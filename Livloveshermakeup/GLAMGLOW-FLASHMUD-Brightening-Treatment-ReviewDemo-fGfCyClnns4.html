am makeup list today because I am doing
a demo and also a review for you guys on
the brand new glam glow flash mud
brightening treatment mask this recently
launched at Sephora on the sephora.com
website and I believe also glam will
have the website where you can pick it
up but basically this launched recently
I'm very excited I love glam glow
products I really believe in the whole
science behind their whole line I really
really really love a lot of their masks
I have the youth mod 1 which is my
favorite I have the little tiny sizes of
this one um personally I like the
smaller sizes if you guys saw my
skincare collection video you would have
known that I have a whole shelf that is
designated just two masks so I don't
have tons and tons of room to be
stacking big sizes like this on
basically that shelf so I like to pick
up these tiny ones that you can get at
Sephora and you do get more you know
product in the bigger one I do recommend
just going ahead and purchasing the big
one because you'll run out of these
quickly but for someone who doesn't have
a lot of room in their skincare
collection is great for me so Sephora
does offer at the youth mod which is a
anti-aging one for the power power mod
gifts which is the dual plans which is
the mud to oil and they also offer the
thirsty mud which is a hydrating
treatment which is for dry skin so you
guys can tell I love the glam glow brand
I would not purchase their things if I
did not it the only mask that I do not
have from them currently is the skinny
clearing one which is also amazing if
you have active break off I highly
highly recommend I'll have to go and
purchase it because they don't have a
smaller size I will have to get a full
size but I'm ok with that because like I
said I believe in the brand and I do
think it is a lot more worth it to get
to see full size anyway like I said I
purchased this only sephora.com website
for $69
all of their masks if you get to see
full-sized are $69 a lot of people say
oh that's so expensive I don't know you
know but I will tell you guys right away
you get
a lot of product in here compared to the
smaller ones let me show you guys as you
guys can see really really liked it of
these products but you get a lot more
product in the bigger one and just it's
really really worth it will last you a
very very long time so anyway um like I
said I love lamb glow I love what they
stand for I think they make a really
really wonderful products they really
came out and we're a hit in the past
couple of years at Sephora and you know
I can see why they have really really
great products so basically they you
know they basically launch this new
brightening treatment mask which is
supposed to be for discoloration it has
multi brightening complexes in it it's
supposed to be great for brightening and
lightening luminous you know skin
basically anything that you could think
of that associated the word brightening
that's what this mask is supposed to
help with so I'm gonna go ahead and put
it on for you guys right now just so
that while I talk about it it can sit on
my skin and then I will remove it with a
washcloth so you guys can see the
difference so basically they say on the
website how to use applied to dry face
in circular motions to pre exfoliate for
improved ingredient absorption
absorption absorption leave on for 20
minutes it says product will turn
semi-transparent and ingredients will
absorb and then it says to wash off with
water I'm not close to sink right now so
we'll wash off with this yes I am in the
basement right now like I said it's kind
of early in the morning people are
sleeping upstairs so sorry if you guys
don't enjoy the beautiful anyway so um
I'm gonna plug it so that while I review
it and talk about it I have used it
three to four times already so while I
talk about it it will be sitting on my
skin
so anyway I'm just going to take a
little bit of that and just start
applying it all over and you want to
apply in circular motions because it
does have exfoliating particles in it I
would say it's very much like a
microdermabrasion it's not like a you
know it's not like there's like beads in
here or anything it's very very finely
milled little exfoliating particles kind
of the same ones that you find in the
youth mud which also have
tiny particles and also the dual plans
to open sausages so anyway I am just
massaging this in circular motions all
over my skin and you guys can see
there's like a little flecks of little
black things in there I believe those
are again like tea leaves or something
like that glam glow does a lot of stuff
like that where they have tea leaves in
their products
they're exfoliating treatment does and I
gots my favorite one so I really really
like that so once you have completely
kind of massage that in give it a little
bit of exfoliating action going on
because when you are looking for
brightening and you know really really
kind of evening out the skin texture you
want to make sure that you don't have
any like dull skin buildup on the face
so you really really want to exfoliate
so they definitely got that one under
control they definitely know what that's
all about
so anyway I have done that and now it's
as suggested usage leave on for 20
minutes product will turn
semi-transparent and ingredients absorb
wash off with water like I said I will
wash it off with a washcloth but let's
just start talking about the product so
like I said the only site that they
currently have is the big size and
that's pretty normal I mean you know
it's a brand new product that just
released I do think it is worth these
$69 I will say right away I love all
glam glow products and this mask is
absolutely no exception it's really
really wonderful I do find that it evens
out my skin tone I do have nayad can't
tell but I do have some
hyperpigmentation that I deal with I
have very very fair skin and I get hyper
pigmentation from breakouts and it takes
a very very long time to heal and what I
notice what this product is that it
really really kind of gives that
luminous effect and kind of evens out
those areas especially on my cheeks
where it just tends to look a little
blotchy and a little more spotty it
really kind of evens everything out and
just makes it look very very lovely I
also noticed that it does get a bit a
bit of it with the luminescent kind of
glow to the skin so it is gonna make the
skin a little lighter if that makes
sense
that's probably just the Lightning
ingredients that it has in it so anyway
um that is you know the little pack that
you've yet and this is the little box
that comes in I love to glam blue boxes
I think they're so cute
this says the glamour flash mode
brightening treatment it does it
brightness it has brighten radiance
luminous evening tone and correct it has
white energy flesh loosened reflect
drone and white birch tea birch leaf tea
stalks so that are those are probably
the little and you know pieces of tea
that you see hanging around on my face
it says men and women for all skin types
and it is paraben free so anyway comes
cute little box and you open it up you
brief you about a little bit about what
I said here hello sexy love using their
masks they always have that on there and
then the actual product fits in that
little compartment right there so
packaging is really really cute I love
that everything is color coordinated
like this one is orange the thirsty mud
is blue the dual cleanse is green and
then Corsi youth like is black and I
believe these soon clearing one is white
so anyway love the packaging think it's
really really cute and it comes with
this little pamphlet on the back you can
see the people who started or the co
founders and CEOs of glam glow and you
can see them right there it is a man and
a woman and I think they did a wonderful
job I love that it's a guy and a girl
because they really found products that
can be used for both men and women they
don't just have products that are only
you know supposed to be for women are
only for men I feel like all of the
products that they have their masks and
also their cleansers can be oriented
towards either sex so I really like that
I mean it's a sexy innovative and fun
are the three magical words spoken in
glam land and the word and the world of
glam glow enjoy your super sexy ass
super radiant skin and stay sexy so
anyway this is a little pamphlet that
comes with this one and it basically
talks about all the things that they
have in this mask that are very special
and great so it says an advanced -
brilliant fusion of powerful natural
active ingredients with naturally a cure
occurring highly-developed complexes
carefully combined to create a potent
energized cluster cluster - bye
color unevenness helping to create
intense bright lighter and even results
so I definitely see that with this mask
like I said I really see that it evens
out the skin you guys won't be able to
tell when I take the mask off but that
is what the white energy does that's the
first little main ingredient that they
happen here
the second little main ingredient they
have in here it's called flash Lucent
which kind of looks like the packaging
flashlight and it says a combination of
natural skin translucency optimizers
form together is a complex to help drive
active ingredients with the use of white
quartz microspheres white to refined
pumice and sun dried white blush they
play all helping to provide women
luminous younger looking skin
so those white quartz microspheres and
white refined pumice are the exfoliating
particles that you feel in here and like
I said it doesn't feel like it's big
exfoliating beads they really feel like
it's microdermabrasion and microbe it
really feels like it's microdermabrasion
which is that a little like pumicing
that you feel you know massaging into
your face really really nice the next
thing they have is oh by the way so the
flash loosens it says it has white
quartz microspheres sugar cane lactic
acid white refined fine pumice willow
bark Stella Stella gasps trade wil over
these salicylic acid so very very good
just for lightening and also if you have
acne prone skin and some dried white
wash a play and the next of all
ingredient they talked about is called
reflect drone it's that little pink one
and it says albedo is the reflective
spectrum brightening on the surface
reflect room is the combination of
powerful natural brightening active
ingredients boosted with ultrafine
optical diamond photo luminescence --is
photo luminescence to help to increase
the individual albedo reflecting level
of the skin causing the skin to appear
lighter brighter and more attractive so
it's got a sexual glucosamine in it
nyam nyam nyam niacinamide i assume my
niacinamide
tetra hexyl deco XOR bait and diamond
photo luminescence
sorry probably watching those words but
those are very very so you take
expounding but not you know like
chemical sounding I don't think
Granville does a lot of the chemical
stuff they really stick to you know more
kind of natural I'm not saying they're
completely natural but they work on
really finding products that are like
scientifically proven if that makes
sense
and then last thing that is down here is
the little white birch leaf and that
does the T tox
it says T t oxide what Archie T oxide
and it does our powerful patent-pending
what virtually stepping steeping process
so they steep the tea sorry you guys I'm
reading so quickly at the steeping
process is the secret behind our
proprietary driven results of tea toxic
process the tea oxide tea oxide okay te
a o x I process real these pieces are
contained in the formula which steep
real natural the betel in bet to linic
acid and ella ella chef acid a logic
acid and they go directly into the mud
treatment to help provide a potent
formula and improved color balance skin
tone so that must be white birch leaf
so anyway love that they have that
little pamphlets you can see exactly
what it is that's in there the main
ingredients and yeah like i said you can
see two little tiny tea pieces and i
really good we love the masks that have
got in here especially the glam glow
ones the youth might as you can see
really gonna love these other guys but
this one also have little tiny bits of
tea leaf in it and this is my favorite
mass that grambo house i would say i
haven't used this about three to four
times now and i will say that i really
really think if you use this once a week
like you know you don't have to have
tons and tons of masks i have a lot of
masks and i like to personally
mask two to three times a week which is
a lot but it's just what i like to do
well mostly two times two week three
times is a lot but i would say if you
are just going to purchase one mask
definitely go and purchase one of the
glam glows find what is associated with
your skin type
like the flash mob would be great if you
have dull skin if you have skin that
just needs some brightening if you're a
little older or if you feel like you
just are somebody who really needs a lot
of exfoliation of course you know the
little pumice exfoliating particles in
here will really help to brighten the
skin and I just think the concept really
really makes sense with that you know
make sense but you know they have a mask
for each skin type I personally have you
know four out of the five of them
because I find that you know my skin
changes sometimes it's really dull which
is great you know just this mask is
great for that sometimes I just want
something really really well that
exfoliates really well and makes my skin
look very fresh and young that's youth
mud one they thirsty cleanse is great if
you have dry skin and the dual cleanse
is great if you're having one of those
days where you just need a little extra
cleansing going on if that makes sense I
really like it if I'm having some active
breakouts I find that I can wash my face
and then put that on and it will help
exfoliate but also once it dries when I
start washing it off it turns into that
dual clans oil you know treatment and I
can really get all the grime off of my
face so really really like that when my
skin's a little congested or even if I
wore a lot of makeup that day that mask
in particular is really really great but
as if I can see you know I've shown all
of these masks now I really really love
them I have hit the bottom absolute I
guess you could call the pan of the
product and really really you know love
these masks I have a lot of mass so that
should say a lot that you know I have
almost gone through little tops of these
and I believe all of the little tough we
have right now I'm on my second doses of
all of them so these are my second
little containers um anyway but back to
this mask back to flash mode you know I
really find that everything that they
you know said you know in the pamphlet
in the boxed everything that they
claimed really really does work with
this mask I have tried a lot of
brightening masks before sometimes they
make me break out
they're just not for my skin type
however this one does have a little bit
of salicylic acid in it which is nice I
have combination skin so I really do
like when there's something in there
that can help open up the pores and
clear out blackheads things like that
and also something that won't make me
break out but anyway I'm gonna read a
little bit about what it says on these
Sephora website just so you guys can get
the whole picture of the whole product
so it's a slam blow flash my bright new
treatment $69 it is what it is it is a
multi targeted multi-sensorial sensorial
like multi you know all your senses are
filled basically how something I forgot
to mention the scent is great I find
that all the sense of lamella products
are great you know like the thirsty mud
one smells like kind of like coconuts
kind of tropical the youth mode one
smells like kind of green tea just
really really fresh smelling and my
favorite scent is the dual cleanse this
smells like Kiwis I'm not sure healthy
skin clearing one snob I can't remember
I only have samples of that one but like
I said I will probably pick up a
full-size of that cuz that is great if
you have breakouts but the set of this
one is very sweet it kind of smells like
um like raspberries I want to say a very
light scent of raspberries really really
good none of these scents are offensive
once you wash them off they all
completely disappear and dissipate off
the skin but really really smells good
definitely like that so I think I think
that you just want to point out this is
starting to kind of absorb into the skin
you can see it doesn't leave this white
thick layer on my skin my skin is
definitely starting to take it in so it
done is very very cool and it is dry now
and you can kind of see you know it
doesn't like flake off but you can still
feel the exfoliating pumice particles
anyway back to reading on the support
website it does it is a multi targeted
multi-sensorial sensorial since really
quick results brightening treatments
radiant youthful looking skin it says
what it is formulated to do powerful and
innovative multi brightening complexes
helped to create the brain
lightest and most Lumis luminous skin
possible the t oxide technology is white
birch leaf which white birch leaf that
delivers natural bitumen a tooling the
acid and ellagic at a logic or ellagic
acid to create an approved color balance
skin tone white energy is a brilliant
fusion of powerful natural active
ingredients to in create to create
intense bright and even results flash
Lucent is a combination of skin skin
translucency acts of optimizers
featuring three levels of exfoliation to
drive ingredients into the skin for a
luminous younger looking complexion so
basically the exfoliating particles
really really open it up that's why they
recommend when you're climbing to apply
a circle circular motions because when
you exfoliate the skin first you're
really letting the product go in and
sink in and then it says reflection is a
blend of brightening ingredients boosted
with diamond photo luminescence to
increase the reflecting level of skin
and make it appear radiant and more
attractive it's designed for instant and
extent of a certain results for men and
women of all ages skin types and skin
tones it is formulated without parabens
sulfates and satellites and it has
studies of consumer studies of 100
individuals they said 93% saw a brighter
complexion luminous complexion boosted
skin radiance and you know just really
really great results so yeah so
basically it says precautions here
there's a little a little paragraph here
that says use three days in a row for
improved results so if you want sorry
I'm getting maps all over my lips now if
you want results that are you know very
very consistent definitely apply this
you know as they recommend and they say
three days in a row for improved results
thereafter use two to three times per
week to maintain results and you must
use a high SPF sunscreen daily to
protect and maintain resolve that's
because you know it has the cell acetic
acid in it which if you guys know acne
treatments can make you very sensitive
tips to the Sun so today I will
definitely put on a sunscreen before I
go out for the day and
it says results will be last during
extended and/or direct unprotected Sun
or Sun bed exposure and it says always
follow directions so you know if you
keep going in the Sun after you use this
product especially if you're doing what
I'm doing and using it in the morning
instead of at night you want to be
really really careful you must use some
protection or you will not maintain the
results that you achieve because
basically you are lightening up your
skin and brightening it with this mask
and if you go back in the Sun it's just
gonna darken things up so yeah so I
already read to you guys all the kind of
ingredients like I said they're not
completely like a hundred percent
natural however I think that they use
products that scientifically work for
the skin you know they've really
scientifically looked at it and I do
believe that there are certain products
that will do more for your skin if they
are you know chemically bound or not
completely natural so I do believe in
that I'm not somebody who goes
completely natural however it is nice to
have natural products also in their you
know in their products they do have
natural products anyway so um yeah so
basically they just talked a little bit
about the brand it says lambo was
originally designed for exclusive
professional backstage use in Hollywood
in 2011 glam glow became available to
consumers and that's really one day you
know shot out and they became so so
popular and I would say they're probably
one of the more popular skincare brands
only Sephora website now so anyway um I
am going to take this mask off like it
says on the directions you really should
wash it off with water because then you
can really really you know move those
exfoliating particles the little pumice
particles and really really exfoliate
the rest of your skin which will help
even more to brighten it but for this
video I'm going to be removing with a
washcloth so let's take it you won't
have to give my skin a second just to
calm down because I have very pale skin
it gets red very quickly so when I waked
things off like that it's going to look
red for a little bit already you can see
last night I didn't wear anything on my
skin because I knew I was gonna use
nothing alright knew I was gonna do this
video for you guys today so I just went
to bed with fair skin and this is the
first product I am putting on it this
morning and after this all I'm going to
need I'm not going to need to cleanse my
skin I am not going to need to you know
use a toner to help like exfoliate or
anything like that this product has
completely taken care of all of that all
I'm going to need to do is put a
moisturizer on and of course an SPF
because it is during the day that I am
wearing this so let's just let my skin
sit for a second to kind of calm down
from the redness from the wiping already
you guys can't see they're like these
areas I just look more awake and it's
very early right now
7:51 in the morning so I just look a lot
more awake everything looks a little
brighter
you can see the redness where I
obviously wiped things off I'm just
prone to getting red skin very easily
but you can see that the marks on my
cheeks look more you know they look like
they're like freckles or something you
know they don't look like acne scars
they're not super dark they look a
little lighter the whole complexion
overall just you know matches my neck a
little better I don't look as ready if
that makes sense the spots just look a
lot better and I feel like even this
area where you know because I brought it
right up here I don't put it you know
around my mouth or around my eyes you
really shouldn't with any of these any
of these masks but I do feel like it
went a little bit right here and that
really kind of helped with dark circles
underneath my eyes which make sense as
they did eight brightening complex but I
just feel like I look a lot more awake
my skin looks a lot better like I'm
ready for the day and it feels very very
smooth because like I said I have those
very very nice like microdermabrasion
small pumice particles in it it feels
very very smooth I'm not gonna need to
you know rewash my face this is
completely cleanse my face and also it's
just you know it feels really really
smooth I'm not gonna be I don't need to
use a toner I'll probably pop a
moisturizer on just because you know
that's how we've good to do but overall
like you know I may not even need a
moisturizer this is really taken care of
it
you know dry layer of skin on the top
you know on the top of the surface of my
skin basically on the top of the dermis
so there's really almost no need for a
moisturizer but anyway that was my
review and my little demo on the new
glam glow flash mode of brightening
treatment masque I hope you guys enjoyed
this I just love the way my skin feels
after using this I love the way my skin
feels after using all of their products
but like I said definitely go check out
the glam blog website if you want more
information on any of their masks also
they have a lot of good information on
Sephora website I will link below you
guys to fit this specific product up if
you are interested and yeah I just think
I look good and ready for the day so
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
