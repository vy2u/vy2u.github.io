thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I am
here to review for you guys the latest
installment treatment or mask that came
out from Glenville so glam blow is based
in Hollywood California and they have
products that released on the
sephora.com website and every time they
come out with a new mask I have to get
it because this is a line that has never
really disappointed me I've never been
truly truly disappointed in one of their
masks I have not tried the little eye
what are they called like I I mutter
something I've heard that those are not
that great I have not tried those but I
have experienced with all of the masks I
went through a full size of the clearing
treatment I have a full size of the
flash mud and then I've gone through the
smaller sizes of the tingle exfoliant
the dual cleanse and the hydrating one
so I have experience with all of them so
when I saw that this released on the
Sephora doggone website I had to get it
the packaging for this one is purple
really really cute actually is kind of
like a bit of a blue undertone and it is
called the glam glow gravity mud firming
treatment so I was wondering you know
what their next mask was going to be
because they already have like the
tingle exfoliant which is kind of like
the anti-aging mask so they had done
like a little teaser on their Instagram
and they were saying it's for anti-aging
like this one was going to be of about
anti-aging and I just thought hmmm it
must be something to do with tightening
because they already have you know that
anti-aging tingle exfoliant one which
has like green tea leaves and things
like that in it so I was right this is a
peel-off mask um did I mention the price
yeah it is $69 at Sephora they do not
have the smaller size of this available
yet they still don't have a smaller size
of the flash mud available either but I
do think it's worth it to get full-size
of this product I really have never been
disappointed and I have been playing
with this mask for a week now and I'm
happy
to say that I absolutely love it so
basically what it looks like let me show
you guys I can open it my goodness whoa
there we go this is what it looks like
it is like a liquidy I smells like
cotton huh oh so good
it is a liquidy white consistency I'm
gonna put a little in the back of my
hand so you guys can see it is literally
like glue almost and what happens is you
put a very thick layer of this on your
skin you can apply it with your fingers
or they do give you a little brush it
looks like a foundation brush like a
just a normal little foundation brush I
really thought this was going to be a
piece of crap but it actually really
applies the product nicely really evenly
and really thick layers so I actually do
like it they recommend after you use it
just wash it with soap I would wash it
with brush cleanser if I were you if you
have any um but anyway this is what it
looks like it is very very sticky and it
comes out like a white consistency like
pearlescent white consistency and you
apply a thick layer of this to your skin
just be aware if you do not use the
brush you are going to have to like
really wash your hands after because it
really is like glue
so when you put it on at first it looks
a little something like this it's just
like that really pretty opalescent white
color just like that and other drives
I'm gonna leave it on my hand so you
know it can dry a little bit and then I
can peel it off for you guys at the end
of the video but as I Drive it turns
silver and you look like somebody like
spray-painted your face over it's the
funniest thing it really really looks
like somebody spray-painted your face
it's really really it's funny it really
really smells good like I said I think
all of the glam glow masks smell really
good in my personal opinion that's a
huge thing for me to I'm huge on sense
so the fact that they you know always
put a lot of effort into making their
products smell good that's really
awesome because not only are they good
quality they also they smell good and
you feel good using them on your face so
I have experience with one tightening
mask I have the Mario Badescu tightening
a temporary lifting mask I'm sorry and
that is around $30 on the
a few website and I use that for special
occasions what I really want to firm
things up if I'm feeling a little like
I'm carrying a lot of water weight in my
face or anything like that I will use
that it is the most uncomfortable mask
ever it dries to the point where you can
if you even like try it and smile or
like purse your lips literally you feel
like your face is cracking off it is so
uncomfortable so I was pleasantly
surprised with this product because I
didn't have any sort of irritation
normally tightening masks or taking
products tend to itch a little bit also
the one from Mario Badescu itches like
crazy all you want to do is just like
get that thing off but the one of the
Mario Badescu one they only recommend
you know wearing it for about five to
ten minutes this one from glam glow you
can wear it for twenty to thirty minutes
you want to make sure that you don't
take it off before it's ready so when it
turns completely silver you then can
peel it off your skin I am happy to let
you guys know that yes for once there is
a mask that actually peels off the face
I've had a lot of experience with
peel-off masks that don't actually peel
off they basically just come off in
little tiny bits and then I have to end
up washing my face at the sink anyway
you do have to do that a little bit with
this product as well but you really can
pull off a majority of it like I pull
from here up and I would say it gets to
my eyebrows without breaking so then I
just have another little strip for my
forehead you want to keep this away from
your hairline and away from your
eyebrows because this will rip the hair
out with it like I said it is literally
the consistency of glue all right let's
see here I want to read on the back for
you guys it says apply a generous even
layer to clean skin with brush avoiding
eyebrows and hairline leave on for 20 to
30 minutes so 20 to 30 minutes I do
notice a slight tingling sensation but
it's nothing irritating or itchy it just
kind of tingles and it actually feels
good it's not a irritating tingle it's a
oh that feels kind of nice sort of
tingle I'm not feeling it on my hand
right now but I do feel it when it is on
my face so let me show you guys the
outer box just because they always do
such cute packaging with that and then
I'm going to read you guys a little bit
about what it says a they write so small
on here like I just can't even
the tiniest little writing but this is
supposed to help firm lift tighten tone
it can see sexy contours and I do notice
I'm one of those people that I if I have
like too much sodium I've turned a lot
of water weight basically especially in
the morning and my face I've used this
mask this morning and I feel like I
don't even contour my face and I feel
like it's just it looks shapely like you
can see my cheekbones it doesn't just
look around and I don't know heart like
their eyes like a heart-shaped face so
it doesn't look too um wide is what I'm
trying to say and I really really do
like it I mean it really does work the
Mario Badescu one also works and it is
cheaper but I mean I'm telling you the
experience of having it on your face is
almost not worth it I mean it really
looks beautiful the end result is
absolutely gorgeous I would say both of
them have I would say very very similar
and results you feel like your skin is
pulled taut so kind of like that it's
not irritating it's not like it's like
oh my god you know but it really does
feel like there's a little bit of maybe
someone like pin something back like a
little bit of skin or something so you
do feel that and I recommend especially
if you have like if you're trying to
help with like aging process and all
that stuff
take it down your neck as well I did
that today and I was surprised to see
that I have like a little I get like a
little sleep wrinkles on my neck and I
know a lot of people get deep wrinkles
on their neck just in general because I
feel like we always neglect that area
but I was surprised to see that it just
when I peeled it off it took all of
those sleep wrinkles with so that was
kind of cool anyway let me read at the
bottom of the box here it has T oxide
complex it has licorice marshmallow leaf
and it helps skin look and feel firmer
it's got a visit it-- which is a plasma
and bio define Paula Myers I can never
you guys when I did the review on the
flash mud mask I literally was
butchering all of these so please just
bear with me if that is supposed to help
provide a tighter feel to the skin and
look to the skin and then there's Luna
real IFFT lunar lift lower lift lunar
lift and
um it has soy isoflavone and red algae
extract it helps keep skin tighter and
more toned your skin looks less
exhausted I totally agree with that I
was up really early this morning and my
face but just bloated and disgusting and
then I put that already enough to
contour my face or anything it just felt
pretty and taut you know that's nice and
then the last thing he has in here is
Kozma flexion which is Icelandic kelp
hyaluronic acid and mineral rich glacial
clay which helps skin feeling younger
and more resilient so that is nice at
the Mario Badescu mask I feel like the
one thing that's missing is like the
hydrating properties because it just
drives like a clay mask times 10 like
it's horrible you guys it's so horrible
and although they do give you very very
similar effects on the skin the Mario
Badescu one is just almost not worth it
like literally you will be itching your
face after five minutes and you have to
keep it on for five to ten minutes so I
actually really do prefer this one over
over that one and this is starting to
peel a little bit I didn't put a really
thick layer on I want you guys to see
when it turns silver like that it is
ready to start peeling off and it might
not do it and you guys are gonna be like
what the hell is with this mask is all
about but you have to put a thick layer
for it to be able to do so there we go
so starting to come off ooh this is not
good it's coming off in tiny little
pieces but you guys it's just not enough
product on your I promise you I promise
you I have tried so many um you know so
many peel-off mask that's supposedly
work and they were all crap but this one
actually really does it doesn't take it
all off like if you pull it doesn't take
like your whole face off but it will
take like three sections and that's
really really not that bad and then when
you do wash your face if you have any
like remainder product remaining
products on your skin and you just
really want to scrub that area because
it is a very very thick texture like I
said it is literally like glue
but anyway smells wonderful I think for
$69 it is worth it for special
occasions I'm 23 years old people might
say why do you need that why do you need
a firming treatment like I said it's my
sodium intake is high or if I'm just I'm
carrying a lot of water weight it's nice
to have something like this because I
can always see it in my face
and I think this is a lovely product for
special occasions it's not something
that you would use on a weekly basis I
guess you could if you have aging skin
and you really want to work with like
firming and tightening that area maybe
your neck your decollete you absolutely
could use this weekly they do say that
you can use it um twice a week so you
absolutely could do that I'm gonna keep
it for special occasions just like the
Mario Badescu one like we said the Mario
Badescu one is cheaper but it is just
not worth it
I have a high pain tolerance and I'm
telling you I just want to lick scrape
my face off when that thing is on there
it is crazy so anyway I highly recommend
this product I'm very happy to say that
I enjoyed this a lot I really have never
been disappointed with a glam glow
product I love their lip products I
guess I really need to try the eye bud
now because I've tried all of their
masks I think they're fantastic and I
look at the fact that they all are
targeted towards like a certain skin
type like hydrating or tea you know
tingle exfoliant is for you know
anti-aging purposes dual cleanse is to
help you know with oily skin but they
always have moisture in there it never
feels you know horrible on the skin it
never feels uncomfortable on the skin
even the other masks I have like tea
leaves in it I've never find it
uncomfortable I'm really really happy to
say I have found a firming treatment
mask that is not uncomfortable and
actually does peel off so I'm just gonna
use that for special occasions
um I don't think I need to use it you
know weekly because I am 23 and I just
don't feel like there's tons of stuff
going on like sagging why than whatnot
but I really did want to try this
product out and I think it is definitely
worth it definitely give it a try if you
are dealing with um I hate this word but
sagging you know sometimes like the jowl
area can start to Sag a little bit or
even the neck area
um I'm gonna have my mom try this out
she's gonna love that for her decollete
and her neck I know she is so um I hope
you guys enjoyed this review thank you
for joining me let me give you guys a
close-up of this little brush I think I
showed it to you but it's really nothing
special but it really really just like
picks up a lot of product and spreads
that baby on there I don't recommend
doing it with your hands because it is
still thick and sticky but anyway I
finally recommend this product I really
really enjoy it and maybe it's not meant
for my skin type but I have all the glam
low-mass or I have at some point and I
like to change them out I find all of
them to be really really awesome and
they're never uncomfortable on the skin
I always have good results and I see an
immediate difference so I think it is
worth the $69 I will link below where
you guys can pick this up if you are
interested not an affiliate link or
anything like that it's just a link to
