thank you so much for joining me I have
reviewed for you guys today on a really
new really exciting product glam glow
recently launched another product you
guys know I like to be on my top game
when it comes to glam glow because yes
they are very expensive but I find that
their products work every single time
for me I haven't had one product from
them you know their masks things like
that that hasn't worked for me so yeah
you know I'm willing to go ahead and
spend the extra you know 20 or 30
dollars for a product that I really
believe in so when I saw that they have
launched this I was so excited it is
actually a lip duo and I thought oh my
god it's perfect
I play flute you guys know I'm very iffy
about my lips they have to be very
moisturized
I love exfoliating them and just all
into that sorry if you guys see me
moving I'm in a little spinny chair but
anyway so uh this launched and it is $39
on the sephora.com website I was so
excited this is what the packaging looks
like and I think it's so cute they went
with the pink color this time they still
haven't you know come out with a pink
product yet they have like what green
orange black and so here's the pink line
super super cute and in here you get the
pout mud fizzy lip exfoliating treatment
and POW mud wet lip balm treatment so
it's duo so you get the exfoliating um
lip scrub which is the first step and
then the second step is the balm so I'm
going to show you guys what it looks
like they come like this they're really
really pretty you know you can put this
like on your counter you can have these
on I don't know like they're they're
nice you know in your bathroom I think
that that's really really cute so um
they're very very pretty like I said and
they look like adidas and I'm gonna have
to open them they look the exact same
okay here's the lip scrub so this is the
first part that you do um and you get a
lot of product in here you guys this is
a lot for a lip scrub you know you don't
go through lip balms and lip scrubs very
quickly so I do think for $39 did I
mention the price day yeah $39 I do
think that it is worth it um and I think
it's relatively well priced for glam
glow you know normally they're way up
there you know past sixty sixty dollars
so anyway so you get a lot of you know a
lot of product in here and this is such
a cool exfoliator for your lips
basically what happens is it like
tingles so basically you take it you put
it over dry lips you massage it in it
has a lot of like prettiness to it it
really really gets the
done and then you start putting water on
and it's like starts like going off like
pop rocks you guys know that candy pop
rocks it starts going like that so it
literally is like tingling and like
exploding on your lips and it feels so
cool so it really really kind of is nice
it kind of wakes me up in the morning
it's got a great texture and you get so
much product in here like I said um it
have a very very strong peppermint smell
to it which i think is even better
because it's just really like refreshing
and great for the morning so absolutely
love that and well I think you guys can
tell now I love both of them I love the
product I'm very very happy and I'm
gonna show you guys the ball now I am
writing it on my lips right now and it
is what's giving me that really really
glossy look to my lips so this is like
the consistency of Vaseline or aqua for
it has like a lot of like a petroleum
feel to it so it's really gonna seal in
moisture um and you know it does stay
kind of on the lips it sticks around for
a while so if you are somebody who is
like oh you know I don't want you know
like a lot of gunk on my lips or
something you may not like this for like
during the day um but basically what
you're supposed to do is just put this
on immediately after using the lip scrub
and you kind of just let it sink in you
know maybe before you do your makeup
before you wash your face in the morning
and the smallest tiniest amount goes
really far this way kind of smells like
peppermint but not really it's not as
strong as the lip scrub I wish it was I
love the smell of peppermint but it's
kind of you know this is a little more
neutral so anyway a lot of product in
there too
what are these these are point 85 ounces
or 25 grams each so that's a lot for lip
products for $39 it's gonna go a long
way so anyway I really really am happy
with these I've had them for about two
weeks now and I'm just like in love I
love it so much
so anyway I'm gonna read for you guys a
little bit about it what it says on the
sephora website so it says the glam glow
pout mod fizzy lip exfoliating treatment
and wet lip balm treatment duo what it
is a powerful duo to gently exfoliate
nourish and treat lips what it is
formulated to do transform your lips
from dull and dry to smooth soft and
sexy with this duo
it says the multi action fizzy lip
exfoliating treatment instantly renews
energizes and smooths the look of lips
it features our exfoliating complex of
Caribbean cane sugar Hawaiian sea salt
and hibiscus flower flower powder I was
gonna say flower power super cute
that's a real ingredient um flour powder
and in further it is further boosted
with an antioxidant rich tropical fruit
blend sweet almond oil
guava cherimoya star fruit lychee and
mangosteen the moisture risk rich wet
lip balm treatment is designed to create
instantly softer hydrated and restored
lips it's formulated with a super
hydration infusion of sweet almond oil
cocoa butter murumuru butter shea butter
tamaño oil and basu oil and enhanced
with kombucha extract both lip
essentials contain teat oxide tea oxide
macron Moroccan mint leaf for sweet
minty kissable lips wow that was quite a
mouthful lots of little oils there that
I cannot now anyway so yeah so you know
0.8 e 8 ounces of each is a lot for lip
you know treatments so for $39 you guys
should get on this if you are if you
bought your lips if you have dry lips if
you're a flute player like me you know
you just you guys really should check it
out it's awesome so it says what else
seem to know a tip is a fizzy lip
exfoliant is perfect to prep your pout
for lip color to ensure even smooth
coverage every time wet lip balm
treatment does not contain petroleum
interesting because I just told you but
it feels like petroleum but it doesn't
contain petroleum so you know a lot of
people are pro petroleum a lot of people
are like no no so I I do use petroleum I
don't find that it really like
moisturizes super well but it does lock
in moisturizer it does like lock in
moisture um but anyway so yeah that is
free of Port William so that's pretty
cool so anyway I think you guys things
how I absolutely love this products I
think it's awesome you get a lot of bang
for your buck Glen glow it's not steered
me wrong and I think that this is a
great addition to their line in general
