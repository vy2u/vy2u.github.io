channel today we are going to battles
rust or highlighters next to high-end
highlighters now I did recently pick up
all of the new Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting that powders and all the
different shades and I want to go ahead
and swatch them next to some of their
limited edition counterparts aka limited
edition at my ass sort of products that
went well released as well as watch them
next to some high-end highlighter so
let's start with this shade right here
which is called blossom glow this is one
of the newer shades these do retail for
$4.99 and all of them are permanent if
you are curious this is a really nice
kind of light soft peak shade with a
little bit of like a white undertone and
when I swatch it next to the Dior
highlight right here I notice a lot of
similarities so this is the Dior skin
nude air flowing garden powder
illuminator indie shade of glowing pink
this was a limited edition shade but
they now do have something that's very
very similar in color that is kerbin
entities are $56 versus $4.99 I will see
when I put my finger in here I feel like
this is a little bit of a smoother
consistency and texture the wet and wild
is a little more on the chunky side but
they are so similar as far as color is
concerned they definitely have like that
white base going on there they're very
pigmented and they both did you have a
big Chalet formula so up here we have
the $4.99 cruelty free wet and wild and
down here we have the $56 your highlight
alright let's go ahead and move on it to
a beautiful purple shade so you guys
know royal calyx is kind of like the
purple highlighter that they just
released this is what it looks like so
this is the Quentin wild medic low is
dominating powder in royal calyx I think
that's how you say it it's a beautiful
kind of lavender shade and immediately
when I swatch this I was like oh my god
I have to swatch this next to purple
horseshoe from the moon child glow kit
and I have to say they are very very
similar so here is the wet'n wild Royal
Oak Alex now you also want to go ahead
and swatch it next to the wet and wild
limited edition a lilac to reality a
mega glow highlighter because I feel
like they are similar I wouldn't
necessarily say it's repackaged but
definitely very very similar what is
going on with my hair definitely very
very similar so anyway let me go ahead
and swatch this one so there they are
next to each other I have to say the new
one is definitely a lot more pigmented
this one's a little more on the chunky
side this one is still pretty chunky
compared to the other ones that they
released in the new collection but at
the same time this one is still worse so
if you missed out on the hearts one and
you're like oh
I'm so sad I missed out on it don't
worry you're really not missing out on
that much if you just go ahead and get a
new one all right as far as the auto
selfie of Beverly Hills moon child glow
kit is concerned purple horseshoe is a
really really beautiful kind of purply
highlight it does have glitter infused
in it and I feel like these are going to
be very similar so let's go ahead and
swatch them out oh yeah they're pretty
darn similar I want to see that they're
in exactly but they're definitely
similar so here we have me wet and wild
royal calyx here is my lecture reality
and here is purple horseshoe super super
similar if you're looking for a nice a
Big Show's a sort of gorgeous lilac
highlighter I would definitely go and
take that one up from wet and wild I
just can't talk about these enough you
guys they're just such good highlighters
all right let's go ahead and move on at
to a shade that a lot of people are
talking about this is the golden flower
crown from the wet and wild
visible highlighting powder collection
so this one is like a nice kind of soft
gold color I really really enjoyed what
it does for my cheeks honestly it's
pretty blinding like when you have it on
but it really is beautiful so here is
the shade golden flower crown hopefully
you guys can see it with these lights
again I feel like it's a very blinding
highlight so hopefully you can see it
now I do think it's pretty similar to
the Oprah Rodeo Drive highlighter not as
far as formula is concerned but
definitely when it comes to color so the
Oprah I think has a little more golden
tone to it yeah a little more golden
tones that they are pretty similar so
here is the wet and wild and here is the
Oprah and then also I wanted to go ahead
and swatch it next to this guide
assisting the rock illuminating
highlighter in the shaded Twilight and
this one has a little bit of like a
grayish sort of undertone but I also
feel like the flower crown one does as
well so I just thought I would go ahead
and swatch so they look similar not
identical and the bottom two are true
powder
formulas and then obviously the one wild
is a facial a would highly recommend
officially over these see you guys
everything like golf is when I'm like oh
my god these are not even looking so
good to be any more so yeah there is the
wet while too there is the Oprah and
here is the lorac alright now let's go
ahead and talk about the shade a crown
of my canopy I cannot find anything in
my collection that I feel like is like a
spot on do for this or super super
similar but I wanted to swatch it out
next to a few popular highlighters so
here is crown as my canopy which is a
beautiful kind of coppery color it would
be amazing on for those of you who do
have a deep complexion so anyway here is
what
looks like a swatc beautiful-- a big
chalet goodness now I wanted to go ahead
and swatch it next to the subject to
glow kiss v-shaped bronze from the sun
kissed glow kid from Anastacio Beverly
Hills this one's a lot more cool toned
then the wet and wild but just so you
can have some color reference so there
is the wet and wild here is the honest
sake of Beverly Hills and then finally I
thought I would also swatch it next to
blushed copper from Becca so here is
just a little Jacqueline Hill palette
from two years ago it has pearl
champagne pop and blush copper in it and
blush copper is I think deeper than both
of these it's a really really red tone
but I wanted to give you guys some
reference I'm sorry I don't have
anything that's like a spot on goop or
super super similar but there they are
so here is Becca's blush copper here is
the bronze shade from the Sun just glow
kit from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
then here is crown of my canopy from wet
and wild so really really beautiful I
think that those are gorgeous all three
of those are gorgeous if you do have a
deeper complexion now let's go ahead and
swatch two that are kind of like
repackaged if that makes sense so this
guy right here is the new and Becca glow
highlighting powder in botanic dream
this is like a kind of deeper pink shade
now a lot of people are saying that the
sweet is bling a limited edition her
highlight is the same as this one and I
think they are pretty similar but I
wouldn't say they're identical so let me
go ahead and swatch botanic dream for
you guys so that is what botanic dream
looks like this one definitely has that
really pretty like I see lilac kind of
tone running through it as well which I
really like and then right here we have
the sweetest bling the sweetest wing is
probably maybe a little more so like the
was it the other lighter pink shade but
these ones are pretty close so here is
botanic dream and then here is the
sweetest bling you can still get these
little whore highlighters I know they're
a limited edition but I've seen them at
my Walgreens here in the Arizona area so
I know you could probably still find
them but I still want to share with you
guys and then finally I want to go ahead
and floor fit these guys the next to
each other so we have the Wet n Wild
mega glow highlighting powder and
precious petals which is one of my
favorites although it is kind of dark
it's a perfect color for me currently
this is very similar to another into
your highlight so this guy is for a 99
it's a beautiful kind of rose gold shade
as you guys can see this reminds me a
lot of VD or let's see here
you dare Luminizer in 0:01 new dare so
this is what new dare looks like again
has that nice
soft gold color to it but a little bit
of like a rose gold undertone and I just
feel like these are really similar again
the Dior does feel a little silkier to
me not going to lie to you guys but I
feel like the wet wild is even more
pigmented and they do have the same
formula as well as a similar color so
there is the wet and wild and their if
they do your so yeah anyway guys those
are just those new wet and wild
highlighters washed out next to some
high-end counterpoints counterpoints
counterparts counterparts does that make
sense I hope you guys enjoyed the video
let me know if you want me to do more
I'll be slowed down showdowns and I will
see you guys tomorrow hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
