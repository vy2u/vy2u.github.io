my channel today I wanted to share with
you guys some really really great
products and some very very unfortunate
packaging so let's go ahead and start
with some high-end makeup the first item
I have here is from pur cosmetics now
I'm a little salty when it comes to pur
cosmetics they recently kicked me off
their PR list for I feel like no good
reason now I know a lot of people are
like you're very harsh on products
that's why they kicked you off but I
don't feel like brands should be kicking
you off just because he gave a bad
review of a product it does not make
sense to me so anyway this is actually a
product what I do like from pure
cosmetics this is called the mineral
glow a bronzing a powder now as you guys
can see it may turn a little orange on
camera I'm not quite sure how the color
is picking up but when I have it swatch
right here this is beautiful under eye
and also normal skin it has a little bit
of a sheen to it and it's not to oranjee
you know it has that nice mixture of
like a terracotta sort of reddish color
with a little bit of like that deeper
brown color so I really do like this I
also love the longevity on this I feel
like this lasts really really long for a
bronzer so I think it's a fantastic
product unfortunately the packaging is
so incredibly cheap I believe this is a
15 to 18 dollar bronzer and I just feel
like they could have done so much better
so right here you obviously don't get a
little mirror it's just this really
cheap sort of plastic packaging and it
feels light as air like compared to my
$3 and 99 cents essence all about Matt
fixing compacts powder which I'll be
talking about in a minute if this feels
like half the weight it just doesn't
feel special it doesn't feel like a $15
bronzing powder although it is a really
great product just looking at the
packaging makes me not want to use it as
much in my collection because it's
really just kind of unflattering alright
up next guys we do have the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills glow kids I feel like I
have to mention these because every
single time I do a review on the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills glow kits I complain
about the packaging now I can understand
with the four pan palettes what they
were doing here I understand why there's
not a mirror I understand why it's in
cheap cardboard packaging because as you
can see there is a little intense here
where you can actually pop out the pan
so here is the shades summer you
literally can just dip your finger in
there and voila you have your little pan
right here so you can interchange these
palettes you can kind of create your own
little glow kit if you want but what I
don't understand
is why these six p-m palates have the
same packaging and they do not have that
little insert here but you can actually
pop the pants out and these are a little
harder to do pot in my opinion I have
deep potted one of these before and then
I popped it back in the pan because I
wasn't going very well this is my mood
child glow kit I don't understand why
there's not a mirror I don't understand
why it's in this cheap-ass cardboard
packaging I would like to see them do a
little more I understand that this is a
$40 palette and that is a great awesome
deal because you get a lot of product in
here but I just feel like for Anastacio
Beverly Hills this is a little cheap and
a little flimsy and I'm not really into
it
alright guys up next I do have two
skincare products here they are both in
tub form now I used to not be a fan of
you know products like this at all like
I would not purchase products where I
had to dig my hand in because it grossed
me out and honestly I'm still kind of
like that I'm opening up a little more
like I understand some products are
better in tub form but these guys are
not in my opinion so the first one is
the ocean salt face and body scrub from
lush now this has quickly become my
favorite cruelty free face scrub as you
guys can see it's really really nice it
has a really large granule so maybe
that's why they don't want to put it
into a squeezy bottle but basically it
has the scent of like a margarita you
have a little bit of alcohol in here
which is good for kind of clearing out
the pores if you are a little more oily
or problematic skinned it's really
really nice for just as slopping off
that dead skin on top and I really like
this I feel like this is a very very
good scrub that I would highly recommend
to you guys you have to be very careful
that you don't get micro tears when you
use this because the granules are so big
so you want to really lightly massage it
onto your face when your skin is
completely wet in my opinion and you
only want to use it about once a week
but I hate digging my fingers in here
this is insanely insanely expensive for
this tiny little 4.2 ounce tub and I
feel like I lose a lot of product
because when I go in I've heard generous
and I just kind of scoop up a lot a lot
of it starts to fall off my face it just
washes right down the drain so I really
wish that they would put this into like
a squeezy bottle I think that would be
awesome and then here we have these
Cetaphil moisturizing cream now I know
this is not cruelty free but this is one
of the only products that works for me
when I'm gonna loop is Flair I have not
repurchase time since I went cruelty
free if you guys are curious I don't
think I'll ever have to you because
there
such a large amount of product in here
as you can see so you do get a whopping
amount of 16 ounces of product in here
or 453 grams it's a great product it is
a sensitive like really nice / sensitive
skin it doesn't have any fragrance to it
it's really really beautiful but again I
feel like they could have put this into
a squeezy bottle and it would be so much
easier you don't feel like you're
getting bacteria everywhere and digging
your grubby little fingers in there so
yeah that is definitely a product that I
feel like it's very very good but has
some crappy packaging all right guys up
next we do have the essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder now I have to
say I understand with drugstore what
they're doing with their packaging
because obviously they want to keep
their prices low but this happens to me
practically every single month with at
least one of these the lid a breaks off
on my essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder now I've been really
lucky I don't find that these shatter
super easily but every single month I
have one of them that just rips right
off the lid I mean it's super super
cheap packaging I would love if they
could pop a mirror in here again I
understand that maybe they don't want to
do that because this is so cheap but
this is literally only 399 but it's just
something that does kind of bothered me
I don't like having just the pan sitting
there open to the air so that's
definitely something that I have to
complain about just a little bit even
though you know that is one of my holy
grail setting powders and then finally I
have to talk about wet and wild so there
are a lot of products from wet n wild
that I feel like could be packaged a lot
better and this is definitely one of
them I have gone through three of these
because unfortunately these shatter all
the time and this is the wet and wild
comfort zone palette so beautiful
beautiful packaging you guys these are
awesome drugstore eyeshadows so we're
super beautiful very pigmented very long
wearing I love everything about them but
I will say this packaging just shatter
it's like it breaks like I've had one of
these where the top literally just
crushed in I have had two of these break
when I was traveling I'm one of them
broke in my purse it shattered all over
the place and basically I've had to
purchase probably four of these so now
if you know this is now technically like
a $20 pallet for me not so much $4.99
any bar although it's really great
quality I really wish that they could go
ahead and pop a mirror in here and I
wish that they would just make it a
little more sturdy maybe not a mirror
but a little more sturdy that would be
really really nice so anyway guys those
are some
the excellent products and some not so
great packaging let me know what your
thoughts are down below if you like this
video let me know if you would like a
round two for this video and yeah that's
pretty much it I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
