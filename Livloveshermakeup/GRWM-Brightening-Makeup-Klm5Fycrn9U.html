today I'm doing a get ready with me
video my first one so I'm very excited I
think today for makeup I'm probably just
gonna do pretty simple and light on the
face and then maybe something a little
brightening for the eyes like a white
eyeliner because I am tired I did not
get a lot of sleep so yeah anyway let's
get started so the first thing I'm gonna
do is apply my foundation I'm going to
use today is the L'Oreal visible lift
blur foundation it's really not like
this I'm kind of liking it it depends on
how my skin is for the day so um yeah
the color I'm in is 201 light ivory by
the way so I'm going to grab my
foundation brush just gonna use the Real
Techniques
um I already applied my boys chose their
serum and primer just you guys know my
remember - and then take this and blend
it in
have you seen you look over here is
because my mirror is here
get a baby wipe out keep the hand please
and I like to just wipe the excess
foundation off my lips okay so next I'm
going to apply concealer today I'm going
to go with and I think I like the
concealer more than this foundation
foundation just doesn't have a lot of
coverage but that's kind of what I'm
looking for today not a lot of coverage
so anyway this is the visible lift blur
concealer I love this wonderful stuff so
I'm in the shade 3:01 fair I'm just
gonna take some of this lot comes out so
be careful
I'm not gonna blend it in yet just gonna
cover wherever I need to on my face
we're here for this
okay once I kind of Pat that on I'm
gonna go ahead and grab my unique lender
which is a journey I woke up late today
did not clean it don't yell at me these
things happen sometimes it's gotta get
to school so right here it's not even
damp but it still works so tap that in
she looks like you that I'm going to
take kind of little pointy brush here
and I just like to blend into my
hairline
so
that's oh I'm going to grab my powder
this is the elf tone correcting powder
take my google tools big kabuki brush I
don't like to swipe it because then
you're just moving the foundation and
the concealer just Pat it on just easy
to do when you have a nice big okie
brush like this
you want something pretty dense
oh I just get all up for my book room
alright happy then I'm gonna go in again
with my wife and just wipe my lips so
next I going to take my Milani Luminoso
blush I need a little pick-me-up to take
my skin I did not sleep very well so I
think this will be good for me to use
today I'm just gonna take my ELF
complexion brush it's just super fast
and this is nice because it's like a two
and one it has highlighter but it has
that blush color too
so you don't have to highlighter on if
you're in a hurry so again right next to
eyelashes get a little closer here we
usually just count towel 20 18 19 20
lashes curled and next I am going to be
taking with my face next I'm going to be
taking my Laura Geller what is this I
care about her proof eyeliner eye
brightener so it's kind of like this
banana II whitish color I'm gonna take
that and just go inside my waterline and
my lash line
can instantly see the difference it
helps me to look a little more awake I'm
going to go ahead and grab my it
cosmetics naturally pretty palette my
eyes today so I'm gonna go ahead and
take sheer joy which is that first color
on the top just gonna tap that on it's
really easy to pack it on with the
finger I'm gonna go right here in
between so I can kind of highlight and
brighten that area like I need a lot of
brightening today
I'm gonna go ahead and take my Sigma e35
it's where I know if you can't see it
a35 brush and go into soulful which is
that color right there really beautiful
and work that into my crease
let this calm
Hey bending is the c-40b 40 and just let
that out
I'm gonna take sheer joy that light
color again place it under my brow I'm
gonna take just a kind of skinny little
brush something like this really
anything if it's just small and precise
and takes soulful again and put that
under my lower lash line
so I'm gonna take my tools little fluffy
brush like this and just make sure
there's no excess like that away and so
after that my thing I'm gonna go ahead
and just comb on my brows I'm not gonna
fill them in today too tired for that
too much effort so let me grab
my jordana best vol extreme volumizing
mascara today
hey that really means I'm open up in top
take my Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray just spray that you're just gonna
go back to my Sigma brush the either
side and just go over the crease to make
sure if we have any mascara fall out it
just kind of blends it right off 40 take
that lighter color in my palette again
the sheer joy and run that underneath my
eye pick up any loose and brighten
as much brightening so I can get and
then I'm going to take let's see here I
want something light on my lips so I
think I'm gonna do a baby lips I'm going
to Rose rush this one like a my lips put
that new color for me okay I get that
makeup laughs if you're not some legend
everything and so this is just kind of
natural on the face a little heavier on
the eyes then it's not heavy on the eyes
that's just more like dolled up you know
just more brightening and not quite sure
what I'm going to do with my hair yet I
might just throw it up into a bun I am
Not sure yeah we'll see but anyway this
is the look I hope you guys enjoyed it
