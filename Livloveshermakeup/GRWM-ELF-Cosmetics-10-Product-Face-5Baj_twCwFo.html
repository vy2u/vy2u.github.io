their faith because I am doing a get
ready with me video for you guys I
already kind of started filming it I
only got my primers on you can see I
have the foundation on the back of my
hands and then I realized that the SD
card was full so I'm starting over I
really didn't get that far into it
probably like three minutes but anyway I
am doing a full face of just elf
cosmetics for you guys today
unfortunately not all the brushes I'm
using are from elf cosmetics however all
the products that are going on my face
are and somebody requested this video
and I thought it was a great idea I love
elf cosmetics and I definitely have
enough products from them to like to
fill up my entire face or to cover my
entire face so anyway I just want to
clarify something really really quickly
on my channel and you guys are well
aware that I'm not a makeup artist or
anything like that I just want to let
you guys know when I'm doing get ready
with me videos they are very very casual
and I don't know where I'm going with
the look so anytime you see it get ready
from get ready with me video it is
literally me just getting ready with you
guys on camera I don't know where I'm
going with the look I picked the
products out but I don't really have an
idea of what I want to do whereas a
tutorial on my channel is usually a look
that I have worn before it's a look that
I've created so I just wanted to let you
guys know that right away in case you're
like wow this video is really chatty and
different it's because it's a get ready
with me video I'm no idea where I'm
going with this book but anyway I have
already primed my face because like I
said I started filming this and what I
used was the elf hydrating face primer I
really like this a lot it has like very
silicone e properties to it it feels
very silicone like and it really just
glides on the face super super nicely
and then I also put on my eyelid primer
this is from ELF obviously and this is
just the eyelid primer in sheer the
little name on the side already wore off
because I use this all the time it is
one of my favorite eye primer so the
next thing I'm doing is putting on my
foundation I am using my ELF flawless
finish foundation with SPF 15 sunscreen
my shade is porcelain I absolutely love
this bottle like elf yes like this is a
glass bottle it's so pretty and I
already put about I would say two pumps
of the
on the back of my hand so I'm gonna go
in with my Real Techniques damp sponge
I'm gonna dab that into the back of my
hand and I'm going to apply this all
over my face this porcelain shade is the
lightest one and it honestly is a tad
dark it's like a pad yellow on my skin
but I don't mind it because I am using
the elf tone correcting powder and cool
to color correct it after that's what
I'm using to set my makeup with so I
really do like this foundation a lot it
has a really really good decent coverage
and I feel like um one to two pumps
really makes your skin look nice
actually now that I'm thinking about it
I probably only used one time so I'm
gonna put a little more on the back of
my hand the little pump thing is not
really working right now so I've been
kind of taking it out like this and
putting on the back of my hand who else
I always had issues with pumps literally
I think every video that I film like a
tutorial or you can find it with me with
I'm like alright let's open the
foundation up instead of pumping it out
but anyway you guys can really see how
well this covers I have combination skin
and I get like acne scarring on my
cheeks because I have very hormonal acne
and I feel like this covers it so so
nicely alright yeah that's definitely
enough now so I'm just blending that all
over and like I said this has a really
really nice coverage honestly I don't
think it looks too heavy but I also
don't think it looks exactly like skin
if that makes sense it just kind of has
like a medium to buildable coverage you
could definitely put a few layers of
this on and it builds beautifully
without getting cakey but it also can
build into definitely a full coverage
product so I felt good with that much
coverage I think that looks nice so I'm
going to go ahead and put on my
concealer now the one I'm using is the
maximum coverage concealer in the shade
porcelain again this is a little yellow
toned on my skin but it's not horrible
and super super noticeable so
taking a little bit of that there's like
almost nothing left in this tube I used
to use this every single day I'm gonna
put that on my under eye area kind of
like in a v-shape it has a really really
nice creamy blendable texture and I'm
just going on my eyelids as well just to
do some kind of brightening in that area
I'm not gonna fuss around and try and
cover every little dot on my face today
I'm just not in the mood so then I'm
gonna take the blending sponge again and
take like the sharper side or like the
pointy side and I'm just going to go
ahead and stipple that product into the
skin or bounce it beat it I'm calling
eat my face I never got that thing I
never got when people were like I'm
gonna beat my face I'm like boy you're
gonna do what I'm sorry wait but anyway
I'm just making sure that that is
completely blended in and again you
could go in and like cover up dots and
things like that this is a really nice
concealer that really does have good
coverage but like I said I'm just not
really in the mood today it's very early
in the morning and I just don't feel
like I need a super full coverage look
today all right let's move on we're
gonna go ahead and set that powder in I
do have combination skin so I definitely
want it to be set I'm using the elf tone
correcting powder and cool this is a
Holy Grail product for me it is my
all-time favorite setting powder out of
every single brand so I'm gonna be
taking up my it cosmetics Buki buffing
and I'm just going to go squirrel it
into that products you really want to
pick up all four of the colors you can
see they have a yellow shade of green a
blue and a pink and I like to pick up
all up and then I just stipple this onto
my face and you guys will be able to see
it does have those like color correcting
properties to it so it is going to
lighten up that foundation a little bit
they also have one in warm however I am
cool undertoned so I never really tried
the warm one but maybe you should they
should try it out because this has just
like the best like finish it is so
finely milled and beautiful on the skin
like I
really really love the way this looks
with any foundation not just this one so
I'm just blending that in bring it down
my neck into my hairline I always get
like that little line around the
hairline it's right mean-ass I'm like
why does that always happen to me kind
of stippling it on I don't know what
that little red mark there is not cute
not cute girls neck you all right and
next I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna
bronze my face up a little bit I am
going to be taking of this little brush
right here oh wait I didn't take the yep
this brush this is a blush brush
it's from up and up and I am going to
apply my bronzer and my Bluffs with this
this is what it looks like it's stained
down there I swear I cleaned it and I'm
using the elf bronzer palette in bronze
beauty this has four different colors
and I'm going into that kind of shimmery
sparkly shade right there I'm just gonna
put it on my brush and tap off the
excess and I'm actually just gonna be
going on to the apples of my cheeks to
give some like warmth to my face I'm not
going to be contouring or bronzing so
it's almost like a starter blush which
is why I'm using a blush brush it's just
gonna give like some nice warmth to the
skin I think it's really really pretty
okay it's not like this beautiful kind
of golden glow to it can you guys see
that I hope you can see it I can makeup
skin up my hair yep
I hate that I tried doing this like
video without having to wear a headband
but I don't know how girls on YouTube do
it I've said it before and I'll say
again I just don't know how they do it
without a headband and right now I can
already see there's powder in my hair
and it's driving my crazy
but anyway you guys can see that bronzer
is really beautiful it just gives a
little bit of warmth to my skin I could
I would use a little bit extra like
warmth alright next I'm going into the
elf of blush palette this is in dark
again it's the same sort of format these
palettes that they've come out with
lately are amazing and I am going to be
taking a matte shade or right there with
the same brush just gonna flip it on to
the other side and I'm putting that
right onto the apples of my cheeks this
palette is so beautiful and pigmented
don't worry I will um
blend it into my skin a little better in
a second but it is so pigmented it to be
really careful if you are fair skinned
like I am and you're using the dark one
they have a light one as well just be
really careful because they have a lot
of light reddish kind of undertones and
it really can look like too much so I am
going back into my Buki buffing which I
use to set my powder and I'm just
stippling over that kind of making sure
that there are no harsh lines and then
it doesn't look like someone just like
put a frying pan on my face it's like
burn so I'm just going over that
just like that and now I'm going to go
into the third pallet so this is the elf
illuminating pilot another really
fantastic one from elf it's kind of like
the ambient lighting powders from
hourglass so if you want something
comparable these are great I'm going to
be taking that lightest shade or right
there and I'm going to be using my ELF
blending brush which looks like this
it's a very like dense sort of fan brush
and I'm going to dip into that product
and I'm going to highlight my face so
I'm gonna go on my chin down the bridge
of my nose a little bit up kind of like
just highlighting that area between my
brows a little bit on my Cupid's bow and
then I'm gonna take it from the apple of
my cheek right here all the way up
and what I love about this brush is that
it kind of like because it is so densely
packed it gets the color on there
immediately you don't really have to
build it up which is why I recommended
doing back and forth motions just
because you want to make sure it's not
sitting on top of the skin you really
want to blend it in so that is a
fantastic little talent as well and now
we are gonna go ahead and get into the
eyes um I don't know what I'm gonna do
yet else I always get foundation on
their lips I cannot be the only one I
know most people probably just like
edited out of their videos but you guys
know you don't edit so I'm seeing you
mm-hmm get-get foundation out girl
alright we're gonna go into the elf
prism palette I have all three of these
they are fantastic and I just took this
one out this is my favorite this one is
called sunset it's got some gorgeous
kind of rosy toned colors in there as
you guys can see and I don't know what
to do I guess I'm going to go ahead and
take that pink shade first and I'm just
going to tap that onto my lid with a my
middle finger sorry nice I'm not
flicking you off just gonna tap that on
to my lid like so do it on the other
side as well
I'm going to go into that lightest shade
the whites and take that with my index
finger and go on the inner corner of my
eyes and just kind of tap that and blend
it into the first half of my eye area
like that just so real it brightens that
eye area and then I'm going to go ahead
and take a what's easy
Dilys the morphe and be livid i marthy
I'm a 513 brush it's really nice and I'm
going to put some color in that crease
so I'm going to take that one right
there kind of coppery dopey shade I
guess I'm gonna go in there definitely
tap off the excess because these do have
a little bit of Fallout and a little bit
of kick up now going back and forth in
my crease I like this because it's nice
and dense and it really deposits color
in nicely so I'm going back and forth
back and forth sorry if you guys see my
mirror I really want to get like a
mirror right there but that's where the
window is so I guess when I film get
ready with me or tutorials I'm going to
have to film them that way where I have
like the mirror actually sit and get
ready in the morning so I'm doing that
on the other side as well you can do a
little bit of circular motions
looks like sunset - oh geez
and then I'm going to go in to my Sigma
tapered blending e-40 brush and I'm just
going to blend that out and this time I
am going to use circular motions
just like that and Nan let me go and see
I did get too much fallout interesting
all right then I'm gonna go in with my
ELF professional eye crease brush I
don't know how you would ever use this
in your crease it's still tiny but I'm
gonna go into that deep purple shade
yeah ass girl I'm gonna go in there tap
off the excess and bring that on my
lower lash line because I think that
would be really pretty I'm just kind of
going back and forth packing some color
on there to smoke out that lower lash
line do it on the other side
I'm not getting a lot of fallout today
it's kind of interesting because I
usually get a lot of fallout with this
pallet I'm 90 days and then I'm gonna go
back to that Sigma e-40 and I'm just
gonna take that underneath and blend a
little bit so we don't have any harsh
lines we want it to look really really
nice and synchronize our not like whoops
sorry I just put a harsh line right
underneath there just going a little
back and forth some small circular
motions left that purple shade making
sure everything looks a uniform and then
I'm gonna go back into that really light
shade again check that all over my lid I
just want some biome sort of color right
on there so that when I look down you
see some shimmer feeling some shimmer
right I really like to apply like my lid
color with my finger I don't know why
everybody always ask me like why don't
you just use a flat brush I'm like I
have so many of them I just don't like
it I don't know I feel like my middle
finger really just passed right color
hunter and deposit but I don't know guys
I don't know I like it all right and
next I am going to go ahead and wait let
me check for Fallout cuz I'm suspicious
Wow really no follow I don't know what's
going on today alright next I'm going to
put my mascara on I don't know where my
lash curler is but this will show you
guys how nice it is actually really
holds it curl really nicely this is the
volumizing and defining mascara in the
shade a jet-black it looks like this and
I really can get away with using this
mascara without having to curl my lashes
which is great it's a nice rubber
bristle brush and um show you guys what
it can do I'm just gonna put one coat on
I'm not gonna go too crazy today those
two lashes you guys are probably like
what you not too crazy with the lashes I
love me some clumpy lashes but today I'm
not feeling it it could be the fact that
it's 6 a.m. could be the fact that I
don't know I'm just not really
all right so you guys can see it really
does kind of nicely pick up i smudged it
kind of nicely shoots the I've up
towards your brow instead of like
pushing your eyelashes down or my
personally just sticks straight out like
they just don't hold a curl naturally so
it's kind of knowing it anyway that is
one coat of the mascara and I'm not
gonna do anything with my lips today I
actually have to be plain this morning
right at 8 o'clock I have a little bit
of a performance it's not really a
performance is just through where I
teach so I need to not coat them right
now especially because they are a little
dry but if I were going to I probably
use one of the matte lip pencils from
ELF they are fantastic and I really
really like them a lot alright guys so
that it's my little get ready with me I
didn't do my brows or anything I'm
feeling a little more natural today I'm
not wanting to go super hardcore
full-blown like you know glam glam glam
but this was really really easy to
recreate I could probably do it in ten
minutes if I wasn't sitting here and
talking on camera but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed in this video thank you so
much for getting ready with me and I'll
see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
