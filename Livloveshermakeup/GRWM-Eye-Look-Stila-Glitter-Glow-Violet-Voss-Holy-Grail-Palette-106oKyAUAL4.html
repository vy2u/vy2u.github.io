channel today's video is going to be my
look that I was wearing actually last
week now I already have all my base
products on you can go ahead and follow
me on snapchat I'll link my snapchat
usernames down below if you would like
to see how I put the rest of my face on
and I will link down below in the
description bar all of these products I
have on but today we are just doing it
get ready with me I look and the island
was super requested from last week I did
a lot of different variations but the
main focus was to wear one of these feel
like glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows
on my eyelid and then also I was working
with the viola boss Holy Grail palette
to kind of do a darker crease I did a
little bit of like an orange grace one
day and then I also did a darker crease
with the shade brownie points-- I think
today will just kind of mix those
together but yeah the main focus is to
use one of these feel like glitter and
glow liquid eyeshadows we're going to
use the duochrome formula because these
are definitely harder to work with and a
lot of you were curious as to how I use
mine so yeah let's go ahead and jump
right into it we're going to start with
some eyeliner so I'm going to take my it
cosmetics no tub waterproof anti-aging
gel eyeliner in the shade of black and I
am just going to go ahead and put this
on to my waterline now I was wearing
this all last week and honestly it was
like it was like staining the shit out
of my eyes every single day by the way
if you're wondering yes my foundation
kind of came up over here because I have
really watery eyelids today or just eyes
eyelids I've really watery eyes today I
have no idea why so I'm just going ahead
and putting that onto the waterline so
we can get a little bit of definition
this is definitely one of those
eyeliners that is going to stay put and
you are going to have like a
reminiscence of like products underneath
your eye the next day but it's worth it
because they're good and then quickly
I'm just going to go ahead and curl my
eyelashes now I'm taking my revlon lash
curler and I'm doing about five pumps on
each side just realized I missed a spot
in my brow that's okay I was trying to
do it on snapchat sometimes it's really
hard to film like little tutorials on
snapchat like one-handed but yeah
alright so I curled my eyelashes now
we're going to go ahead and jump into
the viola Voss holy grail palette so
this is what it looks like if you guys
can see super super beautiful palette we
are going to actually start with so
let's go ahead and start with a sigma
e60 brush a vanity Q sheet thanks a lot
a which is that one right there
I'm going to go ahead and take that up
with this brush and then we are going to
tack that all over the eyelid just so
that we can have a nice little base to
start with this will make the blending
process easier and we are going to be
doing a lot of blending for this
particular eye looks like I said I was
definitely spending a lot more time on
my actual eyes last week so yeah that is
what we are doing so just kind of
blending blending blending now we're
going to jump into the shade right here
which is called bestie this is
definitely going to be our transition
shade so I'm going to jump in with this
guy right here which is my morphe MV 13
brush I'm going to dip into that color
and then I'm going to take this all over
my eyelid and into my crease lately I've
been watching it Stefanie Lang from
Stefanie Lang here on YouTube that's her
username I'll go ahead and link it down
below and she always says to take your
transition and put it on to your lid as
well instead of just like blending it
into the crease and I feel like that
actually does help with the blending
process so we're just putting it onto
the lid and then blending it up into the
crease I've been watching her a lot
recently and she has helped me with like
blending eyeshadows I know that I'm no
professional but she definitely is and
her tips and tricks are awesome alright
so after I have gone ahead and put that
on my eyelids and into my crease we are
going to jump in to the shade hashtag
which is that orange shade right there
and I'm actually going to take that with
a Sedona lace EB 13 brush I'm just going
to go ahead and dip in there and then
we're just going to go ahead and
actually work this into the crease again
it's okay if a little color don't come
down onto the lid no big deal and we're
just kind of blending up this is a
really really dense brush and again she
recommended when you do do a little bit
when you do two would you do a little
bit of a transition shade using a denser
brush is actually helpful because you
can really pick up that color like I
said she has just been an inspiration to
me and she has a lot of really good at
tips for hooded eyes as well as oily
skin she's like very very oily skin so
if you're always good you should
definitely check her out she's got like
over a million subscribers but she is
one of those like tutorial lists or like
makeup artists that can actually follow
on YouTube some of these people I'm just
not interested in these eye looks they
create and like I don't know her
eyeshadow tips are just absolutely
awesome so after I
dumbass I'm going to go ahead and jump
into the shade of brownie points we're
going to take a little more of like a
definer brush so the one that I am going
to take is see here I'm going to take
this little guy this be lucky 231 small
tapering of brush brush what I'm going
to take off that shade and then we're
just going to go ahead and start working
that into the crease and we're really
starting in the lower part of the crease
and just kind of going slowly if you
want this look to be super super defined
like the smokey part you can go ahead
and put a piece of tape here I really
only do that for special events and
shows though so that wasn't anything
that I was doing last week but yeah I
really love this little brush because
it's so nice and easy to get right into
the crease no matter what I shape you do
have I'm just kind of going back and
forth and doing a little bit of circular
motions as well and I'm just building
that color up this particular shade from
this palette is actually really hard to
work with it's very difficult to blend
so I thought it was kind of funny that I
was reaching for it last week because I
was really trying to challenge myself
with my eye looks because you know
sometimes you get a pallet and you're
like oh my god I love how these
particular shades blend and then it's
like ooh hoo there's always like a hit
or a mess sometimes in pellets but I was
really trying to challenge myself last
week to really dig in and try and get
into everything so now I'm going to take
a sigma keeper blending a35 and I'm
going to go ahead and blend that out
doing it back and forth and small
circular motions and I'm actually going
to look down into the mirror from this
palette so that I can really see what
I'm doing that's another little tip that
i'm stefanie laying had she was Saied
really with the crease especially when
you're going right into like the socket
area looking down into the mirror can be
very very helpful because then you can
see everything and especially when
you're going in with like a smaller
brush like that Luxy one you know a
really really packed color on just in
that specific area so you want to make
sure that you can really blend that out
easily so again it's kind of taking it
circular motions as you guys can see and
then we are going to take an even darker
shade in to the outer V and then we'll
go back and blend with that hashtag
shade and I really liked the way that
this brownie points-- shade and the
hashtag shade cure together last week
like I said there was a day where I just
wore hashtag which is that orange you
shade in a
a crease and it looks great with one of
the Stila glitter and glows but today
we're specifically working with the
shade of C siren because so many of you
were like these duo homes are impossible
how do I do this how do I work with
these and let me tell you it still is a
little difficult I feel like the
original formula is so so so much better
but that's okay
so yeah we're just going to continue to
blend again with these kind of darker
shades you really want to make sure that
you are blending this is so not my
things you guys know me you know I hate
blending but it's worth it because the
eye look is really pretty at the end of
the day so anyway that is what we are
doing and now I am gonna go in with an
even fluffier bit even fluffier brush
this is my BH Cosmetics crease brush and
I am really just going to go back and
forth with this I really like the way
that this kind of diffuses color and you
can see this got a little bit onto the
lid as well again if I learned anything
from Stephanie lid and so that is
totally okay that I got down onto the
lid and it doesn't matter because we are
placing a glitter eyeshadow on the lid
anyway at the end and something I really
recommend with these glitter and glows
you guys is to not go in with them first
do not try and blend anything on top of
them and definitely go ahead and use
them last if you are going to use them
if you make a nice kind of glitter
eyeliner as well which is awesome but
you know just blending back and forth
with this now we're going to go ahead
and pick that darker shade like I said
into the outer V and I'm going to use
that same little luck see small tapered
blending brush I'm going to go into the
shade teddy bear which again really
challenge myself you see
teddy bear this one right here which is
kind of like a burnt can't even no it's
kind of like a merlot shade again really
challenged myself last week because this
is a like impossible shade to blend it's
want to be hardest in the palette but I
really wanted to see if I could get some
definition really make myself work for
it you know learn some new blending
techniques and basically what I did was
I just took it on the outer V right here
and then just kind of started blending
it into the outer crease and you are
going to get a little fallout with this
but that's okay we will go ahead and
pick up the fallout a little later so
again doing the same thing on the right
eye and I'm just kind of focusing it on
the outer V and then taking it into the
outer crease and then your going to have
a lot of lending to do after this so
really going to take that time and just
blending that eyeshadow going to work
that up a little more on the right
side and yeah oh you can see I already
took it a little too high there all
right now we are going to jump it back
in it to that Sigma e35 and this time
we're going to do small circular motions
for the outer V I really like doing
small circular motions for the outer V
just because I feel like it blends it
inward and also outward again if you do
want to take right here you'll get a
really really nice precise smoky line
there but I just like I said I never do
that unless it's for special occasions
let me know if you guys want me to do
some sort of like a get ready with me
where I do do some kind of like you know
smokey keeps kind of look but we're not
going to be doing that today so I like
you of you asking if you know how I'm
doing that throwback Thursday on again
we're just going to continue blending
you know I'm doing that throwback
Thursday like review series every other
week on Thursday and a few of you were
asking if I would do something called
tutorial Thursday which would be on the
opposite Thursday so basically every
Thursday you would either see a
throwback Thursday review or you would
see tutorial Thursday if you know the
reason why I don't call these videos
tutorials on my channel because I never
want you guys to feel like I'm telling
you what to do I really want it to be
more like we're getting ready together
because I've never claimed to be a
makeup artist I'm definitely not a
makeup artist and it's just one of those
things where it kind of feels strange to
me personally to be telling you like
this is what you need to do so I prefer
just doing look of the week on Saturdays
but if you guys really have like a few
eye looks that you really want me to
recreate cause like there have been
quite a few lately again ever since I
have been watching Stephanie laying it
seems like a lot of you these are not
like my eye techniques they're
definitely hers going back to that BH
Cosmetics fluffy crease brush I've
either definitely liked her eye
techniques but it seems like a lot of
you have been liking a lot of the eye
looks I've been wearing so if you would
like me to go ahead and do tutorial
Thursday I think we would just designate
that for eye looks throughout the week
but again like you know I do look of the
week on Saturdays and I feel like that's
enough but if you guys feel differently
definitely let me know down below I love
the idea I totally love it I want to
give you guys what you want to see but
you know I'm more of a review based
channel and that's honestly just what
I'm more comfortable with I'm just not
comfortable filming makeup on camera
just because well first of all people
are assholes about it you know what I
mean
and that's what I really give a fuck
about that I mean I don't give a fuck
about a lot of stuff but at the same
time you know it's just one of those
things where it's like it's more
enjoyable for me to do review based kind
of things but I know a lot of you been
asking about makeup stuff lately so
remember that I do you know look at the
week every single Saturday which I feel
like is like once a week you know I'm
good a good get ready with me but if you
want something a little more precise and
you would like me to do it more like
tutorial style where I'm not blabbing
like I am right now I could it start to
do that tutorial Thursday and it would
just be for I look so basically like you
guys can see here we're just blending it
back in for and now what we're going to
do to really help because right here you
can see it looks a little sharp and
muddy I am going to go back into the
Sedona lace brush with that shade
hashtag which is that orange shade I'm
going to work it right here and this is
just going to help to blend everything
it together and give it a little bit of
something it also takes it up a little
higher and it just makes it I actually
don't know what shape my eyes are so
like I kind of have hooded eyes but it
makes the eye look just look a little
more elongated the whole eye area so I'm
just kind of taking that up and again
this Sedona lace brush is definitely
very very densely packed so it's a
little hard to do really precise
blending with this but what we're going
to do is go back in with that BH
Cosmetics and then we're just blending a
little more right here and again you can
see this fell down onto the lid like I
said if I've learned anything from
Stephanie Lang is that that is OK and it
doesn't matter so anyway just going back
and forth and I know a lot of blending I
feel like my arms about to fall off but
you can zest for this look so get it
yeah alright so that is what it looks
like so far like I said if you want
something really precise you can go
ahead and put them you know keep over
here I don't really mind if they look a
little uneven that's totally just female
that's just my style I really don't care
but if you are really really like you
know you know about that kind of stuff
you might be like oh my good ok it has
to be completely even let's bring in a
little bit of tape so now I'm going to
take this little Alexi blush brush and
I'm just going to wipe away and
sort of fall out we may have gotten and
now I'm going to go back in with that 60
brush from Sigma that we used at first
taking that think a lot a shade again
I'm just going to work that right
underneath so that we have a little bit
of lightness still with the brow kind of
take it in the areas where maybe I
blended that darker shade a little too
far in just totally fine can clean that
up so again doing that on each side
there's also help so that there's no
really really harsh line I always find
that I blend better on my left side and
I don't know if it's because I'm
left-handed
but let me just do a little extra
blending over here on the right hand
side right so that is good enough for me
um you know then if you want something
really precise you can use tape or you
can keep on blending now what we are
going to do is go ahead and smoke out
some color on our lower lash line I'm
going to be taking these Smashbox photo
finish primer water I'm going to spray
down this little brush right here which
is from the brand T's trendy cosmetics
it's just a flat shader brush as you
guys can see and I am going to dip into
that hashtag shade so the orange shade
I'm going to smoke this out on the lower
lash line something that I learned again
from this Stephanie Lang is that you
really shouldn't take or at least she
was saying it looks a little more
flattering if you don't take a darker
shade on the lower lash line which I
always do like I will take a crease
color and then I'll really take like a
liner shade and really really work that
like on the lower lash line and kind of
smoke it out she was actually saying
that it looks a little better if you
take a lighter shade on the lower lash
line which is kind of interesting I've
never done that so apparently this helps
so that the eye doesn't look as droopy
I'm just kind of taking that and
blending it as you guys can see and then
again I go in one more time with that
Sigma brush the e35 I kind of wipe off
the excess and I have a little paper
towel here and then I just clean up B
lines one's a little more precise a
little more densely packed then that BH
Cosmetics brush and I actually blend
everything I just got a nice something I
okay alright just to make sure there are
absolutely no harsh lines and then it's
a little bit of harshness close I mean
is me
unlike our liquor but the yep doing the
best I can
alright so that is pretty much the base
value shadow which looks a little crazy
now we're going to go ahead and jump
into the cielo glitter and glow liquid
iron shadow initiates east Irina and
this is what the little applicator looks
like if you guys can see me dual chromed
are different from the other ones you
have to tap these onto the lid so what
I'm going to do is start kind of tapping
onto the lid starting towards the lower
lash line and then one thing that I
learned with these as well is you want
to be really careful taking them sort of
towards the crease area you don't want
to take too much so kind of flipping the
little brush here and don't worry if you
make mistakes you can actually fix it
really really easily and I'll show you
guys how to do that in a second you have
to wait for it to completely dry down
before you try and fix your mistake
because if you try and blend this or
move it while it's still wet you're
going to have some issues so again just
kind of tapping and layering this on
because they are not as pigmented as say
the original ones like smokey storm and
gold goddess and that silver shade you
know diamond does you just have to keep
building and keep patting now I'm just
going to do it on my lid today because
Tom and I are going out later but if you
want to you can go ahead and smoke it on
a beat not smoke it but take it on the
lower lash line as well like I said it
actually makes a really really nice kind
of glitter eyeliner but I am just
focusing it on at the lid today because
I feel like I look a little on the crazy
side when I do take it all the way on
the lower lash line so again being very
careful kind of taking it up to the
crease area and do this with my left
hand kind of taking it up into the
crease area but then also not going too
high and this is always the I like I
said that I stand up looking up so I'll
share with you guys how I fix this what
I notice is if I take it too high when I
play it starts to go higher up so what I
do is I just wait for it to dry down and
then I will go in and I will fix it so
again just tapping that color on do you
guys also have an eye that always looks
fucked up if you never get this perfect
and again I'm guessing it because I'm
left-handed so I
my left eye I really don't know but yeah
just really really packing that color on
and then going back to this side and
making sure we have the same amount
doing a little bit of swiping motions
I'm literally not going like oh all over
you know what I mean I'm really being
careful we're trying to be careful all
right
all right so now I'm going to go ahead
and kind of let that dry down and then I
will share with you guys how I fix the
mistake so I always end up not having it
very even and what I do is I wait for it
to completely dry then I take a q-tip
and then I kind of dust it off in the
meantime we'll go ahead and jump into
mascara so I'm going to take my
Charlotte Tilbury full-fat lashes
mascara which was sent to me for PR I'm
going to do one layer of that on my
eyelashes starting on the top so it's
just a really really nice kind of base
mascara in my opinion and then one
little layer on the bottom as well of
course and then I'm going to go in with
my L'Oreal voluminous feline and mascara
which has a nice rubber bristle wand and
you guys know I like to pair a natural
bristle wand with a rubber result I just
really like the way that that turns out
so going like that and then we'll go in
right away with that L'Oreal voluminous
feline mascara which looks like this
again I'm going to start on the upper
lashes with this rubber bristle ond and
then work my way to the lower ones and I
think lastly I was using the Maybelline
a push-up a drama which is even more
like clumpy and kind of like
in-your-face but honestly that mascara
had to be put in the empty bin because
it got too gloopy you know it had been
out for too long so just going ahead and
putting that on to the upper lashes
really kind of building because I feel
like if I'm going to do all of this I
shadow you know my mom as well really
kind of pile on that mascara which I
mean come on I always tell on mascara
and then going on to lower ones as well
all right eventually I'm going to figure
out how to film on the DSLR to do
tutorials you guys but today obviously
I'm filming this on the camcorder so now
that glitter and glow liquid eye shadow
should have kind of dried down a little
bit what we're going to do is again take
that q-tip and the areas where I feel
like I kind of fucked up which is always
I'm going to just wipe away really
lightly and the reason why I like doing
this is because you know once it's dry
you're clear to just kind of wipe that
excess away and then you can just move
it around where you need to put it so
again I'm going to take a clean q-tip on
the other eye and I'm just cleaning up
the lines that are not even and this is
just a really easy way to do it I know
some people can just put it on perfectly
it's not connecting to it okay you don't
do that and I don't mind so anyway guys
that is pretty much the eye look I've
really been enjoying this I love that
when you look down you see all the
purple and I just really like it too let
me zoom you in so you really can see
really really enjoy this eye look and
yeah that is pretty much it so I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow for my fields
and Holy Grails countdown thank you so
much for joining me and yeah I'll see
you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
