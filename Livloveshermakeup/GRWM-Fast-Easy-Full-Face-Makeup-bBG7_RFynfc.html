I'm going to be filming it get ready
with me video for you guys today
obviously hence the headband a little
flower headbands my hair gets stuck in
but you guys know I wear this anytime I
put on my makeup and I am in that the
bathroom today please excuse the
background yes that's a toilet over
there is a shower it's just this has the
best lighting and has the best mirror
like I said in previous videos I am on
vacation right now i am at my parents
cabin so um you know if you would see
it's not super prim and proper but then
again at the cabin so anyway um I'm just
trying to film you know as much as I can
while I'm here and just trying to get
good lighting and for this video because
I want to be near the mirror I thought I
would film in the bathroom so that is
why I'm filming in here I know my
filming has changed a lot like every
video it's kind of different I except I
like to film in the basement cuz it has
those nice like fluorescent lamps and
also it just like shows everything and I
can set up my leg too um iphone II don't
even need my leggings down there that
was too big fluorescent lamps um on the
ceiling however my mom's doing wash
right now she's doing um you know
laundry so I didn't want to be down
there and be like hey I'm just putting
my face on from the camera just keep
doing your thing so anyway I coming here
in the bathroom wow that's been one
minute and 31 seconds of me just
laughing about we gotta get bathroom
anyway let's get started love you my
lips my lips are always dry now I always
have leftover like fast too late or
something with a 94 on them so here i am
and i already did probably face just so
you guys know i am going to be reviewing
the primer i think today so i'll mention
it quickly it's the Stila aqua reach for
it it is called the Stila aqua globe
perfecting primer I dick use that all
over my face like i said i'll be doing a
review for that so I don't want to get
nothing's go on forever
so I don't want to talk too much about
that but basically it's just a primer
stick and Iran that all around my
forehead everywhere underneath my eyes
and i primed my eyes with the lorac
behind the scenes I primer so all kind
on the face and this is going to be very
very quick makeup I just I'm not even
like in a hurry today I kind of am I
have to be somewhere soon um and I have
been sitting around until let's see here
it's like 1 41 in the afternoon and
still don't have a makeup on so it's
just one of those days and I do feel
like putting a little makeup on going to
a graduation party later with my friends
so I'm going to be doing basically a
very very quick makeup and it doesn't
require a lot of products it doesn't
have to be perfect it never is perfect
however it just gets me out the door in
time and quick enough looking not
completely there are faced entire so
anyway let's just get started like you
said I already primed that is something
i always do even if I am in a hurry
because that will make the makeup look
so much better throughout the day and
yeah so um the one product that I use
guys can probably tell i love this i
have used a lot of it this is the
foundation and basically built in
concealer that i've used when i'm in a
hurry so this is the cover girl plus a
laid-back color correction CC cream tone
rehab foundation / base i am in the
color 105 ivory and i just love this
like you guys can tell i used a lot i
have to get another one and i have a lot
of foundations but anyway when i'm going
to hurry i use two pumps of this i use
one on my forehead on my eyelids and one
on uniboob auto part of my face and my
eyes so let's get started one pump on
the forehead like I said and um this is
a little dark sometimes it does um
oxidized a little bit but I just you
know if I'm going to hurry and things
like that i just don't really care you
know I just whatever so when you put it
on at first it looks a little light and
then it gets a little dark so like I
said I do one pump on the forehead and
the eyelids and this is going to be my
concealer as well it smells so good it's
so creepy I love using it with my finger
is because it is so blendable and I find
that it just covers just enough of the
stuff that I want to cover so that is
what it looks like and then I do one
pump for the bottom half of my face is
all foundation or CC cream and concealer
I've use for this kind of look so you
can see it gets a little white at first
but then I noticed throughout the day it
does get a little darker I wish they had
a lighter shade than 105 that's my
complaint with drugstore brands in
general need to be catering Warren to
the failboat take it down my neck I like
I said I'm just rubbing within my
fingers nothing special it really really
just um even if everything out it's
really really nice I like it a lot so
after I have done that doesn't have to
be perfect i basically just slap it on
there but I really even thought my skin
tone which is what I'm looking for and
it gives a lot more coverage than a BB
cream wait my lips and now i'm going to
set it i'm going to be using my NYC
smooth skin pressed face powder I'm
sorry if you guys hear the hoarseness in
my voice I have been a little sick the
past videos that I felt too i was
getting a little sick my voice was like
hey guys how are you doing like pretty
bad but um I'm just kind of getting over
it that's why I haven't posted in a week
also so anyway this is the NYC powder
i'm using it isn't translucent on a pit
pan i love it i'm using my big called
ecotools kabuki brush and stirring in
there and then pressing it on my skin
and i'm one of those people that like if
I'm in a hurry some people would rather
put like eyebrows on or I'm makeup I
would rather have a flawless looking
face so that is what I'm always going to
choose if I am in such a hurry and I
don't even make it to eye makeup I'm
fine as long as i have like color
corrected my face and power
I'm using quite a bit just because I do
get oily in the warmer months this
really really nicely um nicely yes
nicely really a mat like me nicely and
does not put extra color on my face it
may have a tiny bit of coverage and it's
like super too I go through translucent
powder some quickly because I like a lot
of powder to set my place like I said I
prefer a flawless space over anything
else so if that's a lifetime more that's
all I'm going to do but I'm just
counting the things stamping it in
blending it into my ear and I like that
this powder is translucent it does not
add any color though there is a flawless
face I'm gonna getting pounded I pick
more up such a great deal to get my lips
no I can't find anything alerts go down
my neck a little bit i know i blended it
down but like i said it does oxidized a
little bit so so i get my neck make sure
you don't have an orange back i want to
try that when ghosts have this great
left tip that you can take like a tissue
or something and put it on after before
you apply powder or something like that
and it was to help with oxidation
oxidation yeah so I'm going to try that
with this obviously not now I don't know
a lot of time but I want to try it out
with this because I love this formula
everywhere this every single day and I
good and it's just so creamy blendable I
can use my fingers it gives good
coverage but it's a bit too dark so
anyway I'm going to put the pressure on
so I'm going to be using in the sea
physicians formula arcade where ultra
nourishing argan oil blush and natural
I'm also really really good it looks
like that and i'm just going to taking
this BH Cosmetics tapered blush brush it
is stained to clean it
nah I'm just going to get the apples of
my cheeks no contour me when I'm in up
you know brushes don't worry I will and
with like a product like this usually
from the drugstore I don't worry about
like swirling it in I know if you do
that with like Urban Decay you're going
to get like big stripes on your face but
these tend to be a little less pigmented
I will of course blemish them but I
really think this is a pretty kind of
flesh color so I'm just going to go back
to my brush that I used to set my face
and I'm just going to kind of stamp over
that because it will have some remaining
product that just kind of you know a
little bit of a bagel on it so that it
doesn't look some harsh and then so it
will blend it a little bit if I go a
little too harsh by accident like way
too harsh i will use strokes and blend
out blush but stamp this so there you go
nice natural flesh ok know what it is so
hot you're ready like what is two
o'clock in the afternoon lazy I have
been awesome 25 and I stood it just was
like can't be bothered to put makeup on
yet even when want to wear something
alright so next I am going to take I am
doing a highlight just for a nice little
glow i'm going to be using my makeup
forever pro sculpting duo in number two
leaves you taking that highlight that
golden highlight on my Real Techniques
what is this cold setting brush just
take a little bit of that gold hit my
chin love
tell me nose and then on size of my
cheekbone all the way to the apple my
cheek don't worry about be going over
this again it goes on white paper due
and then of course the super oily now
looks super greasy so I'm headed back to
that Ecotools brush and just Pat on top
of that stamp on top of one just kind of
tone down my leg I read a little bit
with the power don't run the Russians
you guys can see that gets such a glow
to the skin and I think the goal like
usually gold sometimes doesn't look as
good on fair skin but this one is
amazing so there it is sometimes I quit
so speak so I'm going to pop on lip
gloss quickly I got this inner are not
sephora 100.4 or something this is M
NARS lip gloss in orgasm very popular
gloss got a nice peachy color to it very
natural easy I need to line the lips or
anything so pop that on I'm not going to
be putting anything well I'm gonna take
that Real Techniques setting brush again
and go into my naked basics just get me
putting one eyeshadow all over my lid I
don't do any creaser crease work or
anything like that one I'm gonna hurry
so I'm just going to be taking a wwos in
your walk of shame bring that all over
this brush and just tapping that all the
way up to the row just so we look nice
and matte and your nuclear so I'm going
to take a little bit underneath don't
help cover any darkness that a CC cream
did not get not wearing concealer even
on the lids
like that hey aunt the one thing i do do
no matter what one thing i do do
goodnight relations the one thing I
always do matter what is curl my lashes
if i can find my eyelash perm seriously
otherís I lift it now right here I mean
it was gray it's just going to curl my
eyelashes quickly when I'm in a rush I
just do 10 seconds I normally do 30 and
I just like to pump it like that did I
just go 10 times when I'm in a hurry
just enough curl since I don't with time
mate quickly i'm going to set my face I
do believe in primers and setting sprays
so I with use doesn't matter if I'm
gonna brush or not so I'm going to be
mixed in that finish setting spray I've
been doing this before i make up lately
just because i find that it means my
mascara running i spray because I spring
blonde so I want to do it after I do my
face makeup now before my eye makeup
don't you know my eye makeup budge I
know it's not supposed to and it helps
it like prolong but i just used so much
like to get it all over so if I wasn't
so how to hand it maybe I could continue
doing that but I noticed that it moves
my eye makeup so that's it it's so good
refreshing I really like this one from
Nixon matte finish babies can we finish
it off so nice but this one I think have
alcohol in it so will help keep you mad
alright so next I just go under the
mascara I'm going to be using my Sephora
outrageous curl one of my favorite
mascaras like and just change just got
close yet so I'm just gonna be taking
that and just go into town near can't
just look in the camera I'm just taking
this I like this because it does help to
keep the lashes curled and like I said I
don't curl them for my normal amount
time when I'm in a hurry so this helps
keep them curl it doesn't you know they
don't go flat immediately so there's one
layer to other dry and I find what I'm
going to hurry I always get my sura
everywhere I'm very sloppy with my fear
um however this is such a tiny little
like brush so I'm less likely to make
huge mistakes in this I still make
sticks but funny so there is one coat
and then righteousness it for a second I
dip it back in and I will go in for a
second just because I mean after a
flawless face I think the number one
thing that I would have fiber on like a
desert island would be mascara just
opens up your eyes so much so the main
points that I hit up to later the
monster can never hurt a girl and I
don't dip in between each eye I just go
right over so you can already see the
difference between two hooks and one I
can always build I'm a to go kind of
girl made some mistakes ok so there are
two coats of mascara thank you guys so
this is what I do when I'm in a hurry um
when I want to have a flawless face but
you know still look put together but I
really don't have tons and tons of time
this is what I do I don't even comb on
my eyebrows I know that's horrible I
sort of just like this make sure they're
in place make sure they're still there
so I don't feel them in or anything like
that and i am going to something i do i
like to wait till my mascaras dry to get
any little flakes off because once it's
dry you can just flick it off with a
q-tip however if I'm in a hurry I will
go back to my real techniques setting
brush back into that color-block Shane
and go over my lid again and that will
take care of any kind of mascara
mistakes
cover it a little bit not completely but
a little bit oh my gosh look what i just
did just made a mess in the face wait
till it's semi dry please miss I was
time to go same time when I got
withdrawal focus at my notes right so I
just kind of a bit sick stuck into mebbe
da a lot of q-tip I would last um and I
just kind of lightly go over the areas
where mascara got stuck once it's dry
will just completely flick off like it
does when it's on your eyelashes all day
it's just a flake because it gets dry so
it's really easily won't disturb the
makeup you have underneath alright so
that is the look this is what I do when
I'm a hurry you guys probably recognize
this face because I am probably worn it
in a lot of videos um probably when I
was not going to finals and stuff with
school but anyway um I don't know what
I'm going to do my hair I don't know if
I'm gonna wear it down anywhere it up to
here some dry shake okay hold on
Battiste Betty stay fresh new clue in a
floral and flirty blush so i think i
will wear it down just kind of volume
eyes i'm not going to brush it out or
else it will get really flat but yeah
this was my back makeup look my get
ready with me i hope you guys enjoyed
this if you did please give it a thumbs
up and we'll see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
