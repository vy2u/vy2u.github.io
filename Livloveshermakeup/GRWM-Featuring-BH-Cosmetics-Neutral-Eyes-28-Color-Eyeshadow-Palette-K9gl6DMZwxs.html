ready with me this morning I figure you
know might as well do want I'm on my way
you know do school and whatnot so let's
just pull the hair back and let's get
started so today I really wanted to try
out because I haven't been using this
very much because I've had so much new
stuff that I've wanted to like you know
review and things like that I wanted to
kind of use some BH Cosmetics products
so I'm definitely going to use the
professional blush palette super excited
about this and then I also want to use
the neutral or natural eye palette today
or whatever this is what is it called
beautifully neutral eye 28 color eye
shadow palette so I'm gonna play wrong
with this
and yeah so let's just get started um
the first thing I'm going to do is it's
like foundation I'm going to be using my
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation this is in 805 you think
that's today because I have a long day
and this lasts a long time on the face
just gonna apply two pumps of that on
the back of my hands use my handy dandy
you know what Real Techniques expert
face brush and I know this looks pretty
like light but honestly this foundation
oxidizes on me like crazy so you know it
like turns darker throughout the day so
that is why I am doing the 805 instead
of the 810 because if I use the 810 I
will end up with literally like an
orange face by two o'clock in the
afternoon which is not cool actually you
know that happens a lot to me with
covergirl products I have no idea why
anybody else
oxidizes it starts out like the right
color and then it just gets
progressively darker as the day goes on
Nicole came as a blended that and I'm
just going to tap set in certain areas
where I don't want saddle and I am going
to take the it cosmetics what is this
boo-ki complexion I used to father died
we need to remember the name of this
came in that little four set from QVC I
love little pointy brushes like this to
blend into the hairline favorite thing
to do with them
yeah yeah find the powder I want to use
so I guess I'll try this Revlon
age-defying or why I didn't like this
but for some reason I didn't so I guess
see when I start applying it what it is
about it this is in the color light pale
oh five I don't know what I didn't like
about this mattifying really nicely see
yes the times like that or you just have
random products laying around then you
go back and you try them out and you
like them even if you didn't before
like this this looks like a very like
finely milled it doesn't look like it's
sitting on my skin weight doesn't
oxidize alright so that was the
age-defying however well so we got so
far
definitely set my makeup nicely I
actually have a 45 minutes subway ride
into Brooklyn this morning for a lesson
so I'll probably fall asleep
all right luminol so blush from Milani
looks like that this is my blush I use
when I am in a hurry and I know that I
need highlighter and a blush in one this
absolutely gets the job done when it
comes to that using my ELF small stipple
by the way
it's such a beautiful glow to the skin
it seems to not really matter like what
your complexion is you can be pale you
can have tan skin this blush just is
like an Universal and perfect your gonna
try any of the baked blushes from Milani
I suggest this one for sure alright
blush and highlighter done go back in so
there's no harsh lines right oh I smell
smoke oh my god cheese my cat's set the
apartment on fire alright so I'm gonna
go into my neutralize 28 color eyeshadow
palette from BH Cosmetics I'm taking my
Real Techniques setting brush
I think eyes know I like to use this all
over the lid I'm gonna take that white
creamy color down there and just Pat
that all over the lid all the way up to
the brow shimmery of it is pretty
shimmery you couldn't tell on this
lighting
you
that's certainly written things up
next I am going to take this ah I can
reach it little crease brush from
Ecotools and I am just going to take
this nice like light almost taupey color
right there I'm just gonna work that
into my crease
this color reminds me of Velvet Revolver
from my favorite palette which is the
Too Faced natural eyes palette it does
kind of look like it - it's matte it
just kind of gives some nice like shadow
to the eye without looking like you have
contoured the crap out of your eye
socket
made myself at I am going to just blend
it out I'm gonna use the elf crease
brush a different purpose then that out
and I am going to take this reaching for
all my clean brushes now Sigma what is
this the EO 5 eyeliner brush gonna take
that same color just found that right
underneath the lash line almost on the
lashes
rady that is all I'm going to do with
the eyeshadow space because I am kind of
in a hurry
oh goodness darn I said I'm gonna use
that blush palette you guys what
happened didn't use it let's see that's
what it looks like anyway
and I promise I will use it this week
and I will get a review and swatches
coming to you guys ASAP beautiful keep
forgetting because it's such like Plain
Jane
packaging just doesn't catch my eye so
anyway next I take my Laura Geller house
right there at the top amazing it never
happens Laura Geller I care waterproof
eyeliner eye brightener in just like
this banana color I've chosen this a few
times banana color it's not stark white
but it has like a little bit of yellow
in it it's also not like nude because
people with my complexion who wear like
the nude eyeliner in the waterline it
actually looks like darker than their
skin
I learned the hard way you're going to
tightline
like my crease color matches my eyebrows
I could probably use that color in that
palette to fill in my brows anyway so
that is eye brightening trick what is
next I'm going to curl my lashes like to
do it for 20 seconds on the day swear
I'm looking pretty worn out and tired
texting me at 7:51 in the morning
seriously alright I'm gonna go one more
time because it is 751 all right
eyelashes curls good to go and I'm going
to take shoot I thought that was my
eyebrow brush cuz I look at all these
dirty brushes like this is disgusting I
really need to clean these it's just
after they build up for a while who is
texting me so early after they built up
for a while it's just so hard to all
right I'm gonna spoolie out my brows I'm
gonna lift them a little higher in the
arch because I am tired and I look tired
now I know I left a review and said I
did not like this size Queen mascara
from Too Faced but I have found that if
i layer it after i layer another coat of
mascara it looks really good
I guess I could use the Urban Decay
perversion bigger blacker better right
so just applying this kind of our base
coat
I don't know the name of this mascara
made me think that it was gonna be like
shocking when I put it on like a huge
difference like you know like to face
like I don't know I just thought I was
gonna be like super kind of clumpy and
luscious the way I like it but it's
actually really really like a defined
mess like it really defines the lashes
so sometimes it's nice but this really
does nicely separate and coat each lash
and I know a lot of people like that
kind of look this would be great just to
go out like that but I want a bigger
what the lashes bigger so like I said I
didn't love but this mascara at first
this is the Too Faced size Queen but I
found that if I apply it after I apply a
different mascara and I let that other
mascara dry first this actually does
some nice stuff so again look at that
wand whoa huge not good for someone
who's messy like me but anyway I just
didn't like this one I used it by itself
like it just didn't do much but when I
you know use it with another mascara
really like as you can see it's just I
think it's volumizing and I love
volumizing mascaras so it's actually a
nice little duo the perversion and then
this perversion is kind of lengthening
separating and then this one's
definitely thickening
this one is so big it's like the size of
my eye crazy right now for the tops
that is my number one tip for getting
false eyelashes without the falsies
rushing your mascara on the back of your
lashes creates so like so much more it
helps if you have lighter hair so that
when you like looking down you're
blinking it's not obviously you're
wearing a super dark mascara hit that
area there be better than sex mascara
does that nicely but this one's not is
not as great so definitely volumizes and
I appreciate that I like a nice good
well you might mascara but I finally
only like this this is layered with
another mascara and I have to be layered
after like if I use it for us I hate it
and I just get it everywhere and so yeah
alright move on to lips quickly I'm
going to wear I think one of my lip
sheers from from bareMinerals that
little like duo I got I need to do eight
review and swatches on that because I
love it but let me grab it
I'm gonna use the color pink pulse and
these are just lip sheers absolutely
love them review coming soon probably
today and they're really really
moisturizing but you can see that gives
such a blast finish which I love
makes me still feel glam even though my
lips are chapped so righty
next I'm going to go back in sit with my
crease brush so you gotta need dry
mascara flakes up there that we can
brush off go ahead and blend out with
this
all righty what else you feel like I
could do so much more but I really don't
have time and by such a long day I
really don't want too much makeup like
melting off my face of that make sense
all right so that is it I promise I'm so
sorry I forgot but I promise I will use
that bh cosmetics blush palette in like
you know my next tutorial or get ready
with me I look forward to using it and I
will definitely like use it tomorrow on
things like that
but I have not gotten to use it yet so
no reviews or swatches yet on that but a
lot of other products that I have gotten
the past couple weeks I have been doing
swatches and reviews on so definitely uh
you know stay up-to-date with those I
guess and yeah this is the look very
very casual light fast easy so I hope
you guys enjoyed this I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
