morning i should say i'm still in my
robe i am going to do a get ready with
me video featuring the Stila in the
white palette i am really played with
this too much yet and i want to play
with it a little more before i give it a
full review but um I thought I just do
you know my normal face makeup and then
figure something out with this one so
let's just get started i'm i'm going to
use a BB cream today i'm going to use a
garnier BB cream my shade is fair light
i just picked this up the other day so
hopefully it not just my skin
there's nothing worse than getting a BB
cream or a foundation and then it
oxidizes throughout the day
I could not get a lot of sleep last
night so I've got to cover up the little
a circle I like this is a nice
consistency seems pretty good i'm just
using my hands because it is a BB cream
I just needed a little moisture on my
skin today too by the way I already
washed my face put my serum on and
behind my eyelids at my face you know
it's very very shiny
next I'm going to use this world olay CC
eye cream that i picked up the other day
also trying to use the products that I
picked up the other day baby lips Oh
entire guys hi should that some kind of
writing makeup but i think i've already
done a get ready with me that was
frightening so this looks very nice and
moisturizing which is good cause like i
said and dried today I was definitely
more of a cream then I like concealer
but okay definitely has a little color
in it though wow that BB cream made me
greasy really quickly holy crap though
it feels nice it feels like just you're
putting an eye cream one but it does
have some brightening effects and this
actually looks a little watching on my
face i do not go on expert face brush
I'm just buff it in surprise usually BB
creams you can just do with your hands
with no problem
I don't know about this one I feel very
very greasy right now definitely accept
this so to use my earth tone crazy
powder i use this basically every day to
set my makeup gonna take that you just
use it with this big couple key from
Ecotools i love this thing it just packs
it on so well absolutely love the
consistency of this powder it's my
favorite it's just so finely milled and
I mean it's three dollars can't view
good a little tired today watching right
yes just gonna come out my eyebrows
spoolie them just so you guys know hey
getting foundation on my lips like yeah
alright so my happy kid thing so sees
this so this is like a nice peachy blush
with a shimmer in him let's basically
got a built-in highlighter as you can
see
and I guess we'll just get started the
palette let me get it out super excited
I really have it more pleased at all
I've been hauling so much stuff so comes
with an eyeliner hopefully it's
waterproof yes it is these are the
colors beautiful think I'm going to go
for more of a neutral probably won't
grab that bluish one today so i guess
i'm going to take that first color bear
with just stay what is this the sigma
e40 war fought all over my lid and up to
my brown just so we have a nice face
so nice shape it's mad for my lid i
think i'm going to do kitten because i
know that that is like one of their
best-selling ones i'm just going to take
it on my finger and just Pat it onto the
lid beautifully pigmented and take it a
little bit into the inner corner to
brighten up gorgeous color
you
pretty pretty pretty great tutorial
video let me take my Sigma at this the
e30 5 i'm going to go into that color
sunset it's kind of that bronzy color
there see well just going to work that
into my crease
just to give it some depth and darken it
up the other way that very nicely soft
and pigmented thicken his so far
okay but you then as a transition color
I'm going to go into that ah what is it
bliss color just going to work that all
right there just to transition into the
lighter color I'm going to flip it over
and then go back to their my brow bone
again just make sure it's nice and light
okay next I'm going to take a small
little what is this from alpha smudge
your eye crease brush whatever i'm going
to take us sunset and bring that down on
my lower lid on my lower lash mountain
star you I'm going to mostly do it on
the outer half and then go into bliss
again and bring that on the inner half
see that those two colors again
really heavy on this side for you grab
their Gary okay the shadows to curl my
lashes
oh I'm sorry oh I'm so silly I forgot
eyeliner in there I've got to use it if
it came with the palette so this is a
waterproof eyeliner says and it says in
the color dapple so I'm just going to
find my waterline and my upper lash line
so
hopefully this is truly waterproof
because it won't stay on my eyes if it's
not so so far we have kind of a brown
smokey that dansville colors nice it's
like a very deep deep dark brown
eyeliner so I feel like there's stuff on
my lips anyway now I voice and I think
sex mascara I trust it close we see guys
in food
hope see you making a mess it's okay
I'll grab a q-tip I a tip for you guys
if you do get mascara like on the skin
part wait till it dries and then get a
q-tip and it will just flake right off
don't smudge it when it's wet not worth
it you looks weird with that little
smudge right there a lip color i'll just
do this NYC plumping lip gloss big bold
very color name I don't know this is the
color a little neutral lips oh my gosh
you know just wait for this dry so I can
i smoke that but so far i mean i love
the pigmentation the shadows are creamy
their luscious i will do a separate
review oh my gosh I can't all right this
here I guess I could use a little dab of
this this is one of them may believe
visits but I don't want to go too bright
so I'm just going to dab it oh my lips
you
because it is very vivid this is a vivid
rose matches my room right so you can
come off no swype this away
need a q-tip but I don't wanna run a
crease brush pick up the little pieces
at the top just take this whoa sorry
guys my camera just went off all right
well that is to look um so let me show
you guys up close this is the look I got
um I think it's a great palate it really
has some nice creamy shadows I like that
they're super easy to blend super easy
to work with well that mr. I didn't
really come off there but so that that
shade kitten really brightens up the eye
and that color sunset really nicely went
into the crease so anyway hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
