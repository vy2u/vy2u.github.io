today I'm doing a get ready with me
featuring the tart bon voyage a little
gift set I got this from Sephora com it
literally came in last night so this is
going to be my first time using it and I
guess you know this is kind of like
first impressions too so this is what
you get inside up here is a palette it
is an eye palette in this little pouch
really nice and sleek and these are the
colors on the inside so I think they're
just really really beautiful kind of
neutral shades and I think you can work
with these a lot and get a lot of
different looks so not quite sure what
I'm going to do yet today but i'll play
around with them and we'll see what the
pigmentations like to so um that is the
palette and then at the bottom you get a
tarte lipsurgence a lip tint in romantic
you get a lipsurgence lip gloss in the
color what is it visionary and then you
get a lights camera lashes which is one
of the tarp mascaras and it is a I think
these are like deluxe i would say these
are deluxe size although the lipsurgence
both of them the lip gloss and the lip
tint powerful size and then you also get
a tard Muse cheek stain a tarte maracuja
oil marcuzzo ever USA and then a
finishing powder so that's what you get
on the bottom so i'm going to use just
as much as i can today i want to really
just focus to look on this so um yeah so
I'm going to start and use the tarte
maracuja maracuja oil and i'm just going
to take like one or two drops of this
this is a pretty thick oil i've used
this before I've had a full size of this
so I'm just applying this all over even
under my eyes on my eyelids everywhere
this is a very very thick oil but I do
like it it's just passion flower or um
yeah passion flower I think I like the
actual seed comes from oh alright so
once that is completely breast and we
are going to go ahead and just apply our
foundation I am currently having some
really bad like hormonal breakouts right
now so I'm going to be using a CC cream
and then put a little foundation on top
of it today just for extra coverage so
I'm going to use the covergirl plus old
a CC cream this is the tone rehab one
just going to take one pump of that for
my whole face and just spread that
everywhere this will color correct I on
gamma eliminate some redness and like my
dark circles and things like that but on
a day to like today where I am breaking
out pretty badly I would like an extra
layer on top so baby wipes
all right and after i am done with that
i'm going to go ahead and use my L'Oreal
visible lift serum absolute pro retinol
a plus vitamin C foundation this is in
the color 143 soft ivory and i'm just
going to pump like two or three pumps
three pumps on the back of my hand and
I'm going to take me grab my brush where
my brushes there there Here I am going
to take um my Real Techniques brush like
usual um and I'm just going to dab that
in there and start working out in
all right after I do that I am just
going to go ahead and take my fingers I
like to just like blot over the areas
where um like makeup tends to settle on
people so right here right here you're
kind of just picking up excess product
that doesn't need to be there so that
may be here and then I'm going to take
my what is this this is from the little
buki collection box of the it cosmetics
Prussians this is the pookie complexion
brush I'm just going to take this and
blend all of that into my hairline just
making sounds undo my makeup Oh little
derby derby headband failing me
alright so once I do that I am going to
go ahead and just like my hands off
again I hate having like dirty makeup
hands and dirty new clips that on the
clock 2cd about it um and let's see here
oh so you can fix this well whatever
anyway so next I am going to go ahead
and set my foundation I am going to be
using the my tone correcting powder from
ELF in cool and I'm just going to take
my eco tools big kabuki brush and just
Pat that in there
I absolutely love this powder but
sometimes honestly it gets a bit of love
too much of a cooling effect to the skin
tone makes it look paler which I'm not
fair enough okay once i do that i am
just going to again like a rich woman
between each thing and then I think we
shall get started with some of the other
stuff in here um i am going to i am
going to take this little tart smooth
operator Amazonian clay finishing powder
since it's such a tiny thing i didn't
want to use it to set my foundation if
this is like an HD kind of powder you
really want to use this just like a
dusting over the face after you have
applied your setting powder so i'm going
to use this it cosmetics Buki brush this
is the poopy powder ball brush it's
really really light and so what i'm
going to do is just take a little bit of
this and tap it into the lid and then
i'm just going to dip that in there and
then just apply that all over and these
micro finishing powder is all of them
you know else make up for ever's they're
all really nice they're all very like ah
I think silica is the main ingredients
so it really does smooth out your
complexion nicely
all right after I do that for that was
nice I really did give a nice stuff I
feel like I need that extra little bit
today I'm just feeling so so upset with
how my skin's been acting lately it's
just really really is bothersome go back
in there go back
baby here want to come out alright so
next I am going to go ahead and apply
that Queen blush um I'm going to be
using my ELF small stipple brush because
that's just what I trust with Korean
products or anything that's not a powder
so this is the tart muse cheek stain so
um I have never seen this I mean I've
looked at it obviously but I've never
like seen anybody use it or anything
like that so this is the color kind of
like a mole like almost like brown so
I'm going to be pretty careful since I
am pretty fair I am just going to take
my ELF small sniffle and just dab it in
there so I pick up a little bit and then
start applying that to the apples of my
cheeks
doesn't make my skin look too muddy it
is a really beautiful color it's just a
little you know deep it almost looks
like a bronzer on me I did get some nice
color to the face so um I do not like
that I mean I i think it is a pretty
deep color it wouldn't would not have
been my pic but it really does go nicely
with everything else that they put in
this bon voyage set so it kind of makes
sense anyway so after I do that I'm just
going to go back with my kabuki and just
kept over that make sure there's no
harsh lines okay and I think because
that is like a cream blush are you know
I I don't want to put a highlighter on
because I think that gives a natural
sheen to the skin so don't need to do
that i think i'm going to go ahead and
get into the eyes it is time let's open
up that palette and see what i choose to
live alright so sorry i feel like so up
CT dropping that altar so anyway um I
don't want to heavy like I don't want a
dramatic smokey eye or anything like
that today you can definitely I'm going
to go ahead and say already you can
definitely get that out of this palette
like those blues down there but that is
not what i'm going for today i have
finals school and it's just not that
kind of day for me so um what i'm going
to do first is take the Real Techniques
setting what is this yeah the setting
brush I believe it is yep setting brush
I'm going to take this color up here
that like pinky color and I'm just going
to put that all over my eyelid all the
way up to the brow the corner that's a
nice color it's got some pink in there
I like this brush because it really just
does this very quickly like I can just
get all the way up there very very
quickly so like that and what I want to
do next is just pull you out my eyebrows
quickly before we go on with the eye
makeup
ok let's go back in back in to do that
on what I'm going to do is take this elf
crease brush and I'm going to go in
queue I think this color I had kind of
dip my finger in there earlier and I
like it so I'm gonna take that one onto
this crease brush and just start working
that into my grief it's like very very
sparkly but it's pretty like it can
still be a daytime kind of look just
what I'm going for today
okay so once I work that into my crease
i'm going to go ahead and take a
blending brush and just blend that out I
always got a plan guys more you blend
the bender I make up a look
okay now i'm going to go and take this
brush from sigma it's the e 35 and i am
going to work a deeper color into the
outer V of my eye and the one I choose
is going to be I think i'm going to take
this warmer one right here so we have
that in the crease and then the warmer
one on the outer PA think that'll be
pretty so just going to take that and
just get that on their sides
and then I'm going to go back to that
blending brush and just blend blend
blend
okay and then I'm going to go back into
that color um well actually no I'm going
to take this lighter color here and I'm
going to work that underneath the brow
bone just to make sure that there's
still lightness under they're also going
to put in the inner corner just brighten
things up
alrighty and then I am going to go ahead
and take I guess I'll go back with that
crease brush you could do something a
little more precise but because I'm just
kind of limited on time today whatever
i'm just going to go back into that
crease brush going to take that crease
color again and just work that
underneath my lower lashline so
then I'm going to take that outer V
color we use the warmer one and do that
on the inner part of the eye
already so once I do that I think that's
going to be it for the shoutout I really
like these shadows I mean they're
gorgeous and I just think the color
selection is like oh my gosh so
beautiful and that love it increase
beautiful so very happy with that i will
keep using it this week and then i will
post a review for you guys on what i
think of the whole kit altogether but so
far i definitely like the eyeshadows so
next we are going to go ahead and do
eyelashes and i'm going to use the
mascara in here at the lights camera
lashes and so I'm going to curl my
eyelashes first I'm not going to use a
primer on them or anything like that
because I really want to see how well
this mascara holds up
ok I'll right here I am then going to
take the mask in just go right in ready
I thought it was this mascara that I
have tried before but this is a
different wand I think the one I had was
they lights camera flashes in that
really chunky like gold to has a really
big rubber bristle brush but this is
tinier and more precise I like that go
ahead and oh wow you know what that's so
annoying I was going to grab this and
see if I could use the mirror in here
but they don't have one in the applet so
I'll just take this my powder just do
that this is nice it looks like it's not
clumping up too easily like it's just
very precise and kind of delicate soft
lashes which I like sometimes or until
the spidery kind of thing but this is
nice it really doesn't clump up as you
can see it's just kind of like yeah do
you want to say so
you
yep this one is nice it's a very very
small easy to apply seems like the
formula is pretty good I haven't made a
mess out of my eyelid yet which is crazy
because I always do with mascara so
let's do the other side
even when I go down on the lashes um
they don't clump up with this mascara so
that's pretty cool because that's
normally most of my mascaras will clump
up if I do that so cool
so very nice feathery lashes I don't
even think I want to apply another coat
I like this I think this is pretty
especially with the eyeshadows so I'm
going to leave it at that I like this
mascara definitely so far and I guess
now we are on to the lips the last thing
so going to wake them down make sure
there's nothing on there I like to take
my towel you guys probably think i'm so
sleepy just like being clean okay
alright so next I am just going to go
ahead and use the two lip products that
are in here which is the tint which is
in romantic the lipsurgence lip tint and
then on top of it i'm going to apply the
gloss and this is in visionary so
they're pretty like similar in color and
i think that was the point of that so
let's apply this
the nice color
so my lips have been dry as heck lately
and this just felt like butter going on
which all the lip surgeons do so it's
nice that I can wear something like this
today so that's the color of the lip
surgeons I'm going to let it kind of set
before I apply that gloss on top I like
it very creamy and tunnels like a I
would say like a dark portal who is it
be with me on that you could dark coral
color that's what I'm seeing it's really
really interesting i'm interested i'm
really interested in the colors that
they use like you know blush that they
picked these i feel like these are very
like they almost kind of go together ah
but yeah it's interesting doing
interesting i feel like everything
really fits together well especially
with the eye palette because the eye
palette has all of those colors in it so
yeah i'm seeing it now so the finger
test all right i'm going to apply to
blast this is visionary and apply this
on top
mm-hmm I don't like that each time I dip
in there and pull out like it takes
extra product out onto the cat part I
don't like that but these are definitely
pretty colors together that's for sure I
would say the lipgloss gives the sheen
kind of picking up on a pinky purple
sheet in there which you can see in
there and then the color is coming from
the romantic lip tint so now I'm going
to go back to my shadows because you
guys know I like to touch up and make
sure that everything is okay there's no
excess like mascara running so i take
another clean i have like a bajillion of
these so i take another clean Sigma e-40
blending brush and I'm just going to
make sure that there were no little
leftover marks of mascara up there or
below and it looks like it's pretty good
i'm going to take this little brush from
Ecotools i like to run this here kind of
on my cheek to make sure there's no
fallout I don't see any fallout with
these shadows but um you know you never
know you never know what the palette so
anyway this is the look i got i really
really love the palette i think the
palette is like or just the colors in
here are just stunning um you know they
got those nice like neutrally gold
ischia whatever love it I think it's
beautiful I think they chose an
interesting cheek color it's almost like
it's not completely universal to every
skin shade for me if I had applied more
it would have looked over done just
because I have a fair complexion um but
it is a beautiful color like if you have
a middle-range kind of skin tone or
things like that I think it would look
just absolutely gorgeous on you so not
to worry about that alright so this is
the look
I think it's very pretty with like the
kind of neutralized and then um you know
these kind of almost Coralie lips i want
to say coral colored so I like that a
lot I'm very interesting so I hope you
guys enjoyed this get ready with me
video i will be using this throughout
the week this little kit and i will
probably be ready to give a full full
review on the whole set probably by the
end of the week so um I will continue
using it and I'll let you guys know what
I think when it comes to review time so
thanks so much for watching see you next
