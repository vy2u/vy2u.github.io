is all wet as you can see I have my
Turbie twist on if you're wondering what
that is and I'm gonna do my makeup and I
thought I do get ready with me kind of
been doing this about the past couple of
days every time I just put my makeup on
so you can just film it um so today I'm
just going to be using a few like I
would say drugstore singles like for
eyeshadow some essence you know some
Maybelline I'm not going to use a
palette or anything I just kind of
picked out these colors and I'm excited
to use them so let's just get started
the first thing I'm going to do is prime
my face with the Napoleon autopilot pre
foundation skin primer looks like this I
really like this because it actually
feels like a gel moisturizer and my skin
is little dry today so I need this and
I'll bring us even everywhere I just saw
my eyelids everywhere I love the smell
of this stuff smells so good alright
once I've done that I'm just gonna let
it kind of sit in and sink in quickly
all this stuff smells so good you guys
seriously all right I like that have
kind of set and sunk into our skin
nicely I am going to go in with my um I
think oh the hair does i was thinking
where's my concealer i'm going to use
the l'oreal visible lift blur concealer
my color is 301 fair i'm just going to
find it under my eyes and anywhere that
i have some leftover acne scars hi jack
hey hey yaoi again she's gonna Pat that
in I love this I really like the visible
lift line from l'oreal but i really love
this concealer it's so like a heavy duty
but the same time feels so light weight
and it doesn't sink in to like you know
crevices or it doesn't like cake up the
skin and look like you're wearing
concealer i'm filming a video right now
to act i can't talk to you right there
just kind of dabbing these this on the
areas that I kind of wanna cover up not
patting it in cuz I'm going to do that
with a sponge in a second so I like this
too because it doesn't set to quickly so
you can kind of just sit with it like
you know on your face without any
worries but you can see how much that
really brightened up my eyes already
just what I really like so I'm just
going to take this little sponge here I
got like a set of them like this from
Sephora just going to take it and just
blend in where I did the concealer I
like these because they're angles and
they're easy and get into that area my
Beauty Blender is just to around
by the way this is not damn it is just
completely dry
okay once i'm finished blending that in
i'm just going to go ahead and use my
foundation today I'm using the covergirl
Ready Set gorgeous fresh complexion
oil-free foundation my sheet is 105 just
going to shake it up a little bit
probably like that amount just kind of
got that on my face then I'm going to
take my Real Techniques expert face
brush which you guys know my favorite
for foundation I'm gonna didn't end that
in
take a little extra back of my hand Deb
that in go over there areas where I need
some extra coverage
I do like this foundation I think have
good coverage but I like all my
foundations from the l'oreal visible
lift or just whatever visible line or
whatever better because they're kind of
like anti-aging and so they're really
silky and like light on the skin some
feels a little heavier but cover girl
has some really amazing coverage in
their foundations it was pretty awesome
finding off my head so once I've blended
that in I'm going to go back with a
sponge again and just Pat in the areas
where we don't want it to Greece or
anything kind of pushing that foundation
into the skin so it sets itself even
without a powder all right next I am
just going to take my where is it
there's my favorite little there's a
blending brush and I'm no idea where it
is so I'm just going to take this and
blend it into my hairline you got to
know I prefer those like pointy tipped
pointy tip duh like foundation don't
shake brushes to blend into my hairline
but I'll have to do because i actually
did clean my makeup brushes last night
so they're all laying out cleans I can't
grab them there in the kitchen alright
so once I've done that I'm going to go
ahead and set this um I am going to use
the essence all about Matt setting
powder I have really just been in total
just in general essence I just got into
the ground but I do like this so it's
nice very very cheap too I'm going to
use my ELF kabuki it's like fated their
iPad forever and I'm just going to take
this and I'm going to Pat that into the
skin
setting everything that we just conceal
this definitely gets rid of shine very
quickly i like that i would say if
you're a darker complexion be careful
because um I don't know I feel like
sometimes this does leave a tiny bit of
a white cast on my face so if it leads
on on my face probably leave one on
people with darker skin I'm pretty pale
so I'm surprised might just be the way
I'm applying it to I like to like Pat it
instead of like use a fluffy brush just
let my powders though okay take it down
wind up blend into my ear pulling up my
hair you know these Turbie twist are
nice they really actually keep your hair
out of your face maybe I need to shower
more in the morning start doing now I'm
Robin so um after i'm done with that i'm
just going to take a baby wipe you guys
know i can't stand the feeling of having
powder on my lips or under huge so
ready next I am going to use Oh like I
said yesterday well i just posted the
video i think this morning but yesterday
i did he get ready with me and i was
really tired and I totally forgot i said
i was going to be using this palette and
i totally forgot so using it today this
is the bhcosmetics 10 color blush
palette it's like the professional blush
palette or whatever and these are the
colors i'm going to be going into that
color right there today I want anything
too pink so I'm just going to take this
brush right here and just dab into that
put on the apples of my cheeks and these
are all I believe they look very very
mad so I am going to apply some
highlighter after this i think you have
shimmer it's very very small amounts so
it's a nice color like that blending
easily to keep playing without a little
bit can review and so want to see you
guys so then i'm just going to go back
with my kabuki and just Pat over to make
sure there's no harsh lines and if I
apply it a little too much I can just
kind of absorb it back up all right next
I am going to highlight I am going to be
using the laura geller highlight in
Golden Rose this is their baked
highlighter it looks like this her baby
I hi later I'm going to be taking time i
use my elf studio fan brush just going
to lightly kind of swirl in there
definitely blow off don't want to apply
too much highlighter on one's the bridge
of my nose even a little bit into my
forehead to the center of it under my
brow
and then I'm going to take it and just
go right on the apples of the cheeks
does he get a nice glow to the skin
alrighty next I am going to highlight
around my eyes of what I'm going to use
for that is this natural I light eye
brightener oh this is from physicians
formula it looks like this really weird
little packaging so chunky that's what
it looks like it's got all these
different like colors in it and it just
kind of color corrects like the eyelid
so I'm going to use the Real Techniques
setting brush now I like this just to
apply all over the lid up to the brow
and help to brighten things up on the
inner corner to even take it a little
under not too much because it is a
little sparkly but once we have make up
there it won't be as visible so I think
that's really nice it just kind of
brightens up the eye without having to
add tons of more like concealer or
something like that
alrighty afternoon and with that I am
going to go ahead and um well first I
want to put a baby lips on this is the
peppermint one it's just clear it is
with sunscreen SPF 20 just start um you
know moisturizing my lips so that
they're ready by the time I get to the
lip liner and the lipstick or lip pencil
and amusing so I have a little time to
absorb that's a really nice little gleam
nice finish all right all right I am now
going to go and use my eyeliner I'm
going to be using the well no actually
first I'm going to spoil you out my
brows and take care of those first I've
gotten back into the habit of using my
Milani like what is this this is just
the shaping wax I like this this really
does keep my brows in place I like to
just kind of glide it over the top not
like pushing just kind of gliding over
and then I go back in with my spoolie
and just make sure that there's no like
lumps of wax in there this really will
hold your brows in place all day it's
very nice i like that right
yeah a little spot there if all we
should fill it in but i am not going to
I've not filled in my brows for quite a
while now but um I am going to do a
video on specific like brow products for
blonde people because it's very hard to
find a brow product that matches like
your you know your hair color and your
skin tone are things like that but
anyway alright I'm going to move on to
eyeliner now I'm going to use the NYC
Kohl eyeliner pencil in nine to six
white I'm just going to line my
waterline see me looking over here I
have a mirror so
and then I'm going to tightline
just make sure that whole water line is
coated with a nice white color so after
i'm done with that I am going to go
ahead and highlight my brow bone what
I'm going to be using for that today is
the elf smudge pot in what is this aight
that sweet looks like this it's kind of
like the color of my shirt and I'm just
going to put that right under my brow
bone I'm literally just going to Pat it
in with my finger give some nice lift
there and these are super easy to blend
super super creamy either sign
okay so it's all kind of like a pinky
gleam and I really really like that I
like the way it like picks up the actual
color um and next I'm going to just set
that just because i do have oily skin I
don't want it rubbing off so i'm going
to set that i'm just going to use the
Maybelline chic naturals in champaign
fizz it's just a single color just take
that with this what is this concealer
flourish whatever I use this as like a
blending brush hold onto so alright just
going to go over that area so we're
going to have a lot of light under the
eyebrow but it's very very pretty I'm
going to go to the inner corner can
never be too right there okay once we
set that um I am just going to use oh
another cream product yes this is going
to be kind of like my eyeshadow base
this is the color tattoo from Maybelline
this is in inked in pink it looks like
this it's just gorgeous gorgeous shade
and it really matches the eyeshadow i'm
going to be using so i'm just going to
take that on my finger and dab the on my
lid basically all the way up to the
crease
like so give it a few seconds to fully
set and then I am going to go in with my
eyeshadow color that I'm going to be
wearing on my lid and that is the
essence metal glam I shadow in a frosted
Apple it looks like this so very very
similar to the inked in pink and with
this I'm just going to take my finger
again and just Pat that on to my eyelid
it's really gonna stick to that inked in
pink that makes a really nice like
sticky base I like this one because it's
got nice like gold and shimmer and it's
just a really interesting color when I
first got it I had to like work through
like a layer of just like gold on the
top it's kind of weird but now it's a
really beautiful color so if you can see
really really gorgeous a little more out
here make sure the whole eyelid is
coated and after we do that I am going
to go ahead and take the other eye
shadow single this is also at the
essence metal glam I shadow single it
also had that weird layer but with
silver is not but anyway this isn't the
color coffee to blow and I'm just going
to work this into my crease and those
will be the only two colors i'm going to
be using today for eyeshadow so very
very quick i'm going to be using my ELF
crease brush I think this is a new brush
from them it's nice because it's nice
and small it really gets right up in
there so start working that into my
crease I feel like it's such like a
golden pink color just love that
eyeshadow especially with the inked in
pink they go together so well
all right now I'm going to blend that
out I'm just going to take that whatever
this is out flawless concealer brush
whatever its fluffy and big so I'm going
to use it to just blend these colors
together
there are left with kind of this like
pink smokey look but we have a really
nice highlighted brow so it doesn't look
like sickly by any means okay next I'm
just going to go and use my eco tools
like finishing brush and just run
underneath kind of just swipe make sure
there's no fallout underneath and then I
am going to go ahead and let's here take
my voluminous smoldering eyeliner from
l'oreal i have not tried this yet this
will be against my first impression on
this right now today I'm going to bring
my mirror a little closer to me just to
case it's not as easy as it looks on the
packaging so just going to apply this to
my upper lash line oh it's not as soft
as I thought I'd be I'll goodness okay
well okay
hmm not as perfect as I would like you
have to break it in a little bit
oh well we'll work with its more figure
something out
that would be so easy because it's so
thick but it's just like kind of a
little more texture than I thought it
would be I'm used to doing like a liquid
my upper lash line so I don't love the
way that turn out but what I'm gonna do
is just go ahead and take my finger and
pat on the eyelid kind of like a blur
any harsh lines I might have made like
so all right Jack yelling again next I'm
just going to go back in I just want to
blend a little more here very happy with
that eyeliner huh well you'll find
another use for it who knows so um next
I'm going to go ahead and curl my
eyelashes just going to take this hi
jack why are you going so vocal all
right kind of like pumping it like this
instead of just holding it cuz then
sometimes you get a weird curl where it
just kind of crimps the lashes it
doesn't actually curl it Jack stay out
of the camera jack he knows he's not
allowed up here by my makeup up there's
his tail should get ready with me oh my
gosh Jack don't head butt this down come
here Jack come here oh goodness oh my
God he's gonna make a mess just state it
Jack Jack you're too big for this here
Oh Jack holderness open it Jack oh my
god like an earthquake over here okay
down yeah down good boy goodness secured
me I was worried on the makeups and come
crashing down I can just see it you guys
can see it happening alright so after we
do that the next thing I am going to do
is crawl
why are you called my lashes i'm going
to put back on so i'm going to use my
Jordana best / extreme volumizing
mascara and i'm just gonna find nice
coat of this all over this is like a
really good go to drugstore mascara like
I know it's always going to work well
and do what I want for my lashes so you
get so little in between one's right
there at the side like the corner of the
eye which I like the only other mascara
I have found that does that is the Too
Faced better than sex and I love both
these mascaras only because they do that
really well all right to the other eyes
the back of the lashes especially this
math girl really really make them like
volumize if you hit the back of the
lashes with this I think it's just the
way the brush is shaped it just like
does it so stuff just going to take my
spoon quickly and just like run to right
here what you saw um make sure it's not
too exampie the backs on the other side
I find this map here I was very
buildable to like once I apply one layer
and I put another one on like I see a
difference again when I apply the second
layer sometimes the mascara you don't
see that it's just like looks the same
or it looks just bursts and clunkier but
this one you definitely can see that
volumizing even more so I really like
that alright done with the mascara love
that oh so volumizing what I look for in
a mascara so all right let's go on to
the lips while bi makeup sex so I'm
going to be using this lip liner from
NYX this is in MPL 18 peony looks like
this it's got a little bit of gleam to
it I thought it kind of matched what I
had done with the eyes so just going to
line all the way inside my lip go little
outside my narla with line my lips up go
over my cubic law
all right once I do that I am going to
go in with the lip color I'm going to be
wearing today which is oops clumpy
there's bothering me back um the one I'm
going to be wearing today is from Tarte
it is from that little like lipsurgence
set you know they have like what is it
one two three four for like six of them
or whatever plus two glasses this is in
this is one of the matte lip tints it
slip surgeon and it is in the color
alluring which kind of not just the eye
color again so
and even the matte ones like in this
collection are so creamy and nice on the
lips just feel so good love it finger
test alrighty now I'm going to go back
in and with my crease brush and just
blend that area guys know I like to do
this because when the mascara dries you
can just like flake it off and then you
also get a little more color in their
little more depth and then I'm going to
go back with that super super fluffy oh
I could have used this I guess but
whatever I likes that concealer brush
better all right go back with this and
really blend everything out under the
eye make sure there's not fall out under
there
alright and this is the look um so it
really is kind of nice and like pinky on
the eyes I think it's really pretty it's
got kind of a matching I almost like I
would say a neutral pink lip definitely
um these are definitely like neutrally
kind of pink colors but I think it's
really really pretty very very
flattering well let me brush my hair out
and get a better idea of what this will
look like so um sorry it's still pretty
wet and anyway so this is the look I
likes everything I did not love what
would it were is it eyeliner like oh it
was very very like hard to work with I
thought smoldering eyeliner I thought it
would be really really creamy it's not
so i think i still prefer my liquid
liner this just looks a little it looks
a little uneven I'm not really happy
with that so um that's really the only
thing that I didn't like my absolutely
love these and I've been using these for
a couple weeks now but i love these
essence I shadows I really should have
gotten more colors they're just so
gorgeous like that pink one like for
real that and the color tattoo together
inked in pink these are like perfect for
each other so anyway um that was just my
kind of I guess a neutral pink kind of
you know look and I hope you guys
enjoyed this i'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
