guess you are seen this probably a
little later in the afternoon I am here
with mr. badger I know I showed Khaleesi
in a recent video this is my big boy I'm
a big ferret mr. badger he's just a big
mush I have done a video with him before
I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
cards if you would like to see it
but today what are you doing but today I
have a collab video to do with you guys
this is or a collab video that basically
is in collaboration with you guys as
well as my friend Samantha March here on
YouTube now Samantha and I have done
probably two or three collapse now or
maybe this will be the third one or wait
is this the second one it feels like
we've done a million because Samantha
and I have become very very close if you
don't know who I'm talking about I'm
talking about Samantha March here on
YouTube I'm gonna go ahead and leave her
channel as well as her Instagram as well
as her snapchat as well as we're video
down below so that you guys can go check
her out
I love Samantha we are very similar in a
lot of ways but at the same time we're
not and I just think we really a really
kind of bounce off each other nicely
it's funny I said the same thing about
me and Kaylee bounce when I was filming
our collab video for Monday but you just
feel that way sometimes sometimes you
just get to know somebody you feel close
to them immediately and that's kind of
what happened to Samantha and I so I
love her for her honest opinions she
does a lot of wonderful like tutorials
on her channel she comes up with a lot
of interesting video ideas kind of like
I do so if you like more original
content I think you would love for a
channel but today we thought it would be
fun to go ahead and do a video testing
out our subscribers favorite makeup
products so I picked up some cruelty
free makeup products from the drugstore
as well as some high-end ones I know
mister sperm you are me I know we picked
up some drugstore as well as high-end
makeup products to try out and that are
some of your guys's favorites and we're
just gonna go ahead and get right into
it
alrighty guys got you zoomed in a little
closer here so you can see at my face up
close and personal I did actually film
this video yesterday and this was
supposed to be sort of like a first
impressions video like Samantha trying
out some of her subscribers favorite
makeup and me try not obviously your
guys's favorite makeup but unfortunately
the whole entire footage that I filmed
yesterday like all 23 minutes was super
super blurry except for the last clip
which was completely in focus
I'm filming this on my Canon EOS Rebel
t5 if you guys didn't know there is no
viewfinder on this so if I'm out of
focus I'm screwed so what I'm
going to be doing is going ahead and
doing this kind of in chunks and then I
will just clip some pieces together to
make sure I am in focus but like I said
I did a phoneless yesterday so
technically this isn't first impressions
but it's second impressions and I kind
of have a feel for some of these
products so let's go ahead and jump
right into it and starts with the
hangover three-in-one replenishing a
primer and settings bright super
early in the morning and this is from
Too Faced you guys to get four fluid
ounces a product in here which is a
really nice amount and I'm just gonna
miss this on two of my face now it seems
like twenty-two of you we're
recommending this I believe it was
twenty or twenty-two of you and I felt
like yesterday didn't do much for me as
far as primer is concerned but it really
was a nice setting spray so it smells
exactly like the hangover RX primer but
this was something I never tried I think
I showed this in an anti haul but
because so many people are recommending
it I did pick it up and so far so good
so that is the first item now let's go
ahead and jump into eye primer I am
going to jump into the Marc Jacobs
undercover perfecting coconut eye primer
now I was really surprised with this
yesterday I thought it was really oh
really was good for my shadows they
adhered so nicely throughout the day
this is actually a really really
interesting consistency it's not too
heavy but it's also not too sticky which
is something that I really like with eye
primers I don't like eye primers that
are crazy sticky because then I feel
like I really have to blend a forever
and I would rather have like fading and
creasing throughout the day than having
to blend my eyeshadows for a good 15 to
20 minutes in the morning that's just me
everybody is different but I do very
very realistic everyday friendly sort of
makeup so yeah anyway I'm just patting
this on it smells like creme brulee and
first impressions wise like I said I
felt like my eyeshadow lasted a very
long time yesterday and it looked really
good so so far I'm very happy with this
I think there were 18 people that
recommended this eye primer which is so
cool I had never even heard of this so
that is the Marc Jacobs undercover
perfecting coconut eye primer alright
guys now we're gonna go ahead and jump
into concealer the one that was so
highly recommended was this one right
here can you guys believe I've never
tried anything from the photo focus line
from retina while that's crazy right so
this is the photo focus concealer in the
shade
light I agree it matches me really
really well yesterday so I'm going to go
ahead and put this on underneath my
foundation now you may be wondering if
it Maps you so well why are you going
under your foundation with it well
initially it Maps me so well and then
yesterday I noticed is starting to
oxidize so when I put it on top of my
foundation it just didn't really look
great so I'm gonna go ahead and just do
it under my foundation since it start to
get a little dark around the eye area
and yeah I'm just taking a little bit to
write on the inner corner of my eye as
well as underneath and then I'm gonna do
a little bit of spot concealing with
this as well I thought this looked
really really pretty on the skin badger
stop it I can hear him scraping at the
door I thought this looked really really
pretty on the skin but it doesn't really
pick up a huge amount of product at once
so I just wanted to give you guys a
heads up but I do like it and I think
it's good so let's go ahead and blend
that in with a damp sponge I am taking
my NYX HD blending sponge and I am just
going ahead and tapping that I'm trying
to be careful around my eye area as
always because I'm always just
pulling my skin you guys I swear to god
I like beat my face look literally when
people say I beat my face like that's
that's exactly what I do
when I apply my makeup so I'm just going
ahead and blending that in and I would
say give the nice like a light to
possibly medium coverage it's really
pretty on the skin and it definitely
looks very skin light but like I said
this shape right here definitely darkens
up a bit I don't believe that this is
the lighter shade that you can pick up
so maybe that was my fault but that was
the latest one that they had at my
drugstore alright now let's go ahead and
jump into the wet and wild photo focus
foundation this shade was too light for
me yesterday it's called porcelain so
what I'm going to do is just apply a
little bit of this I'm going to add a
little oil as well and the reason for
that is because I felt like this looked
a little dry on my skin yesterday
especially in my t-zone and you know you
have dry skin when your t-zone looks dry
like Jesus Christ but I'm just having a
little bit like this and then I am going
to go ahead and add a drop of oil to the
sponge so this is the marula by john
paul selects oil and I am just taking
that and applying a one drop of that
directly to the sponge and then I'm
gonna go ahead and start blending this
foundation in I liked the way it looks
though accented I think that this was
just a really really nice kind of nap
full-coverage it looks like skin I felt
like my skin was breathable throughout
the day it didn't feel like it was heavy
or caked on but like I said this sheet
is a little too light I will be putting
on bronzer today so we don't have to
worry about that but normally I think
what I would do is use a mixer with this
so I would go in with my NYX Pro
foundation mixer in the shade of warmth
so anyway just blending that in plain
special close attention to the little
crevices around my nose because I feel
like I always get foundation kind of
caked up in that area but this looks a
lot better in the t-zone with the one
drop of oil the drop of oil trick is
just so good especially if you do have
more dryness again so I'm just blending
this in and then taking a little bit
down my neck as well I mean getting
pimples on my neck lately I think I have
like a hormone imbalance thing going on
it's kind of annoying I don't know if
it's related to lupus or not but it's
annoying
whatever it is alright so that is it for
our foundation now we're gonna go ahead
and jump into powder so for a powder I'm
jumping in again into one of your guys's
favorites there were 13 people that
recommended the Too Faced Born This Way
ethereal setting a powder so I'm gonna
go ahead and it take a little bit of
this into the lid I felt like this was
very a messy yesterday I just feel like
it's kind of weird I like that they have
a little cover here but the sifter
releases a lot of product at once now my
mistake with yesterday usually when I go
in with powder and I set my entire face
I like to stamp it on but I feel like it
was just too much and I looked at very
dry yesterday so what I'm gonna do is go
in with a really really fluffy brush
this is just the wet and wild kabuki
brush I'm gonna pick up the powder I'm
gonna tap it off I'm usually not a huge
fan of like loose powders like this
unless I'm baking because I feel like
they're just very very messy but what
I'm gonna do is basically just go in
circular motions which again normally I
don't do with powder but I have a
feeling that this one is just gonna look
the best this way because yesterday when
I stamped it on it looks so cakey and I
really wasn't a fan I was talking about
it on snapchat I said there was really
only one product that I didn't like that
you guys recommend it I mean how
if you guys watch me you have good taste
so I already knew I was gonna like a lot
of the products but this one right here
just looked very very cakey when I went
ahead and try to do you know like the
typical stamping motion I would do with
a powder I'm not really a huge fan of
loose powders I just feel like they're
messy they're unnecessary but this one
really does like give a nice kind of
airbrush look to the skin I feel like I
can get the same sort of look with like
a drugstore silica powder so I probably
wouldn't repurchase but I'm glad that
you guys recommended I try it out I will
definitely try it out for baking but I
just feel like that's kind of a waste of
product because this is so expensive and
obviously you're using quite a bit of
powder when you do bake but I will try
it out that way tomorrow all right so
while if my camera was kind of
recharging itself I went ahead and I did
apply a veil of the more more butter
bronzer all over my face with a clean
kabuki brush this one from up and up and
the reason why I did that was just
because like I said that foundation was
a little too light for me so I just
wanted a light dusting and I really
concentrated it on my cheeks and now
we're gonna jump into a blush so this is
from Physicians Formula autonomy we're
recommending the NARS blush is the Too
Faced blushes at Physicians Formula
blushes I already have a NARS blush in
the shade orgasm I have all six of the
love flush blushes from Too Faced so the
last thing that was luck were some
Physicians Formula blushes I do own both
the more and more butter blushes and I
also own be happy booster blushes so
this is the only one I didn't have it is
called the mineral aware talc free and
mineral airbrushing blush with SPF 30 in
the shade natural I'm gonna go in with
my morphe brush right here it's a morphe
angled blush brush and we're just gonna
go ahead and put this on I should have
picked up a little more of a densely
brush today when I washed my brushes
last night I wanted to get a little more
of a densely packed brush because first
impressions wise with this brush
yesterday I did feel like I wasn't
getting a ton of pigment now could just
be the actual blush because
Physicians Formula blushes really don't
have a huge amount of pigment to them
they're very nice if you are more like
fair-complected
unfortunately a physician's formula is
just one of those brands that doesn't
really cater to a deep skin tones in my
opinion they really cater to medium skin
tones but their blushes and their
highlighters and stuff cater more
towards fair skin tones anyway long
story short I feel like you do have to
kind of build this up on the cheeks but
sometimes that can be good if you do
have a really fair complexion now
I feel like this formula is a little bit
on the scratchy side it almost feels
sticky but it's a beautiful color and
because it does have SPF 30 in it I
can't take this on my vacation we are
heading a to Hawaii next week I will
have a video going up every other day
while I'm gone so don't worry about that
but ah yeah so that's what it looks like
on the skin have a little bit of a glow
it is very pretty
now we're gonna jump into highlighters
and again this would be most recommended
a highlighting product from the
drugstore all the other highlighters
that you guys were recommending I
already own I think that was kind of the
hardest thing with this particular video
was that I did own a lot of the stuff
you guys are recommending so I tried my
best to go out and find products that
I've never tried before but this is from
Physicians Formula it's called the
bronze booster shimmer strobing palette
and it's just adorable packaging I've
heard great things about this it reminds
me a lot of the Jaclyn hill trio that I
have in my collection from two years ago
with the shades pearl champagne pop and
blush copper this looks like a dupe so I
will be doing a dupes video for you guys
soon I want to do about the light lip
palette I'll go ahead and do that Jaclyn
hill palette with this baby and I did
side by side swatches they're like
identical but yesterday I went in a
little bit with this lighter shade so I
think I'm gonna use the middle shade of
maybe the lighter shade today and kind
of mix those together and these went on
beautifully you guys they look amazing
on the skin really give a reflects and I
don't feel like they're chunky or have
glitter in them whatsoever so very
excited for that alright so let's go
ahead and jump in to a brows I'm taking
my color pop of brow boss and now every
single brow product that was being it
recommended to me was either not cruelty
free or it's a cruelty free option that
I already have in my collection so I
thought I'd just go with the brow boss
this has been my current favorite brow
pencil
anytime I make a mistake I just take the
spoolie like that but I'm basically just
brushing up my brows up and then filling
them in lightly at the arch as well as
at the tail and then the front part of
my brow this is how I like to do at my
everyday friendly is sort of brow if I
want any more thicker brow maybe I
should do a video like brows three
different ways because I have different
kind of brows that I like to do but this
is my everyday go-to very very quick
brow so anyway just filling that in I
think the brow products that everybody
was recommending there were some from
like
make up forever which make up forever
does test Ani animal so I didn't want to
pick it that up obviously but there are
also a few from there's actually one
from Milani I went to my drugstore and I
couldn't find it but I did look for it
but yeah there's apparently a really
good one from Milani now Milani does not
test on animals so I need to look a
little further into that to botana
anyway just filling in the front part of
my brow a lot of people are recommending
honest ah see I'm not a huge fan of
Anastasio brow products I know that's
what they're most famous for and most
like well known for but they're just not
to my favorites so make these a little
more even I always feel like my brows
look like sisters not twins you know
alright moving on it let's go ahead and
jump into some eyeshadow so the
eyeshadow palette that everybody was
recommending to me is the tardis pro to
go and originally i thought you guys
wanted me to get like the full size
palette but then everybody was saying no
get the tiny little one like these
shadows are really good and i have to
say i was so impressed when i was using
them yesterday this formula reminds me
of the new a tartlet toasted palette
alright guys so i am starting up by
taking the shaded drive i already
started to blend that into my crease
with my morphe and 5:11 and i'm
basically using this as a transition
shade but i'm taking it a little higher
and kind of going towards my eyebrow I
just noticed that taking shadows higher
looks better on at my eye shape so if I
want to put a little more effort in when
it comes to my eye shadow that's what I
like to do
alright now taking a morphe n5 thirteen
brush I'm gonna jump into the shade
Chris but which is this one right here
it's such a beautiful terracotta sort of
orange color it reminds me a lot of the
Tarte toasted palette and I did have
this on yesterday and I just loved the
color of this so I'm basically just
working it into the lower parts of my
outer V on each side and these shadows
definitely are a little powdery but it
kinda reminds me like I said of the new
Tarte toasted palette so if you love
this little thing you would love the
formula on the new Tarte toasted palette
so just kind of concentrating it like
that and then I'm gonna go in and blend
that out with a Murphy and four for one
can I pick out all my morphe brushes
that's funny I told you guys I don't
hate morphe brushes I just don't like
their makeup their actual brushes are
okay they're pretty scratchy and they
won't last you a long time you're better
off going with like I stick my brush
like for example this is my Sigma e35
brush I've had this in my collection for
like six years whereas the morphe
brushes you have to replace like every
year in my opinion but anyway I'm just
blending this back and forth so that we
can get a little bit of depth going on
in the outer V as well as in the crease
I'm doing small circular motions as well
as back and forth the only thing that I
feel like this is kind of missing it's
like an all-over brow color brow bone
color because the shade right here which
is called Drive is just too dark to wear
all over the lid and I do like placing
it down a brow bone color just so that
it makes everything easier to blend
alright my SD card filled out but what I
did next was go ahead and take this
little Urban Decay a vise a brush right
here I took the small smudger spot or
the small smudger side and I took the
shade crisp and I just kind of smoked
that out on my lower lash line and now
I'm going in with a sigma e35 brush and
I'm just going to blend everything
together and I kind of wanted to do
something a little more warm tone since
I went for the cooler tones yesterday so
I really like this I love the way that
this palette blends I think it looks
amazing on the eyes I mean it's so
similar to the Tarte toasted palette so
if you really like this little mini
palette you would love that one but
anyway just going ahead and blending
everything together I've had this Sigma
brush literally for ages I'm surprised
it hasn't like falling apart on me but
now I think we'll go ahead and take this
shade right here which is a beautiful
gold called hype and I'm just gonna go
ahead and tap that right onto my Lydia's
that pigment and I'm just going ahead
and tapping that onto my lid I prefer to
use my finger when it comes to stuff
like this because I feel like it goes on
a wet day I'm in your face you know what
I mean so I'm just going ahead and
tapping that right onto the lid and then
I think we will jump into mascara and
eyeliner so as far as eyeliner is
concerned there was this really cool
eyeliner that you guys recommended to me
from wet-and-wild it is so good this is
called the on edge long wearing eye
pencil in your the yang you guys this
went on so beautifully do see this
pigment and like one swipe that's all
you need I mean do you see that and it
really makes the eyes look defined and I
feel like it really brings out my blue
eyes so I'm just going ahead and putting
that right on to the waterline and now
we will jump right into a mascara
alright so for mascara I was feeding a
ton of recommendations for the essence
lash princess or for the wet and wild
lash renegade I was only able to find
this one and I thought the formula was
so cool yesterday this is kind of like a
sticky formula it's very hard to
describe but the wand is like a little
medieval torture device and I really
feel like this gives a great volume I
feel like it gives great length it's
kind of like a trifecta product
I remember seeing someone doing it first
impressions on this and their lashes
looked incredible and then I kind of
forgot about it and never picked it up
but but the little ball tip is great for
the lower lashes and then the upper
lashes you could just put the whole
entire wand there but I love the way it
looks I don't know how to describe the
formula like I said it's kind of like a
sticky tacky formula the strangest thing
ever but it really lasted all day long
yesterday it didn't flake it's between
like a wet mascara as well as they dry
mascara and I just lucked the way it
looked if you do like clumpy lashes I
think this is going to be a mascara you
will like if you do not like a more
clumpy lashes or more like out there
kind of lashes you probably wouldn't
like this but I might get back in and do
one more coat here because I do like
them clumpy and then I'm gonna go ahead
and jump into lip products but yeah I
feel like this mascara is really really
nice thank you so much for the
recommendation you guys cuz this was
like two dollars at my drugstore it was
an amazing deal alright so that is it
for mascara and finally guys we just
have lip products and this is from
Burt's Bees this is one of their
lipsticks in the shade
wait a splash and so many people are
recommending this particular shade it
kinda reminds me a little bit of what is
it called touch of spice from Maybelline
it's just a beautiful beautiful nude
color and I really really like it so
there it is super super pretty you might
need a lip liner with this one it did
kind of travel outside my lip line
yesterday and I'm not great at applying
lip product in the first place I mean I
never am because I'm just gonna practice
my flute at the end of the day and it's
gonna look like crap anyway but that is
it and this is like whole entire face
using a makeup products that are some of
your favorites I hope you guys enjoyed
this video make sure to go check out
some Miatas video thank you so much for
collabing with me samantha and yeah
that's pretty much it I will see you
