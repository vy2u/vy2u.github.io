video is going to be a review and demo
which is why I have my hair pulled back
so I don't get crap all over my hair I'm
queen of headbands here right guys
literally every video you notice where a
headband anyway welcome back to my
channel today we are doing a review in
demo like I said on a new product from
glam glow this is the dream duo
overnight transforming treatment aka
their new sleeping mask which I was so
excited about I jumped on that right
away if you've been watching my channel
for a while you know I'm a huge fan of
glam glow and in general I just find
that their ingredients and the
ingredients that they put on their
products basically really really work
well for my particular skin so I
purchased this for $59 on the support
comm website you can also get it on the
glam glow comm website I will link down
below in the description bar where you
guys can pick them up if you are
interested this is supposed to be good
for normal oily combination dry and
sensitive skin so pretty much every
single skin type can use this and it's
supposed to give you hydrated skin event
basically you wake up with soft smooth
sexy complexion they always say that
sexy sexy sexy so anyway it's supposed
to help with fine lines and wrinkles
dryness dullness and also uneven texture
so the claims like I said are just to
give you glowing dumping radiance smooth
a moisturize skin and this is what the
outer packaging looks like it's really
cool kinda reminds me of the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills um what is it the Mon Cala
Boca it's got that like kaleidoscope
sort of thing going on really really
cute and on the back it shows you all of
the ingredients and how to use this
particular product so when you open this
packaging up it says hello sexy and then
it just gives you again the ingredients
and then your little actual sleeping
mask is put right there so this is
supposed to be really really good if you
have like a big event or something and
you want to wake up the next day with
really really soft glowing smooth skin
and I have to agree I think that this
really does make you makeup ready and
they literally put that claim right on
the front of the box is supposed to
basically prep your skin for makeup and
I have to agree I used it last night and
I love the way this makes my skin look I
have used it I think four or five times
now and every time that I wake up in the
morning I'm just really really impressed
with how smooth and like soft my skin
feels I do think it is helping a little
bit with discoloration not like a ton
but I do notice that my acne scarring
along my
and also this area where I have a huge
ginormous pimple right now is really
kind of like calming down the redness
isn't it like as you know abrupt or as
obvious on my skin and I just feel like
things look a little more evened out if
you guys have been watching my channel
this week you know that I've actually
been in a lupus flare up so for me to
actually have like really evened out
skin tone right now is kind of like a
miracle so this has been really really
helpful for that I would say I was very
very surprised that this was helping so
much with discoloration I really thought
it would be more of moisturizing
products and it definitely does
moisturize but it really does help take
color take care take color and take care
of discoloration as well on your face so
anyway you are getting like a two-step
treatment in here here is what the outer
packaging looks like very very similar
to their new mega illuminating
moisturizer you are getting two separate
on halves in here and each is 0.68
ounces or 20 ml so when you open it up
and when I say separate halves this is
what I mean
so each side has 0.268 ounces of product
in it so you are getting quite a bit in
here in total and you do have this
little separator between the actual
serum and also these seals so they call
this these um serum and this is called
the pearl serum and this is how they
basically describe it numbers one which
is step one is the pearl serum and it
says it is a melt in serum with green
coffee and green tea leaf tea oxide it
has antioxidants and supercharged
essential vitamins that provide an eat
less even flawless complexion and you
put that on your skin you wait about 30
seconds and then you go in with the
dream seal which is that more dark gray
color and the dream seal is basically
supposed to seal all that moisture in
and it says it is a nourishing moisture
boost of hyaluronic acid and mozuku
green algae that plumps and recharges
the skin and gives like a nice luminous
complexion basically so I really think
this is quite a nice mask if you guys
smell it it smells exactly like the mega
illuminating moisturizer which kind of
smells like lemon cake so if you like
that sound kind of like orange or
citrusy lemony kind of cake smells you
would definitely like it I feel like all
glam glow products definitely smell good
but that is something about glam glow
that if you have really really sensitive
skin all of their products are fragrance
but anyway it smells really really good
and I have been enjoying this quite a
bit when I first got it
think about anything that special you
guys I was just kind of like yeah some
nice product I remember posting about it
on Instagram and the first night that I
used it I really didn't notice that much
of a difference it's not one of those
products that you use like one night in
a row and it's good to go
although over night masks are kind of
used for that you know maybe you use
them if you don't want to do your
skincare at night or if you're just
gonna put one thing on your face at
night it's smart to at least go in with
a sleeping mask but I noticed that it
gets better with time so if you are to
use this two or three nights in a row
you really start to notice a big
difference in your skin like I said the
biggest thing that I noticed was not
only like a moisture boost I really
noticed a difference with discoloration
which I thought was really interesting
because this kind of claims to be more
of like a boosting like glow sort of
thing kind of like the mega illuminating
moisturizer I know I keep bringing it up
but it's supposed to give you really
luminous skin this particular product is
and I felt like this was going to go
hand in hand with that and just give you
really nice plump glowing skin but I
have to say it's actually helping with
discoloration which is really cool which
is why I think it is a good option for
practically every single skin type like
they claimed I do think you would like
this a little more if you do have dry
skin or aging skin and you really want
to plump up like fine lines and wrinkles
but if you do have comber or oily skin
like I do although it may feel a little
tacky and a little too moisturizing at
nighttime when you wake up in the
morning and you wash it off it is going
to help with discoloration and things
like that and people who do have combo
or oily skin tend to have a little more
discoloration just because we tend to
deal with a little more breakouts so a
really really nice option for a lot of
different skin tones not skin tones but
skin types and obviously any sort of
skin tone but I think it's actually a
really really interesting mass so I
would say this is very comparable to the
origins drink up intensive mask now like
I said the first night I use this I
would like this have nothing on my
origins drink up intensive overnight
mask I was like it's not as good it's
not as moisturizing it doesn't smell as
good like I love that drink up it just
hit overnight Matt so at first I was
just like there's no way it's not as
good but I noticed that the more that I
used it like if you use it two or three
days in a row it really really will
start to make a difference in your
actual skin and I wanted those people
again I do see a difference when I use
glam glow products so I did want to kind
of touch on that because I tend to
relate my skin tends to really enjoy the
ingredients
they put into their actual products now
everybody has like a certain brand they
just can't hang with for me it's a fee
no like no matter what any time I use
the Vino products like my skin breaks
out it looks really really bad and I
have heard of a few people that really
just can't tolerate the actual
ingredients in glam glow products but I
will say I looked at the ingredients
list on this and I compared it to you
all of my other treatments or masks and
they are quite similar so if you are
someone who has tried a lot of the glam
blow math and they didn't work for you
this one might not work for you but if
you do tolerate the glam glow
ingredients and you see a difference
like I do I think this is definitely an
item that you should pick up now
overnight mask a lot of people use them
just like once a week or twice a week
like I said I feel like the more you use
this the better it kind of like helps
with your skin so I would recommend
using this two or three times a week
they don't really specify on the back of
the box how often to actually use it but
I noticed a difference after using it
about three times in a row so that's
something that I would recommend for you
guys if you are going to go ahead and
use it at night only use this so
basically go and wash your face and I
don't put on a toner or anything like
that just go straight into this because
this is your serum this is your seal so
it's going to lock in the moisture so
basically and this is like a serum and
then this is like a moisturizer is if
that makes sense it's just a really
heavy duty oyster Iser um if you do have
really really dry skin like I said I
know a lot of people that use the drink
up intensive overnight mask
as an actual moisturizer it's just
basically a really nice way if you do
have very dry skin to kind of just give
your skin a very nice boost over time so
if you do want to use this as your
actual serum and moisturizer at
nighttime you can go ahead and do that
there's nothing in here that's going to
a groove eight your skin and that you're
not allowed to use every single day
again it doesn't give you like an actual
date or time like how much time you can
actually use it does that make sense
that made no sense you couldn't know
what I mean it doesn't say only use once
a week or only used twice a week you
definitely can use it as often as you
like but like I said I notice a
difference in two to three days um of
you know consistent use so anyway I do
think it's a really nice mask the actual
consistency is very very buoyant and
actually slightly sticky for the Pearl
which is this serum right here it
definitely has this pretty kind of like
kaleidoscope look to it again it's very
very glossy and it does catch the
a little bit but it smells really good I
feel like it goes on really nicely like
a serum should very very lightweight a
little on the slimy side which is what a
serum should be and then the actual like
seal part this is definitely a lot more
thick a little more tacky and I will say
when you use when you use overnight
masks you do notice that they are a
little more tacky they do feel a little
more greasy on the skin because they're
really going to give you a big moisture
boost so if you're not used to that and
you have really really like oily skin
you may not like this product because
this seal right here is like a thick ass
feel like it really really feels very
thick on the skin and it's not going to
I don't know it's not really going to
sink into your skin fully so you will
still wake up in the morning and you
will still feel a little bit of that
product I have noticed for me personally
with my combo to oily skin less is more
with this um but overall I think it's
really good and I like I said I think
it's very comparable to the origins not
the smell not the consistency I prefer
the consistency on the origins I prefer
the smell on the origins however the
actual way that your skin looks in the
morning I feel like the two of them are
very comparable if I were to compare it
to some of my other sleeping masks I
would say like my me zone which is like
an overnight white sleeping facial I do
prefer this I prefer the origins and
yeah I feel like just in general this is
a really really nice decent overnight
mask if you do have very very oily skin
I would highly recommend checking out
the Korres rose one but this is still a
really nice product so let's go ahead
and apply it shall we
I'm going to be using this little dual
sided glam glow thing here it has a
silicone applicator for your eye area
and then this area is just for you know
obviously applying your mass so I'm
going to dip into the pearl treatment
which is right there and I'm just going
to go ahead and put this all over my
face and I just like to put a small
layer on you guys because like I said
this is very very well this particular
side or this step is not super super
thick but the other one is and I feel
like less is more when it comes to this
so I am just putting this all over my
face very quickly it does not say
anywhere on the box that you can't use
this around your eye area however I did
use it the other night because I want it
to dry it out and it did sting a little
bit so I do not put it
my actual eye area but I do put it
everywhere else and sometimes I will go
over my lips as well so after you apply
of that first step which is that
lightweight sort of pearl serum which is
that one right there you want to wait
about 30 seconds and then you go in with
the seal and right away I can feel like
a little bit of tingling going on and I
think that that's like their T oxide who
knows what the hell T oxide is but they
have this particular like homemade
ingredient is pretty much all of their
treatment mask and I feel it with every
single mass I feel a little bit of
tingling right when I put any of their
mass on so that is what I am feeling
currently but after that kind of sinks
in a little bit I just dip into the
second part which is the seal right here
and this one's a little thicker so I do
want to use a little less product and
this is the one that you guys will be
able to kind of see on the face it's not
going to be like the glam glow um
gravity mud sorry if I'm looking the
viewfinder it didn't pull out a mirror
but it's not going to be like gravity
gravity mode where it looks like you're
like the Tin Man but this will leave a
little bit of a gray tint on your face
so if you really want to look like
you're not wearing anything on your face
then this is not going to be the product
for you because it will leave a little
bit of a gray tinge but overall you
really can't see it I mean most glam
glow masks you can actually see on your
face this one you kind of can't so and
that is what it looks like and
immediately when I apply the seal it
starts to feel a little warming and
tingling again kind of like in this area
around my nose and a little bit up
towards my hairline so I just wanted to
point that out again if you do have
really really sensitive skin and you are
sensitive to fragrance I don't think any
glam glow products are really going to
be that great for you because they
really are quite fragrant now I like
fragrance and fragrance doesn't seem to
bother my skin that much but yeah I just
want to go ahead and point that out
because they do write on the website
perfect for super sensitive skin and I'm
like I don't think any of your products
are that great for super super sensitive
skin because usually super super
sensitive skin has issues with fragrance
so that is what it looks like when it is
applied you can apply more or less
depending on what kind of skin type you
have if you're really dry skin you can
really really go in with the seal but
right now it just feels kind of warming
and tingling around my nose area around
my lips and around my
area and on the outer part of my
hairline so that is what it looks like
on this actual skin and what you do is
you just sleep with this overnight and
then in the morning you wash it off it
is still a little like thick and tacky
kind of feel it when you're washing it
off but overall I think it's a really
really good overnight treatment so I
would give this 4 out of 5 stars there's
the teacher and me talking about four
out of five stars but I really do think
it's a nice product I'm always pretty
much impressed with glam glow products
if you are someone who really does well
with their skin care items I think you
would enjoy this and yeah that is it
guys I hope you enjoyed this review and
demo thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
