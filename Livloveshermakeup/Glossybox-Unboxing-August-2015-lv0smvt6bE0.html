thank you so much for joining me today i
will be doing a unboxing of my colossi
box for the month of august yes august
2015 so i have not opened this yet i'm
just going to show you guys what's in
here and obviously go through the box
and just show you I don't know what they
put in here for the month of August so
let's get started this is what the
inside of the box looks like you get
your little card that shows all the
products that are in there and I will
talk about those as I go through the
products because they have a little
description and price and whatnot of
every single product so anyway let's
open it up and see what we've got for
this month I love velocity box i am not
affiliated with them in any way but i
personally just love this particular
subscription box I'm always very
impressed and very happy so yeah anyway
the first thing I see in here is the
delicios lip balm and it looks like it
says it has no parabens it's from
lollipops and it looks like this so
really really cute little packaging I'm
love to hear it seems like it smells
good let's see the consistency it's like
a very very um how would I describe that
like petroleum jelly sort of feel and it
looks like it is completely transparent
so let's read a little bit about that on
the pamphlet that they gave us it is
called the lollipops makeup lip balm a
summer necessity for the Sun worshipping
goddess and all of us this lip balm
protects against UV rays and pollution
with its paraben free formula it is also
rich in antioxidants which includes a
tap this sweet extra tip of sweet
extract tep ESS CEO hu ite extract a
Mexican plant known for its regenerate
regenerative capabilities and neutral
neutral tube macadamia nut oil so
chapped lips will be a thing of the past
and it says flavors will vary I don't
know what flavor I got it smells a lot
like cake oh so some kind of like
cupcake or some kind of cake or
something it smells really good like I
said it is completely transparent all
you can see is the little she
then at least behind but the full sizes
five dollars and fifty cents and that's
four point 33 ounces so it looks like
this is a full size so anyway um it says
here's a little tidbit about the brand
it says discovered by British colonists
during a botanical expedition in the
1800's in Brisbane Australia I'm sorry
it's not about the brand it's about
macadamia nut of the macadamia nut tree
served as a major resource for natives
throughout the winter due to their high
fat contact and skin healing properties
very cool so um little lip balm that is
the first thing in the box the second
thing oh I'm so excited about it is from
glam glow and I thought that this was at
the mask at the youth youth youth mud oh
my gosh I cannot see today the youth mud
mask but it's actually the youth cleanse
so this is that mud to foam youth
cleanse daily exfoliating cleanser I'm
so excited that this is in here because
I've been wanting to try this out um so
let's read a little bit about what it
says in here and this is a nice size
this is um let's see one ounce in here
and to the full sizes five ounces and
it's thirty nine dollars for the full
size so anyway it says the glam glow
youth cleanse youth cleanse daily
clearing cleanser designed to gently
exfoliate cleanse and renew skin to
create a more youthful glowing
complexion youth cleanse transforms from
a luxurious mud into a gentle and
effective foaming lather that dissolves
makeup and impurities and removes dead
surface cells so I'm really really
excited to try this out i have wanting
to try this out so if that's really fun
um and they have a little tip at the
bottom it says the tip is apply one to
two pumps of the cleanser to hand add
water and vigorously rub hands together
to create foaming lather applied to face
a mash-up massage all over skin so
really really excited to try that out
i'm going to start using this in the
morning i'm going to start tomorrow
morning so that will be really fun the
next thing I see in here is the Monica
dar a beauty simplified conditioning a
lash primer let's get it out of its
packaging here so I can show you guys so
it looks like it is a lash primer so it
is either something you apply it
night or nope it looks like it is the
kind of primer that you apply that has
like those nice little white fibers you
apply this before your mascara and it
helps create more voluminous lashes more
length thickness things like that so
that is the monopod our Beauty
simplified conditioning lash primer
let's read about what it says in here it
says retire those false lashes and debut
a fierce flutter by adding this lash
primer to your beauty routine acting as
a base for your mascara this primer
nourishes your lashes to prevent flaking
while ensure it ensuring your look stays
on from morning to night so the
full-size is 0 point 14 ounces which
this one is smaller or no I'm sorry this
is a full size and the full size is
twenty-four dollars so that already have
paid for the GlossyBox in itself so this
is a full-size and it says the little
tip at the bottom is after cleansing
your face at night comb formula over
clean lashes to wake up with fresh
condition lashes so actually it looks
like you can do this at night time as
like a lash um basically just a prime to
help condition the lashes you can use it
at night and then also before applying
your mascara so that's cool it's kind of
like a two-in-one the next thing I see
in here is a nail polish it is a very
very deep dark brown kind of plummy
color it looks really really nice
actually beautiful for fall coming up
and it is the spa ritual Nair nail
lacquer and it is vegan and the color is
I feel the earth move I feel the earth
move um so yeah that looks really really
nice and let's read a little bit about
that it has this awesome cool little
like um I don't know it feels like
Norris packaging the handle does and it
says the spiritual nail lacquer point
five fluid ounces which this is I
believe point five I want to say yes
this is full size is twelve dollars and
it's a slow down and channel your inner
sun with this creamy polish that
delivers a long-lasting manicure with
its patented specially designed brush
thanks to its a vegan thanks to its
begin respond
resource ingredients spot ritual is
ushering in a healthier way to paint
your nails without the harmful chemicals
colors will vary per box and it says the
little tidbit at the bottom is a for an
at-home spa experience start your
manicure off by dipping your hands into
warm paraffin wax to gently exfoliate
and relieve stress so anyway I'm really
excited um to try that out I think
that's a beautiful beautiful color I
don't know if it's completely picking
that but really really nice and the last
thing in my glossybox for the month of
August is the top of beauty kajal pen
and this looks like it is in black and
it'll City black so likes it black so
very very black eyeliner pencil and it
looks like it's kajal so it's going to
be really nice and creamy and it also
has a little um like smudger stick on
the other side so this is what it looks
like and let's read about it it says the
hot beauty kajal 10 institute black
point 3 ounces which that is is ten
dollars so that is a full-size it says
whether you want to create a rocker chic
smoky or the classic cat i take your
black liner to new heights with this
intensely pigmented kajal pencil these
smuggle matte formula glides on
effortlessly it can be used alone or
over eyeshadow to define the eye and a
tip says be place your pencil point in
the outer eye corner just under the brow
bone at the end of your eyebrow and draw
a delicate line from the outside into
the middle of your I laid into the
crease use the tip to diffuse the line
for an instant contoured smokey eye so
anyway those were the products that were
in a my glossybox for a fee month of
August when I opened it up and looked in
and saw that there was a new thing that
was like too big in the box so I was
like oh maybe it's not going to be that
great of a box but from reading a little
pamphlet that came with it it looks like
all of the items were basically
full-size this month and it definitely
you know the items definitely cost more
like in total then the box does to buy
it so I do think it's worth it i am
happy and i'm excited to use those
products
and I hope you guys enjoyed watching
this unboxing if you did please give
this video thumbs up and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
