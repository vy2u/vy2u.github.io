thank you so much for joining me as
always I hope you guys are having a
fantastic day this video is going to be
an unboxing on the December 2015
GlossyBox plastic box is 21 dollars a
month and i will leave a link below if
you guys are interested in starting your
subscription i'm not affiliated with
them in anyway so um yeah no I'm just
I'm not affiliated with them in any way
but I do kind of I guess pushed people
on GlossyBox because it is my all-time
favorite I love it so much I mean I
don't mean like push people on but you
know what I mean I always always suggest
it to my friends it is my favorite
subscription box that I get and I think
for 21 dollars a month you always get
some really really great products in
here so anyway let's just get started
I'm always very excited to unbox the
December boxes because they always make
them a little different instead of just
the plain like pink color they do like
snowflakes or holiday s kind of themes
and I just think it's absolutely
adorable so I always by the way I always
keep these boxes for makeup organization
skin care organization these are awesome
awesome little hard boxes to have like
the lids are awesome and I also like the
bottom half is awesome to store things
in anyway this is what it looks like on
the inside you can see on the top you
get a little ribbon and then the card
that tells you what is in your box which
i will read for you guys as we go along
and then tissue wrapping and this is
what this month's box looks like so the
first thing that I see is the oral gold
cosmetics hand cream and this has 70
grams or 2.5 ounces and I'm already
excited about this my mom actually uses
the oral gold a skincare brand and this
is quite a pricey item and this
definitely looks like it is a full size
so let's go ahead and read about what
they say in here it says the oral gold
24 karat gold hand cream it's true the
hands of the first part of the bodies to
show serious signs of aging that is very
true that and the neck I always think
what can you guys pick oral gold has
perfected the on-the-go moisturizing
cream with shea butter to instantly
soften and keep hands in tip-top shape
also has 24 karat gold in it a full size
is eighteen dollars and that is for one
ounce so actually that's not the full
size this is the full size 2.5 ounces
but um so if one ounce is around 18 I'm
guessing that this is probably around
thirty dollars so pretty pricey for a
hand cream and it's awesome that we get
such a big size it does have a tip here
it says when your hands need it most
combine this cream with cotton gloves
before bed and wake up with smooth
hydrated skin and it also has they enjoy
twenty five percent off your purchase of
any oral gold body care product with the
code glossy at Oracle cosmetics calm and
that offer is valid through January 31st
2016 so that's pretty awesome i'm
excited to try that the second thing
i've seen here is a full-size nail
polish this is from Color Club and this
is the nail lacquer in the shade
feverish it is a beautiful kind of
oxblood color it's definitely got that
red in there but then that really really
dark undertone which is almost like a
brownish I don't know kind of black
color so really really pretty kind of
like I said oxblood color let's read
about what they say it says the color
club in nail lacquer in feverish this is
point five fluid ounces which is a
full-size and it is eight dollars and
fifty cents that is what it retails for
it says capturing the quintessential
color of fall in a shiny glass bottle
this deep shade of red impart hints of
burgundy that allow your hands to create
a statement on their own pair with midi
rings to accentuate those fantastic
fingers and they do have a little tip at
the bottom it says always allow at least
two minutes between layers of polish if
you are going to build it up it says
this way each coat has enough time to
dry and your top coat can quickly seal
the deal so I'm excited to try this it's
right up my color our ally basically
right up my alley as far as colors go um
the next thing I see in here looks like
it's a mascara yep this is from mtj this
looks like a full size also this is the
high definition mascara in HD black it
looks like this and let's go ahead and
look at the wand because I'm always
curious oh nice what a cute want I love
the rubber bristle brushes and you guys
can see it's like several little like um
below like
I don't know it's like little circles
you know like the kind of like the ones
I don't know you see this a lot lately
like with rubber bristle brush wands
however most of them usually have liked
a little ball at the top whereas this
one has little tiny one going all the
way down so I'm really interested in
trying this out and I love that it's
obviously um I think it's pretty obvious
this is a full-size as well I love
GlossyBox for that because they it's not
just like samples that you get you
really do get full-size products a lot
of the time it says the mtj our
cosmetics a full size of this point 32
fluid ounces which that is is $21 so
that's a $21 mascara you are already
paying for the box in itself just by
getting that mascara it says who wants
raccoon eyes not us for all the drama
and none of the clumpy mess try mtj
cosmetics groundbreaking mascara it's
incredibly unique wand and creamy
formula combined to give you the lashes
that last and it says the tip is that
mascara typically dries out before half
a tube is finished hack alerts to make
yours last longer add three to four
drops of sailing I drops into the tube
stir brush and voilà and that is true
you definitely can do that with a lot of
products just by adding in like visine
or eye drops to kind of revamp the
formula you can do that with eyeliners
as well that start to dry out or cream
eyeshadows alright the next thing I see
in here is a hair product this is also
what i love about glossybox is that they
have the perfect amount of skin care
hair care and makeup in their boxes you
get a little bit of each so if you are a
huge beauty lover in general and you
just love all things beauty this is
definitely the box for you but anyway
this is the color pH Lex homecare leave
in treatment and detangler oh I'm so
excited you guys know my hair tangles
really easily so this is gonna be great
it says with color strengthening
technology it says helps the lawn
results last longer with color pH Lex
color flex I guess you could say leave
in treatment and detangler for color
treated hair our vegetable derived color
strength and new technology strengthens
week and damaged hair while sunflower
seed extract naturally protects your
color from UV damage and fading this
unique formula will detangle hair add
shine and promote healthy looking
healthier looking softer hair it says
spray evenly on towel-dried hair comb
through and style as desired so I'm
really excited to try this out a
full-size or at least um let's see here
you get to fluid ounces I don't think
this is a full-size probably a deluxe
size yeah a full-size that this is
actually for fluid ounces so this is
about half of the product which would
make it about ten dollars a full size is
$22 and it says color treated or not
this treatment this leave-in treatment
is the protection your hair needs to
brace the changing seasons utilizing
natural grape seed and fennel fruit
extracts styling your hair without any
breakage will be a cinch so I'm really
excited to try that I have long hair
that tangled very very easily so um yeah
I really really excited it has a little
tip or tidbit at the bottom it says as
we age or see them an oily substance
that produces on our scalps that assists
in hydration slows down the production
of it basically slows down grape seed
extract extract uses its super powers to
restore lost moisture keeping the scalp
healthy and happy and if you are young
or you know I would say yeah under
probably 50 years old you notice that
you know you may have to wash your hair
more frequently things like that I'm 23
and I noticed I have to wash my hair
every other day and it's not just
because it's like I have fine textured
hair it's also because you know when
you're young you the sebum production on
your skin and also your hair is kind of
like edits but it's basically at the top
of its game so anyway I kind of agree
with them you know as you do get older
you you can wash your hair less and also
you need more moisture in your skin and
things like that so that makes sense
with the sebum thing alright and the
last thing that is in here appears to be
an eye shadow and this is from the
glossy Fox line and this is what it
looks like this is a huge I shadow can
you guys see that this thing is huge it
is three grams in here so this is a very
very big eye shadow and the color that I
got is glossy mauve and it looks very
pretty let me just get this packaging
open if I can any day now yes alright so
the color like i said is called glossy
mob and i do like the glossybox products
I've never had like any issues with
their makeup so this is what it looks
like it
beautiful kind of mommy grayish plum
color it feels really really silky look
at that that's a beautiful color go
ahead and swatch it nice what a
beautiful formula to it really kind of
glides on nicely and I think that's a
stunning color so really really awesome
especially the fact that this thing is
so darn big um let's read about what
they have to say it says GlossyBox um I
shadow in GlossyBox mob looking for a
twist on the classic smokey I take this
pearl infused aubergine shadow for a
spin pair with that glamorous holiday
cocktail dress that you've been dying to
debut and point 11 ounces full sizes
eleven dollars that is a full size and
their little tip is to add a metallic
silver shadow to the intervals corner of
the eye to enhance shape and help blend
in any darker colors so really really
awesome i'm actually really excited to
play with that because again a beautiful
beautiful kind of purply silver
undertone and it's got a ton of silver
iridescent to it so really really
beautiful color and i just see like you
get so much product in there there's a
little bit of kick up but overall really
really beautiful buttery formula and a
huge amount of product alright guys so
that is it for the amount of december as
far as GlossyBox is concerned i hope
that my um what is that popsugar must
have box for the month of december gets

parents house to celebrate the holidays
