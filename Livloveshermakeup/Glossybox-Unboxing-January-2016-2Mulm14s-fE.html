with the company at all but it isn't my
favorite subscription box so i will link
below if you guys are interested it's
only twenty dollars a month and you get
a lot of great products so let's just
get started the first thing i see here
is the negative 4 17 foot nourishing
cream and this says mmm do not ingest
okay avoid eye contact okay blah blah
blah blah blah paraben-free mineral oil
free this is what it looks like love me
some foot cream this is what it looks
like let's read about what it says it
says the negative 4 17 foot nourishing
cream winter is the most unfavourable
season for dry cracked souls packed with
water from the Dead Sea and aloe vera
leaf juice you can state you can say
goodbye to discomfort and hello to
smooth skin 3.4 fluid ounces is sixteen
dollars and this is 1.7 ounces so this
is a nice you know sighs I must admit I
think this is a nice size and a
full-size like I said is what sixteen
dollars that's pretty good too not not
too pricey alright the second thing I
see in here is from a meet a makeup this
is the diamond heart base primer in the
illuminating soft focus this is the base
primer a light primer that prepares the
skin for a perfect makeup it makes
application easier and gives a
long-lasting finish thanks to the
diamond heart ingredients the whole skin
looks radiant smooth and you know
and then it says pro tip apply a meet a
red coral BB cream after application for
best results well I don't have that BB
cream but I am excited to try this
primer really really cute little tube I
love that little tiny like spout at the
bottom but that is the size that you get
and I have been really into illuminating
foundations and primers lately so this
is right up my alley you get 15 ml in
here and let's read about what they say
it says the mbta makeup diamond tart
primer with new year's resolutions
abounding one of ours is keeping our
makeup flawless all night long this
primer special diamond heart ingredient
imparts a natural glow and preps the
skin for foundation by evening out skin
tone and minimizing imperfections for
1.2 fluid ounces it is twenty-nine
dollars and a tip is its skin perfecting
benefits give you the option to wear
alone or as a base for makeup so really
really excited to try that out the next
thing I see is from Nene cosmetics so
this is in a playful peach this is a lip
glide velvet finish lip color this is
the little box that comes in and let's
open it up me me me cosmetics never
heard of them velvet finished lip color
so it looks like it's like a chubby lip
pencil very pretty color let's watch
that Oh gorgeous my goodness that is
quite pigmented this is gonna be perfect
for spring a beautiful kind of orange e
pinky coralie color and that goes on
really full um in pigment like very very
full coverage pigment right there and
it's not skipping whatsoever but it does
feel a little drying it's completely
matte so that is very very pretty I'm
excited to try that out let's read about
it it says the me me me lip gliding play
called peach looking for hydration and a
burst of color for those lips I don't
know about hydration this thing
completely is drawing down to a matte
finish like um it says this apricot hued
lipstick leaf a gorgeous satin finish
that stays put no matter what the day
brings again not really seeing a satin
finish it's starting to drive down that
but that's okay it might stay satin my
hands are just drive but it looks like
half of it is drying down man and a
little
is that me but anyway uh free full size
which this is it is twelve dollars and
fifty cents and it says a little tip
lipstick needs a patch free canvas in
order to keep cracks at bay before
applying lipstick rope a little lip
scrub on your lips to swap away any dead
skin alright moving on the next thing I
see is the process by beautiful
nutrition lemon rinse this is a gentle
clarifying treatment for your hair it
prevents frizz seals and moistures
moisture it has pH balancing restorative
properties in it it adds shine it seals
cuticles it maintains healthy scalp just
about does everything or claims to do
everything it says restart the clock on
healthy hair over time product build-up
causes hair to look dull and lifeless
lemon rinse gently clarifying treatment
returns hair to its natural glory and
active lemon extract that gently
cleanses in tone rapidly restoring
weightless body and shine it gently
removes dilling product build-up
balances scalp for healthier hair
growths most cuticles enhances shine
boost volumes and is for all hair types
and color treated hair I have not
clarified my hair in quite a while I
should probably do that tomorrow when I
wash my hair actually so maybe I will
use this that is what it looks like it
looks like you get a nice size here to
start out with this is Zulu 59ml or two
fluid ounces so beautiful nutrition
lemon rinse gentle clarifying treatment
we love our hair products as much as you
do but not every now and then our locks
need a break from all of the styling
over time product build-up causes hair
to look dull and damaged which is why
you need a quick clarifying rinse the
most full size is only ten dollars and
that's 13.3 fluid ounces it says once a
week after shampooing and conditioning
as usual saturate hair from root to tip
with this rinse let it sit for 30
seconds and then wash out so I'm excited
to try that and all about those
clarifying shampoos and then the last
thing that I see in this month's box is
the royal apothic creme creme
moisturizing body creme comes in an
absolutely adorable little box got
different colors on each side super cute
and
like this is a body moisturiser oh my
god that adorable packaging loving it
I'm loving it let's see it says
moisturizing body crammed on the other
side it's also like patterns very pretty
let's see here the royal apothic creme
creme and it looks like on here it's a
purple one but I have the yellow one and
this is formulated with milk proteins
and lactic acid royal apothic body
moisturizer allows you to sign this
simultaneously simultaneously can never
say that word exfoliate and moisturize
for fresher younger skin and it says the
sense will vary so it looks like I got
the cutting garden one and this one is
the Venetian Grove the purple one is
Venetian Grove and this one is cutting
garden I love anything floral scented so
that's right up my alley for 1.25 fluid
ounces oh this is a full-size so for
1.25 fluid ounces this is a fourteen
dollars so you've almost paid for the
box just with this product and it says
Tippett derived from dairy lactic acid
has been utilized for centuries
beginning with ancient spa treatments
folklore states that Cleopatra soak in
bath of donkeys milk sprinkled with rose
petal well she was quite beautiful or at
least they say she was alright so that
is what it looks like and these are the
products I'm very very excited I always
am very very happy with my glossybox Fox
every single month I feel like
everything is definitely worth more than
twenty dollars and I'm excited to dig
into the stuff if you love hair care
skin care a little bit of makeup this
box is perfect for you it's basically
for the all-around beauty lover like if
you're not just into makeup you know
they also give me hand creams and foot
creams and you know clarifying shampoos
