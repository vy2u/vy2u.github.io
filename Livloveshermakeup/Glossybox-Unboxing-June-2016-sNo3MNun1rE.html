this video I have my June 2016 galazi
box unboxing to share with you guys so I
took it out of the outer packaging and
this month it is a gorgeous red box with
beautiful detailing on it and it says
the Tony Awards so anyway I am super
super excited maybe it's tony will award
a themed which is really cool so anyway
let's take a peek inside here we have
the little bow we have the little card
and then we have the items inside oh my
god it's so cute looks like a little
Christmas Box alright so here is the
card that shows all of the items i will
read off of that as we go through and
then there is a little GlossyBox card
right here and it says exclusive offer
for first-time subscribers enjoy fifteen
percent off a six month subscription of
glossy box and the code if you would
like to use it is GL 0 j app 933 all in
capital letters so that is very very
cool all right moving on open this baby
up all right to the first item that i
see ya I'm just loving this red theme
this is the LA splash lip gloss in the
shade is called red carpet very very
fitting I'm going to go ahead and just
watch this on the back of my hand and
then i will read for you guys what it
says it's a beautiful oh like oh my god
this is a lip gloss systems like a
goodness gracious this looks like a
liquid lipstick isn't that beautiful my
goodness that is crazy pigmented there
is a shade red carpet and all the little
GlossyBox card it says let's see here
the LA flash lip lacquer it is the high
pigment gloss and it says drawing
attention to your lips is always a good
idea made just for GlossyBox la flashes
lip lacquer takes in the next level with
highly pigmented hues and a cream to
matte finish oh that's so cool it's
going to go Matt awesome it says colors
will vary and a full size is eighteen
dollars so that has almost paid for the
box itself alright so the next item that
I see here is the KO lion where is poor
and I have actually tried this before
this is the steamed pork pack and
actually I haven't tried this one this
is the original one I've tried the one
that is heating and cooling I picked
that up from Sephora but this one is the
blackhead steam
pack in the original four pack really
really cute and basically the thought
concept behind these little products is
that you put them on so here i have a
little samples and you put them on
basically as your cleanser so here's the
blackhead remover which is usually like
the warming one and then the original
one is probably the cooling one and it
says let's read on here the oh it's does
not have oh it does have mine I was like
that not mine it says ke lian premium
hot and cool poor package you owe a
full-size is thirty dollars for one
point eight ounces it says makeup needs
a pristine canvas in order to deliver a
flawless application KO lion-o brings
the best in skincare KO line or KO lang
lie own why own something like that it's
a i think it's an agent skincare brand
it says Caroline brings the best in
skincare with a detoxifying do that
features a steaming mass to cleanse
pores then a cooling mask to tighten and
refine so these are not actually
cleansers like the ones I had tried
these are masks which is awesome I'm
really really excited to try that
alright the next item that I see here
are the tan towels and I have tried
these before right now am wearing
self-tanner I've been loving the Jerkins
fair to light skin the actual cream I've
been really really enjoying that but I
have tried these before they made me
very orange so i will save these for
someone else but these are cruelty-free
tan towels and basically they're really
nice because you can just wipe them all
over your body without worrying about
having streaking or things like that it
says these are the half body classic a
healthy glow that is absolutely
necessary for your strut down the
catwalk exfoliate tan and moisturizers
with these only one self talent tanning
towelettes for the face and body and the
full size is twenty seven dollars for
ten tao left and i do remember when i
had tried these before although they did
leave me parsley a little orange
everyone else oh excuse me damn I've
object everyone has different ph and
things like that in their body so color
could look different on you um but i
remember when i use these on my face I
didn't have any sort of break out so
that is pretty awesome all right to the
next item that I see it here oh my god
they're away more than five items in
here this month that's awesome all right
this is the emoticon allowed icona
milano i'm guessing the system yeah
waterproof mascara this is
definitely a full-size let's take a look
at the wand okay interesting it's a
little fiber or a natural bristle one
sorry and it looks interesting I don't
love natural bristle ones but we shall
see it says that this is the economy
llano emoticon allowed mascara it says
want to have a night enter the bright
lights without worrying about your
mascara running down your face icona
milano's long-lasting waterproof mascara
is the answer to all your bows and this
is a full-size and it is $19 so we shall
see about that I don't love waterproof
mascaras because I feel like they take
my lashes like what I'm taking my eye
makeup off they take my lashes with them
but yeah we'll see about that alright
the next item I see is a beautiful nail
polish oh my gosh I hope this is showing
up on camera this is a beautiful
iridescent light purple mixed with gold
this is from sinful colors and the shade
is called kitty pink I love that that is
so so so cute oh my goodness all right
it says sinful colors Kylie Jenner
trends matter satin collection it says
strike a pose with glamorous hands that
make a bold statement sinful colors and
Kylie Jenner have collaborated to
provide you with the both casual and
daring colors that will push the
envelope with every stroke colors were
very and mine was the shade kitty pink
and it is three dollars x target I think
they said yeah target all right moving
on the next item I see here is a hair
oil this is from Sebastian and this is
the professional dark oil and it's just
a tiny little sample kind of like a
perfume sample and it says I'll probably
take that when I travel actually it says
here the Sebastian professional sharper
fierce oil is nineteen dollars for 10.6
ounces it says we all need to be
reminded how fierce we are from time to
time Sebastian professional sharper
fierce hold any hairstyle with a long
lasting extra strength grip but it's an
oil that sounds very very interesting I
never heard of an oil giving grip to the
hair all right and oh I'm sorry that was
the oil and this is the shaper I was
like how was an oil gonna give me
texture know so there were two separate
products here they wrote about this one
which is the shaper which is a hairspray
and then the oil was just an extra
little bit
alright guys so that is everything that
I got in this Hans glossybox I really
like the variety I personally love
glossybox because they give you skin
care they give you a makeup they give
you hair care so I really liked this box
it's not my all-time favorite box but I
still think that was really good and we
got a lot of items in there so let me
know down below if you've got a
different box than I did and please let
me know what you got and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
