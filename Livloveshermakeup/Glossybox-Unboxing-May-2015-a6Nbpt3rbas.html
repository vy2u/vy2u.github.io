said it is for the month of May so let's
open it up and see what's inside um I
have not looked in yet so let's see we
get a little card and of course the cute
little ribbon this shows what is in the
box that sorry I'm just kind of ripped
it forget that um I should have opened
it delicately but I just ripped it open
instead like a little birthday gift so
um I love velocity box by the way just
want to say I've never been disappointed
with any box they haven't forgotten I
don't think and i highly recommend them
so i will leave the link below and not
affiliated in any way but if you guys
are interested IP GlossyBox is a good
good subscription box to try for beauty
related things so the first thing I see
in here is the head over heels nail
lacquer in this cute little box like
this and let's open it up and see what
it looks like okay so it looks like it
is a top coat so that is what it looks
like a really really cute little bottle
and let's read about what they say in
the little conflict it says the t's
trend cosmetics head over heels nail
lacquer top coat it says we get a spring
in our step from the dutch beauty brands
adorable packaging top coat promising a
super smooth application it will seal
any manicure with a high gloss finish
the full size is $14 4.2 24 ounces and
this is i don't think this is whole side
but that's really really awesome so
right there we have our little top coat
moving on uh we see the professional
sebastian style bird 9 multi benefit
hybrid hair spray it is a multi benefit
hairspray and it looks like this get a
nice size of that could for travel and
in here it says the sebastian
professional style bird 9 from heat
protecting to added volume and texture
this new multi
the hairspray from sebastian packs a
punch paraben and alcohol-free the
lightweights dialer and treatment hybrid

protection and enhances natural shine so
that's really awesome awesome Lilith at
six point two ounces to see full-size
this is only one point 55 but the
full-size is nineteen dollars and ninety
six cents oh that's not too bad for a
full-size hairspray that does all of
those things next I see oh the glam glow

says exclusive offer thirty percent off
any glam glow calm mud mask with code
glossybox 30 so you could get thirty
percent off you know a mask and it is
the clone the code is all capitals

back as well for a deal if you're going
to buy a full size of the glenbow all
right next I see a clean restore
retexturizing gel and it looks like it's
40 it's for the face so it looks like
this really really nice pretty packaging
