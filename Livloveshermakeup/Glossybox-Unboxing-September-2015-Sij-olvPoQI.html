thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a wonderful sunday
today i will be doing my September 2015
glossybox unboxing so let's just get
right into it I've not opened this baby
up last box is my all-time favorite
subscription box of like all times that
and the popsugar must have box are
definitely my favorite so I love opening
this up and I'm just so excited every
single that so anyway the first thing I
see is a little discount card from
bauble bar it says enjoy twenty percent
off your next order at bauble bar com so
that's really cool and then you get the
little card and it shows what is in your
box and also i will be p5 as i go
through it so let's just get started
this is what it looks like so cute
always so well put together i love that
um the first thing I see oh that's
beautiful this is the meet a makeup this
is the artist color powder blush in 108
so they very very deep like almost like
rusty brownish color but I think it'd be
really really beautiful for fall that's
definitely probably going to be a broad
their armies actually very dark it but
it's not like that kind of nice like
ready undertone to it sofitel look very
nice though I mean I think if you shared
that out on your cheeks no matter what
skin tone you are that'd be really
really beautiful so excited for that it
does take up a little bit of powder um
you know it's a little powdery so be
aware of that but it is very pigmented
and that is a very nice kind of rusty
reddish brownish color a to like that
let's see where is this it says the mbta
makeup artist color powder blush a full
size which this is full-size point 35
ounces is $22 and it says craving
perfectly sculpted cheekbones
shamelessly create definition with this
warm peach tone blush infused with mica
its intense pigments promote a natural
rating well so I don't know if that has
a lot of peachy undertones I think it
had
more of like a red like terracotta sort
of color to it but I'm definitely
excited to use that is very beautiful
the next thing I see that's kind of in
the same color family is the nails inc
uptown nail polish this is not a
full-size birthday full size is point
four seven ounces and is fourteen
dollars I don't think this was a full
size but this is what it looks like
really really pretty color very neutral
kind of ma vie I think it actually pair
really pretty we are really nicely
prettily making that a word I really
nicely with this blush so really really
excited for that I think it looks really
beautiful and mailed ink makes really
really good nail polishes I have never
really had like a dud sort of product
meal pink so I'm very excited about that
and it says I'm smoothing out any
imperfections on the nail this highly
pigmented formula utilizes a plumping
agent to create a long lasting super
glossy finish it's flattering dusty rose
Hugh easily transitions from day to
night complementing every skin tone so
excited for that I keep say I'm excited
for that I'm excited for that but I
really am excited and the next thing I
see is the 12 benefits love at first
lather moisture balancing foam shampoo
well it's a foam champ ooh that's so
cool i don't think i've ever tried a
phone shampoo but um i remember we did
get something from the 12th benefits
online in one of our glossy boxes i
think it was like a leave-in conditioner
sprite it was very nice so um I am
excited to try this especially because
they fo shampoo that's so interesting um
it says Summer Sun giving you a
cringe-worthy main kind of yes my has
been very dry um 12 benefits unique 12
benefits unique foam delivery provides
the TLC your hair has been asking for
some the harsh chemicals sunflower
extract and coconut oil combined to act
as a natural sunscreen repair texture
and protect the cuticle all while gently
removing removing impurities the full
size nine dollars a 1.7 ounces and so
yeah this is a full-size interesting so
um definitely excited for that I need to
come up with a different word I can't
wait to drive that I'm going to say that
instead of so excited
the next thing I see this looks really
interesting this is these sticks
cosmetics it looks like it's like a
weird like lipstick shape this is a
lipstick and the shade is I don't know
that to hear mauve oh my gosh look at
this packaging that is so cool it
literally is like very very sleek and
the lid just pops up like that and the
lipstick is shaped so interestingly it's
like a little like triangle thing wow so
it must be really easy just like get
right on the lips but that is a pretty
color let's go ahead and swatch that see
how pigmented it is wow it is beautiful
what a gorgeous shade Wow perfect for
fall oh goodness I can't wait to try
this it's really nice I love the
packaging that's so cool so yeah
beautiful beautiful kind of ma fille I
mean it's called mob but it's kind of
raspberry colored in it I love anything
that's got a little bit of like a
raspberry tome to it any berry shade
with a little more of the pink in it
gorgeous it says giving beauty on the go
a whole new meaning sticks Cosmetics has
introduced the first ever lipsticks and
can be applied with one hand in under
five seconds courtesy of the chic yet
innovative packaging so you can flip it
up you flip the top up with one hand and
then apply it is so cute it says the
gorgeous assortment of colors is
compliment complemented by their premium
oyster eyes and consistency colors will
vary depending on the box like I said I
got ma which is a pretty Bradford color
and a full psych is fifteen dollar
fifteen dollars and a point 10 ounces I
think yeah this is a full-size so very
very cool very cool and the elastic I
see in my glossybox for this month is
the bio bio salt they revitalizer just
like a toner says directions for you
supply it to 23 drops onto cleansed face
neck and bite I think this is a lot of
toner it's the tone of her serum I
cannot tell open it up have a little
dropper form wow it's like a very very
liquidy whoo Oh interesting it's like a
very liquidy
crm but it's got kind of like a silicone
ii feel to it oh very interesting so
this is what it looks like really cute
little packaging I love these little
droppers technique and they revitalizer
so yeah it has a hundred percent new
austin swallowing and bettering that vid
let's just read what it says on here it
says the revitalizer a squall on squ ala
and a squall line is a naturally
occurring emollient in the body that
works to replenish and hydrate the skin
that can diminish in some as early as
their 20s oh no girl if the revitalizer
uses a plant-derived escuela swallow
school on to restore what was once was
already there was once already there
dull skin will be a thing of the past so
for 1.7 ounces it is $58 this is just
point 14 fluid ounces but it does a good
like nice-size to try out so very nice
so this is kind of like a moisturizer /
um it feels like it leaves like an
interesting almost kind of textured
field I can this have to be rude but
very interesting I think it's kind of
like a toner / moisturizer depending on
your skin type if you're really oily
this probably could be your moisturizer
if you're dry probably not but yeah so
that was what was even my glossybox for
the month of sep tember and i hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
