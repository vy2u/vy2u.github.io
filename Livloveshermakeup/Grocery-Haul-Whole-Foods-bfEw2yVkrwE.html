today I'm going to be doing a grocery
haul I know that sounds kind of odd but
I've seen a lot of people here on
YouTube do these videos and I thought
I'd just share you share with you guys
what I got from whole foods I am trying
to transition myself into eating
healthier in general um I truly eat very
unhealthy unhelpfully unhealthy I'm just
I just don't need healthy so basically
what I'm trying to do is transition
myself from you know like eating really
crappy chips to eating better tips
things like that so this is in no way
like super healthy and I just want to
put it out there that i'm not trying to
lose weight or anything i'm just trying
to be healthier in general so i thought
i'd share with you guys what I got the
first thing I got were these Kara sweets
and beats chips again these are just
going to help because um like I said um
I eat really really crabby chips and I
thought that switching td's would be
better I actually got two bags of those
they were two for six dollars i believe
i got these little vanilla cupcakes
these are like to buy cupcakes these
help me when I have like a sweet tooth
craving I think whole foods makes the
best cupcakes um I got some of these
vans 8 whole grains toaster waffles like
you just pop them in the toaster oven or
just into your toaster and you can make
those in the morning I got one of these
teas tea unsweetened rose green teeth
like a slob soft floral tea I got some
skim milk for when I make some macaroni
and cheese it has to taste the way I
like it and I eat really crappy macaroni
and cheese i obsessed with macaroni and
cheese it has to be kraft macaroni
cheese or i won't eat it wow that's a
really bad hopefully I'll transition on
about at some point um I got some of the
kind healthy grains oh and honey
clustered with toasted coconut granola
here's my receipt if any of you are
curious all of this cost fifty nine
dollars and 21 cents I got some of these
garlic pesto pita crisps or yeah pita
crisps from Kashi
I really like the brand Kashi they make
really tasty the little snack so these
look really good and I'm think I'm just
going to dip them in hummus um I got one
of these Argo tease i think they are
based in i want to say New York in
Manhattan this is the Carolina honey and
then also I got the hibiscus tea sangria
alright that's the first and second bag
here I have some of the Rudi's organic
bakery honey sweet whole wheat bread the
other bag of Lootera chips the sweets
and beats I think these were like I said
two Olympics I got some kashi original
seven grain snack crackers these are
just there TLC tasty little crackers
these are delicious I got some more of
the kind granola I got it in vanilla
blueberry clusters with flax seeds I got
some unsweetened almond milk another
iced tea this is from teas tea again and
this is elegant Jasmine green tea
unsweetened I got some stonyfield Greek
yogurt I like to put granola in this in
the morning and eat that this is vanilla
flavored I got a little one time sample
thing of the Vega one this is an
all-in-one nutritional shake vanilla
chai sounded really really good it says
it has let's see here Green six serving
of greens 20 grams of protein vitamins
and minerals fiber omega-3s antioxidants
probiotics and only 170 calories so
that's not it really really good for a
protein shake the actual like containers
of these were like thirty dollars so I
thought I'd start out with a single
little package
and the last thing i got was this little
apple cranberry tuna salad snack pack so
I thought this looked really good this
is nice for on-the-go and I'm in school
right now so sometimes it's easy to just
take for like a lunch or whatever so
yeah that was my little whole foods hall
again for all of this I ended up
spending a 59 dot 21 cents so I hope you
guys enjoyed this I know this is not
really related or anything like that but
it is kind of health-related and yeah
I'm trying to be healthier this year so
i'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
