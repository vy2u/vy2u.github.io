channel i thought i would share with you
guys a quick little grocery haul this
morning and then at five pm tonight i
hope my first installment in my makeup
declutter series which i'm very excited
about or i should just say it my
declutter series because i'm gonna be
decluttering a lot of stuff so anyway I
am a say to share with you guys of what
I got we actually ordered these
groceries online and I did have to put
the blueberries and the raspberries and
the strawberries away already because
the delivery guy got here really really
late and they were already looking all
like mushy and gross but for the most
part I left everything out so let me
share with you guys what we picked up so
the first item that we picked up with
some Ezekiel 49 bread aisle of
toastiness and putting avocado on top
and alpha chopped tomatoes we also got a
whole loaf of sourdough bread Tom early
like sourdough bread I really like
sourdough bread what I like to do with
this is go ahead and put some like eggs
on top in the morning and then a little
bit of like paprika or a tomatoes super
super good we also picked up some pop
chips I really love these are so so good
so I got two bags of beef BBQ and then I
also got a bag of the sea salt and
vinegar which I love to salt and vinegar
chips so we got those we also got a flat
black we got a bag of ocean spray
mandarins these are just like those
little tiny cuties really easy to eat
really nice to carry around in your
purse or anything like that here are
some avocados these are not ripe yet but
I'm going to put them in a dark area so
they will ripen up quickly so I can have
them on some toast I normally am very
picky about my cake cups and my coffee I
normally just like starbucks k-cups but
I did want to try out these pumpkin
spice a Rebecca arrivata Elena that a
Rebecca Rebecca these are just never
normal like keurig k-cups and they are
the compared to brand from the service
that we order from which by the way if
you are in the Chicago or Milwaukee area
we order from the brand called pea pod
delivery not sponsored or anything by
them we just order from them and its
really nice from Tom and I are both busy
and I can't get out the door or he can't
get out the door um so yeah we are going
to try those out they are pumpkin spice
and I have been loving this
international delight pumpkin pie spice
creamer so I thought the two of those
would mix together really nicely we also
picked up some refried beans these are
from taco bell I love these I make
own little vegetarian tacos at home I
also picked up some of this pumpkin
bisque soup again this is there at
limited edition this is from the
compareto brand I've never liked Karen's
much about like compared to brands Tom's
a little more picky than I am when it
comes to food but as you guys can tell
from five boxes of macaroni and cheese
over there I don't always eat like
sprite quality food i'm sorry to say
that but it's true alright moving on I
did get some mini cucumbers I like to
dip these into humus we also got a two
pound bag of what are these I think Gala
apples no they are honey grip yes honey
crisp apples I got Tom like two bunches
of dole or just bananas whatever and
then we also got some Ocean Spray
craisins and I'm ruining my little kick
up thing here alright let's put that
back I've got some of these little
craving foods are super good and they
released how to spy at my sweet tooth
but i do believe they have added sugar
so just be aware of that i also got a
bag of lemons and i like to have these
inside of my water for spa water here is
some sharp cheddar and i put those into
my tacos we also got some matzo apple
sauce and love out the sauce I don't
know why I just have a thing for it we
got some shredded lettuce again for
tacos five boxes of macaroni and cheese
because if you watch my snapchat you
know I'm obsessed with macaroni and
cheese and not just any macaroni and
cheese it has to be the craft kind I
don't know why it's just like my comfort
food alright moving on I did pick up a
few of these that I like to bring to
work once in a while these are the
little lean cuisines now my biggest
issue with these is that they're very
very small but they are like easy to
carry and you know if you're out you
know you have to have a lunch somewhere
and you're in a hurry and you have to
get out the door quickly they're easy to
pack into a little like ice box thing on
iceboxx a lunch box that has like a
freezer pack in it so right here we have
the five cheese's rigatoni this one is
the cheese ravioli and then sometimes i
like to make these it's better to just
go get a nice piece of fish from like
Whole Foods or something like that but
these are really easy to make these are
the Gorton's grilled salmon fillets and
then here is another lean cuisine one
that I kind of like this is the cheddar
potato and broccoli but those are just
not something that I eat it like every
day or all the time they're just
something that I will occasionally bring
to work alright I do like these little
bumblebee snacks these are tuna salad
snack so comes with cracker
and like tuna salad in it I really find
that tuna holds me over and like keeps
me very full for very long so I love
that we got this little thing of
fat-free milk we do not drink regular
milk we drink almond milk however i do
mixes into my mac and cheese we got some
crunchy tacos of course the taco book I
think this obsessed with taco bell and
magnitude okay let's all eat and then I
got Tom some of these Joel dippers these
are dark chocolate covered real banana
slices and then finally oh sorry I can
have the hiccups finally for me I got
these outshine fruit bars these are
pomegranate so these are really really
good and I haven't really been into a
scream lately I do prefer like popsicles
over ice creams so I picked those up so
anyway that's our little grocery haul
like I said I'll be back later today to
share with you guys my first installment
in my makeup declutter series but i do
like coming on here once in a while and
sharing with you guys some food because
i love watching this video so anyway ah
that is it and i will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
