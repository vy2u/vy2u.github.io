you so much for joining me I have this
little brown box right here because I am
doing a haul for you guys and it is
actually a brush haul these brushes are
from morphe brushes and i actually got
them on hautelook i would say morphe
brushes is on hautelook every maybe
month to month and a half like every
five to six weeks they are on there and
they are on there for a few days and I
have been obsessed with morphe brushes
lately and I think that you definitely
should order them from hautelook because
you can get them literally 50 to 75
percent off and more feed brushes is
like really big right now a lot of their
palates are very popular right now a lot
of their brushes I think ever since
jaclyn hill kind of started working with
them they've become a very very popular
brand you hear about them more than you
hear about like sigma nowadays in my
opinion so anyway I have all of like my
orders pulled up here on my hautelook
app and I'm going to tell you guys
basically what I got everything totaled
out to be 73 dollars and eighty eight
cents and I got a lot of brushes and I
am going to go through and um basically
show you guys everything that I got and
talk about them and yeah so the first
thing i got was the morphe deluxe vegan
set with case this is a set of nine I
believe synthetic brushes and it was
twenty four dollars and it comes in this
beautiful little case right here it's
like crocodile print can you see that
and it zips up all the way and it says
morphe brushes right there and you unzip
it and I did take everything out of the
packaging already because I didn't want
to struggle on camera but this is what
it looks like and again this was twenty
four dollars and you get a lot of stuff
in here so starting over at this end you
get this really nice little angled brush
that you can use for your eyebrows you
can use for eyeliner you know whatever
you want to and its really really nice
these are so soft and this is really
really nice like it's very very dense if
that makes sense so that's the first one
you get the second one you get you could
use as a concealer brush you could use
to put eyeliner on you could use to put
you know eyeshadow onto your lid you
could use basically for whatever you
want but it is a very very short and
kind of um it's just not very long like
it really would work well if you wanted
to put it on your lid
I personally don't really use brushes
like this to pat color onto my lid I
prefer my finger but this could also
work as they concealer brush for like
spot marking any area that you need to
the third brush you get is a gorgeous
little fan brush here so silky you guys
I cannot even tell you these feels so
nice so it is not very dense it is very
very like you know it gives it basically
gives and it is just so silky and that
will be nice for applying highlight or
anything like that that you want to and
I think it's just gorgeous the next
thing you get in here is like I mean you
really could use this for anything that
you want but it's basically like a domed
little like pencil brush I'll probably
use this to take I shadow underneath my
lower lashline then you get this one
this looks like a true like concealing
brush it's kind of thicker and bigger
than the other one but it is completely
flat and then you get this gorgeous
score just like flat-topped brush you
could use this to buff in foundation you
could use it to pat on powder you really
could use it for anything it feels so
soft and I think it's going to be
absolutely gorgeous for buffing and
foundation really quickly because it
takes up a lot of space but also
stamping on powder and setting you know
locking in your foundation so that is
the next one and then you get this nice
one and this is like a very very um you
know it's just kind of loose I feel like
this would be really good at doing like
the buffing technique and kind of
buffing in any sort of powder that you
want it's a very very loose and fan like
you know what I mean like fan like if
that makes sense kind of like the fan
brush it's just very very um like it
gives you know it's not super super
dense and I think this will be nice for
bronzer powder anything like that really
really beautiful and then you get this
nice little angled brush and this is
going to be nice for blush I really like
angled brushes for blush so I think that
that will be really really nice to just
kind of sculpt out the cheekbone you
could use it to contour could use it for
anything like that but it is super super
silky I can't get over it and then the
last thing you get in here is a true
little foundation brush and I don't
really use these for a foundation but
maybe I should try so that was the first
set I got and like I said that was
twenty four dollars with this
and this is nice because it zips up all
the way you can open it you can travel
with it it's awesome so that was the
first thing I got the second thing i got
was the deluxe I blending two-piece set
so it looks like this and this was the
six dollars and fifty cents for this
little blending duo so in here you get
the morphe m4 for one which looks like
this and it's just a nice kind of dense
like crease brush and it's not as big as
I think the morphe m 440 is it's a
little like thinner and it kind of is
tapered at the top but it looks really
really nice and I gosh those brushes are
falling it looks really really nice and
easy to just kind of sculpt in that um
you know crease color so that is the m4
for one and in that little duo you also
get this little pencil brush which I
love like I said I like to take these
and use this to put um eyeshadow
underneath my lower lash line and this
is the morphe m43 one brush sota two of
those together were six dollars and
fifty cents and then I got to the morphe
m200 which is a deluxe crease brush and
that was three dollars um yes the m200
this is this was three dollars you guys
like what really really good deal so it
looks like this it is very very silky it
kind of has like that tapered thing
going on it's not very dense I think
this is going to be great for getting
that kind of diffused crease look so you
could use it right up here and do small
circular motions to kind of um take your
eyeshadow out and above really really
beautiful and like I said that is the M
200 and then the next thing I got was
the morphe deluxe contour set with zip
pouch it is a set of 6 and this was a
fourteen dollars and it comes in this
little black pouch I probably will toss
this little black pouch it's not as cute
as this little you know carry on case
basically but it looks like this and in
here you get some nice synthetic brushes
you get a nice arrangement of I rush is
face brushes so this is the first one
this is going to be great for buffing in
foundation it is a very very dense and
it reminds
me up those Sigma like f whatever they
are those synthetic like buffing brushes
this looks really nice very very dense
and very very soft and I like the white
handle isn't that pretty the second 1i
is that is in here is this one and again
you could use this to buff in foundation
it is still very very dense but it's a
little tapered and yeah I think that you
could use this for powder you could use
it to buff and foundation whatever you
want whatever your little heart desires
next you get these three brushes and
these could be used for concealer they
could be used for contouring they could
be used for whatever you want you could
blend in your eyeshadow with this
whatever you want the first one looks
like this and it is completely even it's
slightly tapered like at the top it's
bigger and at the bottom it's a little
smaller and then you get this one that
has definitely definitely kind of got
like an angle to it again you could use
these for concealer buffing in anything
really whatever you want and then this
one's kind of like a little mini pencil
sort of brush you could use this to
bring any you know foundation back
towards your hairline buff things in
whatever and then you also the last
thing you get in here is one of these
guys and you guys know I love these sort
of brushes these kind of tapered I take
these all the time and just to bring it
Lena the foundation into the hairline
because I always get a line no matter if
the foundation is a little too dark for
me or a little too light there's like
always line consistently so anyway that
is nice to have the next thing that I
got is the morphe n be 39 it is the
deluxe buffer brush and this was a nine
dollars and this thing is super super
dense really really beautiful sleek and
black and I think this is going to be
great for again buffing in foundation
you could really kind of you know like
stipple it on or you could actually buff
it in circles but also this is going to
be great for stamping on powder you guys
know that I like to lock my foundation
in with powder and I really just kind of
like to stamp it on so that I'm not
moving the foundation so I think this is
going to be fantastic for doing that
it's got this kind of cool it's like
black and then it's got gray like at the
top the color kind of cool so that was
nine dollars and then I got to the MV 13
which is the deluxe blending fluff brush
and this was a four dollars the MV 13
looks like this again it's got that
two-toned sort of color to it really
really soft and I think this is going to
be nice for just taking and going into
your crease it's going to be really
really nice for that you could use it
for stamping on product onto your eyelid
whatever you want but that is the mb 13
and then the last one that I got is the
morphe m3 30 this is the blending crease
brush and this was three dollars and
fifty cents and I already have one of
these I like it because it really does
kind of give and it's really really
beautiful for kind of diffusing above
the crease so I think it's absolutely
gorgeous super super soft and silky and
yeah so that was my morphe brush hall
like i said i spent what was it seventy
seventy three dollars and eighty eight
cents on all of this so under seventy
four dollars and I got tons and tons of
brushes so I think it's definitely worth
it i love morphe brushes i love like the
way that they're made they're really
really wonderful you can use them for
whatever you want of course but they
really really are silky they don't shed
they're just fantastic but I definitely
think you should check them out on
hautelook because like I said fifty to
seventy-five percent off is such a great
deal and normally like those kits like
the one that I showed you like the ones
that were in these little bags and
things like that like the set of 9 or
set of 12 those are normally like forty
or fifty dollars and they're comparable
to Sigma brushes and you know even on
the morphe website I think I saw this
one and it was like fifty dollars and i
got it for 24 so really really good deal
if you are in at the market or on the
market looking for new brushes and
really nice soft ones good quality ones
definitely check out hautelook and keep
your eye open for morphe brushes and
yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this hall
i'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
