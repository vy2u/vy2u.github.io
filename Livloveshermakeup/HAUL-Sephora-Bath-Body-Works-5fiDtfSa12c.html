thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having an awesome day this
video is going to be a Sephora haul and
also a Bath &amp;amp; Body Works haul so I went
into sephora i just picked up a few
things i'm gonna do this for bag first
because i just got three things and then
of course i ordered online Oh from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works big ol box oh my gosh wow I
just like messed everything over there
but anyway so I'm going to share with
you guys what I got so like I said we'll
start with Sephora I went into sephora
with the intention of picking up just
one thing it was a Christmas gift for my
brother I have an older brother and I
really really wanted to get him the
spice-bomb cologne dis year for
Christmas I got it for my boyfriend last
year as one of his Christmas gifts and I
just think it smells so good it actually
is a unisex scent I'm actually wearing
the deodorant today my boyfriend said i
also got him and so I was thinking oh
you know what I think that my brother
would really like it it's very neutral
it's really warm smelling it smells
great and um I knew that I wanted to get
that for him so I thought I'd go in and
get the deodorant and the 1.7 fluid
ounce cologne like I did for my
boyfriend well I was in there and I was
looking and I was like okay you know for
1.7 fluid ounces it's like 115 dollars
and the deodorant was like 45 and then
one of the guys that works at sephora
was like do you want it in the gift set
I think we have a gift set right now and
I thought oh yes because it is the
holidays so obviously they have like
better deals so he went to the back and
picked this up for me this is what it
looks like this is the gift set and in
here you actually get the full-size the
3.4 fluid ounce cologne and a I would
say its smaller size of the shower gel
and the aftershave balm 415 so the big
size of the spice-bomb is normally the
3.4 which is in this kit is normally 145
dollars so you actually get all of this
for 115 so this is what it looks like
it's packaged really nicely and it looks
like a grenade and then you get the
shower gel and in the after shave balm
and it just smells so good and I love
the way it was packaged I think it looks
so sleek I'm just going to put wrapping
around this and give it to my brother
and yeah this is a great deal I
recommend because you are getting that
big big 3.4 fluid ounce you know Cologne
in there that's like a great deal you
guys I can't even tell you normally it's
like the 1.7 fluid ounce one that is 115
I told my boys when I was like why did
they have this deal last year I could
have got never you but anyway so I got
that and I really just went in with the
intention of picking that up but then I
was in the line waiting to check out and
of course I had to get some stuff that
was at the front so this are the way I
do that this we're gonna say these just
this one this one's not usually sold out
but this one is always sold out on the
sephora.com website you guys know I
really am a fan of the tony moly brand I
really like a lot of their stuff
especially their hand creams but this is
always sold out online it is the pocket
bunny moist mist and I love facial
sprays i love my surely crows water
facial spray I've tried a lot of
different ones i like to use them after
my skincare ritual in the morning and at
night just to kind of give an extra like
mist of refreshment and also moisture
you can also use it to set your makeup
but this is the pocket bunny moistness
and this soothing hydrating face mist is
infused with fruit extracts to help
boost elasticity while moisturizing for
dry tired or sensitive skin so first of
all the packaging okay yes look how cute
how adorable is that I love that so much
so so cute so I am excited to try this
out I never have used it before so we
shall see and well excuse me hiccups um
it just comes in a little spray bottle
like that and I think it's really cute
and hopefully it works for me so we're
going to try that out and then I got
another facial mist it is sorry my chair
is like squeaking it is the coda Lee a
beauty elixir I wanted to try this for a
while and I would use it for the same
thing you could probably use it to set
your makeup as well but a lot of these i
like to use as like a refresher or like
my final step of my skincare routine so
this is the beauty elixir for smoothing
glowing complexion and it comes in a
little ornament style you can hang it on
the tree and yeah so i'm excited to try
a vent out great so that is what I got
it Sephora let's move on to fast
bodyworks put that back in there I love
this set you guys with luxurious this is
now it's time for me to go and buy flour
bomb like a full size for myself I think
I deserve that a lot of perfumes but I
really really want it God Victor involve
makes like the best smelling stuff ever
alright so bath and body works I ordered
online of course they give you all these
little coupons every single time you
order so I got twenty percent off my
order and i'll also wanted to go on and
just pick up a few things that are
basically going out of season their
candles are fifty percent off right now
they're fall candles all of their winter
collection is coming in but I'm one of
those people I don't like to start using
winter sense until after Thanksgiving
because I still feel like thanksgiving
is very fall-like so basically the start
of December is usually when I start
burning like candles and putting in wall
flowers that are winter themed or
scented but anyway so I wanted to pick
up a few more candles that I hadn't
tried out and then two more that were my
absolute favorite that are obviously
going out of season now but the first
one I already put in our little sleeve
here I was burning it last night um it
is the cetrone cedar wood it looks like
this and it smells so good you guys it
smells so good it kind of smells like a
man's cologne and it says this blend of
aromatic cedar wood and sunny Citrone
with a hint of mint is they carefree and
Sunkist as the hills of California wine
country so this smells so good and
usually when I go into the bath and
bodyworks website my goal with candles
is to like get a few of the ones that I
like and then always try new sense
because that's normally how I find like
the best sense ever so um to others that
I had done that with like in a past Hall
worthy pumpkin pie and this turned out
to be like my favorite fall candle of
the year so I had to pick up two more of
that those they smell amazing smells
like pie crust and like warm henkin
flakiness it's not too spicy it's one of
those like sweet kind of smelling
candles and it says save room for this
delicious optimal autumnal oh my god I
can't say that word autumnal are aware
our Auto blend of creamy pumpkin whipped
vanilla and flaky pie crust at the suite
is your favorite pumpkin
hi and i love this i have one burning in
my beauty room right now so i did have
to pick up two more of those in the way
i discovered those were like it was in a
haul video that i had done and i try and
always pick up some of my favorite
candles and then other ones they hadn't
tried yet so i picked those up in other
favorite so the other candle i picked up
besides the cedar wood one that was new
to me was the heirloom pumpkin I just
thought you know what this was one that
I hadn't tried yet most of them i have
tried but um smells really good it's
kind of like it's definitely smells like
pumpkin but it kind of smells like a
pumpkin pie but like spicy pumpkin pie
not as sweet as this pumpkin pie I like
that one I prefer that one over this one
but it says the perfect autumn pumpkin
celebrated in a invitingly warm blend a
fresh pumpkin creamy nutmeg and rich
brown sugar I definitely smell d nutmeg
and the pumpkin in here so really really
like that and we will burn through those
and then I will go online and get our
absence befall candles no winter candles
yeah I'm so excited alright the next
couple things I picked up or some
wallflowers we have two plugs to
wildflower plugs in our living room and
then I have two in my beauty room we
don't have any in the bedroom or in my
boyfriend's office because he's a little
sensitive descent but I already like
filled my wall flowers up with most of
these and I know I just said oh yeah you
know I don't like to you know put in any
sort of winter sent until like after
November but this is my all-time
favorite favorite favorite winter scent
from bath and body works it's the tis
the season this is the wallflower
plugins this is the little duo these
were on sale I think these are like
three dollars apiece I have two of the
wallflowers in my beauty room like i
said and i had to put this in because it
is my favorite scent and i've been
working a lot on my beauty room this
week and i'm just in there all the time
and this is such a warm inviting sent
it's very um just remind me of like
cinnamon but like sweet like sweet
cinnamon or something like that it's
really really great so I already plugged
those in I know I totally just said I
don't use winter sense until fall is
done but that was an exception and then
for the living room our two plugs are
filled with the autumn set yep autumn
wallflower sent this is a beautiful
beautiful scent kind of woodsy kind of
night
my boyfriend likes that it's not too
sweet and i also picked up cinnamon and
clove buds and this will also be I don't
know if I'm going to do this in my
beauty room or out here in the living
room we also have I have like a little
stash oh no I have one more little thing
of this and if I think it's fresh balsam
so that's a winter sent as well so
either this will go in the living room
or my beauty room I may have to get more
of the tis the season and just do those
than my baby room but um yeah and then I
picked up some of their like
Thanksgiving deep cleansing hand soaps
we use deep cleansing hand soaps we use
them in all our bathrooms and also our
kitchen like our kitchen sink area and
well no actually right now we're using
those mrs. Meyer hand soaps in our in
our bathroom so smelled really good i
had to pick up the limited edition sense
but these are cheaper than the mrs.
Meyer those were like five dollars a
piece but I really wanted to try them
they have really really good it's like
orange club and cranberry but anyway
they had a few of these besides like the
winter sense they had these kind of keep
ones they had really cute designs on the
front and we personally put our soaps in
our bathrooms we put them in like
sleeves that we got from Target like
really really pretty little bottle so we
normally don't actually have these out
except for in the kitchen we just don't
put them in to sleep so I thought these
are really really pretty patterns on the
front and um yeah these were like the
last fall ones that they really had
around before you know he got into all
the winter ones and they were on sale so
this is the honeyed pineapple pumpkin
and I just think the design is so pretty
and it's very like Thanksgiving like and
it says an irresistible blend of
caramelized pineapple creamy pumpkin and
molasses Oh mommy knows it smells really
good now my nose smells like pineapple
but yeah it has like this little like
subtle scent a pineapple to it but with
like spices and pumpkin I know it kind
of sounds like a weird mix but it's
actually really really nice so I love
that I love the packaging and then the
next one I got was cranberry citrus and
sage again beautiful beautiful packaging
and this one smells so fresh so so good
I smell a lot of cranberry in there not
a lot of citrus but maybe a little bit
of cinnamon as well
it says a luscious blend of sweet
cranberry citrus zest and a hint of sage
I love that one that may be my favorite
and then I got the give thanks this is
just the sweet cinnamon pumpkin in the
Thanksgiving packaging and sweets and
I'm pumpkin just smells like cinnamon
and pumpkin it says an enticing blend
creamy pumpkin cinnamon and spice sugar
so I don't smell any sugar enhances
quite a spicy scent in my opinion and
then the last one is brandied Apple
pears was probably my second favorite I
already smelled all these obviously
everything's open this one smells really
good too but definitely my favorite is
the cranberry citrus and sage but this
comes in a close second it is a harvest
blend of sweet brandied apple and juicy
pear so I really really liked those like
I think the packaging looks really
really cute and those ones will be out
in our kitchen ang yeah that concludes
my hall from Sephora and Beth and body
works i hope you guys enjoyed this video
