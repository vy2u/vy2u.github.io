as you guys can see I have a whole lot
of stuff behind me I'm doing a haul for
you guys today and I am actually like
this is not really like a skincare
makeup sort of Hall it's actually a mix
of everything so there is skincare there
at the back care there is t-there's home
decor I went to target I went to lush i
went to sephora i went to teavana i went
to all these different places TJ maxx
and i thought i would just share with
you guys what I got because I was out
the whole day yesterday with my
boyfriend and we did some shopping so
let me just start with the stuff that i
got from sephora i didn't pick up too
many things but the first thing that I
got was the makeup eraser this is
supposed to be basically like a cloth
that removes all your makeup so you
don't have to use any sort of makeup
wipes or um I don't know like I make a
remover things like that it sounds
almost too good to be true but the
reviews on this are like fantastic on
the sephora.com website so i thought i
would try it out and yeah I don't know
I'm kind of nervous I feel like maybe it
won't work beautifully it is like twenty
dollars but I'm still going to try it
out so that is what it looks like i will
let you guys know if that works for me
the second thing I got from Sephora was
this little quarterly product this is
the totally rest Bertrille lift this is
the eyeball yeah this is the eye lifting
bomb its anti-wrinkle anti puffiness
eyelid firming with hyaluronic acid acid
peptides and resveratrol 500 if you guys
don't know my boyfriend I really like
this coat alee resveratrol line so we
thought we would try out at the eye balm
and it looks like this I feel like you
get a nice amount of product in here it
is quite pricey I think this was around
$56 but we are excited to try it out and
we do like the serum that they have and
also at the firming night cream so we
thought we'd try this one and then the
last thing that I got at sephora was
this makeup setting spray from tacha
I've heard so many good things about
this this is the tacha luminous dewy
skin mist and I have just heard really
really awesome things I believe you can
use this as a skin missed or as a
like makeup setting spray I'll probably
use it as a makeup setting spray but I
actually don't know who knows maybe I'll
use it as something different but um
yeah i was thinking i'd use this as a
makeup setting spray it has beautiful
beautiful packaging and this little
sticker thing on the top but it looks
absolutely gorgeous look at that bottle
isn't that beautiful and I've heard this
really makes your skin look dewy and
luminous so I am a very very excited to
try out and I will let you guys know how
that works for me as well and I think
yeah that was all that I got a Sephora
let me go on and move on to lush I have
my little lush bag over here and the
first thing i got was a bar soap this is
the rock star bar soap i will unwrap it
to you guys can see um it is like a pink
like candy smelling soap it literally
smells like candy I like really sweet
smelling things so i knew i would love
this and i have already used this before
but this is what the actual bar of soap
looks like I got one of like the
prepackaged chunks it smells so good and
I am actually going to be putting that
in my shower right after I film this
video so yeah and then the next thing i
got i have to look at my receipt so I
know exactly what it is all right this
one is let's see here this is called the
keeping Santa bubble bar and this was
695 I thought this was so cute it
actually has like a vegan chocolate
chips for the eyes I know that sounds
crazy but this is what it looks like
isn't that adorable and I think this is
one of their limited edition like
holiday ones oh my gosh it smells so
good it's very very fresh but like soft
and sweet smelling so that is the first
one I got I think I just got like a
little sprinkle or something on my lip
yeah I definitely just ate his face all
right it tastes good though and lush is
really really natural and wonderful and
you know they don't do animal testing or
anything like that and then the next one
I got is this little pink bubble bar and
this is the creamy candy bubble bar and
this was seven dollars and forty cents
and it looks like this and it has this
cute little like flower thing right
there and again this just smells very
very soft and sweet like candy so love
that pick that up and then the other
thing that I picked up was the comforter
bubble bar which is my all-time favorite
bubble bar it looks like this you guys
have probably seen this a lot on YouTube
it smells like oh my gosh I think it's
supposed to be a mix of blackberry and
cream or something that's exactly what
it smells like blackberry cream so I
love that and I can't wait to use out I
usually get like two uses out of those
big comforter bubble bars and then I
also picked up they were having these
little charity popped hand and body
lotions and if you buy one of these I
believe these are around seven or eight
dollars if you buy one of them all of
the proceeds go to charity so I bought
this and it just smell quite good I
smelled it in the car on the way back
yeah it just smells very very nice kind
of like lemongrass tea or something like
that kind of natural smelling but really
really good so that is what i got from
lush let's go ahead and move on to oh my
gosh i can't even alright let's grab
this bag over here this is from teavana
and i love this bag how cute is this
holiday bag so we went into the teavana
store so you guys know we were like in a
mall which is why there are so many
different stores but um we were trying
out and testing out some of their teas
they always have like samples at the
front and things like that and they were
sampling the teavana white chocolate
peppermint flavored rubios tea and i was
like oh my gosh it's so good it's a very
very sweet this is a loose-leaf blend so
it is you do need to have like a like
strainer or things like that so that you
don't have like the leaves flying around
in your tea but this tasted so good and
um you know they recommend half a
teaspoon of tea / 8 fluid ounces so this
will last a very long time but anyway
that white chocolate peppermint flavor
is amazing and then my boyfriend really
liked this one this is the gingerbread
flavored black tea blend so it does have
black teen it so that means there is a
little bit of caffeine in here but I
just love the packaging of these two I
think these are so pretty I'm and I have
these
but I think they're so pretty and this
one really did taste like gingerbread so
really really yummy he likes that one a
lot I preferred the white chocolate
peppermint but I will have both and then
I did go ahead and get their little
perfect tea maker this is only like 1995
and this just like assures that
basically the tea leaves don't go into
your tea so you put everything in here
and it has a little strainer at the
bottom as you guys can see so make sure
that um you know you just pour hot water
on top and then you don't get any of the
leaves basically in your tea so that is
what I picked up highly recommend having
one of those if you are gonna get teased
from teavana because all of their teas
I'm pretty sure are like loose so yeah
highly recommend that all right moving
on let's move on to target i'm going to
show you guys some of the home decor
stuff first so if you guys recall I
showed this little bouquet in one of my
weekly favorites videos this was a
bouquet that I put together for under
ten dollars from target including the
base everything that's in here
everything is under ten dollars so this
was something that I created in the fall
and I thought it was really really key
at the base was like one or two dollars
the acorns were like fifty cents and
then each little bundle in here there's
like a little tiny bundle of each was
like a one or three dollars so really
really puts I think actually one dollar
yeah I put this together for really
really cheap and I think it's a
beautiful little centerpiece or just we
have it near the window sill and I had
the idea of changing this out per season
so I thought you know what I want to
change it out during the spring during
the winter things like that so this was
our little fall one and I'm going to
keep this out for thanksgiving and
everything um but I did find some cute
little things to put together um in that
little what is this a little base for
wintertime and here they are so these
are like those what are these
poinsettias points yetta's poinsettias I
can't really say it but it's that kind
of flower that you see a lot around
Christmastime so I got so let's see here
for different bunches and they were a
dollar apiece at my target and I'm just
going to put them into that base that i
already have for christmas and i'm
actually going to fill the base this
time instead of acorns i am going to
fill them with these cute little plastic
ornament bowls that I found and these
are also one dollar apiece
the section that you find like at the
front of your targets so I thought it
would be really cute to fill them up
with these little ornaments instead of
the eight porns and I'm really really
excited to put that little bouquet
together once the time is right and once
the time kind of comes around obviously
not ready yet because we haven't even
gotten to thanksgiving but once december
hits i'm going to do that so that is the
first level thing i got and then i got
this beautiful i want to kind of move so
you guys can see that beautiful wreath
could we actually have a brief um oh
this thing is huge we have a wreath on
our front door right now and it is
really really beautiful it's like a
basically autumn inspired wreath but we
picked this one up and this was quite
pricey this was around forty dollars but
it is so beautifully made it's like
paper mache it's got little acorns
little berries and these beautiful
beautiful little flowers and I thought
this was going to be gorgeous for the
winter time so we did pick that up and
I'm very very excited I think it's
absolutely gorgeous we're gonna put that
up again at like in December and I
absolutely love it I don't want it to
tip but I absolutely love it i think
it's gorgeous and we're very excited to
put that up and then I've got some other
stuff from target of course so let me
show you guys what I got and these are
all like kind of skincare and haircare
related I got three packs of makeup
remover wipes I got the Neutrogena
makeup remover cleansing towelettes this
is the night calming formula I really
like the scent of these these are really
really nice um and again if that makeup
eraser from Sephora works really really
well maybe I'll just end up using these
while I do my makeup or like swatches or
things like that but we'll see I'm
skeptical about that product and then I
got the simple sensitive skin asked
experts my seller makeup remover wipes
I've never tried these ones but i love
these simple micellar water it is my
favorite micellar water so I thought I
would try out these wipes and I've heard
really really good things about these
ones and i also picked up the aveeno
active naturals ultra calming makeup
removing wipes these are again one of my
favorites I love the scent really really
nice and very very like gentle and I
don't know I feel like it is kind of
calming on my skin alright and then I
picked up some hair products i picked up
the Garnier Fructis damage eraser
strength reconstructing butter this is a
deep conditioner so I picked that up I
also picked up the Pantene mask so this
is an intensely hydrating mask deep for
deep moisturization for powerful repair
yeah it just as Pantene pro-v I don't
even know it's just I don't know it was
like a couple dollars so i picked that
up and i also picked up the aussie three
minute miracle moist which I love so I
picked those three up I also picked up
another detangler I like to have a spray
detangler and then there's one from Shea
Moisture I really like that's more of
like a cream sort of thing or like a
it's like a gel that turns into an oil
on the hair but I like to have a spray
one and I just went through my suave
kids one I love it umm it smells like
apple it's really really good but I saw
this and I thought I'd pick it up this
is the L'Oreal Paris power moisture
ten-second Hydra detangler for a daily
care it's an ultra-lightweight leavin
missed for normal to dry hair so I
thought I would try this out i think the
packaging is gorgeous i love that blue
color and then I picked up some of the
Noxzema ultimate clear anti blemish pads
these just have to percent's also like
acid in them they're nice to have around
I've been breaking out a little bit
lately I don't even know if you guys can
tell on camera but I've been having some
hormonal breakouts so I thought I'd pick
that up and then I also picked up the
clear pore cleanser / mask from
Neutrogena this is one that I always go
back to you it's awesome it has benzoyl
peroxide three-point-five percent in it
and it's awesome if you do have um
breakups and simple
acne all right and let's see here I
think this is the last thing so I did go
to TJ maxx i picked up a beautiful
beautiful mirror for my beauty room so
i'm so excited about that but i could
not call that over here it was too big
but the other thing i got was this
really cute little owl he's going to be
sitting in my beauty room and my beauty
room is the kind of theme going on is
white and silver um there's a lot of
color in there but um white and silver
is kind of the main theme so I just
picked this up it was only 599 I think
he's really cute I think he's going to
be adorable just kind of sitting there
and I think he's really sweet so yeah
anyway that was my basically
miscellaneous hall I hope you guys
enjoyed the home decor stop and the
tease and some of the skin care what not
and yeah i will be posting a video later
on today it is actually a collaboration
with my friend mama loves mascara here
