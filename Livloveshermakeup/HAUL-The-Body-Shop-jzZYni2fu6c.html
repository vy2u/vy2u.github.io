thank you for joining me I am so excited
for this video I film quite a few videos
today and a lot of them are hauls
because I've been ordering a lot of
things I hope you guys don't mind by the
way I will be happy
reviews coming up very soon I've ordered
some new things from Sephora and whatnot
so reviews will be coming soon but right
now um because I just had my 23rd
birthday
and it's just been relaxing time to
whatnot I've been spending a lot of
money and doing a lot of hauls so anyway
I thinking a lot of boxes and this
particular box is filled with goodies
from the body shop um and I don't order
from the body shop very frequently
however I saw that they were having cash
back on tea dates and I was like I gotta
get on it so anyway I'm gonna show you
guys what I got everything really really
was like on sale good prices just good
good good stuff so anyway here is what I
got oh I just moved the camera when I
did that so let me move you back anyway
so I've got quite a few things I'm going
to show you guys and yeah so the body
shop is kind of like Bath and Body Works
except they don't really do like candles
or anything like that but they have
really good smelling body products like
bubble bath shampoos body lotions things
like that so anyway let's just get
started the first thing I picked up was
a shower gel and this was like five
dollars literally and it is the vineyard
peach shower gel and it's a soap-free
cleanser with peach I really like a gel
cleanser is especially during the summer
time so I thought I'd really like this
I'm gonna smell it and try and describe
it oh it smells so good it's just
amazing kind of smells like the Tony
moly peach hand cream which is something
I break about all the time so really
really love the scent and I'm super
excited that I got this so this is the
vineyard peach shower gel and this one
is the 250 ml or 8.4 US fluid ounces and
like I said I can remember that one was
$5 so it is on sale they have a lot of
stuff on sale right now if you go onto
the online website just look under
clearance or sale and you shall see
everything I ordered was actually in the
sales section I didn't even want to go
look at other places that
you know they had on the website like I
didn't even want to look because I just
wanted to get stuff that was on sale
because that would spend more money you
know if you have a budget for it you can
spend more and get more stuff so the
next thing I got oh my god should I just
lied everything I just said I lied about
um I did go and look for this one
product this was actually the reason I
can't even believe I just said that
whole statement the whole reason I went
on to the body shop website was because
I was looking for this one product and
yes this was not in the sales section
this was the most expensive item I
bought it was $12 I think the fact that
I just looked down and saw all these
sale items I thought I could get away
with saying everything was on sale this
is the one item that was not this was
the reason I went onto the website and
this was what I was looking for of
course I came out with more stuff but
this is what I was looking for this is
the body sorbet this is supposed to be
like a cooling moisturizer that's like
gel and I just thought it sounded great
for summertime and I'm really like on
and off with loving body moisturizers
sometimes I use them sometimes they
don't sometimes I love really oily ones
really creamy ones sometimes I don't
sometimes I don't want anything so I
thought that this will be great for the
summer it is in the Satsuma scent which
is an amazing scent at the body shop
it is probably I think all of them are
like best-selling cents but this one
smells like oranges oranges excuse me it
is so lovely
it's just smells so fresh it's the best
smelling orange product you've ever
smelled seriously highly recommend the
Satsuma scent it's probably my favorite
at the body shop but anyway um I got
this like I said it's a cold-pressed
Satsuma oil from Argentina it's a body
sorbet it's a light and fruity body
moisturizer and it's like a gel formula
I thought if somebody so refreshing and
so great so that is when I picked up
this blissful price I believe it was $12
that's the most expensive thing I
thought by the way so I really wanted to
get this I saw that on the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works website they now have a product
very similar to this however I think
that the body shop scents smell a lot
more fresh and a lot more like fruit and
natural if you like fruity scents of
course I love Bath &amp;amp; Body Works for
their sense I love their really like you
know Kiki scents and all of their
candles that come
in the fall time but if you are someone
who really likes like citrusy through
the kind of scents that are very very
natural and seem like they have like it
says it's cold-pressed Satsuma oil like
it actually has the product in it it's
not just like manmade commercial the
body shop has really good stuff well
that was a long little tantrum there but
anyway so I got this one
this type of product like the body
sorbet or like the cooling gel
moisturizer is cheaper on the Bath and
Body Works website I think they're like
seven dollars and you can get any
fragrance but I just want to try this
one because I thought it would be so
refreshing in the subsume ascent so
anyway I'm glad I did it cuz then I got
a bunch of my stuff you know gotta do
both gotta do both love both stores and
the next thing I've got the rest of the
stuff all on sale I promise this is the
body shop early harvest raspberry body
scrub and it looks delicious and I want
to eat it um and this is nice because it
is like a really really first of all it
smells amazing it really smells just
like raspberries it looks like jelly and
the actual exfoliating particles are the
raspberry seeds so this is nice for if
you I personally like to do like a
physical exfoliation of my body
um not you know that is the difference
between the physical exfoliation and the
chemical I like to do physical
exfoliation all over my body like the
actual chunks like 3d chunks once a week
so sometimes you know I like to do it
twice a week and this would be nice to
use after you use like a really really
gritty one maybe a couple days later you
could use this it's not as harsh because
the actual particles are that of a seed
so I think I'm really gonna like it I
think will be great especially on days
where you don't need too much
exfoliation but you do want to get rid
of the dead skin cells or you just need
a deep please um the next thing I picked
up was the oh yes these were like
Christmas time products that we're going
out and I'm just one of those people
that I mean I'll use this stock you know
I don't care what time of year it is
I'll use it and I have a lot of bad
products so this is
the cranberry bath jelly
I thought the sound of that was so cool
so it is frosted cranberry baths gently
it looks like this and apparently you
just like to put some of it in your
bathtub and it looks so cool it's like
literally like a jelly and it smells
amazing and the frosted cranberry scent
is really really bright and fruity I
really could use it any time of year
could be used during the summer fall
winter mostly summer and later probably
but again it was on sale and I did
notice that I didn't click on but I
noticed that underneath that it said oh
well if you like this product you may
like this one and it looks basically all
of the other Bath jellies and they were
just like the normal summertime cents
and they were like ten dollars more so I
thought it'd be better just to get the
outdated Christmas ones because I have
so many back products it will take me
forever to probably get to this even but
I like the thought of the bath jelly and
I think that you just pour it into your
tub and it you know smells really good I
think it might make a few bubbles and it
has you know just nice properties to it
probably will moisturize your skin a
little bit and yeah so picked that up I
did pick up another one of those and I
got it in the glazed apple again like a
Christmas see kind of scent I'm going to
smell it right now this one really does
smell like Christmasy and wintery to me
I probably won't use it this time of
year know so we'll care I used up all
the time whatever I'm feeling if I feel
like it's like oh it's like a fall day I
feel like a fall day right now and it's
like 92 degrees outside I make you this
but anyway it's more of like a full
wintery kind of scent out probably I'm
saving it I have so much stuff to go
through
that's summery but anyway it's the same
exact thing the glazed apple bath jelly
you just pour it in it looks so cool
it's like totally like a jelly and I
just thought that was so cool and fun
and who knows what it does I don't know
if it gets bubbles I don't know if you
just soak in it and it feels good or
smells good I just like the thought and
the fact that it was on clearance um the
next thing I got was another scrub um by
the way the body shop is really really
known for like their scrubs and their
body butters so
I kind of you know dabbled in that area
I'm not as I don't know the brand as
much as I know like that my body works
to things like that but I do want to
start ordering from them more often so I
ordered the body shop spa fit this is a
smoothing and refining body scrubbed
enriched with a hundred percent natural
origin citrus and caffeine ingredients
it comes in this really cute little
container and it's supposed to help
smooth your body out and help with like
cellulite and any kind of like skin
bumpiness you might have I have a lot of
that like on a lot of it but I do have
it unlike my thighs and my stomach and
things like that just like lumpy skin
not necessarily cellulite or like not
stretch marks but just like lumpy kind
of skin like just wear it I feel like
it's like little fat deposits that me
since I don't know I think it's probably
just cellulite but um I know that really
really using something that's quite
abrasive or just making sure that
circulation goes to that area of the
body can be really really helpful so I
like that this had caffeine in it and
things like that and I think will be a
good scrub so I'll probably primarily
use this on the lower part of my body
like I said my butt my thighs and my
stomach where I have more texture in my
skin so really excited for that I'm
going to smell it oh it smells really
really good and it looks really really
gritty so it smells like just very very
citrusy and bright and lemony and
wonderful so I'm very excited for that
and like I said I will probably just use
it spot spot use it's not treatment
music on certain areas because it is
kind of a small container and it was
more expensive than some of the other
items alright the next thing I picked up
were these I've never tried these from
the body shop
I even tried a lot of stuff from the
body shop so this will be very fun and
if you guys see a future haul from the
body shop you'll know that I did like
the products so I'm sorry well this is
the body shop smokey poppy back bombs
and I wanted to see I did not think that
this I smell it now and it smells
amazing but like the description of it
on the website smokey
papi I was like yo I'm not gonna like
that scent but these were the only bath
bombs they had that we're on sale and I
do like bath bombs lush makes really
great bath bombs they're just these
little basically balls that you pop into
the bathtub and they're cut in half so
you can use half or you can use a whole
one and they just make everything really
fizzy and they smell nice and they're
supposed to have nice properties like
for your skin and whatnot so um this
smell is really really nice actually
though again like the black packaging
and everything I just thought looking
back like that sounds gross but it
smells really good
smells very like um the most cool oh
nice so that will be nice and I'm sure
my boyfriend Juan so like this actually
so excited for those and you do get I
think six bath bombs in here so this
makes a great deal again this was under
$12
that's like $8 I think so great deal um
the next thing I got was a body butter
because the body shop is well known for
their body butters um last Christmas I
did get a little kit with all the
different body butters like the
different scents and I fell in love with
quite a few of them the formula is great
but I fell in love with that so it's ooh
my scent the strawberry you know it was
just great the formulas amazing so they
had this special edition limited edition
one for the summer and this is blueberry
so it smells really good I should have
known when I smelled it it does smell
like blueberry it smells really really
good and this is the full-size so that
was awesome that I got it for under I
think this one was under $10 hey I'm
remembering the prices of this this is
good so anyways yeah this is like
limited edition scent but I think will
be great during the summer and I can't
wait to use it so you guys would
probably be seen and empty soon with
that in it so those were all the
products I got and then they do list you
get only one that little sample I feel
like I'm so spoiled with Sephora and
Ulta I get like all these samples and
points yeah they lay pick one sample
from the body shop so I saw really
really great reviews on the body shops
nutri grant new - new trig annex drops
of youth line this particular one is a
serum I've heard really really good
things about it I'm
you have some really really good
skincare items and I plan on going and
you know purchasing more products like
that but I have so much skincare that I
need to get through before I go and do
that but this is a youth enhancing
concentrate for smoother looking skin
enriched with Krista marine plant stem
cells and it says 98 percent minimum
ingredient of natural origin so 98 no
parabens no silicones Ehrlich owns 98
percent natural and it says apply two to
three drops before applying your
moisturizer and yeah I have still not
found a serum that I'm absolutely
absolutely head over heels with I have
found quite a few that I do like um but
maybe this will be the one so I'm gonna
try that out and yeah this concludes the
body shop haul I hope you guys enjoyed
