you so much for joining me I have a haul
for you guys I did some shopping last
night it was one of those things like I
wasn't planning on doing any shopping
but my boyfriend I went out to eat and
we ended up kind of it like a mall
setting and I went to Alta i went to
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and then i went to
barnes noble so um Alta I just went and
picked up some random stuff there were a
few blushes that I wanted to get that
we're on like my to-buy list and Babu
bodyworks was having their semi-annual
sale so I stocked up on a few things and
then Barnes &amp;amp; Noble I just got some
random stuff but i thought i'd share it
anyway so anyway let's just get started
i'm going to start with alta because i
know you guys love using things as much
as I do so the first two things I got
were blushes and the first one is from
it cosmetics I've been wanting this for
a while a lot of people talk about this
blush it is the it cosmetics CC radiance
ombre blush in the shade sugarplum so
this is what the outer packaging looks
like I'm going to open it up and swatch
it for you guys i swatched it in store
and I was like that it's so beautiful
and everybody talks about this blush so
that's what the packaging looks like and
the actual color is beautiful it's like
an ombre effect into a deep plummy shade
can you guys see that how beautiful is
that color so let me go ahead and swatch
I'm just going to swirl it around so
that is the color oh my gosh it's so
beautiful you guys oh I'm just I'm so
excited to wear this so that is what the
color looks like I think it's beautiful
it's got an amazing like iridescent to
it do I see that oh my gosh I just
cannot wait to play it with that blush
so that is the first one that i got and
then the second flush that I got is from
laura geller this is the baked gelato
swirl blush in plum barry and i wanted
to get this because they really love my
baked gelato swirl illuminator and
gilded honey and i did go and swatch the
ballerina shade as well they have like a
tinker my lighter but it was like really
dark it looks like it's pink on the
online website but then it was really
really dark in person like it would not
look good on my skin tone but anyway I
thought you know what I should try these
blushes and i thought this color was
gorgeous for at the wintertime so this
is plum berry and let me swatch it for
you guys that is what it looks like whoa
baby do you guys see that Oh
it's so beautiful oh my god you guys ok
there's the it cosmetics and there's
plum berry like what no look at that ah
it is so beautiful and it just feels so
creamy and luxurious I'm really excited
to play with both of those like I cannot
wait you guys I'm very very excited so
those were two blushes that I got that
um I put a lot about and I just thought
you know what I really want to try them
and yeah I really have no other
explanation alright moving on I picked
up a about taste dry shampoo I picked it
up in the light and blonde shade because
i need to get my roots done so i was
thinking that this would definitely help
between colorings and i have tried that
one before i love it i also picked up
these cetaphil moisturizing cream like
two or three years ago the only cream
that i put on my face in the morning was
the cetaphil one and i absolutely loved
it and made my makeup lasts all day
worked as like a moisturizer and also
kind of a primer it was amazing and it's
just so thick and luxurious the tub
especially if you're not using it on
your body I'm probably just going to use
it on my face it will last you forever
so I did pick this up and I'm excited to
try that out again just because I feel
like it's been forever um another
product that i got that i heard about
from l from L is for living here on
YouTube her name is Elle and she's on
the channel alerts were living these are
the rock daily resurfacing discs and i
actually had i have purchased these
before this is a repurchase she was
talking about these and i remember
purchasing them and remembering like
just having really good skin when i was
using these like not a lot of breakouts
i believe they have glycolic acid in
them and just like really really good
stuff it says they are clinically shown
to help diminish the look of fine lines
and wrinkles approve the improve the
appearance of skin in one week they have
skinned conditioning cleansers cell foam
and disc is textured on one side so let
me actually open these up and show you
guys because they are really really big
and you can actually cut these in half
but one side is textured and the other
side is soft and basically it does like
lather up on your skin so that's the
soft side and there's the textured side
but they're so cool because they really
do kind of lather up and you don't need
to wash your face at the sink well you
kind of do because you use it and then
you wash it but
it's very very quick and easy and I
think these are great for travel and I
just remember my skin looking really
good when i was using these so I saw
them again they were on sale and I
thought what the heck I might as well
purchase another little tub of them all
right another skincare products I picked
up with the Garnier clean plus balancing
daily exfoliator this is for combination
skin if you guys have watched my channel
for a while you know I'm obsessed with
the blackhead scrub it's amazing it's
for oily skin really really good I do
have combination skin but I like that
one a lot so this one I remember I tried
like a smaller size of this and I wasn't
wowed or anything it doesn't scrub the
way that the charcoal one does or the
mythical yeah the blackhead charcoal
black head cleansing scrub whatever it's
called it doesn't like scrub the way
that one does it has like more like
microbeads in it rather than like really
really rough um particles which I
actually kind of like I really like to
scrub my face in the morning but I
remember using this and I really love
the smell it smells like pomegranate and
it's just really really nice I'm a huge
person when it comes to Santa like I'm i
love really good smelling products i
like i like things that he's really good
at like things that smell really good so
that's a huge thing for me and
especially in the morning i want to
smell something really really good so i
did actually open this is not something
i normally do whatsoever I did open up
the what was it called the invigorating
one which is for normal skin I opened up
that scrub in the store I just popped
the lid I didn't like Todd for anything
I just smelled it and my friendly or i
recently picked that up and I was
thinking oh I really want to get that
one because it looks like it's going to
be invigorating kind of minty eucalyptus
and I actually hated this time so that's
a huge thing for me like I said sensor
really big for me so if i don't like a
scent of something i'm not going to
purchase it so i opened it up and I
smelled it and I was like no I don't
like that so the one right next to it
was this balancing one and I knew that I
had used it before but I just thought
you know what let's take a whiff with
that one and it just smells so good and
I just thought you know what I should
get a full side wit so that's what it
looks like oh my gosh I was a very
long-winded answer ova
talk about how I don't know my story
with that product I guess alright the
next thing that I picked up was from
Pacifica this is the amount of the lemon
blossom perfume oh I love the pacifica
perfume see guys I have the gardenia one
I have the mango one I have the Indian
coconut nectar one they are fantastic
and this one I smell in store it smelled
so good it was very very fresh it smells
like lemon and I just don't have any
perfume that smells like this so i
thought that i would definitely pick it
up and i'm really really excited to
start using that another sort of
perfumey body spray that I found I was
like when I found it you guys are
literally I started freaking out I love
the body shop they said suma sent it is
so good it smells like fresh oranges it
smells like when you first like cut an
orange open and the scent is like all
over the place that's what it smells
like it's so fresh and beautiful this is
the best sent from the body shop I did
not know that they had a body mist I
just write this on me right now oh my
gosh oh my gosh it just smells so good
you guys it's so citrusy and Orrin G and
like the perfect orange scent I
absolutely love it so I had no idea they
had a body mist I brilla a body mist so
I obviously had to pick that up and then
the last thing that i got from Ulta is
this nip + fab skin Dragon's Blood fixed
cleansing pads I heard a lot about this
brand I've not tried anything from them
so i thought i'd try these out they have
hydrating facial like hyaluronic acid in
it Dragon's Blood whatever that means
but these have hyaluronic acid they have
stella silicas that they have dragons
blood and they have something else I
think glycolic acid but the pads
themselves are really really soft and
cushiony and the fact that they have
hyaluronic acid in there I thought would
be really really nice to use like in the
morning because it seems like it would
really really help to put moisture back
into your skin which hyaluronic acid is
really good at doing and then I has
salicylic acid which helps clear out
your pores so I was excited to use these
I think maybe I'll use them in the
morning maybe at night I'm not
sure let me know if you guys have tried
those and how you use them and okay
let's move on to bama body works they
were having their semi-annual sale so i
picked up I didn't pick up like tons and
tons of stuff I'm I only picked up one
handle a three wood candle of course
it's watched my video whoa what okay if
you guys watched my video about two
weeks ago I did a halt and I ha like a
bajillion Campbell so I really only need
it I didn't need to I only wanted to get
one this is the twisted peppermint three
wick candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I
really like this scent just smells like
peppermint not a lot not a whole lot
going on there but it's really really
nice it says merry and bright peppermint
celebrates the season with notes of
vanilla and she agreed musk in this
cheer field sent and i thought i would
burn this in the beauty room just
because it's white and it kind of
matches the little area back there i'll
probably switch it out with the 1i have
there which is fresh sparkling snow i'm
getting a little sick of that scent i am
one of those people I like to switch
them out so I mean I'll reuse them so
i'll put that went away and then i'll
put this one in and then i'll go back to
that one at some point but i think i
want to put this in later today so I'm
excited for that I got so much stuff
everywhere and then I picked up two of
the aromatherapy hand soaps for my
boyfriend he loves these these are his
favorite so I got the eucalyptus
spearmint which he really likes and the
orange ginger the orange ginger scent is
amazing if you guys have never smelled
that it is so good it's very very
uplifting and beautiful kinda reminds me
of this satsumas actually all right and
then I got the spice Apple toddy this is
one of their decorative hand soaps I
really love these bottles I think
they're so pretty and all of the hand
soaps were only three dollars apiece you
could get the foaming ones the
decorative ones the deep cleansing any
formula for only um three dollars so
this is the spice Apple toddy it smells
really good it is a mix of apple cider
vanilla brandy and a dollop of whipped
cream and it just smells like apple
really really good I like it a lot and
again I think those bottles are adorable
you can take the peels off like that you
can when you're done with it you can
take the little wrapper off and then you
can just use it in your bathroom if you
want to just fill it up with other soap
and I picked up another decorative hand
soap this is the shimmer champagne
shimmer and champagne I've never seen
this scent before I just thought it was
really pretty a pretty color to kind of
like light pink really really nice it
smells like um Prosecco or something
like that I don't know I minded me of
the new year so I picked that up sorry
guys I'm running out of space to put
these things and then of course I picked
up the deep cleansing hand soap and
black cherry Merlot I love this scent
from band the Bombers it's amazing it is
an addictive blend and yes it is
addictive okay it's absolutely addictive
an addictive blend of dark cherry black
raspberry and scrumptious Merlot and it
just smells so good it's really really
deep and it smells like a black cherry
or something oh if you guys have never
smelled that scent from bath of my works
you need to and I talked about this in
my weekly favorites they need to make a
three wit candle in that sense it's so
good all right and then also for my
boyfriend I got him the eucalyptus deep
cleansing soap eucalyptus mint sorry
it's a refreshing scent of fresh mint
Chris Cooper little hola Chris
eucalyptus sorry guys if I seem a lil
hyper I had a coffee today so you know
Chris yoga lyptus and sweet Clarice
stage smells really really good it's
right up his alley because he really
likes those aromatherapy ones I thought
you would probably like that one because
if that eucalyptus scent in it and then
I picked up one of the foaming hand
soaps just because these are gentle on
the skin and I have started to get more
like eczema and dryness on my hands on
my wrist which happens every year during
the winter and these are a lot more
gentle than the deep cleansing it's a
this one's called oh snap jolly
gingerbreads gentle foaming hand soap
it's a party it's not a party without a
gingerbread man really really cute and I
like these little chunky bottles this
smells good just like gingerbread and
then the last thing i got my god this
bag is so big okay put that down the
last thing I got from Bath and Body
Works where the wallflowers these are
little duo's these were also i think
three dollars this is a vanilla
snowflake which is just a blend of icy
mint and sweet vanilla and peppermint so
I thought that sounded really really
good alright and onto the last thing I
wanted to show you guys a few things
that i got from barnes &amp;amp; noble i went in
there wanting to get a book and guess
what i got no book
this is administer you guys what I got
the first two things they don't really
cute like stationery and things like
that so the first two things I got were
little petite notes and it's because
when I do giveaways and things like that
I do like to write a little note and pop
it in the box when I send you guys
you're like gift or your um yeah your
gift I guess so i like to pop in like a
little note and right now i have like
stationery that's like hot pink and it's
really really cute but i just thought
that these were even cuter these ones
are owned this says the hummingbird
bakery it's 32 mini cards complete with
envelopes and these are cupcakes look at
it how cute is that like who doesn't
want a cupcake card right and then these
ones have cats on them because I am a
crazy cat lady so these are 12 folded
notes with envelopes and they have
little kitties on them I thought those
were adorable and then I also got a
coloring book wow I sound like a child
but these are really really cool these
coloring books are super difficult super
super difficult um like when I see
difficult I mean difficult do you guys
see this stuff like this is not for
children this is for grown adult these
are really really hard designs and I
find it really really nice at night time
to kind of go through some of this stuff
and a color because it's just I don't
know I find it very calming I'm not
great at like drawing or coloring I'm
left-handed which I think makes it even
worse for me I don't know why I'm always
smudging stuff on my hand and whatnot
but um these are very very difficult but
really really beautiful and I like to do
these when I'm on a plane or if I'm
taking the train somewhere if I have a
long drive um as long as I take my
Dramamine I'm not getting carsick I like
to just draw on these because it takes a
really long time and it just distracts
your mind I'm gonna ask the like doing
them at night so I got that and then to
go with that I did get a package of 10
these are micro line color pens and
they'd have really really tiny little
tips so they can get into all those
small little spaces you get a red one a
yellow green blue purple brown and then
a black so really really excited
they are pigmented no bleeds 0.45
millimeter tips they're going to be
great so that is my holly hope you guys
enjoyed this I know was kind of random
um but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
