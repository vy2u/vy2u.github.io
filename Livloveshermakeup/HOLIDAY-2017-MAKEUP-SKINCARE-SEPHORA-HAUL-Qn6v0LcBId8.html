my channel happy Tuesday today I do have
a skincare and basically a makeup
holiday 2017 kit sets palette sorta haul
from Sephora to share with you guys
today now I want to say before we jump
into this video because I know I'm going
to get questions in the comment section
I want to make it very clear and there
will not be a dedicated review on every
single palette in kit that I share in
this particular video the one eye shadow
palette that I did pick up I will have a
dedicated review with swatches in
comparison going up for you guys
tomorrow but I really just don't have
time I am so behind on videos right now
you guys have no idea if you follow me
on snapchat you probably know but I am
really really behind on videos right now
so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and do
a ginormous follow up haul for you guys
next week where I give you my first
impressions as well as my final thoughts
on all these little sets and kits I
really would love to be able to do a
dedicated review on everything but like
I said I'm very behind up videos right
now there are other videos that need to
get up that are more time-sensitive so I
hope you guys can understand but anyway
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
want to start with the Kat Von D Saint
and sinner eyeshadow palette so I picked
this up when I first released which was
about a week ago I have been playing
with this for about 4 days now I will
have my review swatches in comparison
going up tomorrow this is really really
nice you guys I would highly recommend
going ahead and jumping on this I do
have it on at my eyes today I think this
packaging is just absolutely amazing
what I really like about this particular
eyeshadow palette is the fact that you
really can create more neutral eye looks
when you first look at it it doesn't
really seem like it is a palette that
you could create super super neutral eye
looks withing but I have a pretty
neutral eye look on today and then I
took this shade right here which is
called Exodus and I put that on the
inner corner of my eye or kind of on
like the inner third of my lid I guess
you could say this is a really
interesting palette I will say these are
very very firmly pressed so if you don't
like to spend time blending this is not
going to be the palette for you but
overall I would say this definitely
takes second place next to the metal
matte palette from last year I do still
prefer the metal matte palette just
because I love the metal crush formula
but overall I really like all the
different finishes in here I love the
colors and I think this is a good
holiday palette
that is the first item and that I picked
up up next I have some bite Beauty
little amuse-bouche lipstick kind of kit
so and this first one is actually from
the unloose bush liquefied lipstick line
and now for me and I have actually never
tried these before a lot of people are
recommending I go ahead and pick this
little set up because apparently these
liquid lipsticks do not dry down they
remain kind of glossy and pretty on the
lips and you guys know I don't love a
super super drying liquid lipstick so
let's go ahead and open this up I have
not even swatched these yet so we're
gonna do that together and this is what
they look like on the inside they're
super super tiny but that's okay I never
I never really go through lip products
except for the one that I went through
yesterday in my empties video but
whatever alright so the first one we
have here is called a whip and this is
just the cutest packaging ever
this is adorable really nice kind of
velvet feeling sort of similar to like
the NARS packaging and this is what the
applicator looks like it looks like has
a really nice little applicator a little
bit of an indent and a dip so you can
really get into all the little areas but
yeah let's go ahead and swatch it whip
so here is what whip looks like
beautiful beautiful kind of cool toned
neutral shade it definitely leans a
little more cool toned but it still has
that neutral undertone going on there
it's a beautiful kind of Grey's beige
nude color these do smell like lemon
which a lot of the amuse-bouche formulas
do you smell like this from my beauty so
I'm not surprised up next we have this
guy which is called braised it this is
what it looks like it's a nice kind of
berry color and I always feel like any
bite to beauty lip sets are so nice
around the holiday season I always get
them every single year if you guys watch
my holiday 2017 beauty releases part 2
video you know that I wanted to pick
these sets up so that is a breeze that
looks like really really nice kind of
burnt I would think it's almost like a
burnt red color it's got a little bit of
like an orange e undertone I have no
idea if it's gonna pick up on camera but
that's what Brees looks like and I
really do like that these are remaining
pretty glossy and they're super
pigmented which I feel
you know that's a typical by beauty
thing very very pigmented lipsticks all
right up next we have flambe which is a
gorgeous gorgeous true red so let's go
ahead and swatch this little guy I love
this packaging whose back into use just
so cute all right this one is more of a
true orange red I hope that that's gonna
pick up on camera but there is flambe
and then finally the last one that we
have in this tiny little liquid lipstick
sect is this guy which is called let's
see here what are you called dim blasts
a dumb blonde say guys I just where I
got this packaging is so tiny I can
never read the names on my by beauty a
little minis but here is what it looks
like this is a gorgeous color I feel
like I never see colors like this invite
Beauty set so that is really really nice
it's like a brown cool tone brown and
gray it mixed together so that is the
little liquefied lipstick set I believe
this retails for $22 so it will keep you
guys updated on that and give you my
final thoughts in my follow up all of
next week and then of course I have to
go ahead and pick up this little guy
that comes in the little red tin I get
these every single year I've gotten them
for the past like three or four years
and this is the bite to beauty the
perfect bite app that mu talk face so if
this is what it looks like and it says
joy on here and the tin this year
actually has a little bit of like a
metallic finish which i think is so cool
because metallic a liquid lipsticks and
all that kind of stuff just metallic
finishes in general are very in right
now so this is what the little minis
look like and I do find that these kind
of break easily so you have to be kind
of careful but the first one we have
here is honeycomb now honeycomb is one
of my favorite nudes from bite Beauty I
actually have this in full-size and I do
have this from last year's set as well
but it's like the most perfect a
gorgeous kind of nude color you know
what let me go ahead and swatch it on
this side let's see if I could do this
with my right hand I am left-handed so
let's see let's see there yeah now I did
it all right so this is honeycomb it's a
beautiful cool tone kind of nude shade I
really really love this on me personally
I do pull a cool undertone not really
right now I'm a little more artificially
tanned but I really love this shade so
that is the first one next up we have
sugar cane and this one actually looks
super super light kind of like it has a
bit of a lilac undertone so that will be
kind of interesting yeah it's pretty
it's kind of like a light pink with a
little bit of a lilac undertone so that
is as much
just you get if you guys are curious
this little set right here retails for
$25 every single year I think it's such
a great little stocking stuffer I always
end up picking up three or four of these
I'll probably pop one of them in my
60,000 subscriber giveaway as well when
that comes up all right the next sheet
that we have here gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous this one is called rhubarb
rhubarb is a color that they have had in
their like pencil form before I remember
getting this years ago probably in like
the 2014 holiday kits but this one looks
a little more cool toned I don't
remember rhubarb being this cool tone
but that is what it looks like has a
little bit of a berry of a purple
undertone so really excited for that and
then finally we have cayenne and I'm
guessing that this is gonna be a bright
red color there you go cayenne pepper
kind of color
and this is just a beautiful beautiful
it's got like a blue undertone that
perfect perfect red that will make your
teeth look super super white so that is
the bite Beauty a moose bush lipstick
and then the liquefied a lipstick set so
very excited for those definitely will
keep you guys updated it and then as far
as makeup is concerned the last item I
got here is the market Jacobs velvet
noir major volume on mascara and now
again if you guys saw my holiday 2017
and Beauty releases wish list you know
that I really wanted to pick something
up from the holiday collection as far as
Marc Jacobs is concerned they are a
cruelty free brand or at least their
beauty line is their perfumes are not
but their beauty line is and I really
missed out last year I didn't pick up
anything from their holiday collection
so I was looking at the palette and I
thought the palette looked really really
nice but as far as colorful shadows are
concerned I always go for the Kat Von D
holiday palette so I skipped on the
palette and I decided to get this
instead look at this packaging
why can we just take a moment how cute
is that it definitely doesn't feel as
weighted as I thought it would I have
heard this is a really really awesome
mascara as well it kind of has a similar
bun to like the two base of better than
sex so I'm very excited I don't know why
I want to smell it but I do which is
smelled like a normal mascara so yeah
that is the last little makeup item I
got all right guys moving on to skincare
sets sorry about that how to take a
little bit of a break there to remove
those swatches from my hands they were
starting to stain already and I didn't
want to have to deal with that before
going to work so and
let's go ahead and move on to skincare
we have the first little set here which
is from drunk elephants now I was very
excited to get my hands on this this is
an $88 set but it is $118 value it is
called become see about me a skin a
story so anchor you are getting a full
size of the C from a day serum you are
getting a little mini of the best
e-jelly cleanser you are getting a mini
of the Umbra sheer physical daily
defense sunblock as well as the deluxe
size of the be Hydra intensive hydration
gel so here's what it looks like on the
inside I think that this is just like
the perfect cute little skincare set for
the holiday season I think I'm gonna go
ahead and pick up another one of these
for my mom during the holiday season but
here is the first item so this is the B
Hydra intensive hydration gel I've only
tried this once I don't remember being
the biggest fan but I think if I mix
this together with a little bit of oil
it will actually be more moisturizing
for my skin so I'm excited for that guy
and then right here you guys know I love
a new bestie cantaloupe jelly cleanser
from drunk elephant this is great if you
have more normal to dry skin would
HIGHLY highly recommend this I'm
actually going out of town this weekend
so I'll probably take this little guy
with me it's up next we have the upper
sheer physical daily defense
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen this has
20% zinc oxide in there which i think is
fantastic I definitely prefer a physical
sunblock for me personally so I'm
excited to try this out I've heard
really really good things from Stephanie
Nicole on this particular little guy so
excited for that baby and then of course
you get the full size of the C from add
a serum now I'm not a huge fan of their
overnight glycolic serum but I really do
like the C Pharma I think this is really
really nice we're brightening up
pigmentation on the skin and it's just
overall a very good a vitamin C product
so very very very excited for that guy
right there so that is the a drug
elephant holiday set and I think that
that is a great value and definitely
something you should check out if you
are interested in drug elephant all
right and then the other skincare set
that I picked up is from Olay Henriksen
this is called the twelve days of Olay
aglow it is $69 a $108 value and this is
actually a napkin calendar and now I
know I'm probably breaking some rules
here by opening this up before Christmas
but I am NOT a you know I'm not a
religious person so I'm just gonna go
ahead and crack this baby open I
celebrate Christmas because that's was
the time that my family gets together
and all that kind of stuff but there's
no way in how I'm waiting till December
to open this but if you do want to get
this for someone as an advent calendar I
think it's really cool when we first saw
this on the sephora.com website I felt
that there were repeats here but these
are all different products so let me
walk you guys through what you get in
here the first item you get is the clean
at root foaming cleanser you also get
the invigorating night treatment and gel
you are going to the counterbalance oil
control hydrator you are getting the
truth serum at the transforming walnut
scrub the shear transformation
perfecting a moisturizer and the
uplifting transformation eye creme the
appear true the youth activating oil you
are getting the nurture be moisturizing
cream at the pore balancing of facial
sauna scrub and the uplifting
transformation eye gel and the force of
nature intensive hand cream so you're
getting a lot of products here from Olli
Hendrickson they are a cruelty free
brand I think a lot of people don't know
that their skin care products are
cruelty free but they are so this is a
great way to sample out some of the only
Hendrix and uh products so here is what
the admin calendar looks like you guys
and it opens up and it's cute so
we're gonna go ahead and open something
in here because I'm not waiting to open
this baby up a couple of these I'll
probably pop into my 60k a giveaway just
because I know that there are a few
items here that I'm not in love with but
let's go ahead and open day as six right
here just randomly alright here is the
only Hendrix in the clean truth foaming
cleanser so as you guys can probably see
it this is the nice size these are nice
sizes that you're getting here let's
open up day to feel so bad already
ripping open an app in calendar but it's
okay here is day two this is the Olay
Henriksen transform shear transformation
perfecting moisturizer not a huge fan of
this I have tried this before so I'm
going to go ahead and put that in a
giveaway but as you guys can see you
just kind of pushed on the little area
and it will pop out to the product which
i think is adorable so let's go ahead
and open day three right here try and do
this on camera you open it up and
there's the little item which i think is
adorable this particular one right here
is from the oil line or the oil like
perfecting line so the green line is
really nice if you do have oily skin
this is the poor balancing facial sauna
scrub it has volcanic sand
has green fusion complex new seed oil
and a cheese I've never tried this out
so I'm excited to try that out but yeah
that was basically the only Henrickson
little skincare set here at so many
different products that you get to try
out from them would highly recommend I
mean you can rip yours open like I did
or you can actually use it as a guide a
map in calendar so anyway guys and now
I'm going to go ahead and grab all of
these samples and the 500-point perks
sets that I got so let me go grab those
and I'll be right back in the back ok so
there weren't any samples that I could
see that were cruelty free so I skipped
on samples however I did it get some
point perks as well as I guess these are
all point Bourg
so papers later might have here is the
Stila huge extreme at mascara so and
this is something that I tried out
probably about two years ago I was not a
fan of it I was not a fan of it and I
can't really remember why so I thought
I'd give it another go I remember this
having incredibly incredibly wet formula
to it but it has the same wand as the
Marc Jacobs mascara I showed you guys
earlier in the video as well as like the
Too Faced better than sex mascara so
we'll see how that goes I just remember
it being kind of like it with what we
was very non-transfer proof but I
thought I'd try it out one more time so
that is the steal a huge extreme mascara
up next we have they believe the true
cream a moisturizing balm it means this
was 100 or 250 Point Park and I really
do enjoy products from believe I love it
they are aqua balm I love the
moisturizing balm so I went ahead and
picked to that little baby up and then
finally I picked up a 500-point perk I
saw this one from bareMinerals and I
don't know I have this like weird
love-hate relationship with products
from bare minerals I find them to be a
very very boring brand but I thought I'd
go ahead and take this out because I had
a lot of points and I was like whatever
might go yes so let's go ahead and open
it up inside of here you get a little
brush so this is the tiny little brush
you get I remember very minerals brushes
they used to be like the only ones that
I would use but then when I serve is
like trying them out after really
getting into makeup and really getting
into like good brushes I remember than
being quite Scratchy
so this one doesn't feel bad but I don't
know what I would use this for maybe
like a facial a high leg is nice and
densely packed would probably get that
product on there really nicely but I
can imagine using this hurt bullish
because it's super super densely packed
but anyway though this is the very
minerals full-face flawless brush I
guess you could probably pair it
together with this little guy this is
the bare minerals mineral veil I've
always had this product was just okay
nothing special um but I thought you
know - what more come and try it again
up next we have the lash domination
mascara from bareMinerals I remember
enjoying this so I'm excited to try out
this little guy again I remember at
having a crazy one
yeah it has like this like serpent wand
you see this is like twirling around it
looks really really scary like a
medieval torture device but that's okay
well go ahead and try that out and then
here we have the bare minerals this is
one of their infamous like matte liquid
lipsticks and it's actually called
infamous okay well let's go ahead and
actually swatch it so this is what the
applicator looks like to see that little
like amount of product on the top there
that looks really weird but holy crap
the pigment on this do you guys see that
oh it smells like candy I hope they're
not too drying I've actually heard good
things about these I think these are
from the generation nude lipstick line
so and that is just a beautiful amount
of pigment and that is a gorgeous shade
and infamous so excited to try that out
on my lips and then finally we have this
guy this is the bareMinerals primetime
original foundation primer I have never
ever tried this out but I remember Sarah
Rihanna talking about how much she loves
this so I hope that it will work for me
as well so anyway guys that is it - that
is it for my quality 2017 at makeup and
skincare haul from Sephora I hope you
guys enjoyed this video like I said I
will have you follow up haul going up
exactly a week from today so thanks
again for joining me and I guess I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
