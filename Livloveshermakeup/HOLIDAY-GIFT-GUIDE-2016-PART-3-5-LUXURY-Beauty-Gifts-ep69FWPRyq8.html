thank you so much for joining me happy
Thursday today's video is going to be
part 3 of my holiday gift guide and I
did five minute makeup today it did not
even fill in my brows so if I look a
little plain Jane or basic and that is
why because I'm feeling playing jada
basic so anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into this originally I was going
to share with you guys beauty related
items that were luxury and also non
beauty related but I decided to kind of
switch it up a bit because a lot of the
non beauty related items that I was
sharing with you guys are actually items
that i'll be sharing what i do thee what
to get him for the holidays video and
that will be on tuesday so today I
thought we could kind of do like a top
five series on like the top five luxury
items that I think of somebody would be
very appreciative to receive for the
holiday season so let's go ahead and get
started the first recommendation is
definitely a holiday palette or a very
luxurious holiday palette and this
little guy here is from Bobbi Brown this
is the shimmer brick a Bobby to glow
shimmer brick palette you get three
different highlights in here and I think
this is best for those with like a
medium to dark complexion so you are
getting a wild roche d you are getting a
bronze shade and also a gold shade it
will still show up on those who do have
like a fair complexion but i think for
those who do have like more of a medium
to deep complexion this is a really
really wonderful palette to get also
chanel and like Dior come out with
holiday palettes I don't know if I just
mentioned that but they do have out with
their own little holiday palettes as
well that are very luxurious and
beautiful and for those who do have more
of a fair to light complexion I would
highly recommend the hourglass ambient
lighting edits surreal light palette
you're not getting a whole lot of
product in here but this does retail for
eighty dollars it is absolutely
beautiful it's what I have on my face
today I'm wearing this along with the
strobing powder as my highlight and this
blush down here on my cheek so those are
the first items i would highly recommend
number two would definitely be a
full-sized perfume so I feel like lots
of sets and kids come out this time of
year with a little deluxe size perfumes
that I showed like in yesterday's video
part 2 but I think if you have a friend
who has a signature scent and they only
wear one perfume it would be really
really sweet to go ahead and pick up a
full-size for them so both of these are
one of fluid ounce and this one right
here is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana
bourbon perfume it's beautiful really
nice in woods
I think it cost eighty five dollars for
one fluid ounce and then right here i
have the victor and well flower bomb for
this it was like 115 or 120 for one
fluid ounce they do offer a really big
bottle that you can purchase for like
two hundred dollars and again if your
friend has like a signature scent and
they love that sense then i think that
is just super luxurious and beautiful to
receive so anyway that is the second
recommendation the third recommendation
is definitely a clarisonic i think that
these are just really nice items to have
i would recommend this one from those of
you who have sensitive combination and
also more oily acne prone skin I feel
like clarisonic is great at cleansing
and helping to dissipate pink punk bit
pitbull be perfect pimples and also
breakouts on the skin and i think that
the cashmere luxe brush head this one
right here is so freaking silky and soft
guys it's the best one you can find so i
would highly recommend checking out the
mia and then also i want to go ahead and
recommend as number for the luna for rio
mini because i do think this is nice for
those of you with more mature and dry
skin so this is really beautiful as well
and you do have like the cleansing side
over here and then this side helps to
massage in not only serums but also any
sort of product that you put on your
skin so moisturize or things like that
so this is also another really luxurious
little gift to get this is the mini
version which i believe was around
ninety nine dollars they do have a
sensitive student version and a normal
skin version that are around 160 and for
both the clarisonic and the luna you can
get little kits around this time of year
that come with different replacement
brush heads and also different cleansers
and things like that so those are three
and four and finally number five is
something that I do every single year
for one of my friends at work so i guess
this year last year so my friend at work
i really really loves these chanel bran
and something that i'd like to do is
basically put together a little sampler
pack of chanel products for her so just
for reference i wanted to show some why
i sell products because YSL is currently
my favorite luxury brands so i'm here i
have the YSL to shake off this is the
blurring the primer here we have like
the YSL veloped engine oil one of the
left knee i live pop water glossy stains
and then the YSL babydoll mascara why
not go ahead and choose that like the
best products from the line and kind of
put them together in like a little
sampler pack and then either tie a
ribbon around it putting in a stocking
stuffer you know use it as a stocking
stuffer whatever you want to do i think
some
would be very very appreciative to get
that kind of stuff because I think all
of these together are around two hundred
dollars so that is a very very luxurious
a little gift idea or again you can go
ahead and just get like one of you why I
sell pallets or Chanel or do your things
like that so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed these top of five ideas as far
as like luxury picks for the holiday
season are concerned these are my top
five thank you so much for joining me
guys and I will see you tomorrow for a
solo appalled by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
