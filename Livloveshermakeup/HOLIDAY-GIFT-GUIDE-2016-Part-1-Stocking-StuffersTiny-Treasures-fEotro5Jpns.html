I hope you are all having a wonderful
day today's video is going to be part 1
out of 3 well technically four of my
holiday gift guide series or video so I
did one of these last year in 2015 and I
really enjoyed doing it however I stress
myself out and I made myself do it all
in one video I don't know why I didn't
just break it up I am definitely
breaking it up this year so today we're
going to talk about stocking stuffers or
tiny treasures I didn't want to just
call it stocking stuffers because
obviously not everybody celebrates
Christmas but these are all items that
are under like twenty dollars or fifteen
dollars that you can either pop in a
stocking or you can wrap up or put a
little bow on them whatever cute little
gift ideas like that tomorrow we will
talk about makeup sets and kiss so
anything ranging from nine dollars all
the way up to like 60 or 70 dollar
eyeshadow palettes I think are great
quality that you could pick up for gifts
and then finally on Friday is it
Wednesday today wait Wednesday tomorrow
Thursday we will go ahead and we will
talk about extravagant luxuries and when
I say that I don't mean like seven
hundred dollar face creams I'm talking
more about like I don't know maybe I'll
toss my keurig in now but great
extravagant luxury I think beauty items
that are kind of extravagant sunday
riley skin care products clarisonic luna
stuff like that so anyway those are the
three that we will be talking about this
week and then next week you guys
requested that I do a what to get him
for the holidays video I had to ask Tom
for help with this one so I asked him
out of the three years we've been
together I said what are your favorite
items that I have gotten you for
Christmas so he did pull a few items out
and i will share those and then i texted
my brother and I was like Alexander help
me what are your favorite items that I
got you for Christmas so I will also go
ahead and share that because tom is a
little more um I don't know my brother's
kind of a hipster he's really cute so
he's kind of like a hipster and then tom
is a little more like professional so I
think that'll have a nice amount of more
like laid-back kind of gifts you can get
your boy friend or loved one or spouse
or whatever and then of course Tom may
be a little more techy high-end kind of
stuff so anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into this video we are going to
start with makeup items that I think fit
perfectly into stockings or just little
items that you can wrap up for it the
holidays so the first thing I want to
say is mascara I feel like mascara fits
perfectly inside of stocking so this
particular one is from l'oreal this is
the voluminous feline mascara the sheet
is called 627 blackest black I have not
even
open this yet that's why I wanted to
show it I haven't even tried it yet so
I'm not recommending this particular
mascara I'm just saying mascaras in
general two of my favorites from the
drugstore are definitely the clump
crusher from covergirl and also the
falsies push-up drama from Maybelline
those are very good I also think a
little mini palettes like this are great
for stocking stuffers are just tiny
little treasures so this is the little
quad here from Maybelline this is called
the copper chic and number 70 I studio
palette these are very very good quality
and again very tiny and cute you can get
a lot of those on sale too sometimes I
find them buy one get one fifty percent
off at the drugstore and also of course
I want to talk about wet'n'wild you can
get there 8pm palettes for buy one get
one fifty percent off usually around the
holidays at Walgreens and if you are
like shopping for someone who's already
a huge makeup addict and they do already
have these I promise you you will find
something else because they constantly
released a limited edition collection so
you can get them limited edition ones
but these are both permanent this little
guy is a trio called I'm getting
sunburned which is my all-time favorite
and then the little eight pan palette
that I like the most from wet and wild
is comfort zone which looks a little
something like this minus all beat up
and worn down but that is what it looks
like really really good quality and then
the final little one I want to recommend
is from the profusion brand so recently
when I was in my Alta I saw that
profusion was on sale fri 545 so you
literally could get five with their
palettes for five dollars you could
literally just pop them into all your
friends stockings or whatever and my
personal favorite is the runway
eyeshadow glamour palette in Barry bloom
this is what it looks like even if you
can't find the 545 this was only 299 at
my Ulta so this is what it looks like on
the inside these are actually really
nice quality shadows right here you guys
can see I've dug into this quite a bit
I've had this for about two years now it
has made it through to declutter series
so I really do think that that is good
quality alright let's go ahead and move
on to some skincare items i will say
little samples of mass and also sheet
masks are great for stocking stuffers or
just small gifts in general so I do have
a one here that I absolutely adore I
love these secret garden on pool or on
pool a mass so this little one is the
olive oil 1 they also have a camellia
one which is really good quality and
then also Sephora does make sheet masks
as well they're not my all-time favorite
but this one is the rose one which is my
favorite out of
all of them they do have like a ginseng
version they have a lemon version they
have pomegranate they are all sorts of
different stuff so I think these are
very very easy to gift and very very
cute and then I also want to recommend
little deluxe ice samples that maybe you
just have lain around I have a ton of
these little glam glow thirsty mud
hydrating treatments I mean I think I
counted out 15 today so I'm going to go
ahead and drop those into some stockings
for the holiday season because they're
just so cute and tiny and easy to use
also I want to go ahead and recommend
nail polish so my favorite formulation
of nail polish is from wet and wild now
i'm not a huge nail polish buff but i
will say the mega last collection from
wet'n'wild is amazing i really really
like this they have an amazing wand it's
very very big and flat but i swear it
just goes on so nicely these are very
very pigmented and very opaque when you
first apply them so I really enjoy this
this particular shade is 217 B Disturbia
but they have a whole selection of
different colors that you can choose
from and limited edition shades for the
holidays and then I think a really cute
thing to do is put in a like kind of
just regular color and then go ahead and
throw in like a glitter that you can put
on top so this is from alpha this is the
nail polish in the shade love me and
it's just a beautiful beautiful red
glitter shade that you could top with
either either disturbia or any sort of
shade so I think that's really really
cute nail polish is great for that also
of course i have to mention some things
for Bath and Body Works um I will say
wallflowers if you are someone who is
gifting for someone who does live in
like a dorm and they can't be burning
candles of course I want to recommend
three wit candles to you guys they don't
necessarily fit in stockings very well
but you could definitely just put a bow
on it and put like put in a little box
or something like that and gifted would
be adorable but I think well flowers are
a great way to kind of get into the
different scents from bath and body
works you can get little duo packs like
this for three dollars and fifty cents
sometimes on sale and the actual little
Wallflower plugs you can get very basic
ones we have ones in our living room
that are just solid black but then the
ones in the beauty room are actually
shaped like little sons like you can get
tons of cute stuff like that so this
little duo pack here is called tis the
season I just think this is a fun way to
try things out and even if you don't
want to get a dual pack you can get them
in single form just like this so if
you're someone who had is a little more
sensitive to fragrance maybe you don't
want a candle or you
burn candles in the situation that
you're in that I would definitely look
into those for yourself but also for
your friends and family and of course
something I want to recommend that's
kind of a two in one product from their
aromatherapy line of Bath and Body Works
is the stress relief sandalwood rose
body wash and foam bath so you don't
have to get this particular scent the
reason I wanted to recommend these is
because they're very tightly sealed as
you guys can see and they do fit into
stockings very very easily so they're
kind of perfect for that but this is a
body wash and foam bath and one so it's
kind of like a 2-1 product you can also
pick up the philosophy ones on Alta
makes like a three-in-one Beauty
smoothie I think those are great for
popping inside of stockings and then of
course i also want to recommend soap
because i think soap is something that
everybody actually uses and does like so
about the Body Works has their deep
cleansing hand soaps or any sort of
their formulation of hand soaps on sale
right now for like two or three dollars
so this particular one is winter citrus
wreath it is a blend of beautiful balsam
breathe accented with fresh citrus and
you can find any sort of sense that just
smells amazing and then I did a pic this
little guy up from Ulta how cute is this
it says to and from right here and this
is in the scent um I believe it's called
like plum Bellini or something like that
so I got two purple ones and a gold one
I'm going to be giving two away in my
20k a holiday giveaway but yeah I think
these are adorable it's called winter
Velva sorry the scent but how cute is
this just to have out like you know in
the sink in the kitchen or wherever you
want I just think that this is really
really cute and then I do want to also
talk a little bit about like a makeup
pouches so this may seem strange but if
you are someone who does subscribe to
like Beauty subscription boxes or even
just bags like it see you probably have
a lot of these little bags sitting
around even if you're not subscribed to
them maybe you do have something from so
for that you got like a bunch of samples
in I swear like what have the favorite
things that I like to do during this
holiday season is go ahead and fill
these up with samples and then pop them
in a stocking so go ahead and look at
some samples that you have if you do
shop at Sephora chances are you do have
samples and sometimes they send you
shades that just don't work for you or
if you want something and you've already
tried it or something like that
you didn't really like it you can go
ahead and put it in one of these cute
little pouches and then pop it in a
stocking or just wrap it up put a bow on
it whatever these are very cute little
bags this little one I got from Ipsy I
mean they're all super super adorable
and you know you can never have enough
makeup bags honestly you guys if you are
someone who really does use a lot of
makeup it's always nice to have
everything encased in here so here's a
perfect example of an Ipsy bag right
here that i have already stuffed for one
of my friends during the holiday season
so that is what it looks like on the
inside even if they are like a close
friend of yours you can give away some
decluttered items that maybe you haven't
used too much so I think that is
adorable and a nice way to kind of save
some money do if you don't want to spend
too much on stocking stuffers also t you
guys know I'm a huge tea drinker I
really love these little teavana like 2
ounce containers so this first one here
is chocolate chai I mean it's just
really really festive these little
containers don't open very easily so
they're kind of perfect to go ahead and
pop in a stocking they do have the
little lid there but yeah these are
loose leaf teas you also can pick up
like the perfect tea maker which is
around 25 dollars I didn't want to show
anything over twenty dollars in this
because it's just for kind of stocking
stuffers or small gifts but you can also
go ahead and do that but how cute are
these they're just gold and you know
they're super festive for the holidays
this one right here is Earl Grey creme
so you can get really flavored ones or
you can go ahead and you can just pick
up the basics like green tea black tea
and then you could even just tie a
little ribbon around the two of these
and give them I think that that's a
really cute idea also if you are someone
who has maybe a daughter who's a little
bit on the younger side and maybe
they're starting to get into like makeup
and things like that the reason I wanted
to talk about this was because I'm a
teacher and I do see a lot of like
younger girls that are kind of getting
into makeup they kind of want to wear
perfume they kind of want to do stuff
like that but maybe you just don't feel
like they're ready a really cute thing
that you can do is go ahead and get them
a little hand sanitizer and a body mist
from Bath and Body Works oh and they're
gonna feel like they're cute and girly
because you can get them matching like
this this is twisted peppermint and even
if you're not a young girl I still use
stuff like this okay but this is a
little pocket back it's very heavily
fragrance and obviously just sanitizes
the hands but then you can get them a
little fine fragrance mist like this so
usually they have I believe three four
five dollars on sale during the holidays
there are larger versions that you can
buy of this particular product but I
think the little
mini ones are adorable during the
holidays so you can go ahead and give
them one of that because you know maybe
you don't want your I don't know
eight-year-old nine-year-old
ten-year-old wearing like your Chanel
perfume or something so I think that's a
really cute idea and also I mean I'm 24
years old I still like this a lot so I
think they're perfect for stockings and
then the final item that I want to
mention again if maybe you don't want to
go out and be buying a ton of stuff if
you shop at Sephora there are chances
that you have picked up these little
perfumes here that are like 250 or 350
450 points so basically you get these
little tiny glass bottles of actual
perfumes and chances are you never
actually get to them because i have a
whole little container here that has
just been sitting with them in there and
they're adorable to look at but also
they're adorable to pop inside one of
these little bags or something and then
give to someone so this right here is
flower bomb here we have like a tory
burch again so cute this is like the
perfect example of a tiny treasure in my
opinion here's a little burberry one
hears versace you know chances are that
you probably have a few of these misty
or I mean how cute is that and this is a
great way to go ahead and let your
friends try out some different
fragrances you can even pop in like a
handful of them fill it up in a little
bag or something like that I think that
that's really adorable so anyway those
are my gift ideas for stocking stuffers
and tiny treasures I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I will see you
tomorrow we will talk about more
expensive items will talk about makeup
or talk about little tiny kits and gift
sets that you can get ad alta am yeah
i'll see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
