today's video is going to be part 2 of
my holiday gift guide I'm very excited
because today we are talking about
beauty or makeup sets that are anywhere
between nine dollars all the way up to
like $60 pallets that have been
favorites of mine so there are so many
beauty kits and sets that have released
this holiday season I'm not going to be
talking about every single one that I
picked up because I'm not in love with
every single one that I picked up I will
only be talking about the ones that are
my all time favorites that I think are
absolutely worth the money worth the
value all that kind of stuff so let's go
ahead and jump right into it the first
item i want to mention is the Too Faced
grand hotel cafe set this is around
forty nine dollars only to face calm
website I know currently it is sold out
but it keeps coming back in from bean
and stuck and then being sold out so
just keep your eyes peeled for it this
is what it looks like and I did a three
in one comparison video on the chocolate
shop palette to the Mary macarons or
macaroons palette and then also the
palettes that are in this little set and
hands down I think this is the best
palate little kit give set value set
whatever you want to call it that
two-faced release for the holiday season
so you open it up like this and inside
you are getting three different palettes
they each have six different eye shadows
or a blush and bronzer in them and then
also you are getting a little deluxe
sides of better than sex that mascara at
the bottom hopefully you guys can see
that so I won't say that every single
paladin here is absolutely amazing there
is one in here that I wasn't the biggest
fan of and I did go ahead and declutter
that one is called the peppermint mocha
palette but the other two pellets are
worth the 49 in my opinion so this one
right here is called gingerbread cookie
and also these would be great little
stocking stuffers if you want to break
at the kit in 23 because they do have a
to and from on the back as you guys can
see it and then also eggnog latte so
eggnog latte is probably my favorite I
love the blush in here at absolutely
beautiful this is what eggnog latte
looks like and then gingerbread cookie
has a little more warm tones and brown
tones gold tones in it so this is what
gingerbread cookie looks like the
peppermint mocha palettes had a little
more very tones in it it's not that it's
absolutely horrible it's just not my
favorite I don't think it's comparable
to the other palettes that are in this
kit but for forty nine dollars i do
think that that is a great little kit
alright moving on the next thing I want
to talk about is not necessarily this
particular one but just
sephora favorite sets or kits in general
so you can get whatever the hell you
want you can get lip kits you can get
mascara kits they even have like a
bronzer kit out right now so if you know
you are gifting someone who is
absolutely obsessed with one kind of
type or a certain category in makeup i
would say these are great so this one
was called the lash stash this is what
it looks like this was $45 us or 50 for
canadian and basically i got two
full-size mascaras a mascara primer and
then i got a bunch of little deluxe
sized mascaras from different brands
again they have this for like lip kits
that have this for skin care kits
masking kits whatever so I think these
are definitely worth looking into during
the holiday season and the boxes are
actually super super cute and decorative
so you could just pop a bow on there or
you know wrap it up however you want to
really really cute the next little set
that I want to recommend is from Ulta
this is the makeup blending sponge duo I
don't have either of them in here right
now because I just use them this morning
but this is a beautiful beautiful little
set so this is around ten dollars at
Ulta and honestly I do find these to be
very comparable or comparable to the
beauty blenders so you do get to in here
for around ten dollars I think it's
definitely worth looking into I
personally love them I think they're
very comparable to the Beauty Blender
some people say that they don't think
they are they're a little hard to the
touch I actually think they're softer
than the Beauty Blender but to each
their own I would still recommend going
ahead and at least picking it up either
gift it to yourself and at least try
them out because you're getting
basically one one of them is five
dollars or you can go ahead and give to
a friends so i would highly recommend
checking that little kit out also the
bite beauty best bite remix redux
discovery kit whatever you want to
purchase for 525 dollars not five
dollars twenty-five dollars is also a
great little set I get this every single
year it does come any little reddit in
as you guys can see there is a mirror in
here and they have so many of the kits
right now so this one has the abuse
boosh lipsticks in it it has four
different ones I don't know where my
last one is somewhere in my collection
but this is a beautiful formulation you
are getting four different lipsticks in
here for $25 yes they are kind of sample
sizes but my cutie make some of the best
lip products ever so i would highly
recommend this little kit or you can get
the best buy remix or redux the
discovery kit is great as well so i
think by beauty makes some awesome
awesome little
so during the holiday season I do have
some here that I want to talk about that
are from the body shop so the first one
is this a little kit right here this is
called the handfuls of fruity happiness
so i got this about two weeks ago i'm
obsessed with this kit so far in here
for fifteen dollars you are getting a
strawberry hand cream um I'm gonna say
watermelon a mango hand cream and also a
grapefruit cam cream I gave the mango
one to Tom's mom when she was visiting
us but I kept these strawberry in the
grapefruit I currently have the
grapefruit in my purse these are really
really nice if you didn't know the body
shop does tend to be I would say a
little more on the expensive side it's
not like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works price items
so that's why I didn't show this in the
stocking stuffers video just because I
feel like they are a little more highly
priced but these are just beautiful I
really like the consistency on these
hand cream it's super super cute I feel
like everybody gets dry hands this time
of year so this is definitely a set that
I would recommend checking out also from
the body shop they have these little
these little kids here so the first one
is called jiggle gel rock if you know
that somebody is traveling for the
holidays this is a great little thing to
have I will probably bring two of these
when I travel for Christmas this is
basically just a little thing like this
it can either be an ornament or you can
just wrap it depending on what holiday
you celebrate but in here for $25 you
are getting four different body washes
the first one is the Moringa scent which
looks a little something like this you
are also getting of these strawberry
scent and you are getting the Fuji green
tea scent and then of course my favorite
which is the Satsuma sent so I think
this is a great little deal again you
know the body shop isn't priced like a
bath and body works so they do tend to
be a little more expensive so I actually
think this is quite a good deal and
again you can go ahead and hang that on
the Christmas tree or use it as a
stocking stuffer whatever the heck you
want and then I also wanted to make
recommend this from the body shop so I
got all of these at Alta by the way if
you are curious but if you know that
someone loves a certain scent from the
body shop they are offering these little
hmm excuse me mr. Badgers here in the
room with me is been really really good
but he is making my throat itchy so if
you guys didn't know they are offering
these little $9 cubes so they have honey
mania they have mango they have
strawberry and Satsuma so if you know
someone who loves a specific
like I do from death I'm sorry from the
body shop you can get them this little
kit so in here you are getting a
colorful little soft and loofah it's
actually really nice on the body and
then you are getting a decent suma
shower gel and also the Satsuma body
wash so i will probably actually bring
this kit for the holidays as well just
because you have everything that you
need shower wise in there I think it's
absolutely adorable so I think those
kids are great from the body shop and
then also if you do want something a
little more luxurious than the body shop
hand cream set Lucy tag does release a
beautiful tiny little set of six
different hand creams every single year
so the first one I have here is called
rose this is beautiful they also have
almond milk and then they do have this
one which is cherry blossom these are
super super tiny the body shop hand
creams have one fluid ounce of product
in there so it's a little more
worthwhile however I do find that the
law c-town brand does hydrate my hands
more so if you want a little more of a
luxury gift you can get a set of six of
these for around forty dollars at
Sephora so I wanted to go ahead and
mention that and then let's talk about
like a body butter set so something that
I wasn't incredibly like impressed with
this year was the Laura Mercier creme
what was it called I think it was called
the loop ities souffle body creme
collection so I purchased that it was
like $64 for six of these little body
cremes and honestly I really really do
prefer my little body creme set from
Korres you are getting way more product
in here and you do get four different
body butters for around thirty dollars
like I said the one that you get from
Laura Mercier will set you back like $64
so I actually think that this is a great
little set if you do see the body creme
collection set on the Sephora com
website for around thirty dollars highly
recommend checking it out you are
getting for your getting a row center
also getting a fig sent you are getting
a guava scent and of course ap alert set
so just want to go ahead and point that
out as far as perfumes are concerned
there are so many great little sets
going on right now there is this little
one here from taco or toca this is on
sale right now for about ten to fifteen
dollars you have the Florence Cleopatra
and Simone sprays so yes these are in
spray form perfect for traveling perfect
for a stocking stuffer or just wrapping
up for your loved ones they also do have
this little clean rollerball right now
which is about ten dollars or maybe even
nine dollars you are
we sense air warm cotton and also skin
they smell incredibly good and they are
very very strong I'm wearing the warm
cotton today and I can still smell it I
applied it about three hours ago so
these are really really good quality as
well and then a little roller ball set
that is a little more on the expensive
side it's about thirty-six dollars for
six the little minis is the nest
fragrance sampler set so you are getting
a bunch of different ones in here likes
it clean you are getting Dahlia and
vines you are getting let's see here
midnight fluff you are getting white
sample would you are getting indigo and
you are also getting paradise and just
like a few others so this is really
great as well I do not find that these
are as strong as the clean roller balls
which you can get for ten dollars like I
said however they are still really
really good and for thirty-six dollars i
think it is worth checking out this
little set and now let's go ahead and
talk about some pallets that I really
think are worth it that are under sixty
dollars so the first one that I want to
talk about is the Tarte Amazonian clay
color wheel so I highly recommend going
ahead and checking this out in store I
have seen them at my Sephora all over
the place sometimes they go in and out
of being on stock on the actual website
but in here you are getting a warm tone
side of blushes in the Amazonian clay
formula as well as a highlighter I'm
sorry a highlighter and then on the
other side you are getting cool tone
shade so this is what I'm going to break
for Christmas when I am traveling I
think it's beautiful very compact and
only around $45 which is a very good
deal a little set that i recently picked
up another one for my giveaway is the
lorac what is this dance till dawn I and
cheek palette this is about seventeen
dollars on the altar calm website and
honestly this is really really good
quality so you are getting two different
blushes in here and six different
eyeshadows they're very creamy very very
blendable and lorac does have a lot of
different palettes out this time of year
so would highly recommend checking that
out and then I of course want to
recommend and mention my Sephora blush
bronze and ready to glow face palette I
picked another one of these up again for
my holiday giveaway or my 20k giveaway
because this is so good this is
currently on sale for $21 on the Sephora
com website you do have a cool tone
blessed year in warm tone bless you have
a bronzer and also a highlight the
highlight isn't my all-time favorite
however the blushes and the bronzer are
absolutely amazing especially for $21 so
would highly recommend
and checking out this beautiful little
palette and I also do want to recommend
this little kid here from Tarte so this
little kit is filled with a bunch of
dual sided brushes I do not like the
packaging on this but it is worth the
value in my opinion so this is what it
looks like a very very abstract kind of
reminds me of like groovy like 70s kind
of thing not personally my cup of tea
but I know a lot of people do like it on
the inside you do have a magnetic
palette and then you do have your little
brush holder over here these brushes are
very very good quality you guys and I am
definitely going to bring this when I am
traveling for the holidays so you have
this little side for blending in your
phone your concealer this side for
blending in your foundation you can put
your powder on with this you have this
little guy here you can do whatever you
want with that and then you have this
little dual ended brush here as well so
I think this is worth looking into again
this is probably i grep think around
like thirty or forty dollars really
really good set and finally the last
item I want to talk about I'm sorry I'm
like reaching over here it's like I'm
gonna drop shit but the last thing I
want to talk about that is absolutely
amazing if he kept on da metal matte
eyeshadow palette so recently when I was
in sephora they had a whole lot of these
in stock I haven't really been able to
find it on the online website so i would
recommend going in store but you are
getting so much bang for your buck with
this particular palette you are getting
foiled shades on the top and then matte
shades on the bottom it is absolutely
beautiful this is hands-down my favorite
eyeshadow palette that released this
year for the holidays so i would highly
recommend checking that out as well so
anyway guys those are my favorite sets
kids and palettes that have released for
this time of year that are under sixty
dollars i will go ahead and talk about
some more tomorrow when we do luxury
products but i hope you enjoyed this
video let me know down below if you have
any city set or kits that you would like
to recommend for everyone to check out
during the holiday season and yeah i
will see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
