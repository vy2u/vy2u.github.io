thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be my honest PR
reviews and number two so we are going
through just like PR that has been sent
to me for this month now I believe about
nine or ten different brands have
reached out to me so far I have only
accepted PR from three of them and the
reason for that is honestly just because
I've been doing the makeup declutter
series and I already have so much boxes
and makeup everywhere in the Beauty room
it's a little overwhelming at this point
so I'm sorry I didn't accept that much
PR this month if you guys didn't know I
do not have a peel box so brands don't
just like send me stuff to that directly
they have to email me first and then get
my actual home address so it's a little
trickier I'm just not ready to open up a
peel box yet because like I said I feel
like brands will just send you stuff and
not reach out to you first
and I just I just don't want that yet
I'm not ready for that yet so anyway I
accepted PR from Aussie which is
technically an influencer tour box that
was sent to me I haven't decided if I
love Influenster yet or if I'm just like
I like it or I don't like it I really
like the concept of writing reviews and
giving reviews because I just love doing
reviews either either writing them or
verbally giving them to you guys over
camera and then also I did accept some
products from the brands called Dabo and
this is through blue scandal which
basically sells a bunch of different
Korean skincare and out of just Asian
skincare in general I'll have links for
you guys down below and then also
Charlotte Lacroix so we'll go ahead and
start with these Charlotte Lacroix
products the first item that they sent
me is the activating night cream with
argan stem cells they also did send me
their Charlotte Lacroix CC cream light
and they did also send me this little
guy right here which is the red T serum
we'll go ahead and start with this one
because this is my favorite product that
they sent me it is a red T serum it is
for all sorts of different skin types
and it is one fluid ounce which is a
really really nice amount so I really
have been enjoying my contact that I've
had back and forth with this particular
brand I love their packaging this was
probably one of the most gorgeous boxes
I've ever received PR why everything was
really beautiful really beautifully put
together they came in beautiful little
white boxes and just really gorgeous the
presentation of everything so this is a
serum that you were supposed to use in
the morning and an evening it says apply
two to three drops which is really
interesting because the consistency on
this is very
different and strange and you're
supposed to put in your palm your hand
and apply it to your face and neck so
one thing I want to say is that there
are only six ingredients in this
particular serum which i think is
amazing it is basically fragrance free
and the only things in here are aqua
which is purified water we have
hyaluronic acid red tea extract and then
to binder or filler ingredients so we're
really really short little um
ingredients list here which i think is
amazing and I really like the
consistency of this so like I said it's
a little different than of what I'm used
to as you guys can see it kind of comes
out in this jelly formulation and when
you start rubbing it in it gets like
very very liquidy and then it just
completely absorbs into the skin like I
said there really isn't a lot of
fragrance there and I am a big a
believer in like teas and antioxidants
and especially red tea which is rooibos
tea I hope you guys watched my tea time
with live video you probably heard me
talk about rooibos tea all the time but
I do believe that teas have antioxidants
and good things in them for your skin so
the fact that this is infused with
rooibos tea I think is really really
awesome and I just like this I think
this is overall a really really good
serum I noticed that it sinks in
immediately so if you do have a
combination to oily skin I think you
would love this as you guys can see
there is no residual anything on my hand
and it's just beautiful I love the
packaging I love the pomp formulation I
love that there's a short ingredients
list and I do think that I have seen a
difference as far as skin and complexion
and readiness is concerned my skin just
looks a little bit better overall I
wouldn't say that it's like firmer or
more moisturized it just looks a little
less discolored if that makes sense so
I've been enjoying that quite a bit
like I said they also did send me this
activating night cream this has Argan
stem cells in it this is beautiful again
beautifully packaged and you're getting
a lot of product in all of these by the
way this is 1.67 fluid ounces this is
1.69
and then this CC cream that they sent is
1.69 as well which is more than the
standard foundation so this is a
beautiful beautiful night cream you're
supposed to apply it at nighttime and
this is what it looks like you guys can
see I have dug out quite a bit in there
I really like this kind of buoyant
consistency it's a little more of like a
mousse or creme look just a little more
moosie I guess you could say it has a
little more of a thick consistency to it
it does have a little bit of a scent and
I'm not a huge fan of the scent I can't
really put my finger on it Tom thought
it smelled
muskie with a little bit of like
grapefruit or something like that in it
but it's nothing super super offensive I
think this would be great if you do have
very very very mature or dry skin I
think it's quite nice on my skin type as
well I am combination to oily and I
really like the way that this sinks in
and I noticed right away that my fine
lines and wrinkles just look a little
more plumped up immediately after using
this now if you run even more moisture
you can go ahead and just mix in some
oil boosters or any sort of oil in with
this which I have done this week and I
think it's a good night cream nothing's
super super impressive it's not
something that I would personally go out
and purchase with my own money however I
would purchase this little guy right
here the red tea serum with my own money
alright and then the last item that they
sent to me is the Charlotte Lacroix CC
cream light for all skin types this is
kind of like the dr. jorde BB cream it's
one of those things where one size kind
of fits all I think they have a light
version and then a darker version and
this unfortunately is too dark for my
skin but I will show you guys the actual
consistency so this is what it looks
like this is pop it out oh oh goodness
it's falling this is what it looks like
when you pump it out on the actual skin
and it really really is a beautiful
consistency it's very very light and
quite moisturizing on the skin and what
I like about it is that it really really
isn't greasy at all now because they
kind of do that one-size-fits-all thing
obviously this is too dark for me so
what I plan on doing is giving that to
my mom but I think it is beautiful and
for the price you are getting a whole
lot of product in here and you do get
the SPF so that is everything that was
sent to me from Charlotte Lacroix like I
said I would personally purchase this
red T serum with my own money I would
highly recommend this I think it really
would work for all sorts of different
skin types I like that it sinks in
immediately and it just really has
helped with a little bit of readiness
and hyperpigmentation on my face
I think the activating night cream is
pretty good as well it's not my all-time
favorite night time moisturizer but I do
think it is a good one to check out
especially if you do have dry or more
mature skin and then if you do have a
darker complexion than me I'm anywhere
between an NC 10 and 15 and Mac
foundations I do think that this one
would work for you I think the CC cream
is very beautiful it's got very sheer to
light coverage but again it's a CC cream
I've got a little bit of color
correcting properties in there and I do
think you get a lot in here for the
price alright moving on let's go have
you started talking about the Aussie
products I'm going to start with the one
that I like them
like I said this was sent to me in an
Influenster box so influencer influenced
her a chair remember what it's called
but anyway this listen to me in one of
their Vox box boxes so this is called
the Aussie total miracle dry shampoo it
says seven miraculous benefits in a one
bottle at first I did not like this but
now I love it I have it in my hair today
and I think if you are someone who has
very very fine kind of flimsy hair like
I do if you want a little bit of like
hold to your hair kind of like a
hairspray but you also want to suck up
the oils in your hair this is a really
nice one it kind of gives me the effects
of the print a powder from bumble and
bumble I don't know if you guys have
ever tried that that is literally like a
loose powder that you put into the palm
of your hand you mix it up and then you
apply it to your roots it gives you
volume and that also sucks up the oil
I feel like this does that but it's an
aerosol can form so I know that this is
a really really good price is under $5
at the drugstore and I would highly
recommend checking this one out if you
do have more fine or flimsy hair if
you're a very very dark hair this is not
going to work for you because they even
leave a white cast in my hair color and
my natural color is starting to come
through a little more it's kind of like
an ashy blonde light brown color and you
really can tell but what I recommend
doing is spraying it all over it let it
sink in for a couple seconds then
massage it in and then kind of brush
through your hair but overall I do like
this and this is something that I would
purchase with my own money they also did
send me the total miracle seven and one
shampoo so I think this is just okay
it's nothing super impressive to me I
know that Aussie makes some really
wonderful deep conditioners and
conditioning products I'm not super
impressed with this and I'm actually not
super impressed with the conditioner
either the total miracle line I think
overall is nice they do have some what
is it in fear they have hobo oil
Australian aloe and seek help in it so
it supposed to be these special
ingredients that are supposed to give
you seven benefits in one I don't notice
seven benefits in one all say is that I
like this because it gives me volume and
also sucks up the oil but these I really
didn't notice that big of a difference
with they do smell really good and so
does the dry shampoo I will say Aussie
products really do smell good but this
is not something that I would probably
purchase with my own money now these are
both I believe under five dollars not
for both them but each of them is about
five dollars each and I feel like Aussie
is one of those brands that you know if
you want a decent products you can go
ahead and use them if you want something
amazing for your hair it's
something that I would recommend if you
do have color treated hair as well I do
think that this will eventually strip
your color but I think they're okay and
now if you are gonna purchase anything
from Aussie I would highly recommend
their deep conditioner that one is so so
so good they have like a strong version
they have a sleek version and then the
moist version the moist version is my
all-time favorite but I would not say
that this 7:01 conditioner is comparable
to that and the shampoo is just okay if
you do have a little more dry hair or
frizzy hair this will be nice because
it's a little bit of a thicker
consistency but overall the only thing I
would say that I really noticed that was
beneficial was probably that I helped
with a little bit of frizz and that it
smells good alright guys and now let's
go into the products that were sent to
me by blue scandal like I said I just
spent like I said I do still have a two
little sheet mask that they sent me that
I have not tried out yet so I will
update you guys maybe in a sales and
holy grails
if those works for me I'm gonna try them
out probably next week but they did send
me these two products right here from
the Branton Dabo so this is the Dabo
hydro collagen moisturizing toner and
then this is the Davao collagen
moisturizing cream now I have been using
this for a week and a half straight in
the morning and you can barely tell that
I have even used any like product so
this is a really nice thick kind of
toner it reminds me a lot of an emulsion
actually actually I can't talk today you
guys it reminds me a lot of emulsion
actually so what I do instead of
applying this onto like Asia Sato cotton
pad I actually take this and directly
put it into my hand because you guys
will see it's got a little bit of like a
gel like consistency so although it is
runny like a toner it really is a little
bit thicker than what your standard
toner would be because normally a toner
is basically the consistency of water
this is just a little thicker it
definitely has a fragrance so I would
not recommend this to those of you who
do have sensitive skin but if you have
comp or oily skin this is beautiful if
you have dry skin and mature skin you
would like this as well and also if you
have normal skin it's like I said ooh
they just got it on my nose like I said
the fragrance is a little overpowering
but I like the bottle it is a beautiful
frosted glass bottle you do get a lot of
products in here and I think it is nice
I feel like it does kind of plump up my
fine lines and wrinkles kind of
instantly it's not one of those things
that I have seen dramatic results from
using it for a week and a half but I
will say immediately upon application I
noticed that
skin looks a little plumper and more
hydrated so I've been enjoying this
quite a bit but I will say the
moisturizer is like a million bajillion
times better if I would recommend buying
one thing from the Dabo line it would be
this guy instead of this guy this guy is
good and they do work together very very
nicely but this is such a beautiful
moisturizing cream I think you would
love this if you do have any sort of
skin type again if you do have very
sensitive skin this is a little more
fragrance it's not as bad as the actual
toner or emulsion but it does smell
quite strongly now I have dug out quite
a bit of the products in here I will say
I feel like I'm going through this
container quite quickly but this is
beautiful such a gorgeous gorgeous
consistency I don't even know how to
describe this but it's a very buoyant
and it's not really mousse like like the
Charlotte Lacroix it's more it's more
like rubbery like it's got it's got a
little bit of like give to it I don't
even know how to describe it but I love
the way that this blends into my skin
and literally after I blend this into my
skin
it just looks moist like my skin just
looks glowy and moist it doesn't look
greasy it doesn't feel greasy
it just looks moist so saying that word
I hate that word but I feel like it just
makes my skin look very very beautiful
and it really does prep nicely for
makeup so I am liking this quite a bit
and the two of them combined together I
will say you did get extra moisture if
you do pick up the toner and I feel like
this would take you a very long time to
get through but if there is one thing
that from the collagen line that I would
recommend it's this little guy right
here so anyway guys those are kind of my
thoughts so far on the products that I
have accepted for PR this month thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow for a look of the
week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
