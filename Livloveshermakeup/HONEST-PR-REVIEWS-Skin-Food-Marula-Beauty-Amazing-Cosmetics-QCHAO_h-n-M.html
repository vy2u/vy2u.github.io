have another video for you guys tonight
this time we are talking about honest PR
reviews I got sent some products from
different brands and if you guys don't
know what PR means basically they send
you products and they ask you for an
honest review and you give it on your
YouTube channel or social media or
wherever so I have some products here
from skin-food some from marula beauty
and then amazing cosmetics and also a
brand called galettes
that I got off of Amazon that was sent
to me and I'm gonna give you guys my
honest thoughts on these I know it's
very very hard to trust youtubers
nowadays I feel like I don't trust a lot
of youtubers I don't know if they're
just being sponsored or paid and you
know I've never done a sponsored video I
rarely use affiliate links I feel like
hopefully you guys feel as if you can
trust me I try and always give it
straightforward with you guys and just
give you the honest blunt truth in my
opinion and that's what I plan on doing
today some of the brands that you know
reached out to me they know that a lot
of these products some of them I did not
actually like so I will be giving my
honest thoughts and if they have a
problem with that they can take that up
with me in my emails so anyway I'm gonna
share with you guys all of the products
and I want to say really quickly not
being sponsored not being paid to talk
about these these were simply sent to me
for review to give my honest opinion and
I will not be using any affiliate links
down below so if you want to click on
something the reason why I'm not using
any affiliate links is because I didn't
get anything that was like a big
discount code that is the only time I
would ever use an affiliate link if you
guys were getting fifteen twenty
twenty-five thirty five percent off or
something like that but if it's just a
link for me where you guys click through
it and I get money I don't use those
kind of links so anyway uh yeah let's go
ahead and get right into it
we are going to start with skin food so
the first item that skin food sent to me
was actually a pack of cleansing wipes
they were their brightening enzyme
cleansing wipes and those were really
really good I did enjoy them I think
there were like 80 of them in a package
and I think the package is around $12 I
will have all of the prices listed down
below in the description bar on every
single product but yeah I really did
enjoy those I don't have too many good
things to say too many bad things I
thought they were just okay they aren't
an item that I would go and personally
purchase myself but they were just okay
I did not notice any difference as far
as brightening up my skin is concerns
but I did notice that they remove
makeup and swatches quite nicely the
second item that they sent me was this
egg white pour foam now I think this
could be good for people who do have
sensitive or dry skin to be completely
fair I did ask him food to go ahead and
pick out the products that they wanted
to send me I wanted to see if they maybe
watched my channel if they knew a little
bit about my skin type because a lot of
the times these brands will approach you
and they'll say oh we love your channel
blah blah blah blah blah can we send you
some products so I wanted to see if they
really have watched my channel and kind
of seen that you know I have compost
skin and things like that if this
particular cleanser definitely is meant
for those with kind of sensitive or dry
skin but I still have been using it as
you guys can see I'm probably about
halfway through and what I've been doing
is using this after I've removed my
makeup so this is like my second cleanse
I think it's a pretty good product it is
quite fragrance so if you do have super
super sensitive skin I wouldn't
recommend this but what I noticed is
that this really really decongest my
pores I feel like it removes all
residual makeup and although I do have
combo to oily skin I still feel like
this really really cleansed my skin so
it's not something that I would go after
and purchase myself just because I have
a better like second cleansing products
like my rocks resurfacing discs but this
is pretty good and it does say it is a
foaming cleanser that deeply purifies
with egg white and deep pore clogging
impurities with rich white foam so
basically it's supposed to go in pull
all the gunk out and I do feel like it
gets the job done but I think it would
be better for those who do have dry skin
or sensitive skin instead of oily or
compost the next item that they had sent
me was a pack of their facial masks I
don't like these um they sent me seven
of them and I think that all of them are
pretty much the same thing I'm not even
kidding I feel like they're just
recycled into a little pack so I hope
I'm not being too harsh but honestly I
really don't like them so there were
seven of them I did try the tomato one
and I can't remember the others that I
tried but here we have green tea this
one right here is orange this one right
here is called Beauty berry which is
really cute and then this one is yogurt
I didn't use all of them because
honestly I feel like they all do the
same thing I don't feel like these masks
fit very properly onto my face they're
very very thick the actual cloth and
they started to fall off my face so
definitely not my favorite um sheet mask
in general but I do think that they
soften the skin so I personally would
not participate on
funny and I don't think I would
recommend them for you guys and now the
last item that they sent to me I am
obsessed with this is my favorite item
out of everything that has been sent to
me
this is the premium lettuce and cucumber
watery emulsion before this I had never
tried an emulsion and basically what an
emulsion is is you can use it however
kind of you want if you want to use it
as a moisturizer if you're super super
oily but for me with my combo skin I
like to use this after I tone my face so
I have used about this much of it um I
just kind of shook it so when all over
but I've used about this much I really
like it the scent is really nice it does
smell like cucumber and like not like
lettuce let us doesn't smell like
anything but it does smell slightly of
cucumber so if you like that or if you
don't like that that's just something to
be aware of but ooh just got in my mouth
but it smells really good to me I just
take a little bit and I dump it into the
back of my hand and basically it's like
a hydrating toner that's the way that I
think of it so I like to put this on
after my toner before I go in with my I
don't know like my I guess my hydration
essence or even my serum and then I go
in with my moisturizer then my eye
creams and my oil but overall this is an
amazing product I believe it's $15 on at
their website and this is something that
I will be purchasing with my own money
after I go through it they also do you
have a tomato one and also an avocado
one so I want to try all of them but
yeah
so those are the items that skin foods
sent to me like I said the two top ones
I would say are definitely the egg white
pour foam and definitely the premium
lettuce and cucumber emulsion these are
two that I would recommend I would
recommend this one for anyone I would
recommend this for sensitive or dry skin
I would stay away from their sheet masks
and their cleansing cloths are just okay
alright moving on let's go on to amazing
cosmetics amazing cosmetics sent me
three different items and I want to
touch on something really quickly um
because the last product I'm going to
talk about I had really bad experience
with with the actual like not that
company but like the people that were
sending me the items so I just wanted to
point out that skin food and amazing
cosmetics have amazing customer care and
support they wrote like little like
handwritten notes and like all this kind
of cute stuff they were very very hands
on they told me no matter what I can
give my honest opinion they made me feel
very comfortable about this whole thing
because sometimes you know I think what
happens with a lot of youtubers is they
get sent a product and they feel like
they have to say good things and you
know this isn't
job so like I don't worry about people
unsubscribing if they don't like this or
companies coming after me this is not my
main source of income but at the same
time I do think there are a lot of
brands out there that really just want
an honest opinion and I think it's
important for people to go and give an
honest opinion because these brands make
 loads of money guys you don't have
to sit there and be like oh it's the
most amazing thing I've ever put on my
face if it's not good you should just be
honest with your audience so anyway
amazing cosmetics sent me three
different things the first is the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer in
the shade ivory and they did send me the
extra large tube they also sent me the
amazing concealer illuminate version in
the shade eye brave and then they also
sent me this amazing cosmetics line
smoother plus primer so I'll start with
this so when I first got this I thought
this was an overall like whole face
primer and I was like that tube is so
small you're gonna go through this way
too quickly but after reading about it
and looking on the website basically you
have these three little roller balls
here and you're supposed to put this on
areas where you do have fine lines and
wrinkles to kind of lift and kind of
plump up those areas it is very very
silicone base I don't feel like when I
squeeze it all of the product comes out
evenly but it never never balls up on
the skin so if you are someone who likes
that really thick 2-methyl cone sort of
plumping effect this is a really nice
one to put underneath your eyes on the
like outer corners of your mouth and I
also want any little fine lines or
wrinkles I would recommend this product
however again being completely honest
with you guys I do think there is a dupe
for this from the drugstore and that is
the Revlon age defying cream so they
have this tiny little tube kind of like
this but it's a lot cheaper than this
this is like I believe so what a
full-size I think they have two sizes of
this but anyway it's the same sort of
concept so it's a very thick tube method
cone sort of like primer or whatever you
want to call it line smoother and you
can put that on your pores underneath
your eyes wherever and I do you think
that that one is pretty much exactly
comparable to this so this is not an
item I would personally purchase with my
own money but I am happy they send it to
me I thought it was cool to try out and
one thing I do want to note like tell
you guys about it basically this has
like the little roller balls the Revlon
one does not but I will leave the full
name for the red foam one down below if
you guys are curious about that so
that's a pretty good product and then
they also sent me like I said the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer I
love this
I have purchased three full sizes of
this in the past four or five years I
think this is a wonderful concealer it
is very very very full coverage so if
you are someone who does not like that
really full coverage thing going on you
need to be careful with this I will say
if you do have oily skin this can be a
little heavy on the skin but overall
fantastic fantastic concealer really do
enjoy this and highly recommend and then
the last concealer that they sent me was
the illuminating version I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter this this was just
not good it's a very very thick and
opaque which I like but then it sheers
out and it's just like why have a really
really illuminating concealer when it
feels so heavy on the skin I just did
not like the consistency of it and
because of that I'm going to let it go
and I feel like sometimes I can work
around consistency but this was just so
thick and yet it didn't feel like I had
that coverage there so this is not a
product that I would recommend or
purchase with my own money alright
moving on to the marula brands marula is
sold at sephora and i felt really
special when they sent me a full-size of
their marula luxury oil because this is
like $75 on the Sephora calm website so
they wrote me a handwritten little note
again really beautiful love the way it
was packaged they've been in contact
with me the whole entire time I really
like their customer care and service but
this is the first item they sent to me
it is the John it's Paul selects marula
pure marilla facial oil this is what it
looks like this is a full-size and I do
like this oil I mentioned this in a
favorites video you have the little
dropper form just like this and marula
oil is very interesting it reminds me a
lot of like the tarte maracuja oil it's
very much like an anti-aging sort of oil
very very thick and very um I guess you
can feel it on your skin does that make
sense so if you're someone who does have
a really really oily skin I would not
recommend this oil but if you have aging
skin if you have dry skin normal skin
sensitive skin I do think this would
work for you one thing I want to point
out is that this brand does have a
little bit of like a spicy earthy scent
to all of their products so that's just
something to be aware of if you do have
super super sensitive skin maybe this
won't work for you but I do recommend
this I think this is a beautiful oil I
like to apply probably about three or
four drops on top of my moisturizer or I
like to mix it together with the
moisturizer that they sent me so the
second item that they sent to me was the
marula by john paul selects pure marula
face
loschen so this is very interesting I
don't think this is going to work for me
during the winter time but during the
spring and summer months it's beautiful
it's a very very light weight literally
lotion do you guys see that it is
literally a lotion so if you do have
copper or very very oily skin this would
be a great moisturizer for you because
it sinks in very very quickly again it
has that more natural kind of spicy
woodsy scent and I'm pretty sure that
most of the ingredients in the marula
brand products are quite natural because
I look those up and they seemed pretty
good but yeah I love the packaging on
all of the products that they set me
really beautiful very luxurious I think
that this is just okay like I said I
don't think that I'll be using this very
much a during the winter time but right
now it's working well when I mixed
together the oil so I will take three
pumps of this in the morning and then I
will take about half a dropper full of
this I will mix them together put them
on my face and I feel like I'm really
moisturized that way so if you have very
very dry or aging skin this is not going
to be moisturizing enough for you I'm
pretty sure that they do have a night
cream that maybe you could try out
because I do like the brand but I would
recommend maybe going with the oil
because this is really really hydrating
very beautiful really helps to kind of
like plump up the skin and then they
last lightening that they sent me was
the marula daily moisture mist this is a
leave-in conditioning heat protector
this is just okay I don't really put a
lot of heat on my hair ever I don't
think I've even blow-dried my hair in
like three or four months so I'm not
really into all that kind of stuff but I
still think it's pretty good at putting
a little bit of moisture in it does not
make your hair greasy when you do spray
it in which is surprising since it does
have marula oil in it but it's a good
product it's not something I would
purchase with my own money but it is
nice if you do have I would say normal
hair if your hair is super super super
dry this is not going to give it the
moisture it needs but it still is a
relatively good product and I will use
it up and also it does have you know all
of those benefits so that it doesn't fry
your hair so if you are blow-drying your
hair you could spray this in first if
you're a flat ironing or curling you can
spray this in first it is free of
silicone fatal aids and also parabens
which is cool and good to know and also
I just wanted to show you guys how it
comes packaged I just really like the
feel of this marula line I thought it
was beautiful everything that they did
liked a little box and a little note
everything was really beautiful and I
liked the customer service alright and
finally we are going to end with a
product that I'm not even going to leave
a link down below like
I'm not using any affiliate links but I
will still link below where you guys can
pick these items up I'm not gonna link
this down below because I had some bad I
have some bad things to say about this
this is the goods or goats oxygen facial
tonic this tones balances and calms oily
skin this was sent to me by a brand that
sells for Amazon and alright I just want
to say really really quickly first of
all it came like this and I don't know
if you guys can see this this has like
extra like tape over the side right here
the Box came completely completely open
but there was no note there was nothing
it came in a package that smelled very
strongly of cigarettes I don't know what
that's all about
it was just a very strange kind of thing
I don't really know exactly what
happened with this but the person
contacted me and I thought okay sure
it's a natural product I could use it to
tone my face I hope you guys can see
right here I tried to use this product
but this smells like ass like
straight-up ass I mean it smells
absolutely horrible like the most
natural horrible horrible scent ever I
really don't like it and I really felt
like this actually burned my skin which
is strange because it's not supposed to
have alcohol in it is supposed to be
all-natural
it actually inflamed my acne more and I
really don't like this and when I wrote
to the actual brand and I told them or
not the brand but the people that were
selling for Amazon and I told them I
said this did not work for me they wrote
back to me three days later and said hi
would you like to try this product it
was the same exact person and I'm
thinking do you not keep track of who
you contact for PR I just think that
super super non-professional and first
of all and again like I don't do this
for a living but you don't want I mean
like come on like you're gonna contact
me twice you don't even remember
obviously they've never watched my
channel they don't know who the hell I
am they're just contacting me out of
nowhere and it was just the strangest
thing that she contacted me two times
and you know it was the same exact email
would you like to try this products and
I emailed her back I said you already
reached out to me two days ago I said he
said you were going to send it shows
oh sure is her sure sorry Olivia I'm
thinking like wow
what the hell so anyway that was kind of
a weird situation like I said I don't
like it I haven't really had any
problems with the brand they haven't
been like oh you know we're gonna sue
you because you don't like our product I
just told them it didn't work for me and
they kind of just like dropped off the
face of the earth but anyway so I did
want to go ahead and tell you guys that
like I said I'm not going to link this
down below or even the Amazon seller
because I don't want you guys to pick
this up this is not a good product but
very strange like this tape over the box
thing like they were putting something
extra here really really beat up box I
almost felt like this had possibly been
opened I don't even know but overall
would not recommend this so anyway guys
those are my honest PR reviews if there
are products that I would highly highly
recommend that you check out it would be
the premium lettuce and cucumber watery
emulsion from skin-food
as well as the marula oil really really
good stuff so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this thanks so much for joining
me and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
