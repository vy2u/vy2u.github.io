channel I'm sorry if I look a little
disheveled I have somebody very special
in my lap today's video is going to be
an introduction on YouTube to my pet
ferret and mr. badger I have him
somewhat distracted right now licking
some oil off of his belly he loves this
oil called ferret own this is for
ferrets basically kind of like a fish
oil or nutrition supplement so the way
that I got him to sit still it was to
put some on his belly so the he will
groom himself but this is my pet bear
and his name is mr. badger can you can
you turn your little head and say hello
say hello to everyone hi this is mr.
badger he is so sweet he is my pet
ferret and I got him about two months
ago now so today's video is basically
just me introducing you head to you guys
and then also we're gonna do a little
bit of a ferret Q&amp;amp;A because ferrets are
a little more unusual animals well is
that good baby
ferrets are a little more unusual
animals they aren't technically exotic
but I feel like they're kind of semi
exotic animals so I thought I would do a
little bit of a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys you
guys have a lot of questions about him
and yeah I just wanted him to come on
camera if you guys didn't know I post
pictures of him on snapchat videos of
him on snapchat and he does have his own
Instagram which I will link down below
if you would like to follow him but yeah
this is my pet little I call him mr.
badger his name is honey badger so he's
my pet little badger even though he's
not a badger he is a ferret so yeah
let's go ahead and get right into the QA
I'm gonna put him down because he's
distracted now and if you guys didn't
know ferrets do get a little hyper
sometimes so anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it and the first
question that I got was from let's see
here
Shopaholic Jess and Christy Slinker um
they had similar questions so the first
one mr. badger meets a beta since you
can I see your back about what he's
doing anyway Shopaholic Jess and also
Christy's flanker the first question is
was it hard training him and somebody
also ask how do you train him so was it
hard training him mr. Batra actually
came to us pretty much completely
trained which is awesome if you guys
don't know what I mean by that is that
he doesn't nip he doesn't bite and he is
potty trained
and how do you train him so if you do
want to train a ferret mr. badger what
are you doing are you doing hold on one
second
what are you doing okay anyway if you
guys didn't know how you do train a
ferret and things like that is basically
it just be very very persistent with
them lots of treats
lots of a special oil and lots of Sam
and chew sticks that's pretty much it
it's kind of like with any other animal
you just have to be consistent and
patient alright question number two is
from a Chelsea rose and a third also
southern bookworm and these were kind of
related questions they asked how does
Tom feel about him and why doesn't he
like him to run around the apartment so
Tom feels totally fine about mr. badger
I think sometimes on my snapchat I make
it out to be a little more dramatic than
it is tom is totally fine with him the
reason why he doesn't love him to be out
in the apartment when he's home first of
all it's because I let mr. badger oh
excuse me I let mr. badger out videos
already a hot mess I let mr. badger out
during the day when I'm on lunch break
so Tom's not home anyway
but second of all tom is allergic to mr.
badger yes he is allergic so it just
makes it a little more tricky when he is
out during the day when I let him out if
you guys didn't know ferrets do sleep 18
to 22 hours a day so mr. badger
technically really only comes out in the
entire apartment for about two hours but
Tom doesn't mind him being out it's just
he does get a little sniffly and things
like that all right the third question
is from Vegas to Canyon she asked I've
heard the ferrets are stinky is that
true
are they related to skunks so they are
closely related to skunks yes they do
have a little bit of a musky odor to
them it's nothing super super
overpowering I think if you are someone
who has a lot of ferrets and yes it can
be overpowering but if you just have one
it's really not that bad but yes they do
have a little bit of a musky odor to
them and as far as being related just
comes I do believe they are related to
skunks they're also related to minks and
also what's the other one not badgers
even though his name is honey badger
he's not related to badgers but
something else I can't remember it what
exactly like category they're in but
there they are like obligate carnivores
so I believe they are closely related to
skunks alright the next question is from
Jane Z mr. badger I hear you
snob
the next question is from James II and
she asked of what are his favorite
hobbies mr. been through favorite
hobbies are eating 2/6 salmon two sticks
and also stealing on my slippers if you
guys follow me on snapchat you know that
he does that a lot
alright the next question is from Katie
rude this is I've never seen a live
ferret do they make any noise so fears
do actually make a noise it's called do
king or ducking do king ducking I don't
know quite how to say it but it's do ok
ing so do king and basically it's a
noise that they make kind of sounds like
a little like musky not musky but like a
of the roadie kind of giggle it's kind
of like kind of like that and they do
that when they are plain and when they
are excited alright the next question is
from my cat Molly and she asked does he
have his own room I'm confused on
snapchat if his cage is in a separate
room and do you have to bathe him so yes
I do wave them about once a month you
don't want to beat them too often
because the oils will just produce more
kind of like if you were to over wash
your face you will produce more and more
sebum and then he will be even more
stinky so I would recommend just going
ahead and bathing your ferret maybe once
a month or once every two months that's
personally what I do I've only ever
bathed him once since I got him and what
did she ask oh yeah does he have you
thumb groom sorry guys who need distract
experiment going around on my stuff on
the background but yes he does have his
own room technically Tom and I have a
three bedroom apartment so we have like
our guest bathroom then we have our
bedroom tom has his own office I have my
Beauty room and then we have a guest
bathroom so we put mr. bachelors cage in
there just because it's a little further
off from the rest of the apartment and
we thought it would be nice because he
would have his own quiet space so
technically what I do is mr. powder does
have a cage I just leave it open at all
times and I let him run around in the
guest bathroom and then two hours of the
day I let him out into the whole entire
apartment so like I said they do sleep
about 18 to 22 hours a day sleeping the
majority of their day sleeping he
absolutely loves his cage even though I
never lock him in there and he does have
a dog bed that he also sleeps and so yes
he does technically have his own room
it's like a guest bathroom all right the
next question is from Lisa sixteen three
seventeen how old is he and where did
you get him I purchased him at Petco and
he is going to be a year old in January
and yeah we I would highly recommend
going ahead and adopting your animals
not shopping we checked at our local
humane society they did not have any
ferrets up for adoption so unfortunately
we did have to buy him but yes he's
adorable I love him the next question is
from Rebecca Jewell
does he know he's a crazy cat snake so
if you guys didn't know ferrets have
like very flexible backs and they kind
of act like cats but they obviously look
like a snake because they have a very
flexible spine so yes I think he knows
alright moving on um the next question
is from pixie PI live hey girlie she
asked us he giggles so yeah he does make
that um that sound that like kind of
thing when he's happy and when he's I'm
excited so yes he does
number time is from Emily clayed or
Emily Clyde she asked as mr. badger ever
dress up in cute hats and outfits he has
not yet but you can bet your ask that I
will be doing that with him are you
moving on the next question is from
let's see here Ellen girl she asked can
you walk ferrets like you can walk dogs
absolutely you can they do have little
harnesses and leash that you can leashes
that you can buy and I actually do take
mr. badger out on our balcony so he can
get some fresh air and I take him out
he's in my nail-polish mr. Bostic I take
him out and he does really really enjoy
that so yeah yes you can take them out
mr. badger please get out of my nail
polish collection I can hear you a
little alright moving on are you
going to have a brother or sister
someday mr. badger this is from Katrina
three two one hi Katrina
um I think eventually maybe yes we would
get a second ferret so that he can have
like a playmate and something to kind of
hang out with hold on one sec guys this
is ready is your ass out of there I
don't want you in there in here what are
you doing
oh goodness all right please stop being
a bad boy he's like I can't I can't stop
being a little bad boy please stop it
do not go eat my nail polish okay I'm
closing this door stop oh my god okay
blooming eye socket guys you know I
don't edit so it's gotta be in there all
right the next question is from Jessica
Dawson hey girl hey Jess
she asked which slipper is your favorite
so mr. badger if you guys didn't know he
loves stealing my little moccasin
slippers so I would say he prefers the
left one I really do think he does
alright the next question is from feel
ooh 28 do you live in a cage or are you
a free to roam ferret so as you guys can
probably tell he is free to roam the
reason why I'm freaking out a little bit
right now is because I'm doing my
declutter series so I have boxes filled
with makeup all over the Beauty room
which is why you can hear him making a
ruckus um but yes he's free to roam
around the apartment we have ferret
proofed everything so he does like to
roam the only room he's not allowed in
is our bedroom because we don't want Tom
to be like choking at nighttime and also
he's downed a lot in Tom's room and
that's because he has a lot of wires in
there and I don't want mr. Batra chewing
on those even though he's a good boy and
doesn't really chew very often all right
the next question is from Matt about
beauty hey girls she asked I am so
excited for this live how did you decide
that a ferret was the best fit for you
as a pet he seems absolutely adorable
and full of rambunctious playful energy
does he also like to be a cuddle bug he
does like to be a cuddle bug like I said
I just took him out and we slept in
because it's Saturday so he's very
rambunctious right now when you do take
ferrets out they're definitely very full
of energy the first couple hours that
they are out and then they start to just
slow down and then they will fall asleep
anywhere so I have literally seen him
fall asleep on the way to his room
before like he was out and he was
walking and he just fell asleep on the
floor like it so he definitely is a
cuddle bug you can take them out when
they are napping and things like that
and they will cuddle with you and sleep
with you so yes he's a cuddle bug and
how did we decide on a ferret so I
actually had a fair growing up and we
just so happened to go into the pet
store and then we went over to the
shelter because I was like hey maybe we
should get a ferret and Tom was like a
ferret I was like yeah why not
so we went over to the shelter to check
to see if they had any and then we went
back to Petco and I was like I want that
one but yeah how do we decide I just
thought it would be a better fit and
then a cat or a dog Thomas really
severely allergic to cats and dogs like
way worse than a ferrets
this was how we decided and the final
question is how did you get your name
what's your favorite toy and do you have
any outfit so he doesn't have any
outfits yet but you know I will be
getting on that and I will be
getting him outfits what is his favorite
toy his favorite toy he likes a lot of
different toys that I would say this
little cat thing so I have this little
jingle thing it's so horrible
description I have this little cat thing
that kind of looks like it's like a
fishing rod and it has a little jingle
bell on it and then it does have
feathers
parents are very is it nearsighted or
farsighted I can't remember but they are
practically blind okay they don't have
very good vision so you want to get them
a toy that does make noise so that is
his favorite who loves chasing that
around and how did you get your name I
feel like he just kind of looks like a
honey badger not exactly if you look at
honey badgers online they're big they're
big animals but his paws his little feet
look like a honey badger so that's how I
gave him his name so anyway guys I'm
sorry that this was kind of all over the
place that's the way it is when you're
trying to get an animal on camera I hope
you enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
