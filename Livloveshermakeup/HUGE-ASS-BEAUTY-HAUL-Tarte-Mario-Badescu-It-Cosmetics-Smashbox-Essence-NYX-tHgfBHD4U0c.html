today's video is going to be a huge-ass
haul the Ulta 21 days a beauty event it
just happened I was still waiting on one
more box it has my Anasazi of Beverly
Hills of brow pencils in taupe and
blonde in it but everything else came so
I wanted to share that with you guys and
then also tarts had a 30% off friends
and family family and friends friends
and families fail which you guys told me
about so thank you so much and I yeah
that's pretty much it let's go ahead and
jump right into it lots and lots of
samples you know when Alta does this
they send everything in a huge box and
there's like one item at the bottom it's
just so wasteful but yeah the actual
samples look like they are the skin
longevity vital power infusion which we
used to be one of my favorite favorite
serums and then also the skin Iceland
what is this pure cloud cream and
Smashbox primer so those are the samples
from the 21 days of beauty event I don't
really like it because you're not
allowed to like pick your samples I'm
trying to pick more cruelty free samples
but the other night on Sephora too when
I was trying to order there were like no
cruelty free samples kind of sucks but
anyway I also got these little guys
these would be Mario Badescu alpha
grapefruit cleansing lotion as well as
the glycolic foaming cleanser and hydro
moisturizer with a vitamin C and then
another little deluxe size with the
lorac like source 3 in one illuminating
primer alright let's go ahead and jump
into the actual stuff the full-size
items the first two items I picked up
where the essence all about matte 16
compact powders these were buy one get
one 50% off one of my all-time favorite
setting powders I also did go ahead and
pick up the lorac unzipped and unzipped
gold unzip to unzip the gold palette now
these I already have dug into in fact
most of the stuff I have dug into
because you know it's been sitting
around but the unzipped and gold is
really really beautiful but I just went
ahead and actually swatched it the
unzipped over here and now it's kind of
rubbing off but this was like an hour
ago on my hand oh my god the quality on
that the formula is so much softer so I
thought these were pretty good but now
I'm very very very excited for the
original one and I feel like packaging
is a lot better everything about it is
just kind of better so here is the
original one as you guys can see nice
kind of rosy tones and if you are
someone with a cool undertone this would
probably work for you and you probably
liked it those else would you come with
little deluxe sized primers as well
alright
another little item here that was very
excited about was the Smashbox photo
finish primer water ever since smashbox
announced that they went cruelty free i
have just been like on that brand i
actually wrote to them probably about a
month ago and i asked about the cruelty
free status and they told me they were
but like i wasn't trusting yet because
logical harmony had written the article
yet but she did so it's official
or at least official in my book and
these are just really really nice the
only thing i want to say is that i do
notice there is a little bit of a scent
going on here it's not anything that's
super overwhelming or overpowering but
for the most part it feels really nice
on the skin it doesn't irritate my skin
i love that there is no sort of alcohol
in here and i actually do feel like it
prolongs the wear of my makeup i've been
wearing my makeup now for probably like
18 hours i'm not even kidding
so yeah really have been enjoying those
and i'm a matter when this first came
out i was like this is good stuff
alright I also did pick up let's see
here the Mario Badescu glycolic acid a
toner I used to strictly use a Mario
Badescu products and this is a really
good glycolic acid toner if you're
someone with more breakup prone skin you
would probably like this a lot I would
stay away if you do have dry skin even
though glycolic acid is good for
exfoliating this one is very very strong
and then I had to pick up the new facial
spray from Mario Badescu with aloe
cucumber and green tea and then I think
it the aloe herbs and rosewater I'm just
gonna have to layer my face up in these
right now it's so hot under these lights
but yeah this one is beautiful really
really have been enjoyed this a lot I
talked about this in my feels I'm holy
grails last week and then this guy right
here oh my god it's really really good
too if you are a little sensitive to
rose which like 30 percent of people are
supposedly if you ever put like rose
products on and you notice like an
immediate tingling or sensation it's
probably because you're having a little
bit of like a contact dermatitis
allergic reaction thing that's what I
was reading on Paula's choice but if you
can't like stand this one this one's
really really nice my friend Rochelle
hates the smell of cucumber so she
wanted me to test this out it does not
smell like cucumber it just smells like
green tea and green tea is really nice
for being or it's known for being you
know anti-inflammatory so if you do have
more guests like breakout chroma skin it
would help but also redness I feel like
it kind of cools down my face very
nicely so anyway really really have been
liking that I think I like this maybe
just a little more than the rose but I
the scent on the rose and then I did
pick up two of the NYX cleansing oils
this is called the strict off cleansing
oil the other one isn't in my bathroom
right now they were buy one get one 50%
off and I think they're just okay I'm
looking for a good cleansing oil that's
cruelty free probably going to go back
to the Burt's Bees one because Burt's
Bees is now officially again a cruelty
free kind of weird that they weren't in
the first place but yeah this is pretty
darn good
not something I would repurchase again
and if you guys are curious I will do a
follow-up haul for you guys next week I
think I'm gonna include it in the look
of the week all right so I'll talk about
all the products after trying them out
more here we have the Mario Badescu
a jade botanical body soap this is
really nice for a body breakouts I am
somebody who does get a very very leg
big statistic pimples on my chest
sometimes I almost like it down near my
butt not like on my Bible like oh right
above my butt so basically my lower back
and then also on my chest my upper back
all over the place really oh you can get
it like on my arms so I really enjoy
this is really really nice for kind of
clearing up blackheads and breakouts and
all that kind of stuff you can use it on
your face too and then I did get the
vitamin aid or a de neck cream I used to
use this all the time and I really dug
into those products yet but when I do my
show up I will tell you guys if I like
that alright the next item I picked up
was the it cosmetics your skin but
better CC plus airbrush perfecting a
powder I felt like I shouldn't have
gotten this like when I was ordering it
I was like it's still too pricey and
honestly I got the shade fair it's very
very yellow toned and it kind of feels I
feel like you're gonna have to work into
the product like when you initially
swatch it it's a little chalky like you
guys can hear that too right it's like
chocolate like I'm not been ready here
and now but seriously it's like it's
like sandpaper and I'm not into that I
just I don't know what to say my first
impressions wise I'm not impressed I
haven't even put it on my face yet you
guys so I can't really say but I'm kind
of regretting that I purchased that it
was very very expensive even like half
off it was like $25 I come on like
powders for $25 and the only time that I
ever used like a setting powder this $25
is when it's like a silica powder
alright and then I did also pick up like
I said some items from Tarte so let's go
through those the first is the
rainforest of the sea deep dive
cleansing gel Wow
rate forms of the sea deep dive
cleansing gel this stuff is fantastic I
have gone through a full size before
tarts even though they have some stuff
that is
definitely like fails within their
collection and like all their
limited-edition stuff sometimes it's not
good their skincare line is pretty damn
good
everything is infused with mark huija
oil and I love their see brighter what
does it Club I'm treatment I love the
pure maracuja and this does have
maracuja in there so if you're scared
because it says cleansing gel don't be
you can use it no matter what skin type
you have it's beautiful it's refreshing
and I love the packaging on this so very
excited for that I did also get the
clean a queen vegan deodorant
I'm obsessed I'm obsessed I'm obsessed
I'm sweating right now but like I'm not
sweating underneath my armpits I feel
like this is the best vegan and like
natural deodorant that I've used that
helps with wetness now it doesn't help
as much with smell like the love Anila
one does I prefer that one for like
actual body odour but this one so really
nice the light fragrance to it and it
just really really keeps me dry which
I'm very like surprised about so this is
formulated without aluminum and it is
hypoallergenic super super excited for
that would highly recommend this during
Italy Sephora sale as well as the love
Anila Wanda love until it does have
multiple different like flavors or I
guess since you can choose from but this
one is really really good
and then I did also pick up at the fair
honey oh I always say that fair honey
fair was given with peach undertones
Amazonian clay full coverage airbrush
foundation so I have this on today and
I've just kind of dotted it on to my
skin it is very very yellow toned and
it's very very messy even with these
sifter but I think it's good it's not
something that I would repurchase but I
think it's pretty on the skin and the
color selection is okay like normally I
feel like Tarte is a little better with
their color selection this one was not
that great I feel like this was the
lightest shade that they had I even
looked at the ones that had more pink
undertones but while I'm self-tan this
will work for me and then I did go ahead
and pick up two of the tarts let's see
here Amazonian clay highlighters in
these shades I don't have right now I'm
wearing this shade exposed and I got
these during the elf to 21 days of
beauty event I just wanted to show it
with the Tarte stuff because they're
from Tarte these are not the same as the
expose formula I'm sorry like i swatched
them and I was like nope it smells
really good this one right here is
called stunner which is a little lighter
in tone and that is or two right there
it's swatch and it really
like they're just not as creamy they're
not is buttery they don't go on its
nicely and then this one I'm like no I
think I'm gonna declutter this this is
called sparkler Amazonian clay
highlighter can you return stuff to the
altar 21 days of beauty events because
this is chunky this is like the litter
so I'm really really not that impressed
with these you guys I was I was quite
surprised to be completely honest but
yeah there it is swatch so very very
upsetting the exposed highlight is
amazing if you're gonna get any of them
get that one I think this one is a
pretty shade stunner but that's what
happened with the sparkler shade it's
ridiculous and then I did also pick up
the charts BB tinted primer this is
broad-spectrum SPF 30 it's like I'm
going through this so quickly I've been
using it every single day this week as
my base or my foundation and then going
in with this guy right here it's in the
shade fair it says it's a 12 hour primer
healthy treatment buildable coverage
oil-free moisturizer pore minimizer skin
brightener no it's not all of that but
it's a really nice Airy consistency
similar to the Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation but lighter you put
it on and it blends in like a dream it
really does kind of prolong the wear of
whatever you have underneath it but like
I said I've been using it as an actual
foundation because it does have coverage
and it's so cool it goes from a cream to
a powder I don't think you'd like it if
you do have more mature or dry skin but
if you are an oily beast like I am this
is definitely something to look into and
then they also gave me a little deluxe
size of the tortoise lip cran in the
shade of Bo how I almost didn't take
this cuz I've heard so many bad things I
don't even know I'll try it out once but
I can't imagine myself liking it these
get really bad reviews they break really
easily they're supposed to be drying and
then on top of that I'm like never wear
a lip liner anyway but I took it and
then also I have this little guy the
ring for so the sea marine boosting mist
this one is nice as well but not as good
as the Maurya the dusky one so anyway
that is my little haul I hope you guys
enjoyed this like I said I will have a
follow up haul going up next week and
yeah that's pretty much it I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
