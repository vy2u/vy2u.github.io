video is going to be my huge a black
friday bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks haul if you guys
didn't know on Black Friday and Cyber
Monday bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks with having buy
three get three free anything so you
could buy anything in the store get
three free and you could continue to
build it in your cart so we about a
whole lot of items I'm just going to go
ahead and get started the first five
items that we got with little mini
pocket backs I just love having these in
my purse so the first one we have here
is called a vanilla bean Noel this is
what it looks like this is a very
popular scent this time of year I also
did pick up twisted peppermint which
looks a little something like this
another really popular scent this time
of year we have Mary of berry kiss we
also have a winter candy apple which I
really like is a very very nice fresh
scent and the last one that I picked up
is called frosted coconut snowball so
there it is so those were the first five
items we got we also picked up a lot of
wallflowers the first double a little
pack that we got is evergreen so I don't
really like this scent I don't know why
I got this I think I'm mistaken this for
what is it called fresh balsam so
evergreen kind of smells a little more
like a car air freshener than I would
like
I feel like fresh balsam is really nice
and smells like a Christmas tree and
this one just smells a little more fake
to me so anyway I'm not really enjoying
it but we shall see if it changes once I
actually plug it in we also did get to
the season which is my all-time of
favorite scent ever that Bath and Body
Works or releases we did pick up frosted
cranberry as well in the duo packs like
I said everything was buy three get
three free so it was very tempting to
get everything we got two cinnamon
sticks we also did pick up a sparkling
icicles and the last one we got is
cinnamon and clove buds so we really
like all of these all of them smell
absolutely amazing and we loved that we
got the little duo packs for such a
great price alright we did pick up some
hand soaps as usual we wanted to try
these new ones from CEO Bigelow so the
one here it came off like the actual
little lid part which is fine Tom has
like a automatic soap dispenser in the
master bathroom that we like to use or
he likes to use so we don't use the deep
cleansing hand soap in there but we do
use the deep cleansing hand soaps in
other rooms so I will share with you
guys the ones that we got but these are
kind of new this is bergamot amber
I thought this would be really really
nice and I actually really like the
packaging on these we also did pick up
let's see here cashmere fig which looks
like this I think that sounds amazing
also this one right here which is called
sea salt mimosa I love the color of that
I feel like that looks so beautiful we
did pick up the bath and Bodyworks of
Roma therapy and energy orange ginger
hand soap which Tom really really likes
as well again these don't have any sort
of like exfoliating beads in them which
is nice and then we did get almond musk
which looks a little something like this
and his all-time favorite is the stress
relief in the eucalyptus spearmint so we
picked those up for him and then as far
as like deep cleansing hand soaps are
concerned I got Christmas morning which
is a blend of crisp Christmas fir with a
touch of cranberry this is a new scent
to me but actually smells really really
good yeah it smells really good and I
thought the packaging was super super
adorable and then I also got Mary berry
kiss and it this was kind of nice it
smells a little more like plain Jean
than I thought it would but it smells
good
yeah it just smells kind of like
raspberry cream or something it's winter
berries snowy vanilla and crystallized a
ginger I don't smell any of the ginger
in there just want to put that out there
and then we also picked up a gingerbread
a latte and this is the blend of warm
Gingerbread vanilla latte and whipped
cream so that is what it looks like and
then I also did get let's see here very
Mary meringue which I'm so excited about
I picked this up last year this is a
blend of whipped lemon meringue glazed
sugar and a hint of vanilla
I love citrusy scent so I got that one
and then also my all-time favorite that
they released are in the winter time is
when a winter citrus wreath so this
month amazing it is a beautiful blend of
balsam wreath accented with fresh citrus
and I love citrus everything so we
picked that up and then as far as
candles are concerned we did pick up two
of the fresh balsam candles I absolutely
adore the fresh a balsam scent this time
of year now if you are very very
sensitive to fragrance I do not
recommend picking this up but this
smells like you literally have like two
or three Christmas trees in your
apartment so especially if your burning
two at once like I do so I wouldn't
recommend this if you are very very
sensitive to scents but it's amazing it
really does smell like a Christmas tree
the fragrance notes in here are woodland
balsam crisp eucalyptus fir branches and
cedar wood it smells absolutely
incredible and amazing and look at the
lids
oh the lids are so cute for this time of
year and then my all-time favorite scent
it like I told you guys is taste the
season this is my all-time favorite
scent from Bath and Body Works ever it
reminds me of going home for the
holidays when I was in college because I
would always take one of these with me
when I would go home for Christmas so
this is the kiss - season 3 what candle
these smell amazing and I really liked
the frosted glass that they come in this
year and at the fragrance notes for this
our Red Delicious apples sweet cinnamon
bark and a cedar wood and then the final
two candles that we picked up were a New
York black tie which this just reminds
me of Tom I don't know where the lid
went but this smells exactly like Tom
like this is Tom and a candle it smell
so incredibly good it reminds me a lot
of the ECB Yaqui like the original
Cologne if you like that you would like
this the fragrance notes are aromatic
sage dark tonka bean and rich sandalwood
it just smells really freakin good so we
got one of those and then the last
candle that we picked up was spiced
apple toddy and this is what it looks
like and the lid again so so so cute the
fragrance notes for this are warm apple
brandy spiced plum cranberry and
cinnamon stick so this is a favorite of
mine this time of year again not like so
much of a favorite like the balsam scent
or to season but still a good one so
anyway I feel like I did that relatively
quickly those are all the items that we
picked up from Bath and Body Works I
think it totaled out to under $100 for
more than 30 items which is awesome so I
hope you guys enjoyed this haul and I
will be up next with my Sephora Black
Friday haul so I will see you guys in a
little bit bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
