if you have been wondering where I've
been on my channel this week or my new
mystery channel or my music channel I am
back and the reason why I was gone is
because I actually dropped my camera
last week I initially thought that it
was still working and I attempted to
film on it earlier in the week but I
just couldn't get any videos up this
thing was start like starting and
stopping recording every two to three
minutes and it was driving me insane so
I brought it over to Best Buy and I did
it get it fixed so that is where I have
been all week but today I wanted to go
ahead and walk you guys through my
Sephora vib sale no Jesus no and
this is a Black Friday haul ok this mic
Sephora black friday haul on my Ulta
Black Friday haul it all my
Black Friday hauls in one video yeah
great intro ok let's just go ahead and
just drop right into it I will be doing
a follow-up for this video so I am
actually going to combine my Sephora a
vib sale with this Black Friday haul and
I'm going to do a huge fall what massive
follow up next weekend just because I'm
a few days behind on videos now that's
where I was getting the Sephora vib sale
in my head is because I want to combine
the two of these but I hope you guys
enjoy let's go ahead and start with the
items that I did pick up from Sephora so
the first item I picked up during the
Sephora Black Friday sale was the Yoona
sleeping night oil in the mini
sized it's so excited about this you
guys this is the next generation
retinoid oil that reduces the appearance
of pores and wrinkles while fighting the
signs of premature aging and redness and
this is fantastic if you guys do want to
go ahead and try out a retinol but you
don't want something that's going to
irritate your skin and this is bound
into an oil and it's just absolutely
fantastic so I was so excited that they
had him any of that so I did go ahead
and pick that baby up another little
skincare set that I picked up this sold
out in like 15 minutes I was so happy I
got my hands on it
it's from it cosmetics this is the new
limited edition a beautiful skin set if
you have the it cosmetics miracle
cleansing water as well as the deluxe
size of the secret stops moisturizer you
guys know I've been wanting to try out
these secret sauce moisturizer this is a
$35 value and I got it for $15 so here
is the glow tonic which is they might
seller water and
you have the secret sauce moisturizer so
excited to try these products out I will
keep you guys updated on how those work
out for me up next I did see that by
beauty had a few of their mushroom
lipsticks on sale so these are there by
beauty a mousse abuse lipsticks and
basically they have like a nudes
collection they were all named after
mushrooms this one right here is called
cremini mushroom and then they also had
portobello Portobello when I was looking
at the colors none of them really drew
me in but this one I thought was kind of
interesting and strange and weird so I
went ahead and picked it up this is the
shade cremini and it's kind of like a
honey colored lipstick you guys I feel
like this is gonna look like on me
but I'm gonna try it out anyway I'm very
excited it's kind of like a puke Brown
with a little bit of mustard in there so
you know I'm very excited for that and
then up next I did pick up some products
here from a tart so this is the tortoise
pro at lash adhesive and this is their
vegan lashes set right here and this is
their little little lash helper it's a
lash applicator and now you may be
thinking what the lip you don't
wear lashes but I actually do on stage
sometimes so they did go ahead and pick
those up I will let you guys know how
these work out for me another agent that
I picked up from Sephora was the for a
luna mini this was on sale for $74 which
may sound like a lot of money it kind of
is but these are normally like 100 or
120 I already do have a dark purple one
that I carry around for travels so I
thought this one would be nice to have
at home and this is the bright pink one
and my boyfriend did express some
interest in trying this out as well
because he's getting sick of his
Clarisonic so these are really really
fantastic especially love them for
travel like I said so I did pick up
another little Luna pareo
and then I did have a bunch of points
just sitting there so I thought I'd go
ahead and use some 500-point perks on
the little Ola Hendrix insect inside of
here you do get the transforming walnut
scrub which I'm in love with you also
have the shear transformation perfecting
moisturizer which is just okay these
clean at roots foaming cleanser which is
really really nice it has that orange
creamsicles sort of scent to it you also
get the invigorating night
transformation gel which is a little
drying on my skin personally so I'll pop
that into a giveaway finally you do get
a few samples of the truth serum and I
really do like the size of the cleansers
in here and the scrubs in here these are
nice sizes
if you do have 500 points to spare right
now I would definitely recommend jumping
on the Ola Henrickson 500 point perk and
look at this little box okay
it's like a goddamn polka spotted box
like a little Dalmatian okay all right
now that's why I had you jump into a few
random things just cuz I have them
sitting right here I did order some more
candles from a soy at much brighter I
have two here but I did order three and
the third one kind of smelled like ass
so I went ahead and put that in at my
friend's box for her Christmas present
that's so bad it's not like ass so I'm
giving it to my friend for Christmas no
I think she would really like the scent
it is a pine scent and it's called into
the woods and now the other two that I
got here that I absolutely love the
scents on are past the cider which is a
mixture of apple cinnamon nutmeg and
clove and then pumpkin coffee which is
pumpkin and black coffee these smells
 orgasmic and delicious I really
like these these are soya vegan and they
say they're rad so basically they're
just like a wood Wigga you they're
all-natural they don't have any sort of
added like in them so if you want
some really really natural vegan candles
these are some good ones but yeah I do
like the two of these scents like I said
they into the wood sense smelled a
little more like a air freshener or
something like that I'm not really into
that I'm not really into the scent of
pine so I don't know why I picked that
handle up but I did pick the two of
those out and then I also picked up some
products from glossier because they were
having 20% off on their website so I got
the trio of their serums now the reason
why I did this was because P glossier
actually sent over a PR package a couple
of months ago and I wasn't exactly in
love with the makeup products that they
sent over but their skin care products
were really good so I did pick up this
little trio I think I got these for
around the forty dollar mark for three
different serums which is a great deal
this one right here is called super glow
and this one says to brighten and
energize dull tired skin apply over
clean and a clean face level a lot and
fall with moisturizer I gave that one to
my boyfriend's and then this one right
here is called super pure I thought this
would be nicer when I am breaking out it
says to calm breakup chrome skin and
redness apply over moisturizer and it
looks a little something like this super
super cute packaging I love the
packaging on glossier products and then
this is the one I want to use daily it's
called super bounce and this one does
have vitamin B five minutes to ease and
soften tight rough skin and that is
exactly what my skin is feeling like
lately so I will be going ahead and
using that on the daily but yeah really
excited for those glossier serums all
right now let's go ahead and finally end
with the products that I did pick up
from Ulta first is the NYX olympiade
vent calendar I bought it and I already
opened it up all 24 different little
mini lip products in here and these are
actually deluxe sizes and I put all of
them into a little lipstick rack so
you're all 24 that you get so you guys
enjoy getting a mixture of their lip
lingerie is that they're butter glosses
they're intense butter glosses they're
butter lipsticks all sorts of different
things so let me know if you want like a
lip swatch video on these I think that
would be a lot of fun I suck at
putting lip product on but you know if
you want it after velvet so anyway you
get all sorts of different colors in
here I cannot wait to try all of these
out so this was actually totally worth
it it was like $24.99 for all 24 of
these so that's that great deal
and then I also went ahead and picked up
the nutty body butter trio I recommended
this when I did my recommendations video
and what to pick up during the Black
Friday sales this is something that was
on my wish list and something that I
knew I wanted to get it was $18 for the
coconut body butter as well as the milk
and honey and the Shea body butter from
the body shop these are great body
butters if you want something as it is
not going to leave your skin with a
really oily sort of feeling but you want
something that is going to moisturize
these do the job and they are not full
size but they are a nice deluxe size and
you won't go through these too quickly
so I'm very very excited I picked that
baby up and then here I picked up a lip
liner which I definitely could have
benefited from using today because my
lips look like right now but that's
okay this is the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on lip pencil in the shade ozone
which is basically just a clear lip
liner I don't have time for a lip liner
okay I don't want to have time for a lip
liner it's just a whole unnecessary step
in my opinion so I like something that's
clear because then I don't it up
you know what I mean so I just kind of
painted onto my lips quickly and then I
go in with my lip product and it doesn't
bleed like this is happening today you
know so I'm very excited for this I do
already have one of these but it's like
down to here so I thought I'd go ahead
and pick up another since these were
only a $9.99 a piece and then here we
have it the it cosmetics hello lashes
five I'm going to volumizing a mascara
this was also on sale for $10 now I feel
like I've tried this before but I can't
remember I'm not a big fan of these
superhero mascara you guys know that but
and this one right here is more like my
style it's not a natural bristle one
it's actually a rubber bristle one kind
of like a death wand you know what I'm
saying
so I feel like I'm gonna get a lot of
use out of this I can't remember if I've
tried this or not before but I am
excited to give it another go
and then finally guys when you did spend
over $50 you got a little sack right
here that sounds weird you got a little
sack right here from Ulta and basically
in here you get a bunch of different
Ulta beauty products Ulta beauty brand
is cruelty free so that's really cool so
here we have some blotting papers or
blotting sheets which is interesting
right here we have the uLTA Beauty
tinted eye primer in satin blush so I
feel like that's a beautiful beautiful
color that will be interesting to use up
next we have a little sharpener because
we also do have an eyeliner here and
this is a blackout eyeliner and then a
plum eyeliner so we're gonna go ahead
and test those out and then here you get
a little brush and actually super soft
you know when you get these little
flimsy brushes and they feel like
 this actually feels really
nice so I'm actually excited for that
little guy and then you get two little
lip products here the first one is the
matte lip crayon in the shade a soirÃ©e
and then right here you have the color
brush lip gloss in the shade Olivia yes
if you guys didn't know my name is not
Liv it's Olivia so that's really cute I
like that so anyway guys those are all
the products that I picked up during
Black Friday please let me know what you
got down below and I guess I'll see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
