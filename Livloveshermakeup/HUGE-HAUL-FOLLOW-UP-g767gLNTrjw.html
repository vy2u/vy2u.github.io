channel I hope you're all having a
wonderful day so far this video is going
to be my huge haul follow-up so about
two and a half or three weeks ago I did
a huge collective haul on my channel i
will link that video down below i'm here
to give you guys my final thoughts or at
least my first impressions on those
products now i want to say first of all
and there were two eye mask that i
purchased from sephora that i already
used up and that were in last month's
empties those were the rose eye mask in
the pomegranate I'm asked I would
repurchase those I enjoyed them a lot I
prefer the pomegranate over the rose but
yes those are very very good also I used
two of the Evian facial mist up and
those were in last month's empties as
well so I don't have them to show you
guys but those were really really nice
as well I like to carry them in my purse
I would repurchase and then let's see
here oh yes the Estee Lauder pallets
that I got from my friend i bought from
her makeup sale I have not dug into yet
so I'm not going to mention that in this
video and then the little glam glow mask
I actually used up last month as well so
about five of the items that I had
purchased in that Hall have already been
taken care of and they're in my empties
so yeah anyway I'm going to talk to you
guys about all of the rest of the items
so let's go ahead and get started right
here we have the pacifica underarm
deodorant voids these are the coconut
milk scented ones these are amazing I
coffees at Ulta they really smell good
and I really do think they work so i
would definitely repurchase those i also
had picked up these Pacifica super-dee
tops super deep box super detox deep
purification white these have kale
cucumber and mango steen infused in them
these are absolutely wonderful very very
clarifying if you do have combo or oily
skin I think you would absolutely adore
these these are going to be something
that I will repurchase over and over
let's see here the next item is from
Sephora this is the mini citrus brush
cleaner I have been loving this I was
very very worried because honestly it
does seem like it's a little oily and it
is kind of oily and I do not like oily
makeup removers however are not makeup
removers brush cleaners but when you
spray this on to the actual like cotton
pad or whatever you want to clean it off
on you can brush your brush in there and
then you wipe it off separately on like
a separate paper towel so I feel like
you can get rid of the oiliness
would definitely repurchase this I
probably have like this much left at the
bottom I think it works very very well
and the scent is amazing oh it smells
like pure like orange and lemon and you
guys know I love citrus so I'm really
enjoying that the next item I had
purchased was the purity made simple
one-step facial cleanser this is another
item that I'm usually using oh why can't
I think I'm using to clean up my makeup
brushes I use this as my deep cleanser
for my makeup brushes it smells
interesting I don't I don't know I'm
starting to like this smell more but
when I first used this for the first
time on my face I was like holy i
hate that sense but i actually is
starting to its starting to grow on me
but anyway i don't use this on my face I
don't think this is a very good cleanser
at all I'm sure a lot of people are
going to disagree in the comments
section it just didn't personally work
for my skin type but I do like it for
removing like excess makeup off of my
brushes it works very well and it does
not leave any sort of film or gross
residue now an item that I do love using
on my face is the purity facial
cleansing gel and eye makeup remover I
also purchased this and it was such a
good deal you get seven point five fluid
ounces in here it is a gel so a little
goes a long way and it does smell
exactly like the purity line and I think
that's why it's growing on me because
the more i use this the more i love it
so anyway this is a fantastic absolutely
fantastic makeup remover what I do is I
splash my face with a little bit of
water then I will take probably like a
quarter size amount of this I'll rub it
all over my face I rub it over my eye
area everywhere it takes makeup off
amazingly and then you just wash your
face so really really enjoy this will
repurchase this this is right on up
there with my bosha makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil which you guys know I'm
obsessed with I feel like that is saying
a lot so really enjoy that product i
also had picked up the tree hut Shea
sugar scrub in the tropical mango sent
you guys know this is my all-time
favorite I'm exfoliating like body
exfoliator oh please open okay I can't
open it but anyway it's my all-time
favorite scent from tree hut and also i
love the formulation on these body
scrubs they work so well they do not
leave you only they will not leave an
oily cast or like slippery feeling in
your tub or anything like that they're
amazing highly highly recommend and they
are very very affordable the next item I
purchase was the josie maran nirvana
hydrating treatment mess I don't like
this I don't like it I'm not going to
return it I do think it's okay it is
quite refreshing on the skin I've been
using it basically to set in my skincare
in the morning and at night time but you
guys I don't know I don't feel like it
squirts out enough product at once also
you guys can see this kind of got bent
out of shape the little part up here it
doesn't have a very good taste or smell
it's cotton inside of my nostrils inside
of my mouth and I'm like holy that
tastes weird I think it might have
alcohol in it honestly when I'm spraying
this on my face and a little gets into
my mouth that's what I'm tasting I will
have to double check the ingredients but
there's no point in getting some sort of
a facial ness that has alcohol in it
because ultimately it's just going to
dry your skin out so I would not
repurchase this not very happy with that
purchase at all and then the next item I
had picked up from Sephora was a Lancome
juicy shaker the shade that I got is
cherry symphony since I'm a musician
this is what it looks like and I will be
doing a battle of the lip oils you guys
will actually see that tomorrow morning
which is wednesday at six a.m. but this
is what the swatch looks like on the
back of my hand and I like a lot of
things about this product but there's
also a few things that I don't like so
there is the actual color I think the
color is beautiful i love the feeling on
the lips but my friend rochelle was
completely right these do not last on
the lips whatsoever like literally you
have to reapply these probably every 20
to 30 minutes and i just feel like it's
not worth it this is about twenty
dollars at sephora so i'm not going to
pick up any more of these i do think
it's nice it does smell good it tastes
good it does have a pretty tint to it
and it's kind of like my sword of lip
products but i do wish that the where
time was a little longer on these i do
carry this around in my flute case i
don't mind like reapplying throughout
the day what I do like about this
another thing that I do like is the fact
that it does not like rub off onto my
flute head showing so that's a big thing
for me so I think that this is just an
okay product it's not my favorite but
it's also not many least favorite and
then I also had picked up some
colour-pop lippie so the first one I got
was the color pop color plop yes it's
too early it's too early when I'm
filming does the color pop ultra glossy
lip in the shade cheat code this is a
beautiful beautiful kind of like bronzy
color and i love the
emulation on this I will say it does go
outside of the lip line quite quickly so
you might want to wear a lip liner but I
like the formulation it's not too sticky
it's actually quite moisturizing and you
guys know i'm all about comfortable lip
products so that was definitely a good
purchase and the color is absolutely
fantastic and outstanding I mean look at
that I don't have anything like that in
my collection I also purchased the
colour-pop ultra metallic lip this is in
the shade flitter again very very pretty
unique color the only reason I'm going
to not declutter this is for the color
but I have to say I'm not a huge fan of
this formulation they are very very late
in moosie however I do find them quite
drying on the lips not as bad as like a
liquid lipstick there's flitter it's not
as bad as they liquid lipstick look at
those shitty swatches not as bad as a
liquid lipstick but I do think that they
are quite drying still so they look
quite nice and Lucy and shiny when you
first put them on but then they do dry
down and like I said the only reason I'm
going to keep it is because that is a
very unique shade I also picked up the
ultra metallic lip in the shade zebra
which again beautiful very very unique
shade will be keeping it because of the
shade but yes the same thing with the
formulation very nice and mu C and kind
of lightweight and also I find that I
can't reapply these throughout the day
they just start to kind of crumble on my
lips so not the greatest formulation but
I like the concept and the colors are
outstanding alright and now we are going
to go into the last part which was the
tease i did a big like teavana sort of
segment hall hulp did that make sense
none of that made sense I did a huge big
t bond hall within that hall so anyway
the first item I had picked up was a
teavana set and I had a bunch of
different loose-leaf teas in it the
first one was raspberry lime aid this is
a bright herbal infusion of raspberry
balsamic oh and limeade twist I do not
really like this one this is not that
great Tom does like it I personally
would not purchase a full size of this
we also got chocolate chai which is
black t plus rooibos balanced by dark
chocolate and sweet cinnamon notes this
tastes amazing if you are someone who
likes chai and you really like that like
nutty kind of flavor chocolate bean medi
like depth inside of your chai you would
really like this I feel like that made
no sense but hopefully you guys know
what I mean I feel like pure chocolate
is very kind of like nutty tasting and
that is
very good and then we have youth Barry
this is white tea with sunrise pineapple
acai berry and a subtle floral finish
this one is so so good and I feel like
youth berry is one of the fan favorites
from teavana so we would purchase a full
size of that Jasmine along oh my god oh
my god you will see this in tea time
with live at the end of the month this
is amazing I love green tea paired
together with jasmine this is green
oolong teas natural orchid notes that
are enhanced by sweet jasmine and it
tastes so incredibly good we need like a
full full size of that one also wild
orange blossom I really liked this one
Tom did not like it he thought it was a
little too sweet but this is an herbal
infusion so it has no I'm caffeine
whatsoever it's a soothing herbal
infusion of orange + hibiscus with light
floral undertones I saw it taste really
really good and I would like a little
bit of this at night without any sort of
sweetener we also had the Earl Grey
creme I personally didn't like this one
but Tom wants a full size it is black
tea with classic Italian bergamot creamy
Madagascar vanilla and playful pops of
marigold petals it was just a little too
overpowering and it kind of tasted a
little more sour than sweet and I like
really sweet teas but we would probably
getting full-size for Tom next we have
the strawberry grape fruit Seulong and
this is a green tea brightens by pink
grapefruit sweet raspberry and lemon
grass this one is really actually quite
good I do like this one a lot we would
probably get a full size of that also
the white chai this one was pretty good
we do prefer the chocolate chai we
probably wouldn't get a full size of
this but this is white tea with warming
chai spice is balanced by tropical
coconut and pineapple so that was kind
of weird because I is like a very like
kind of you know darker tasting product
I guess you could say you know it has
like cinnamon and things like that in it
so to have a child with like coconut and
pineapple kind of tasted wrong to me
Jessica I'm used to like that really
cardamom and cinnamon taste but Tom did
actually kind of like this one but I
don't think will purchase on both sides
we also got these juju island green this
is beautiful it reminds me a lot of
matcha green so if you like that you
would like this Tom prefers this one I
prefer the other green tea I'll show you
guys in a minute but this is full-bodied
pure green tea with rich notes of
toasted chestnuts and then we also had
this one this is just the chai along Tom
like this one very very classic
very good tasting has a lot of caffeine
in it so be aware of that this is a long
t spiced up by cinnamon ginger cloves
and cardamom so that is what it looks
like alright moving on we also got this
flavored who longs to Morris T this
tastes really really good very festive
holiday related I like this a lot but we
also got caramel chai this one's quite
good it's a little on the sweet side a
little to artificially sweetened and I
did look at the ingredients and they do
put sugar already in here so that's
probably why I wasn't a big fan of that
one I'm caramel almond amaretto oh my
god this is good this tastes really
really nice warm you don't need any sort
of sweetener in this it's just so so so
good the way it is so we would
definitely purchase a full size of that
and then this is the green tea that I
like this is the shoe gyro crew and this
is like the most expensive one on their
website literally like a 32 ounce
container of this it's like 150 talleres
but it's so so so good it's just
straight-up pure green tea it tastes
amazing the tea leaves are like long and
they smell so good oh my god it's
beautiful so we would probably go ahead
and i would spend $150 to get a full
size of that we also got poached pear
cider Tom loves this iced and without
any sort of sweetener it tastes really
really good that is an herbal infusion
so no caffeine and then we also got the
chai along which we also got in the
level travel size and again Tom really
likes this one it's good it's just a
full body nice chai and then they last
item we had picked up with Belgian rock
sugar we haven't cracked into this one
yes but we do exclusively use the
teavana Belgian Rock sugar we have
another bag that we're going through
right now that we love so anyway guys
that was my huge haul follow-up I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
