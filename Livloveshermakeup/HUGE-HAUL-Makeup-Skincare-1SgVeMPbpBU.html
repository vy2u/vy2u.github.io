hope you guys are having a really good
day I have a haul for you guys today as
you can see i have a few boxes just a
few let's see here i have stuff from
Ulta I have some stuff from paula's
choice some stuff from morphe brushes
support and also nordstrom rack or whole
look so let's just get started I'm going
to start with what I got from Ulta so
the first thing i got was this um ulta
beauty smoothie dragon fruit frappe
three-in-one shower gel bubble bath and
shampoo it looks like this and it smells
really really good it smells like just
fruity and delicious so I was excited to
try this I looked at some of the
formulas and I just thought or I mean I
looked at some of the different the
formulas the different like sense they
had the different flavors and I thought
that this one just kind of caught my eye
I wanted to try out the smaller size
first before i purchased a big size i
just thought it was fun to have a shower
gel a bubble bath and shampoo all in one
I thought it'd be fun to try I'll
probably end up using it as a bubble
bath but also can you imagine traveling
with this like that would be so easy you
can use it as your shower gel and your
shampoo it's kind of awesome so anyway
um the little trial sizes that look like
this they had this particular scent the
dragon fruit frappe and they also had
the buttercream cupcake which smells
amazing I'm probably going to use the
dragon fruit one first just because it
smells a little more summery and then
use this one after this really really
smells good this buttercream cupcake
smells amazing it smells like vanilla
frosting alright moving on a few samples
from hotel just get through these
quickly Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer that's a really nice primer and
also a little one of the benefit
professional love that for concealing
poorest I picked up to a big Physicians
Formula argued where ultra nourishing
argan oil blushes and these came out a
while ago they're not completely new
they say that they're new but they came
out a while ago and I've seen a lot of
people do videos on them
but I would pick a few up for myself so
I got the shade rose and the shade
natural so this is rose and i will say i
did swatch these already and so you guys
know they do have like a gold overspray
on top of them so that has already been
wiped off which really made the product
looked really beautiful that i already
wipe that off but anyway this is what
the packaging looks like again this is
the rose color and it just looks a
little something like whoa well
something like that really really
beautiful it just has a mixture of like
Rosie tones and it smells really really
good so I'm excited to use that and I'll
show you the other one which is been
natural terrible oh excuse me there will
be a lot of blushes in this hall I have
been blush obsessed lately and this is
the natural color so this one's a little
more like peachy in my opinion than the
rose one but I also thought it just
really pretty it has like a dark coral
in the middle absolutely like that also
smells really really good so I'm excited
to play with those i also got two
blushes from palais do i don't have a
lot of things from play do in fact i
don't think i have anything from the
palladia brand so i picked up two of
their matte blushes this one is in
bayberry which looks like this and i did
swatch it it's just really really true
to color a nice matte kind of medium
toned fuchsia but it's like on the cool
side so it's not too bright and I also
picked up this kind of nice apricot
peachy color it's kind of like a muted
apricot peachy color it's called peach
itís and this is also matt and these
were really cheap these were only a
couple dollars each so i really like the
who's excited to play with those i
picked up this NYX honey do me up um
what is this skin serum and primer so it
basically comes like this and has like
little gold flecks in it and you open it
up and it has one of those things that
like snaps when you have completely
closed it which I really like sometimes
I feel like I don't completely closed a
product so we have that will snap
closure but it has this little spatula
and it basically pulls product out and
you put it on your skin and so I don't
know if I'm going to use this as a
primer or
a CRM I have a lot of Syrians serums i'm
currently going through so i'll probably
use this as a primer but it says it has
honey which is a natural antiseptic
antiseptics yes and gold flakes which
increased skins radians and also
collagen for smoother skin so i'll
probably end up using this as a primer i
did put a little on the back of my hand
last night and it felt so good so I'm
excited for that maybe we'll use it as a
serum probably not puhlease it is
brother just go with that I picked up
one of the NYX soft matte lip creams I
don't have any of these which is
surprising i wanted to try out the
formula and I'm in love I will totally
get another one this is in the color
Istanbul and it's a really really
beautiful neutral pretty color i'll show
you guys and pull it out like this it's
a little darker than what it appears in
the actual packaging but it's really
really nice and the formulas and basing
and it just feels so nice on the lips it
doesn't feel drying at all so really
impressed with that i also picked up a
knicks intense butter gloss this color
is toasted marshmallow and um I just
thought it was really really pretty it
seemed to be the one shade that
everybody raved about and I do have some
of the NYX butter glosses but this is
one of the like extreme or intense
butter glasses so it has more
pigmentation to it so I definitely had
to try that out oh he's a gangsta coma
scarf it is so cold here in Manhattan
today I don't know what's going on it's
almost june and it was literally the
high today was 66 degrees so I've like a
scarf on long shirt I'm all bundled up
really crazy the next thing I picked up
I don't know why I got this so stupid
this is the Maybelline Dream atmos in
porcelain I've read this is kind of a
horrible foundation i think i just
picked it up because it reminded me of
like back in the day um but it's way too
dark for me cuz i don't know why i got
this but i think that sometimes it's
easy like with a moose to just like pick
it up and smear it all over your face if
you have to be out of the door in a
hurry so i think that's why i got it but
it is too dark for me to or not not
quite sure what I was thinking I
remember trying this out when it first
came out and not loving
but girl whatever i'm trying to get the
next thing i got was the knicks
high-voltage lipstick I've heard so many
good things about these lipsticks and i
love it i have watched it it is from in
the color ranks to riches and it is this
beautiful coral shade with a golden
undertone it is absolutely beautiful the
shade is so different from anything that
i have and also let me put some on my
lips it's not pretty it probably doesn't
match with what's going on here but um
it's so beautiful and oh my god they
just feel so good on the lips so I'm
really really happy that I picked that
up love the formula these high voltage
lipsticks how did I not try these out
sooner seriously alright next I got one
of the tree had two detoxifying
Mediterranean salt scrubs and this is in
fig and olive fig and olive and it is
activated charcoal with Fig &amp;amp; Olive
extracts certified organic shea butter I
love the scrubs from tree hat I have
tried the sugar scrubs I've tried some
of the salt scrub side that I tried the
active charcoal one why not so I'm gonna
try that out we'll see how that goes the
scent is really nice actually it smells
really good so happy that I also picked
up from tree hut something that I did
not know they sold this is a tree hut
epsom salts so they had I think two
different signs they have a coconut line
which sometimes gave me a headache
sometimes that scent um so I got the
tropical mango which is the scent I know
I love and this is vishay moisturizing
epsom salts tropical mango students
aches and pains certified organic shea
butter natural maple extract and
basically like this whole bag was like
under ten dollars so it was a really
good deal and epsom salts are really
nice for when you just need to like
relax your body so I'm happy I picked
that up and then the last two things
that ulta were these helps body
moisturizers I remember back in the day
in high school when I was a receptionist
at a hair salon they used to use this um
like
I don't know they had this that you
could buy like on the way out which is
weird because it was a hair salon but
anyway um they have the original one and
recently they've come out with all sorts
of different like combinations and
scents and flavors flavors not like
you're eating it but you guys know what
I mean so the original one still smells
the best to me this is the hemp pure
herbal extracts original herbal body
moisturizer and it just smells so good
you guys like there's something so
special about this scent try and
describe it it's just kind of like sweet
smelling like I don't know if that's
what hemp's malafide but if it does I
want to like eat it and then I also got
the pomegranate one so don't love this
scent as much i think the original 12
smells the best i'll probably end up
getting a big size of the original set
so anyway that is what i got it ulta
let's move on this is going to be a long
video because I have a lot of things
that I didn't want to break it into a
bunch of different things so next we
have polished choice I am trying to up
my skincare routine yeah like you know
really vamp it up so i picked up the
polished choice clinical 1% treatment
with peptides and vitamin c i tried this
before and hated it the reason I got it
is because I saw on the Polish toys
website that you could buy both of these
together and it just seemed like it was
a match made in heaven because everybody
was commenting that they didn't get a
bad reaction so this is the clinical one
percent retinol treatment this is like
no joke this is one percent retinol
that's a very high percentage it's hard
to work with you only need a small
amount and it has this nice little pub
but when i use this I had horrible
horrible reaction the first time you
used it which was probably month two
months and months ago I tried I think
maybe around November trying to use this
and I hated the product and did not use
it up all the way however when I saw on
the website that they were having like a
dual thing for like $75 get the two 475
with the resist moisture renewal oil
booster and people were commenting that
they had absolutely no sensitivity when
they combine the two I knew I had to get
it so this is the resist voice your
renewal oil booster for normal to dry
skin and what you do is you drop it
comes with a little dropper which I'm
going to put on and basically you take I
think three of I have to go back on the
website and look for sure but i think
it's three drops of this to one pump of
this and you mix them together and you
apply it on clean skin at night so i'm
going to start doing that and if it's
working out well i'm going to do an
updated nighttime skincare routine which
i don't think i've actually been done
yet so a nighttime skincare routine and
i'll let you guys know how all of that
is going but I'm trying to vamp up my
ass and purity I also picked up the post
choice clinical scar reducing serum for
all skin types and I just thought you
know I've been really into trying
different serums i still haven't felt
like found one that i'm absolutely love
with so this would be for daytime has a
nice like silicone e texture so it's
almost like a built in primary skimming
so i thought i would try that out and
then i got a few little samples i got
the polished choice resist vitamin c
spot treatment it brightens skin tone
and banishes brown spots it's just a
little tiny tube of that and then two
other samples um the skin recovery
hydrating treatment mask and the
ultralight super antioxidant concentrate
serum and i also use the BHA liquid last
night so that is what i got from paula's
choice moving on morphe brushes finally
got my jaclyn hill favorites palette
really really excited for this um and i
did swash them the shadows are amazing
makes a great so i'll show you guys
quickly what it looks like I didn't get
it the first time around and then I saw
how amazing everybody was making it look
and see so I knew I had to pick it up so
this is what it looks like they are very
very pigmented and very very creamy in
texture and yeah I'm really really happy
that I picked it up so that all i got
from morphe and then i got a few things
from sephora really just like two things
i like i said i'm in a blah i'm on in a
i'm on a blush kick so I picked up the
NARS dual intensity blush a lot of
people were saying bad things about this
and still I'm kind of undecided i'm not
going to return it a horse because I
just don't like returning makeup but um
I'm definitely
gonna play with it i think it's going to
work better when it is wet rather than
dry it's kind of hard to work with when
it's dry I did Squatch it anyway I got
the duo in adoration and it looks like
this you get a nice light pink and a
dark pink and like I said I swatch them
and they just seem really like kind of
difficult to work with and a little dry
and texture so I am definitely going to
play with them more like wet to like
kind of spray my brush with a setting
spray and then work it and see if that
works better and the other blush I shaft
is from our glasses the ambient lighting
blush in the shade diffused heat I also
swatch this already love it um i have
been loving my hourglass ambient
lighting power powder in ethereal light
so i thought i would definitely have to
pick up one of these blushes and this is
what diffused heat looks like so its a
mix of that yellow toned um ambient
lighting power powder the yeah i think
it i think its ethereal i think it's the
more yellow toned one mixed with the
actual blush and it's absolutely
beautiful also the packaging is just
like on point on point girl on fleek and
then i got some samples javon chinois
report or one mascara stay here cute
little tiny it's like a tube wow that
one though love it so definitely going
to try that out see how that goes you
know I love me some mascaras and then i
also got samples i got i used up the
josie maran last night at used up the
Arcan milk hydrating treatment thing i
like sad i just found that it was like
it was like a very light version of the
argan oil if you like that i won't get
it but i prefer the actual argan oil i
actually like the thickness of the oil
but if you don't like the thickness of
the oil definitely look at the Argan
milk from just Marin uh and I got a
sample of the kaplan md beverly hills
perfect pout lip mask listen lip balm
duo which I'm excited about because
everything
want to buy this but I thought hey I
really should try a sample dress before
I decide just spit on to my Creator
literally just fish sorry um I was
definitely already like considering
purchasing this because I would I love
my goggle it masks from bite beauty but
this is nice because I can try it out to
make sure I actually like it before I go
and purchase it alright that's when I
got at sephora moving along okay last
box uh what how long do we have 15
minutes so far well this is the last
thing um look so pop you need was on
hautelook and i order some more things
the first thing i got was the bright up
your life palette which um I got the
neutral one a while ago and I really
like the texture so I thought well I
really should try out the bright one and
see what they're like I did swatch them
they're not super super pigmented but I
feel like they're safe to work with like
if you're someone who's going to be
working with bright colors you kind of
want to be on the safe side you don't
want to just like be like damn there's
the color you kind of want to be like
working it up so that's what the palette
looks like and I like it's a little
weird but I like it I also got the pop
beauty blush bean and this is more of
like a highlight I also swatched it it
has like four different segments of
colors kind of like in a row and I think
I already mixed it up because I just
don't like using segment I like to just
mix the whole product together and um
it's definitely not a blush but it's
called a blush of beam so I feel like
that's kind of like a highlight cannot
get it out of this box out okay thank
you i'm seriously rip it open um anyway
comes in this cute little box like this
is like a nice little hard case and have
a little brush in there but nice big
mirror but that is the color it's like
it brush out it really is just like a
highlight and it's super super shimmery
and it's very pretty like I said there
were like four different more like six
different segments of color but I just
mix them all together I think will be a
nice high
or even play blush talking than dropping
everything a blush topper I think will
be great as a blush topper like you put
like a light blush on that's Matt and
then you sweep that over just like once
you'll have the perfect amount of sugar
me all right I also got a stain stain
lip stain in petal pout really like the
color um it just was really really
pretty that is what it looks like let me
show you guys the color and it comes out
so easily you know how lip stain
sometimes just dry out right away this
one's really nice so that's the color
really pretty and I also got another
stain and stay and this one is in peach
pepper looks like that and I really like
this color so it would be very peachy
kind of apricot e apricot e because
that's a word you know um I got me wait
let's continue with a lip products so i
can keep stretching them a big pop
beauty powdery pop crayon in barely
bitten what is happening why is going on
also really nice the texture is so
creamy it just like lights on it's right
there and then i got another one of the
pouty pop crayons and this one is in
rose romance this one does that it's
like doesn't glide on as nicely as the
other one the one I just showed I mean
wow this packaging is just packing is
killing me today girl there's actually
that real yeah this one is just not as
like I don't know but it's right there
it's also very pretty so those are all
those lip products I think they look
really good i'm excited to play with
them and then I got the pop beauty face
magnet primer just thought I'd try it
out i'm all about those face primers so
that's what it looks like we'll see
looks promising i did rub a little into
the back of my hand and seemed kind of
like tacky but not too sticky so you
know like product will stick without a
dean sticky let me know sense
it's like it was just tacky enough that
your face will circulate you foundation
stick your bait so I'm trying to say
girl okay and then I got to be pop Syria
/ pot mascara and seriously black see if
the girl the mom looks like this and I
love me some rubber Bristol wands and
this look right up my alley so anyway
that was my high because I've enjoyed it
I've so much crap to put away now like
so much i'm looking at the pile like
seriously should be but um yeah i hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
