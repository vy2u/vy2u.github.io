channel today's video is going to be a
huge haul and I just want to say I'm
filming when I get home from work which
I usually don't like to do my hair is a
mess I was filming this morning it was
all pretty and put together and now I
feel like a greasy beast but anyway I
would hear Charl for you guys today I'm
super super excited this is a collective
haul I feel like my cameras crooked it's
a crooked it looks like it's over there
okay whatever haha i have a huge
collective haul provide i did some
shopping on the sephora.com website i
did some alta shopping i bought a few
items from my friends makeup sale i also
got some stuff from teavana and i also
got some stuff from colour-pop so
originally I was just going to do
separate little mini halls like a whole
week worth of halls but then I was like
you know what once in a while I like
doing a big fat collective haul because
who doesn't like watching just like a
bunch of beauty stuff on boxed in one
big video so that's what we're doing
today so let's go ahead and get started
I will start with Sephora the first two
items that I ordered from Sephora are
from philosophy and these are parts of
the purity line now this is the purity
made simple one-step facial cleanser I
actually do not like this as a facial
cleanser and I'm sure that people are
going to be like what oh because a lot
of people do really like this as a
facial cleanser but I wanted to get this
to use to clean my makeup brushes down 8
fluid ounces was i think around like $23
which is a little more expensive than
what I'm used to purchasing from
philosophy I like to use their
three-on-one products to actually deep
clean my makeup brushes at night time so
i may go back to that but I've heard
really good things about this for
cleaning makeup brushes like it leaves
no oily residue or anything so I am
going to try that out and then one item
I already dug into because I needed
makeup remover this is the purity made
simple facial cleansing gel and eye
makeup remover so this is actually a gel
that removes your makeup like I said I
wasn't a huge fan of this for actually
removing makeup and I was such as
cleansing my face I didn't think it was
anything special actually but I heard
really really great reviews about this
and there were just some really good
reviews on Sephora it says it provides a
fresh filming deep clean that is ideal
for oily skin types which you guys know
I definitely have combo to oily skin it
says it removes dirt oil impurities and
all traces of makeup and eye makeup and
it rinses completely clean leaving skin
feeling refreshed and not tight and you
guys I'm in love with this so far I've
used about this much and i will say like
this is just as good at removing makeup
as my bow
makeup break up cool cleansing oil would
you guys know I'm absolutely obsessed
with so this is 7.5 fluid ounces I think
you get about I think it's about the
same price as they make up break up to
so I don't know this may be a new
favorite for me you guys really really a
nice product you wet your face and then
you take a little bit of it you put it
all over you basically massage into your
skin it takes off all your foundation
all of your eye makeup it's really
really good alright the next item that I
got is something that had been on my
love's list for quite some time now it
is a facial mist I didn't have some bad
luck lately with facial mist I really
didn't like one from herb Orion I had
tried and no it wasn't her borean was it
yeah was herb Orion there was also one
from oly henriksen I wasn't really into
but I'm really hoping this is good this
is the josie maran nirvana hydrating
treatment missed it says supreme skin
bliss this is what the outer packaging
looks like and i have heard pretty good
things about this i think taki talked
about it and it's been on my love's list
for like a year now it's a beautiful
little glass bottle like this and you
guys know I love me some facial miss so
I'm really hoping this will be good it
says experience nirvana starts with
clean skin and a call mind closed eyes
press and hold pump to create a steady
missed and then I'm going to use this to
set in my skincare in the morning and at
night so I'm very excited for that the
next item I got to my friend Rochelle is
going to be rolling her eyes while she
watches this this is one of the Lancome
juicy shakers I wanted these for a while
now I tried to stay away because I
wasn't trying to purchase any new lip
products this year this is what the
actual packaging looks like and the
shade that I got is called 151 cherry
symphony obviously since i'm a musician
had to get that one of it anyway this is
like a little um a little shaker and it
is a bio by phase like lip oil so
basically you shake it up the oil
combines with the pigment and then you
put it on your lips she got one of these
and she thought the staying power was
incredibly poor and now we do look for
different kind of things when it comes
to lip products she likes long wearing
lip products i don't care i just want
them to be comfortable so i did want to
try these out so i picked up one of
these up and let me go ahead and swatch
it for you guys to go keep that little
applicator as i am obsessed oh my god
it's so soft to see I think I'm gonna
like these I know
she was saying it was like complete crap
but I have the feeling that I'm gonna
like this so there it is right there
Terry symphony and it's like a nice soft
little applicator that's super super
cute alright the next item that I
purchased were some more skincare items
I've got some more facial mist these are
just from Evian it's just their little
duo that looks like this this is
basically just Evian water in actual
little aerosol can and I like to carry
these in my purse to refresh my face
throughout the day and also if I'm
getting really hot I think it's nice to
spray all over your body I also picked
up two more of these Sephora I'm ass I
got the rose one in oscoda pomegranate
to the pomegranate is my all-time
favorite and this is what it looks like
and this one is supposed to help with
anti fatigue and it's also supposed to
energize your under eye area and then
the rose one is ultra moisturizing and
brightening so I do like both of them
you guys know I love everything rose but
the pomegranate is definitely my
favorite I see the biggest difference
when I use this particular one I've
tried all of the I'm ass out and this
one is still my favorites but anyway i
like to use those basically on special
occasions i used to use them in the
morning before work like everyday but
that's starting to add up and it costs a
lot of money because those are five
bucks a pop so they're basically like a
single-use form some people were saying
that you can get a couple uses out of
them I seem to not be able to do that I
don't know why it's like my skin just
sucks all of the actual product in so I
really like them on special occasions
like date night or if we're going
somewhere or if I have a concert so yeah
and then the last item that i got from
sephora is the mini citrus brush cleaner
it says it is a natural brush cleaner
derived from fresh citrus orange oils
and I just wanted to try this out as a
spot cleaner for my brushes all right do
we have a lot of samples and point perks
and I also typed in a lot of codes
because this was I think I place this
Sephora order in like three orders so
the first thing i got was the Clinique
pep start Hydra blur moisturizer this is
what it looks like and I think this was
a code or a hundred point perk and
basically this is just a blurring
moisturizer so I'm excited to try it out
I've been seen a lot of commercials for
the staff start line I also got the
Giorgio Armani knockoff I cannot speak
of Giorgio Armani haha see perfume or is
it perfume yeah it's a perfume I
I got the Guerlain meteorites baby glow
this is a light revealing sheer make up
with sunscreen and it has broad spectrum
SPF 25 in it so I'm excited to try that
out I got a sample of the benefit
Porefessional I also got a sample of the
YSL rouge the left shin lipsticks in
Rose Rouge and coral there they are I
love YSL lip products so i think i will
like that sample i also got a sample of
the Murad invisible or perfecting shield
that this is one of my all-time favorite
sunscreens it feels like a primer it's
awesome speaking of primers I also got
the hourglass ambient light correcting
power of the primer in mood lights you
guys know I have a full-size luminous
light I do like it so I thought I'd get
that and then they had the color
correcting fluids from urban decay in
sample version you guys know I love
these so I could take that to travel
with alright and then there was a code
to type in for a sample bag this is for
skincare I was very very excited the
first sample you get in here is the
drunk elephant be Hydra intensive
hydration gel they also had this which
is why I wanted to get it this is the
title brightening enzyme water cream
from sunday riley I've heard really good
things about that i also have heard
really good things about the sea from a
day serum from drunk elephant here we
have the tattoo Harper regenerating
cleanser I'm excited to try that they
touch of pure one step camellia
cleansing oil I had tried this before
it's just okay the Luna sleeping oil
I've been wanting to try this for ever
from sunday riley you guys know a big
fan of retinol but i've heard that the
smell is really strange so we'll see the
Etosha polished classic race ensign
powder in the classic version and then i
also be taught to Harper resurfacing
mask and that is what that sample looks
like and then I got another little one
this one is seven days worth of the
Clinique a moisture surge expended
thirst relief this is just a gel to
creme it's like a gel cream moisturizer
I've gone through to full sizes of these
I thought these would be perfect to
travel with if you want seven days worth
of moisturizer and then I also picked up
a five
under point perk I've been saving a lot
of my points i think i have like 2,000
or 3,000 right now just sitting around
because honestly I don't really like to
spend my 500-point perks on makeup kits
I like to get the skin care stuff
because I feel like it goes a long way
so this is the fresh age delay
essentials for face and lips I am
obsessed with the age delay black teen
line from fresh and it's very very
expensive and I thought that they had
the new serum in here and the serum is
$85 and that's why I wanted to get it so
anyway the first item in here is the
fresh black th delay firming serum like
I said I wanted to get a full size of
this and it is $85 which is super super
expensive so I'm excited to try this out
for sure can I get it out there we go so
this is what it looks like and you know
this is skincare so this is going to go
like a little goes a very long way the
next item in here is the fresh sugar
nourishing lip balm advanced therapy I
do like the fresh lip balms in general
so i'm sure i will like this and it's
like a tiny little mini size and it does
have SPF in it that is what it looks
like and then the next item in this
level 500-point perk is the fresh black
tea instant perfecting mask it's not the
overnight mask which is my favorite but
this one's still pretty darn good and
then the last little item you get in
here is the fresh black th delay cream
this is a little greasy it's a day cream
but it's still pretty darn good so those
are all of the things that I got at
Sephora let's go ahead and move on to
Alta the first item that I purchased
from Ulta are the Pacifica underarm
deodorant white these are odor
neutralizing with coconut milk and
essential oils this is what they look
like I love me they smell so good they
smell like coconut milk and I really
like them for just wiping down my body
in general if you do you want to use
them as actual deodorant wipes you do
need to go ahead and keep reapplying
them throughout the day but I just think
they're nice to have in your purse and
they're just good quality so I do enjoy
those and then let's see here I also got
some more wipes these are from Pacifica
as well these are these super detox deep
purification wipes so if you watch my
empties video from last month you would
have seen that I went through a little
pack of these that was in a kid's I
really really like these i will be using
these basically to wipe down my face
quickly in the morning
I don't have time to wash my face you
guys know I'd like to do that with wipes
I really do like the Garnier clean plus
a blackhead eliminating wipes and i also
like myolie henriksen Greece relief ones
but these are cheaper than both of those
so I thought I would try them out for
that and they do have kale cucumber and
mango steen in them and I just remember
them being incredibly incredibly like
purifying like very very deep cleansing
and then the last item that i got from
Ulta is the tree hut Shea sugar scrub in
the tropical mango sent you guys know I
love these scrubs they are my all time
favorites so I went ahead and purchased
that one it just smells like the best
out of all of them is still my favorite
I can't open it but it smells amazing
just take my word for it ok alright the
next couple of items i got are from
colour-pop i wanted to try some of their
metallic lips and their glossy lips so
the first item i got is the ultra glossy
lip in the shade cheat code this is what
the outer packaging looks like and I
feel like I cannot keep up with color
pop lip products this ain't just have so
many cool new lip products all the time
but I wanted to go ahead and include
these in two of the video that i will be
doing the like hits and misses from
colour-pop video i still haven't done
that but i will be doing it soon so i
wanted to include these so this is cheat
code and i just thought that was like
the prettiest bronze eous most gorgeous
chocolate brown color ever so here it is
on the back of my hand it looks so
pigmented and it's actually very glossy
and very very soft so there is oh my god
how beautiful is that it doesn't smell
too offensive so that's really good and
I think it was only six dollars so yeah
this is the ultra glossy lip in the
shade cheat code there it is and the
next product I got is the ultra metallic
lip and I got to initiate flitter and I
had a friend who posted this on
Instagram I'll leave her instagram down
below oh my god the second then she's
watched this on her lips I was like I
need that I need that I need that it
kind of reminds me of narsus orgasm it's
like a peachy pink color with tons of
golden Sheen so I'm very excited for
this and the applicator looks pretty
good oh my god it's so beautiful like
this colors everything it's more like a
mousse like consistency which I prefer
over like a long wearing um you know
over like a long wearing that what would
you call it
like drawing lip products am I trying to
say matte lip products all right so
there it is definitely not as pigmented
as the altar glossy but still look at
the sheen on that that color is like
literally everything and is giving me
life x 10 and then they last item that I
got is another ultra metallic lip in the
shade zebra and this was like one of the
first ones that I saw again I sauce
watched on my friends instagram and it
was just absolutely beautiful so there
it is and this is kind of similar to
cheat code it's like a little more pinky
toned though and I thought this would be
amazing for the fall time oh my god like
that color is just so different like I
don't have anything like that you see
that there is zebra zebra flitter and
then cheat code oh my god how beautiful
did they look so excited I will
definitely do a follow-up all for you
guys in like a week or two on all of
these products after I try them to let
you guys know what I think of everything
alright moving on my friend at Kristen

had a little bit of a makeup sale and
she asked me oh by the way before we get
into that I did get some samples from
