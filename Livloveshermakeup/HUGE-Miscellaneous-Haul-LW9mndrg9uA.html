they haul for you guys from lots of
different stores there in random boxes
they're probably also for boxes because
I like the size of those for storing
things before I put together a Hall but
I don't think any of this is actually
from Sephora so most of it is from
walmart com back instead from hautelook
and sigma so let's just get started um
all of this right here was from walmart
com I just wanted to order a bunch of
like drugstore makeup I just I don't
know I was I was feeling it one day and
you know here in Manhattan drugstore
makeup is like five dollars more than
anywhere else I swear to you I know it's
worse in Australia but it's pretty bad
here like for the u.s. it's it's pretty
expensive so I like to go on to walmart
and order it because it's like so much
cheaper so the first thing i got was
this um covergirl advanced radiance
age-defying makeup + sunscreen and this
is what the Olay ingredients and my
shade is 105 I've read I have a tricky
time with covergirl foundations I really
love the formulations that like their CC
creams and their foundations but
sometimes it oxidized some me and this
is the lightest shade that they run in
their line which is 105 so hopefully
that won't turn orange on me next I
picked up the L'Oreal Paris magic
perfecting base base primer I've heard a
lot of things about this and I just
thought why not I love primers I think
primers do help and they kind of make a
barrier between you putting you know all
these chemicals on your face um so you
know I thought I'd try it it looks cute
comes in a little glass jars pink next I
got to the Maybelline brow drama and the
reason I got this was because I have the
benefit gimme brow and it's a little too
dark at the shade is I think light
medium and it's a little too dark on my
eyebrows and this one had the color
blonde so I've been hearing that this is
pretty similar to the gimme brow but
also just it seems like you had a better
color selection so next I got this oh
this was actually from duane reade so
this would I don't know if they sell
this everywhere at gosh cosmetics it is
sold in duane reade and duane reade is
kind of like manhattan's walgreens
they're just everywhere so this is the
CC cream illuminating foundation it's in
01 porcelain excited to try that out the
CC creams and this also from duane reade
gosh what is this we're on things
shimmer powder I already opened up
because I need to look at it so pretty
that is what it looks like and it's just
so so shimmery but I thought it was
gorgeous so pick that up um and then
let's get back to the walmart stuff I
got another CC cream this time it's from
hard candy and I did open this up and
it's like super orange you guys look
super frigging orange do you see that oh
yeah that's totally my skin tone so well
see about this one this isn't I think
the shade ultra light no fair okay
because that's pretty bad if it's that I
dark but hopefully it changes once it's
on the skin but um yeah so CC correction
creme SPF 15 from hard candy then I got
two of these little cover girl I've
never tried these my here emilynoel83
here on youtube town a lot about the
covergirl little let quads so I got
country woods take these stupid sponge
things that I know these things I know
some people do I don't this is country
woods bunch of nice neutrals and then
you have what is this blossoms which is
like pinks and purples also very pretty
I really like that one so exciting to
kind of play with those I did kind of
dip my finger right now they're not very
soft but maybe they have good color
payoff next I got the Nivea a kiss of
mint and minerals refreshing live care
this is probably one of the only video
lip balms i do not own yet so you know i
have to figure that out let's smell it
like that color oh oh yeah smells great
look at that beautiful color yeah I like
it it smells good alright cuz those
orders my little lip balm collection um
okay so maybe what is this this must be
a sample from Sephora maybe there is
something in here that's from Sephora
blender cleanser solid just like a
sample of that sorry guys this is all
kind of mixed up but you get you get it
you get where you know i'll let you know
where they came from next I got from
Walmart two of the color reach bombs
from I believe this turn from l'oreal
right yeah they look like this and I've
heard that these are super super
moisturizing it easy to wear on the lips
and my lips have been really really dry
lately and sometimes I just need
something that I know is not going to
make like a hassle out of it and I'm
gonna have to reapply lip balm and all
that kind of stuff so I'm excited to try
those I got that in the shade to 18 rows
elixir and also plush plum 219 so I move
this thing about those and then I got a
bunch of these um I love these I have
one of these okay so I have one of these
and I always thought was like the best
tint ever it is like so gross the
packaging is like disgusting but this is
the Maybelline super ten stained glass
and this is in I'm gonna came to read
that Ruby raw face or God kick dolphin I
don't know it is so beautiful like it it
lasts all day the stain texture the
color so I said these on sale at Duane
Reade and they were like two dollars a
piece so I've got all the colors i got
am I going to commemorate this okay so
this is the same one at that one which
is good because I definitely wanted it
second one of that um this one is aa
something Barry but it looks like that
then you get kind of a darker like um
muted topi tan color something a little
more read a little more pink and a
little more purple so um I was just
excited to see those because I think
these are discontinued so maybe that
Duane Reade I was that happens
have some left so they're selling them
for like two bucks apiece I'm so happy
um and then from walmart I also got this
neutrogena moisture smooth color stick
again I heard someone talk about these
and how they're easy to wear lips you
don't have to worry about them
throughout the day um I'm a flute player
so i'll be at school practicing and
things like that i sometimes just don't
reapply my lipstick because what's the
point if i'm going to be in the practice
room you know just practicing and I find
a lot of just lip colors in general try
out my lips and that's not good for me
personally so um yeah I guess we'll see
about this I have a lot of lip crayons
but this looked like a pretty color it's
in bright to bury and then I got one of
the Rimmel show-off lip lacquers what
color is this ah look feel so good to
break open that feels with this gorgeous
gorgeous red color no this just spoke to
me where is the color like what is
nothing big bang so I'm excited to try
that and then I got the Milani eyeshadow
primer because everybody raised about
this and I still haven't tried it so I
thought you know what I gotta get it i
also got two of the Milani what are
these bella eyes gel powder eye shadows
okay one of these in like a rose shade I
gotta in Bella gold and Bella teal and
oh my gosh look how beautiful these will
be together okay I like it I like it
look at that beautiful color we're just
gorgeous portis and then I got this
little wet'n'wild brulee color icon
eyeshadow this is like the best thing
ever for like evening out the color on
your lit like your lid or underneath
your eye is just like it's perfect like
this is this over the best um it seems
to just like match everyone's skin tone
I don't even know it matches mine I'm
really really pale so okay so sephora
samples i guess clinique acne solutions
clinical clearing gel could be using
that right now
definitely mm-hmm um let's see here
needles no more exclusive tri-blend
wrinkle relaxer from I have no idea dr.
Brandt and the rose face mask from fresh
I've no idea where those came from
alright next we're going to open up a
little scent of some brushes that I
already like you know opened up we kind
of look dead but they're in the box
waiting and they're ready to be shown
they're ready they know their time is
coming out um so basically I went on to
the Sigma website a few weeks ago and I
decided I wanted to pick out all new I
brushes that I had never tried before um
so I have a lot of hooey 35e forties I
probably have like four of each you know
it's just like I constantly use the same
thing so I thought I'd pick up some of
their different ones um this was the
little gift that came they usually
always send you a little brush this is
the medium angled shading e70 super
super cute i love that they sent you a
freakish and then I picked up the small
tapered blending this is an e 45 do you
see how like precise and small that is
it's like you really could get like
above the crease and it just looked
really promising so we're going to go
ahead and get that one a try and then I
picked up the diffused crease brush
which is an e 38 and this one's kind of
similar but it's a lot more like flat on
the top and it's very very dense and
stiff so maybe blending out like you
know something in in the corner you know
you could put like a darker shade and
just kind of bring out that outer V with
this so we'll see that's the diffused
crease free breach the breach the brush
the breach diffuse please bring shoes
like cheese or something and then I got
to the e36 it's super super tiny and
precise and I think that you can just go
like I think I've seen emilynoel83 again
use this a lot she really talks about
this for like um just like if you want
to put like if you have some
really really dark on the crease and you
want to put something a little lighter
over it like on top this is perfect just
to fit in right there so really really
excited to try this one out ether t6 and
then the last one I got was the e25
which I don't have which is surprising
because this is I would say pretty you
know pretty well known one so this is
more kind of like flat but I guess that
it really just kind of gets into the
crease really easily and yeah so super
excited about that I think it's great
like Sigma has some brushes that like I
will always use and I will always like
repurchase but I gotta be fun to try out
some new ones that I haven't tried so
all right let's see here next I have two
perfumes oh you guys okay this is the
LeBaron miscellaneous all these are
actually from whole foods so I'm just
gonna put this under collective haul
because it's from a whole lot of places
these are the pacifica perfumes I've
heard a lot of people talk about these
and I smelt them at whole foods and I
was like I have to get them so I've got
the Brazilian mango grapefruit one which
smells like oh my god is so good it
smells amazing and they're cute little
bottles you know these are only I think
like $18 piece so if you're looking for
like a good oh oh wow I suddenly feel
like you know I'm walking on a beach or
something so that is the pacifica
Brazilian mango grapefruit delicious
smells so good and then I got the
Tahitian gardenia I really love floral
sense so let's go ahead and just spray
this on over the one I just sprayed
because that's exactly how lot to do
things oh oh my gosh this is this is the
one I like the most I love flowers and I
just love gardenia blossoms anything
like that you know lilac honeysuckle it
smells great so i could post little
bottles are cute too i must say to put
them up in my perfume collection in the
back and then i got two things from
hautelook macadamia the hair Caroline
was on hautelook a couple of weeks ago
and everything was sold out really quick
especially the deep repairing mask I
used that for a really long time and I
stopped using it and I to
I'm really missed it um I know a lot of
people rave about it but honestly my
hair takes pretty well too deep
conditioner so I don't have to be buying
like super super like expensive one and
that one is pretty expensive but anyway
talk about good deals on hautelook they
had all of these products this is let me
just start with this this is the full
size of the healing oil treatment I got
this for like $18 this does for like 58
on the actual macadamia website and i
love this oil i used to have the really
really small bottle it took me like a
year to get through so this is gonna
last me forever i love that it has a
pump and I mean there's like 18 bucks
such a steal and then the other thing I
got just to try out about a smaller size
of something like three or four dollars
the moisturizing rims it's a daily
conditioning rinse for all hair types um
I like to do a weekly deep oil deep oil
that's the rub that fast rose I do like
a hot oil treatment on my hair every
wednesday and so I mixed together
coconut oil you know whatever kind of
oils I want I mixed them together put
them on my hair leave them on for 30
minutes and then when you know I take a
shower and I have found that with oils
it is very hard to get oil out of your
hair the best way to do it is with a
conditioner believe it or not people
always sit there and scrub scrub scrub
and try and get the oil out but the best
way to do it is with a conditioner so I
thought this moisturizing rinse would be
the closest to a shampoo like it would
actually rinse out the oil but it's not
going to be stripping and it's not going
to be taking away all those precious
oils i just tried to like seal into the
cuticles of my hair so umm yeah I'm
excited to try that let you guys know
okay shoeboxes down one more all right
okay this is from hope look and stila
was recently on hautelook and i just
can't oh and also I guess I start with
this tarina tarantino okay I see her
stuff on there all the time and I was
just like yeah I won't get I don't hear
people talk about it very often i'm like
it's good whatever i ended up getting
stuff so this is the tarina tarantino
spark lyssa d shimmer dust
if I'm gonna look like a disco ball oh
this is why yeah it's so cute they look
at the back again back that's why look
how cute that is oh and it's just as
beautiful like pearlescent on the inside
it looks almost like it's like pink
undertone I guess you could just kind of
put this like you know during the summer
when you want to look all glowy and sexy
like sprayed on your legs and not your
face I don't know why just like that
like spray it on you know your your your
arms and your legs but pretty look at
that bottle I'm going to put that with
my perfume collection even that was not
perfect they cut this beautiful I needs
to be shown on the next thing I got from
her the tarina tarantino line is the I
dream hyper liner and I got it umbro
kundala which is like a pink color so
remind you why I vote I'm liner that's
right because it's a beautiful color so
yeah so that's what it looks like how
gorgeous is that that's gonna be amazing
like on the inner corner of your eye oh
my gosh beautiful color broken doll
gotta love it next I got one of her i
believe yes doll skin cheek pallets um I
just wanted to try a few things you know
to see what what is worth purchasing
from belong so very nice packaging like
that okay huge mirror which is great and
you get those shades right there how
beautiful are those 10 I'm rest so one
of them has shimmer and it looks like
the rest are mostly two of them are Matt
one is slightly shimmery and the other
one's really shimmery so very beautiful
I'm excited to try that out actually
great packaging I like it and I get I
like it all right um and then i also got
what else do i get from her oh yes the
dull skin eye primer again it just seems
like i've been trying so many different
I timers out so might as well try hers
to write with them alone one um it looks
like that super cute packaging doe foot
yeah just normal kind of cool um again I
don't know it's an eye primer we'll see
you will see how both I've been
collecting I promise lately um ok so
that's what I got from darkness I to use
those now they look really nicely
packaged like everything looks like
pretty high-end so i'm good i also got a
little lip set from shoe a they were on
their maybe i don't even know like hot
look you know I'm the easiest robber for
them to ship the stuff to you but um
it's worth waiting for for those prices
but this is the mini glisten up lip
gloss collection limited edition it
includes for sheer sparkling mini lip
glosses and bronze card holder in coral
glisten nude listen Rose listen and
original listen so I heard a lot of
really good things about the shoe a lip
glosses in particular if you're going to
try anything from the brand people
always say go for the lip glosses so

to carry your make around and probably
not going to be big enough for the
makeup I carry around during the day but
definitely from my pencil my little
hello kitty cat this um alright so the
first thing you get is the kitchen
shimmer and this is the all over shimmer
liquid Luminizer so yes I can't just has

it's just gorgeous so really really
excited for that little pouch then I got
the lip glaze in kitten I believe

jumbo sized one because she wants huge
so next I got to the smudge stick
waterproof eyeliner in kitchen um I used
to not be a huge fan of the formula of
the smudge stick waterproof eye liners
but I'm starting to like them all
more than my work with them so we'll see
about that one and then of course kitten

bauble bar something steal out were they
