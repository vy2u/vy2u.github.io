happy Thursday I hope you are all having
a wonderful middle of the week so far
yeah middle of the week alright today's
video is going to be my huge Sephora VIP
sales follow-up haul so I'm sharing with
you guys either my first impressions or
my finalized thoughts on the items that
I picked up during the vib sale I am
super excited to share with you guys
some of these items because some of them
are really great and a few of them I'm
like there okay so yeah let's go ahead
and jump right into it and the first
item that I think is just okay is the
Lord we're seeing the petite souffle
body creme collection so I was expecting
a little more from this collection I
still think it's absolutely fantastic
you do get six little mini body creams
in here but I was expecting these to be
a lot more moisturizing than they are
you guys these are actually quite
lightweight on the skin I would not
consider them a body creme or even like
a souffle they're really just a very
light kind of lotion so you've got a
bunch of different cents my top cents
are definitely fresh fake which looks a
little something like this
creme de pistach which is beautiful and
also creme brulee so these are my top 3
scents they also do have a seat home
version they have let's see here coconut
milk and then also an almond milk one so
they all smell really really good I
think when you are buying this
collection it's more just for the
overall sensation and feel of being like
oh I'm so passion something you know
like things like that just putting it on
your body it's a very luxurious kind of
experience but I would not say that the
formulation of these are anything super
super impressive I don't think I would
actually purchase a full-size of these
but I do love for a creme brulee honey
bath and I do like her body washes I've
tried out a sample of that as well but I
would say if you are looking into the
body creme just know that these are
probably made for those of you who do
have a little more
combination to oily skin if you wear
very very dry or if you're very mature
skin this is probably something you want
to stay away from it's just not going to
give you the hydration that you want and
also if you do have sensitive skin these
are gonna be way too fragrance for you
so overall I was kind of surprised by
this little set-to this was around $62 I
don't think that it was a waste of my
money but it's definitely not something
that I would probably repurchase now if
they released a below like creme brulee
honey bath set next year where it was
all like the little bubble baths and
whatnot I would purchase that but this
probably not again alright I had also
picked up two packs of the Sephora yuzu
cleansing wipes and
so two packs of the Sephora rose
cleansing wipes these are my all-time
favorite cleansing wipes at the moment I
love these Sephora collection cleansing
wipes I think they're all really good
they offer different options for
different kind of skin types so if you
have very like oily prone clogged pores
things like that you can use the
charcoal ones which have a little bit of
a dual surface thing going on so you can
exfoliate your skin and these are great
if you have more mature skin even if you
do have oily to combination skin or
combination to oily skin like I do these
are great and then the easy ones are
fantastic as well for pretty much all
skin tones I will say if you are very
sensitive skin these are very very
heavily fragranced as well kind of like
the body butters so I would stick to
more like the coconut water wipes but
these are beautiful so these ones smell
like lemon the other ones obviously
smell like rose very very happy with
that purchase all right I had also
picked up three of the wise health
beloved hint in oils I already own at
the shade chariot my Shaklee which I'm
obsessed with it is absolutely beautiful
so I did pick up Orange Crush this one
right here is called peach me love and
this one is called pink about me they
are all absolutely beautiful I thought
that these at first had different scents
to them they actually all have that
really nice kind of fresh watermelon
scent but they are beautiful they go on
very glossy they have the perfect amount
of pigment to them and I will say they
all do dry down to the same color so the
stain that's left on your lips is the
same color with all of them but overall
they are beautiful my all-time favorite
lip oil love the overall feel of them
the quality the smell everything about
them I feel luxurious when I use them so
I love those I also have been enjoying
my Dior Dior skin nude Erin Luminizer
shimmering sculpting powder in the shade
at zero zero one this is what it looks
like and this is just gorgeous you guys
it is a beautiful rose gold highlight so
here is what the actual color looks like
I will be hopefully doing a video for
you guys as soon where I do some more
dupes and I did find a dupe for this so
I am very excited to share it with you
guys
here it's a little swatch of it it is
beautiful as you can see this is
definitely darker than my actual skin
tone or my complexion now you can still
use this as a blush topper you can still
put it on to your cheekbones today I
have a Dirk or highlight on as well it's
from Wet n Wild it's that Goldilocks
shade it's like a true gold it's
definitely darker than my skin tone
however it doesn't mean that your skin
can't glow so if you
a little more fair complected you can
definitely layer this with a lighter
highlight but if you have like a medium
complexion to a very dark complexion
this is going to be like the most
gorgeous thing on your skin so I would
highly recommend checking it out it is a
beautiful bakelite formulation and it
just sits on the skin so beautifully I
just love those beige delay formulations
on the skin they look absolutely
impeccable so yes I would recommend this
but just wait until I do my dukes video
so I can share a few tips with you guys
I think I found wait did I find one or
two so far I think I found two so far so
definitely stay put for that video first
before maybe you invest in this but yeah
it's pretty darn pricey it was 56
dollars but in my opinion still worth it
I also had picked up the Urban Decay all
nighter waterproof liquid foundation
this is what it looks like I can only
give you guys my first impressions on
this because I actually did a first
impressions video on this so on Tuesday
I did a first impressions with this
product I have not tried it since I will
be using it tomorrow and then over the
weekend as well and then using this in
shop my stash on Monday so that by the
time I do my follow-up haul or I'm sorry
my follow-up first impressions review on
Tuesday I can give you guys my final
thoughts but I'll go ahead and link the
first impressions video down below
overall I would say they just need to
work on shade selection this oxidizes
like crazy and this one on probably 3 or
4 shades too light for me and by the
time I was done at the end of the day
with my makeup this was too dark for me
it was about two shades too dark for me
so something that they need to work on
is definitely the shade selection but I
do like the finish of it I like the
coverage and I do think it looks
beautiful on the skin so I'll link that
video down below really only have first
impressions on that so far
I also had picked up these early gross
water balancing mist which is my
all-time favorite balancing mist I
should not be trying out other facial
sprays not when this one is so perfect
for my skin type this is absolutely
beautiful if you do have combination to
oily skin it's never gonna leave a
sticky tacky feeling on your face it's
gorgeous it smells like rose and it
really does moisturize without being too
heavy on the skin a lot of facial myths
are either too sticky or too tacky or
they're too heavy on my skin this one is
just absolutely perfect so I'm gonna
stick to this for a while I know I have
been trying out different facial mists
for you guys lately but I'm just not
into it anymore none of them work for me
the way that this one does
all right I also had picked up this
little guy this is the what are you
called oh you're fortifying cream for
nails this is called become apricot
apricot this is what it looks like it is
beautiful and you guys I love this I am
absolutely in love with this it is a
very very sticky tacky formulation they
really should not call this a cream for
nails they should be calling this a
salve for nails this is literally what
the consistency looks like it is hella
gray see how look thick I mean it is
crazy it really really will leave you
feeling very sticky and tacky almost
like you have gum on your fingernails so
I just wanted to put that out there
right away because I feel like they kind
of it's not like false advertising it
technically is e cream for nails but I
would say it's more of a style for nails
I like to put a pair of gloves on after
I use this I carry a lot of gloves
around with me because before I go
onstage I like to pop a pair of gloves
on to form my fingers up so I like to
put a pair of gloves on after I applied
this at night time it is beautiful
though if you really want to pop with
like the nail beds like the health of
your nail beds this is a wonderful
wonderful product for doing so I have
noticed a little bit of a difference
with my overall nail health I don't have
great nails to begin with nor do I feel
like I need to have great nails to begin
with I can't really paint them all that
often or anything like that just because
of my work but yeah I mean I think this
is beautiful I think it's gorgeous if
you really do have that thing where you
get like very sort and nail beds or you
have like little pieces of dry skin on
the sides of your nails you definitely
should check this out at my friend
rosemary said she's been using this for
like seven years and honestly it's very
good as long as you can get packed past
it with the actual consistency that
really tacky sticky thick consistency I
think you would love it alright I also
did pick up a little fragrance sampler
from desperate masters I'm sorry you
guys really my throat is closing up
Arnel what that's all about I have a
little nest fragrances sampler here so
there were a bunch of different scents
that I got here these are just little
roller balls this is a great little
value these honestly go on very very
strongly like you can smell it all day I
like that the actual consistency is not
too oily I do like to put it on my
pressure points so like here right here
on the back of my neck as well for them
to kind of like release scent throughout
the day but these are great so the first
one is Dalia this is one of my all-time
favorites
we also have this one right here which
is called Midnight's live this is
another one of my favorites the next one
we have is to clean this is another one
of my favorites we also have Paradise
which is a little more of a warm scent
if this one right here is indigo this is
a very dark kind of vampy scent I like
it though it smells quite good this one
is called valid if this one is out so
really nice kind of a darker richer
fragrance and then also this one as
sandalwood white sandalwood this is
probably my least favorite out of all of
them but I would say sit clean let's see
here midnight fluff and acid Dahlia are
my all-time favorites so really like
these I think that the rollerball is
actually quite strong and very very
heavily fragrance so I am enjoying those
quite a bit would recommend checking
that out I also did pick up these
Sephora Suprema cleansing oil I am
obsessed with this you guys I am loving
it so far this has cottonseed oil in it
and I think it's fantastic for a moving
makeup you guys can see I have used
about that much so far I think it's
beautiful
um what I compared its what I say it's a
dupe for the potion makeup breakup coal
cleansing oil know what I say it is
comparable absolutely yes they will
remove all of your makeup I usually use
about three pumps of in on my face
makeup and then I wash my hands quickly
and then I go ahead I dry them off and
then I go over my eye area with two more
pumps so five pumps total I do feel like
I'm gonna get through this relatively
quickly but you do get 6.4 fluid ounces
for $15 but yeah I think it's great it
removes my makeup beautifully I think
it's really fantastic does not leave an
oily residue on my skin if you want to
get into cleansing oils and you don't
want to pay for like the tatcha one or
the bush of makeup breakup coal
cleansing oil would highly recommend
checking this one out first I do think
it's better than the garden gave one as
well because the Garnier so heavily
fragrance one thing I will say about
this scent is that it is it is there it
is there it's not like super perfume me
or anything like that it smells kind of
natural but a little perfume me it's not
my favorite scent ever but you know it
removes makeup well so I have been
enjoying that and they final item that I
had picked up with the Luna for Rayo
mini so I've been talking about this on
and off here this week this definitely
is making my skin purge you guys I'm
used to it because I did pick up the
Clarisonic what it first came out I've
gone through six different models of the
Clarisonic huge fan of the Clarisonic I
had about a two and a half to three and
a half a week period where I broke out
from the Clarisonic and this is doing
the same exact thing to my skin right
now I'm hoping that you will start to
calm down and just kind of subside
within the next week or two but I think
this is a good product is it better than
the Clarisonic in my opinion absolutely
not and I know that I'm not going with
the majority of people I think a lot of
people do actually prefer this over the
Clarisonic now I feel like this is a
little more abrasive than my Clarisonic
but please understand the brush head
that I use of my Clarisonic is the
cashmere luxe brush head that is like
the softest one you can get so I really
do think that it is softer than this
little guy I just feel like this is kind
of um kind of rough so that is when it's
on and I just feel like it just it
definitely stimulates the skin and I
like the way that it feels but I do feel
like it's a little abrasive on my skin
especially this little side over here
which you're supposed to use like on
your decollete your neck things like
that or around like your t-zone but I've
been doing exactly what the package told
me to do I think it's relatively good I
definitely think that the Clarisonic
does different things the Clarisonic for
me personally deeply cleanses my skin a
lot better than this however this I have
noticed really kind of takes care of
texture on the skin so if you are
combination and also acne prone I would
highly recommend getting both because I
think they do different things I will be
doing a comparison video between the two
where I go more in depth but overall
this is a good purchase
I just am hoping that the purging has
stops soon so anyway guys those are all
of the products that I got those are
kind of my finalized thoughts or my
first impressions I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
