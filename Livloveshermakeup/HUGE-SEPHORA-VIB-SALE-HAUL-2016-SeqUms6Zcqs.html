thank you so much for joining me as you
can tell today's video is going to be my
Sephora vib sales haul I bought a lot of
products probably around 15 so I'm super
excited to share with you guys what I
picked up most of them were from my
loves list actually I think everything
was from my loves list so if you saw my
wishlist video then you know probably
what some of these items are I want to
say really quickly before I jump into
this yes I look a little rundown because
I just got home from work and second of
all let me know down below in the
description bar in the description bar
in the comment section what you guys
think of this lighting I got some new
lighting it's softbox lighting and I
actually have one of the lights off
because I think it made me look a little
too washed out but right now I have my
ring light on with the softbox so I
would love to know if you guys have any
thoughts or opinions on this particular
lighting I noticed with the Beauty room
I am missing a lot of lighting behind me
and I actually don't have any plugins
behind me which is why a lot of the
light tends to focus on my face because
this is where I have the plugins in this
area so I hope that this will help to
give the lighting maybe a little bit
more of a smooth effect it won't wash me
up too much and hopefully it's just
better in general so let me know down
below about that but yeah let's go ahead
and get started this shouldn't take me
too long since I talked very fast so
let's do it alright the first item that
I picked up its from Urban Decay this is
the all nighter liquid foundation and
the shade that I picked up is called 0.5
but I have heard some really good things
about this and some really bad things
this is a full coverage long wearing
it's supposed to get a matte finish it
is waterproof and also oil-free I will
see the actual packaging feels very very
cheap like it's just plastic but it does
have that kind of cute little like oil
slick thing going on here or like
spiderweb effect so I am excited to try
this out like I said I have heard that
this dries down a shaded darker I don't
know if I said that or not but so yeah I
did pick up the lightest shade let me
know down below if you guys would like a
first impressions on this particular of
foundation all right the next item that
I purchased was the foreo luna mini this
is the revolutionary t-sonic facial
cleansing device I ended up getting the
little purple one I have heard this is
great for kind of stimulating blood flow
in your face which helps to improve fine
lines and wrinkles and just plump up the
skin a little more I originally was
going to get the light
version and then I wanted the dark pink
so that it would match in my Clarisonic
but I felt the purple was just too cute
to pass up on so I will definitely give
you guys my final thoughts on this next
week when I do at my follow-up haul and
also I do want to do a comparison
against the Clarisonic so this is more
stimulating for the skin apparently and
then the Clarisonic is more exfoliating
so we shall see I will definitely test
that out for you guys I also picked up a
Julie Cruz water balancing myths that
this is my all-time favorite facial mist
ever recently you guys honestly hmm
excuse me recently I have found that I
have been having a really bad luck with
facial mess I have just I don't know
what the deal is I don't know what's
happening so I don't like the Olay
Henriksen ones I don't really like the
Josie Maran one that I'm working my way
through right now so I thought I would
just go back to my all-time favorite
which is this one this is great if you
do have combination or oily skin it says
that is a hydrating mist rich in the
living energy of rose and marshmallow
that helps to restore tone and hydrate
the skin and it also does leave your
skin balanced and refreshed which I like
alright I'm moving on I did also go
ahead and pick up a let's see here this
little body butter set right here I did
open it up because I had to peek and
this is the Laura Mercier the petit
souffle body creme collection so glad
that I purchased this with my first
order because it is now sold out on the
website so inside of here you do get a
bunch of little body butters as you guys
can see and I really love the Laura
Mercier bath collection I feel like she
has a lot of nice products so I was
super excited to try this out so the
first one I got is amber vanilla this is
what it looks like and these do come in
little glass bottles oh it smells so
good that smells amazing and I thought
these would be great for travel I don't
know about you guys but I will be
traveling probably for Thanksgiving and
definitely for Christmas so I'm excited
to try those out I also got let's see
here tart dough C Tom this is like a
citrus scented one let's smell it oh
yeah it smells like Oh kind of smells
like a lemon bar that's melt amazing so
I got that little one also in these sets
they have creme brulee and I have tried
out a full-size of the creme brulee and
bubble bath which smells absolutely
amazing incredible yeah it just smells
so good it smells amazing so I got that
one in there and then they also have
almond coconut milk which is probably
one of her signature scents I've heard
this one's really good oh oh girl that's
probably my favorite smells are really
really really good and
you also get let's see here fresh fig
which is another little favorite of hers
let's smell this one oh yeah that one
has like a little more tang to it so I'm
excited to try that one out and then the
final one that you get in here is creme
de pistach yes
creme de pistach so that is what it
looks like so anyway that one smells
good too so anyway I'm super excited to
try that out every single year during
this little sale I do get some sort of
little body butter set or like I really
like the philosophy three-in-one bubble
bath shower gels and also bubble baths
did I already say that bubble bath
shower gel and shampoo I really like
those little sets however this year it
seemed like they were doing this set
that has like matching the lip glosses
and I've just decluttered 88 lip glosses
the last thing I need is more lip gloss
so I didn't think those up but I got
those little body creams which I'm very
excited about I also did pick up these
Sephora collections on the supreme
cleansing oil this is cotton seed oil
you do get 6.4 fluid ounces in here and
I am really a big fan of cleansing oils
I try not to use facial wipes too often
I prefer them just for cleansing my face
quickly in the morning but as far as
like removing makeup is concerned I do
think it's better to use a oil because
it's very gentle so I'm excited to try
this out will definitely give you guys
my thoughts on that
speaking of cleansing I did pick up two
packs of the revitalizing and toning
yuzu facial wipes from the Sephora
collection these are beautiful I love
these they do smell like lemon and like
I said I like to use these to kind of
cleanse my face in the morning I also
did pick up two packs of these Sephora
rose cleansing wipes so this is what the
Rose cleansing wipes look like these are
ultra moisturizing and brightening a lot
of you have been saying that you've been
kicking these up and you really like
them as well so I'm so happy to hear
that moving on I did pick up three of
the YSL beloved teens in oil so
originally I was going to get all of
them the whole entire collection because
I have bought one of them before the
shade that I got was called cherry my
Shelly and I think it's beautiful I love
that it is a lip aisle and then it turns
into like a little bit of a stain on the
lips so I really love it I did Ardi
swatch the three of these and you guys
can actually see the stain that it left
on my hands I won't swatch them in this
particular video just because it does
take a little bit of time for them to
kind of like dry down on your actual Hey
but these are beautiful so the first
shade I got is teach me love which is
number six so this is the shade of peach
me love and then I also did get the
shade let's see here pink about me which
is number eight and I love the packaging
on these it's a gold box with a silver
tube so this one's a little more of a
cool toned pinky color and then the last
one that I got is called crushed me
Orange number seven and I think this one
looks beautiful as well so like I said
here are these stains that they kind of
leave on the hand I will say the stains
seem to be the same sort of color
however they are beautiful when you
first put them on very moisturizing my
all-time favorite lip product ever
alright moving on the next item that I
got was a little perfume collection
sampler this is from nest fragrances
this is called the Eau de Parfum
collection and I put it in upside down
can you guys tell I already smelled all
of these I could not help myself so
anyway this is basically just a little
rollerball sampler of all of the
different nest fragrances you have
midnight now bad you have Dalia indigo
citrine white sandalwood and paradise so
these are roller balls but I really do
like nest fragrances I have been trying
a lot of their samples out through my
Sephora play box in the past couple of
months and I think these are great
because the actual rollerball is not too
oily and also they have a very strong
fragrance so I'm very excited to try
these out and I definitely will give you
guys in my final thoughts on those next
week and then let's see here the last
little item that I picked up was the
Dior Luminizer shimmering sculpting
powder in D shade 0:01 actually it's not
the last item I got two items from Dior
so and this one is the highlighter that
recently released it is in the shade
nude air and I'm very excited to try
this out because you guys know my
all-time favorite highlight of life is
the Dior glowing gardens the limited
edition one in the shade glowing pink
that released last year so very excited
to try this guy out look at the color
you guys it's like a peachy golden shade
I definitely want to swatch this for you
guys I love a big Chalet formulation
when it comes to highlights so I am so
so so excited to have this I already
know I'm going to love it and if you
didn't know the do your stuff comes with
a little brush and then I'll seal it
also a little navy blue slash a black
sleeve here which is velvet which is
very very luxurious and very
you know all right and then the last
item that I picked up is video our
Crimea apricot fortifying cream for
nails so I'm a flutist that's what I do
for a living basically so I just can't
really do much with my nails you guys
it's not really appropriate for me to
have nail polish on when I'm playing in
a concert or something like that
because the last thing I need is for
people to be focusing on my nails and my
fingers they should be just listening to
the music you know so yeah I will say my
nails just aren't anything special
they're not super long but I do get a
lot of dry skin around certain areas and
I would say that they are a little
overworked from just like know my nails
but like my fingers from practicing so I
thought that this would be a nice little
treatment it is in the same exact
packaging as the creme de Rose lip balm
and you do get the same exact amount so
here is what it looks like I love the
creme de rosa lip balm it is my all-time
or one of my all-time favorite lip balms
so here is what the apricot creme for
nails looks like and it's very very
sticky it almost feels like honey can
you guys see that it's very very sticky
and it smells lightly of apricot so I'm
very excited to try that out -
definitely vilage guys know what I think
of this and I yeah that was pretty much
everything that I purchased let me run
you guys through some of the samples and
little point perks that I got I won't go
through everything because I don't want
this video to be too long but the first
item I picked up was the clean reserved
belong rose perfume this isn't a little
spray version I tried this out in these
Sephora playbox I love this perfume I
also did pick up the Clinique take the
day off cleansing balm so this is
something that you put on dry skin you
massage it in you take off your makeup
and then you rinse your face and it will
take your makeup off I did get this
little Jack Black clean break oil-free
moisturizer here's a little sample I
also got two or three of these little
lunk um what are they called the
smoothing and glow boosting liquid care
energy Davey is so this is what it looks
like these are basically I think they're
kind of like an emulsion I haven't tried
these out but it says on the back let's
see here it's all in French so basically
it's kind of like a serum or not a
moisturizer a serum or like an emulsion
and then I also got to this little guy
here this is the angel mu soda perfume
here it is I also picked this one up but
this is the DEF neon a vinyl cream stain
from YSL
this is in a 401 402 and 405 and then
you do get like a little mini version in
here as well so let's see what this is
or is this a little brush oh just
kidding it's a little brush and then you
can go ahead and pick up all of the
different colors right here and then I
also did pick up this little purity it
made simple three-in-one cleanser for
face and also for what does it face an
eyes I felt this would be nice I use
this to clean my makeup brushes I
thought it would be nice for travel I
also got this pin Rose wild child Oh de
Parfum towelettes so it's kind of like a
perfumed towelette and then I also did
get the surreal skin Argan finishing
balm from josie maran there are more but
i already put them away so anyway that
is it guys I hope you enjoyed this quick
video or relatively quick the video on
