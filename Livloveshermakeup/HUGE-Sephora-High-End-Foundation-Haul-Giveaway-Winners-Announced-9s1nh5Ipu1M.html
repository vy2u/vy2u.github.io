home in Milwaukee as you guys can tell
and i am here to share with you guys a
high-end foundation hall from sephora
and also the announcement of my 20,000
subscriber giveaway winners so the two
winners that one are down in the
description bar in this video I would
really really appreciate it if you guys
would go down and say congratulations in
the comments section I think it makes
just a better experience overall for the
winner when they can go down into the
comments section and see that we are all
congratulating them instead of saying
like oh I didn't win so I want to
say i met i believe 28 thousand
subscribers right now as promised I will
have another giveaway at 30,000 so don't
worry you will have the opportunity to
win but congratulations to both of the
winners besides that like I said we have
a little foundation hall here from
Sephora if you guys didn't know one of
my kind of New Year's beauty resolutions
was to do more first impressions on my
channel so i picked up five high-end
foundations i did pick up some from the
drugstore as well so don't worry you
know i love the drug store as well but
we are going to be talking about some
high-end foundations that i'm super
excited to try out that i have never
gotten my hands on that I've never
wanted to try my skin has changed it has
changed in the past month I don't know
if you guys can tell in my videos but I
have gotten really dry my skin has just
got a completely completely bone dry and
I wanted to try out some new foundation
so I have completely decided to kind of
change up the way I do excuse me kind of
change up the way I do my first
impressions on my channel so normally
what I do is I put the foundation on
with you guys or I put the product on
with you guys and then I come back a
week later to share my follow up or do
you guys know I don't edit my videos I
have no desire to edit my videos and I'm
not just going to start editing my
videos to do a first impressions video
but a lot of you were requesting if I
could do a check in at the end of the
day so say I post it at six a.m. and
then at six pm I come back and I check
in with you guys after 12 hours aware
and I was like I can totally do that so
I really appreciate you guys giving me
that idea i love getting constructive
feedback from you guys in the comments
section so that is what we're going to
be starting to do it with um you know
like first impressions reviews on
foundations and pretty much everything
so anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it so the first foundations that i
picked up is one that i have heard great
things about especially if you do have
more dry skin this is the giorgio armani
luminous silk foundation
the shape that I got is number two this
was extremely extremely expensive but I
wanted to give this instead of the
sample I know that sometimes people do
pick up samples to test out for first
impressions which I totally don't mind
watching but I find that sometimes when
samples start to dry out and it's just
not like the same I don't know what it
is baby I just keep the cap open or
something like that but anyway I wanted
to go ahead and pick this up so this is
what the actual bottle looks like it has
a nice gorgeous glass frosty bottle you
do get one fluid ounce of product in
here or wait is it one fluid us know yes
it is it's one flow downs and then you
do have a little pump here as well so I
think this looks like a pretty good
shade match I don't even believe they
have a shade number one do they because
almost a horrible calm website it did
not show that they did but this is
number two very excited to try this out
like i said my skin has been very very
bone dry so i think that will be a good
one i also picked up the urban decay
naked skin weightless ultra definition
liquid makeup so many of you have been
requesting that i picked this up this
also has one fluid ounce and I picked up
the shade 0.5 which is the shade that I
wear in the all nighter foundation so we
shall see if this works out it looks it
looks dark because it looks darkest
do you guys see that I don't know if
it's going to show up on camera but when
I held it up to my face I was like no
like I hope this works so the shade is
0.5 like I said I hope it doesn't
oxidize like the Urban Decay all nighter
does but this is supposed to be a really
nice natural looking foundation it says
it feels like you're wearing nothing at
all yet to the naked skin transforms
your complexion skin is supposed to look
natural illuminated and bright so I'm
very excited to test this one out as
well for you guys and again it does have
a pump which I love and I love the shape
of this model I don't know why I just
really do alright so the next one I
picked up was from a cosmetics this is
actually a CC cream so I have tried out
the normal CC cream I've gone through
about two and a half like bottles of it
the last half I actually gave to a
friend because she really wanted to try
out but recently when I was on the
safaricom website i was like i should
pick up that old one that i had tried
out but then i saw that they had the
illumination I thought right now for my
skin since it is so dry this would be a
good one to try out it says color
correcting illuminating full coverage
cream with an anti-aging hydrating serum
so this does have SPF 50 in it if you
guys didn't know this is paraben and
cruelty
it cosmetics is cruelty free which is
great so I did pick up at the shade fair
and I love the way that this bottle
comes out so would you guys see this
it's like silver at the top and like a
beautiful leg almost holographic pink I
really enjoy that it comes off like this
and it is a pump I love the way that she
packages for her CC creams when I think
were her CC cream so anyway this is
going to be a lot of fun to try out as
well I want to know down below which
foundation you guys want to see first
test it out so definitely let me know
down below and whichever comment gets
the most thumbs up that will be the
first one alright the fourth one that I
picked up is actually from y Estelle
this was a hella pricey so I hope it
works out this is called the YSL fusion
ink foundation so this is what the
actual packaging looks like it is super
super beautiful this is supposed to be
kind of like a water foundation very
skin-like so I'm very excited to women
that I watch here on YouTube absolutely
rave about this I love faces 1042 and
also mama loves mascara so I'm going to
link their channels down below but this
is what the packaging looks like so you
have this gorgeous little gold lid here
and then it is a glass of bottle I mean
why I sell always does the packaging
beautifully yeah I'm excited to try this
out i think this beat n shade looks
really really freakishly close to my
skin tone so this is going to be fun to
try out and then i did pick up something
that was more of like a skin tint again
since i've been so dry so this is the
hourglass illusion hyaluronic skin tint
it does have one fluid ounce of product
in it kind of like a normal foundation
it is oil free and it does have broad
spectrum SPF 15 so definitely let me
know if you have tried this out I
haven't seen too many people play with
this but my friend Bree here on YouTube
I will also link her channel down below
she has tried this out and she really
really likes it so this is what it looks
like the shade that I picked up is
called vanilla which is supposed to be
there lightest shade with a cool
undertone so I really hope this is light
enough but yeah I'm super excited to try
that out as well and then the last thing
that I picked up was actually a primer
to go along it to do these first
impressions a lot of you again or giving
me some wonderful constructive feedback
and you said that I should wear primer
on half of my face and then the other
half of should just leave plane so i
picked up the bobby brown
vitamin-enriched facespace i recently
got a 100-point perk of this at sephora
and i think is incredible it's not to
silicon like it's also not to mattifying
or to hydrating it's just right in
between so I thought this would be a
very very good
primer to test out foundations with let
me know if you have seen a different
primer in my collection that you would
rather I try out maybe a drugstore one
because this is quite pricey but I
thought this would be a good one so this
is what is the vitamin enriched
facespace looks like it is actually in a
plastic container I thought this was
going to be a nice way to glass bottle
but yeah so it's really beautiful it
kind of smells like lemon pound cake and
like i said i have tried it so i think
it's a really really nice one and i'm
excited to try this out with those
foundations and then I did pick up some
point perks so the first one it was a
liquid lipstick if you guys haven't
noticed I've been very cynical about
liquid lipsticks lately like I don't
even want to try one out before I even
like open it up so um in my if sea bag
for this month I had opened something up
and I was like I'm now I'm gonna try it
cuz it's a liquid lipstick like I should
not be thinking that way I should still
try it out so anyway this is the shorter
Armani lit the magnet this is the second
skin intense matte color in the shade
400 which is a red color so I'm really
really on the hunt to look for a very
very comfortable comfortable liquid
lipstick this year so I'm gonna try this
little guy out I did get a sample of the
kate spade walk on air perfume this is
one of my friends at favorite perfumes I
will also link her channel down below my
friend Haley and then I got two samples
of the Misty or this is the absolutely
blooming and they gave me two of those
it smells amazing i love the way the
smells and then I did pick up this row
seat and this is the almond milk body
cream I absolutely adore the shower oil
so I wanted to try that out and then I
also got the dr jart water drop
hydrating moisturizer so this is what it
looks like this is a really nice little
point per core code that you can type it
you get one fluid ounce of product in
here so pretty darn good same amount as
a foundation but recently I did pick up
one of these and Tom actually used it
over the holidays and he said he really
liked it my best friend Michelle says
she does not like this on her very dry
skin but I'm gonna try it out anyway we
shall see I trust her more than Tom as
far as like skin care is concerned so we
shall see how that works and yes so that
is everything that I picked up
definitely let me know down below which
foundation you want to see tested first
and yeah congratulations to the giveaway
winners bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
