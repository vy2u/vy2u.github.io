this video I have a huge Trader Joe's
haul for you guys so if you would like
to see what groceries we picked up for
the next couple of weeks then please
keep watching alright so the first two
items we picked up were some organic
raspberries we also got two these for
almond croissants and it says just proof
let rise overnight and bake so yeah we
got those we also got some organic of
bananas for Tom I did not realize that
we got so much organic fruits normally
just by regular fruits we got let's see
here some pomegranate seeds two bags of
garlic naan which we really really like
we also got two bags of the penne
arabiatta which we also really do the
enjoy from Trader Joe's and I have a
recipe that I actually make this from
scratch as well and it's a vegan but
this one I don't think is vegan the one
that you know you just heat up and then
this is let's see here mushroom and
black truffle flatbread with mozzarella
cheese we love that I also loved this um
what is this a very French thin crust
pizza with debris and tomatoes super
super yummy we got some double cream
Brewery cheese we got some eggs we also
got some Trader Joe's three-layer hummus
you have traditional cilantro jalapeno
and spicy we also went ahead and picked
up for Tom the lamb vindaloo and then I
got these let's see here well I guess
we'll start with these we got some
organic blue corn tortilla chips and
then I got these things called pluots I
think these are a mixture of plums and
apricots we also got some Trader Joe's
baby bell peppers these are super sweet
I like to go ahead and mix those in or
not mix them in but I like to dip them
into the hummus for Tom we got him the
salted caramel bread pudding he really
likes bread pudding I personally don't
for me I got two little pieces of the
Morningstar farms to see these are the
bacon strips they're vegetarian and
really really yummy I prefer that over
regular bacon for Tom we got the
chickens spring rolls with white meat
chicken I've got the me okie gorgonzola
again I have a copycat recipe that I
make that is vegan so if you guys would
like to see that maybe I could do a
vegan recipe for that but I do like this
one and obviously that one is not vegan
um we got some tempura chicken with
sweet and sour sauce we also
shiitake mushroom chickens and we really
just like these frozen meals because you
just heat them up really really quickly
like in the I was gonna say in the oven
you can do it in the oven you can do it
on the stove you can do it in the
microwave however you want Tom got a
bidding but I think that's how you say a
bowl so in here we have beef vegetables
and a spicy chili sauce he also got a
demi but cats will probably have some
cheese and bread with that we got some
organic mixed medley a cherry tomatoes
these are so nice this time of year
again really good for dipping in the
hummus
we got toms some prosciutto as well and
then another one of those black truffle
flatbread pizzas I got my favorite juice
from Trader Joe's which is the tangerine
juice Tom got oh my god things are
falling over Tom got the vanilla almond
spiced chai which is new it tastes
really really good
we also got some whole wheat speak up
the pita pockets I was gonna say pita
bread pita pockets whatever um we also
got some chana masala this is really
really good I'm gonna have that with the
garlic naan probably tonight we also got
let's see here some steamed chicken soup
dumplings and we also got some mochi we
got these strawberry ones we normally
get the mango but we couldn't find them
today these are new and they look
amazing everything mango right now at
Trader Joe's these are little mini mango
pies so those look really yummy and then
for Tom we also got jerk chicken thigh
skewers so yeah I think that he'll
probably enjoy those and then let's see
here he got some Parker House rolls he
likes to just heat these up and put some
prosciutto on in the morning and a
little bit of like I don't know what he
puts on I think he has some sort of like
a paste that he likes to make it's like
a mixture of God I don't even know what
it it's like a truffle paste that he
puts on there and then we also got some
Trader Joe's mahi-mahi burgers so that
is everything that we got from Trader
Joe's I hope you enjoyed this quick
little haul even though it is huge I
tried to go through it as quickly as
possible and yeah I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
