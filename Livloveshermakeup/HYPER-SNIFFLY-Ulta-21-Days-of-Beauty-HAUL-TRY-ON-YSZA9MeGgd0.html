video is going to be my ulta 21 days of
beauty haul now the actual event is
still going on but I had to stop myself
I was like you don't need anything else
I really wanted to get that it cosmetics
foundation brush but I was like girl you
have like 100 brushes you don't need it
but I kind of looking at that I kind of
was looking at the products last night
that I had gotten they all came in
separate boxes because they ordered them
on separate days and I was like wow I
could have like a full face thing going
on here so today I thought I would go
ahead and try them on as I hold them for
you guys so I've never done this on my
channel we'll see how it goes it may be
like an hour long video sorry if it is
but let's go ahead and get started
alright so I do want to tell you guys I
am already wearing a face primer and I
did pick up an eye primer during this
event so we'll put that on next but I
have on my stila aqua globe perfecting
primer and I chose this one out because
I did pick up a foundation during this
little beauty event and I feel like this
particular primer really isn't to
Silicon e or too sticky so it's a good
one to kind of test out a new foundation
so before we get into that I do want to
say I picked up to skincare items they
are the clarisonic luxe cashmere cleanse
brush head so this is what they look
like Tom and I both use these on art
clarisonic he has the clarisonic Aria in
like a black color and then I have a hot
pink and that is the mia or the mia too
so we got two of those because those are
normally thirty dollars a piece and it
was buy one get one free I think fifty
percent off no buy one get one free oh
god hold on one second sorry leaky
nostril anyway yeah so it was buy one
get one free and I think that's such a
good deal and these are considerably
considerably softer than the normal
brush heads I used to use the normal
brushes but these are like their life
let me show you guys actually what they
look like so look how long the bristles
are they're super soft and silky and
they have a little bit of give to them
some of the other brush heads can be
quite like gritty on the skin and I
never noticed until I got one of these
so that is the first item that I picked
up a on next we're going to go ahead and
get into the face stuff I guess yeah I
don't really know how I'm gonna do this
let's just get started and this is a
pure hydrogel lift 360 I perfecting
primer it says it has base correcting
technology it was all written in French
there we go achieve the perfect eye
makeup
location with this hydrating all-purpose
cooling eye primer that preps and smooth
the skin for better wear throughout the
day I've not heard anything about this
ever I feel like I end up buying things
that nobody ever talks about and I'm
just like well it's on sale I better buy
it right so this is what it looks like
it's just this tiny little stick oh my
god it's so tiny this is tiny tiny tiny
so that is what it looks like and it has
a little protector here which is nice
you take it off and it's literally just
like a pink gel so we're just going to
go ahead and apply that it says to apply
it underneath the eyes and on your
eyelids let me fix my mirror um just
apply it as an eye primer it's a little
weird because this thing is kind of big
I like it you guys know I like quick
things in the morning and I think that
this was like eight dollars oh like
twelve dollars or something like that
okay feels cooling it feels nice
actually find it feels like the Stila
aqua perfecting base oh god it just got
real tacky oh my god I don't know if
I'll like that underneath my eye uh Wow
oh my god a super tacky it feels like a
glitter glue almost well geez all right
that should keep our shadows on all day
hopefully so that is the first item i
got like i said i think it was like
eight or ten dollars so pretty good deal
the next item that I picked up was from
dermablend this is the professional
smooth liquid cambo medium coverage
foundation I thought everything from
dermablend was supposed to be super full
coverage and I thought this was super
full coverage but no it says it is
medium coverage this is the outer
packaging if this was half off i think
around ten twelve dollars maybe it was
more than that you don't know it's more
like twenty i think originally up like
40 you do get titanium dioxide six point
eight percent in here and i got the
latest shade which is called linen so we
shall see here is what it looks like you
did get one fluid ounce even though it
doesn't look like it and it's in a
little squeezy bottle so I'm going to
squeeze some out onto the back of my
hand seems like I have the nice kind of
creamy consistency to it and we will
just go ahead and actually blend this in
but first of all let me show you guys
two brushes that I picked up during this
event the first was the perfecting face
brush this is from bare minerals and
this is the brush that you're supposed
to use with their bare minerals serum
found
shin or whatever I have a lot of serum
foundations and I like them a lot so I
thought I would get this it was fifty
percent off it's the one that has like
the hole in the middle you're supposed
to put the product directly in there and
then put it on the face so we'll do that
but I also got a second brush that this
is the Ulta angled foundation brush I
have to admit like both of these are
super-tiny I was not expecting that I'm
someone who likes to put my makeup on
really really quickly so these are like
I feel like it's gonna take a while to
get through everything but yeah this was
ten dollars so this is what the angled
foundation brush looks like I want to do
a video for you guys comparing the
Sephora house brand to the Ulta house
brand so we shall see alright I'm going
to dip a little bit in here and I'm just
going to start applying this oh my god
it's very thick and this brush is like
super dense I feel soft but super dense
and the shade oh geez it is quite light
sometimes when you do get titanium
dioxide it can lighten up a little bit
so hopefully this will dry down a little
more dark hmm alright I'm going to put
it on my eye area as well you guys see
that that is nice coverage but this
brush I don't like that so let's go
ahead and put a little drop of this into
the bare minerals one and see what
happens so we're just gonna like deposit
it right in there and I think that this
is mostly supposed to be good yeah this
feels wrong this is mostly supposed to
be good for serum foundations because
they're so easy to blend but I wanted to
see how it would perform with a fuller
coverage foundation actually is buffing
and kind of nicely looks better than
this side this side is like super cakey
looking already yeah I prefer i prefer
this brush but yeah both of these are
quite tiny i really like a big
foundation brush you know that well
basically mmm excuse me just a hot mess
today I really like a big foundation
brush that we'll go ahead and just buff
things in really really quickly so I
wouldn't personally like
i don't think i'll use these unless i
want to really like stipple some sort of
product on maybe i'll use them for
concealer but not very happy with the
size of these safe like you really have
to spend time you know blending an you
guys know me i hate blending I hate a
blending all right that that looks like
 that looks like um very
strange because it's like glossy looking
and it seems like it would be blendable
but this yeah it's super tacky like it
feels sticky right now in my face I'm
going to go in with this morphe I'm MV
39 brush which is a nice foundation
brush it is has two different colors to
it if you guys are curious um it is
clean and I'm just going to kind of
blend this in and see if it was the
brush or if it's the foundation oh it's
the brush yeah able to the brush this
you guys because this is now blending in
really nicely on the skin ok so those
two foundation brushes like no no no I
don't like this all to one at all it's
still like weird it's tiny these are
just too little maybe I'll try this one
with serum foundation I'll keep you guys
updated let me know if you want an
update on this I guess I could do a
follow-up hall and give you guys my
final thoughts on the products but uh
yeah no it's not the foundation the
foundation is okay nothing special the
finish is just average i think the
coverage is medium-full coverage but uh
not super super impressed alright moving
on guys let's go ahead and set that in
quickly I'm going to set it in with my
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder since I and then only beast I'm
sorry if I keep sniffling I know people
I was like why are you sniffling you
guys I'm pretty darn sure that I'm
allergic to my makeup I do not have
allergies to anything and I did just get
a pet ferret maybe that's why but
honestly I think I'm allergic to make up
but it's not going to stop me cuz i seem
to always get a runny nose when i'm
putting my makeup on which is like weird
tom was like you should stop wearing
makeup I was like excuse me what do you
just say to me I don't think somebody oh
goodness I have a little eyelash that
just came off well it's
damn girl aggressive enough all right so
after I have set that in I am going to
show you guys the next couple of items i
got so you have this first impression
just ok those brushes though no alright
so moving on I did pick up two of the
Becca mineral blushes these were on sale
for I believe fifteen dollars they're
normally like 30 and these are super
small so I was like yeah you know what
I'm gonna have to go ahead and get those
when they are fifteen dollars because I
almost feel like they're not worth it
when they are thirty dollars that they
are because honestly the Becca mineral
blushes are so pigmented and also I do
love their luminous flush blushes and
those are also this size which is six
grams so the first one I got is called
wild honey it just comes in the typical
Becca packaging flying saucer and there
is a wild honey it's like a nice neutral
kind of peachy color and it does have a
little bit of shimmer in it we're going
to go ahead and apply that with this elf
complexion brush just going to tap in
there lightly Oh white powdery and we're
going to put that right onto the cheeks
I like this I've been really really into
neutral blushes lately just like really
really into it for whatever reason and I
think this one's really pretty oh there
I go with that again just blow your nose
I know something to say that in the
comments I don't have a tissue I don't
have a did you all right ready I like
that color very pretty very very pretty
yeah that's nice okay so I got that one
and then I also got the shade songbird
we're gonna go ahead and layer the two
because why the hell not right so here
is song birdsong burn has a little more
of a peachy tone with some gold shimmer
but it's not like Narses orgasm where
it's like straight up like coral peach
eNOS it's a little more subtle than that
those two look pretty together yeah
that's good yes you really have to tap
off that excess because becca mineral
blushes or their blushes in general are
very pigmented and i'm going to go ahead
and kind of blend that out now let me go
back in with that morphine ND 39 and
just kind of do circular motions
but i know i was going to love those
because i have the beca split pants I
love the formulation on the mineral
blushes are very beautiful and that was
such a great deal i know those sold out
really quickly i stayed up until 2am to
get those so you know there's hardcore
beauty addict right here alright moving
on guys the next item I had purchased
was one of the lorac colorsource
buildable blushes so this is all so many
very neutral color if held like all
three of these up to each other you
probably be like um those really all the
same shade but I swear they're not as a
shade that I got is called cinematic
this is what it looks like and it's just
a beautiful like neutral kind of mabi
color and let's go ahead and use this as
a shadow I've heard these are hella
pigmented so I'm going to go in with
this really fluffy BH Cosmetics fresh
here whoa tap that off and just really
lightly we're gonna start working this
into the crease oh my god pigment I
thought that this would just be really
easy to like blend huh sadly mistaken
sadly mistaken yeah these are whoa whoa
whoa girl whoa all right don't worry
I'll come back to it let's just get this
into the crease these are hella hella
pigmented damn all right I'm going to go
into I have this little palette
right here propped up this is the
hourglass 2015 holiday palette I'm going
to go into one of the ambient lighting
powders and I'm just gonna use it to
help blend this out because that was
super pigmented wow I do have the light
source highlighters and have all four
shades and they're they're pigmented but
not like this that was crazy these
aren't even like what pigmented than me
Becca blushes I'm like I said those are
pretty damn pigmented all right well
okay yes that really really is not
blending very well either I have no idea
if it is because it's a blush or is it
because of that eye primer hmm looks
like it looks like we have some hits and
misses here you guys today we shall see
all right well whatever we'll keep
moving on hmm yeah not so much for an
eyeshadow but it's still a beautiful
color it's gonna be gorgeous as a blush
make sure you tap off that excess all
right and then I'm going to go in with
this little urban decay so much like
liner brush take a little bit of this
product again I'll just put it out you
know on the lower lash line really
really lightly definitely very powdery
better on the lower lash line though
maybe my little fluffy blending brush
was just too too fluffy let me see here
bunch of brushes here let me go in with
this Sigma diffused crease a 38 just
going to go and do a little more
blending I did not think that it was
going to be that pigmented all right
moving on I also picked up some eyeliner
so I got two of these Smashbox Albie's
on point coal eyeliners I love you so
much I have the shade Sumatra it's super
super good where's on the water line for
an incredibly long time so I picked up
the shade Raven which is black and also
storm which is a gray I'm not going to
put these ones on because I have two
other eyeliners I got and I want to try
those out but the formulation on these
is really really good you guys and these
were only ten dollars a piece which is
ridiculous so this is what Raven looks
like and I really like the packaging on
these you just twist it off and then it
is completely retractable which is
awesome so here is Raven not be like
darkest or the blackest of black that
I've ever had but that's nice and then I
got the shade storm and I normally don't
like gray eye liners which is why
sometimes I don't like black eyeliners
because I feel like they have too much
great in them but I was super like into
this when I saw it on the website so
there is storm pretty those look nice so
I got two of those and then i also got
two of the it cosmetics no tug pull
waterproof gel eyeliners they are
clinically proven to have anti-aging lon
where I pencils whatever blah blah blah
blah blah so I got the shade of
highlight and also i got the shade black
I do like these on the water line as
well and again these were like twelve
dollars so here is the highlighting
shade it looks a little more like
champagne e or pinky we shall see oh
it's pretty it's very shy
there is and then I also got the black
shade like I said and that one looks a
little something like this so you know
what we'll put this one on so it is
retractable which is awesome and I will
just go ahead and put this on to my
waterline I love the way it just goes on
so so so quickly damn I'm looking in the
viewfinder at that eye shadow Wow looks
like sheet blushes are not always my
fried shadows okay all right moving on I
am going to use this little becca
shimmering skin Perfector poured in the
shade opal I got this as like a little
deluxe ice gift with those two blushes
that blushes just going to take it with
my finger and put it on to the skin I've
always been like not so much like love
with this opal shade and also it's a
cream product and I don't tend to like
those but I figured why the hell not we
have it for this video let's do it looks
pretty I just feel like it does start to
kind of separate on the face you could
definitely put it on like after your
foundation before you powder but I just
thought we might as well you said
alright and then the last item that I
got was this all may this is called thee
what are you called what are you but are
you all make color plus care liquid lip
balm what have you recommended these to
me i got these shade rosy lips and i
actually was supposed to get the shade
truffle as well and it just never showed
up so i contacted alta and it was a
mistake on their part so they are
sending that one but these are supposed
to be really really comfortable pretty
pigmented like bombs it comes in like a
lips lip gloss formulation pretty so
there is rosy lips and we're just going
to put that on you guys know I love a
comfortable lip products so thank you so
much for the recommendation
I know people go crazy they look why is
it on your Cupid's bow I took it off
okay kind of all right there it is guys
rosy lips hmm oh I like that I like the
feeling of that thank you so much for
the recommendation and that is the guys
those are all of the items that I picked
up in the Ulta 21 days of beauty sale I
think I'm gonna like most of them those
brushes I don't know about those um this
I probably won't use that often i might
declutter this little poured highlighter
this is probably really just meant for
blush like sometimes you can use blush
as eyeshadow but this does not blend
very well it could be that eye primer
that we use I don't know I'm kind of
glad that I did it because now I can see
that it shouldn't use as eyeshadow or
it's that eye primer that sucks so we'll
see I feel like 50 like fifty percent
the majority of the stuff was pretty
good but some was possibly a mist so
anyway that is it actually let me go
ahead and put some mascara on so I don't
look completely crazy for this video
let's just put a little bit on just a
little bit maybe the eyeshadow will look
better if we have some mascara this is
the mist mongo rocca mascara and this
has been discontinued I'm not okay with
that I'm just not okay with that it's
not okay I like it I don't like it
alright guys so anyway that is it would
you guys like me to do like a follow-up
plus review video so like in two weeks I
let you know what I think of all the
products like completely and give you my
final thoughts or do you want just like
a normal follow up where I give you guys
kind of more like first impression but
like kind of not first impressions but
not a full review let me know down below
the size that's what I'm saying I feel
like a hot Mendes just have not kicked
in yet anyway
does it for this video thanks for
joining me guys and I will see you
2morrow 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
