channel in this video I am sharing my
hair products and tools collection with
you guys I don't know if there will be a
lot of interest in this kind of stuff I
honestly am NOT someone who fusses with
my hair too often I really own only
owned a few like hair tools but for the
most part I do like to take care of my
hair so I definitely own a lot more
products but just so you guys know a
little more about my hair I naturally
have very fine straight hair so anytime
you see me as usually I have my hair up
in a bun or a ponytail or just down and
wavy which that is one of my favorite
ways to wear it and how I do that is I
just braid my hair overnight or it's
just down and straight and that is how
it is air dried so I will start with the
heating tools I really only have a few
and I really only use heat on my hair
for special occasions maybe once a week
so how I have my tools I have them
hanging here by shower curtain rings and
I have a Revlon
I love Revlon heat tools so I have a
straightener which I really don't need
because I have naturally straight hair
and then I have a new me curling wand I
don't think this is that fantastic
honestly I got it because there were so
many youtubers that were kind of talking
about the new me products and I'm really
not that impressed and then I have two
Revlon blow dryers so a little tiny pink
one for travel that actually closes up
and then I have a silver one so again um
if I am going to like heat style my hair
I always make sure I have a protected
and protectant in it but for the most
part I really don't do a lot of heat
stuff alright and then this little bin
right here it's like a container is
filled with all of these kind of hair
products that I use like headbands and
tons and tons of bun makers I could
asked a lot by you guys you're like oh I
like your bun or this or that I always
use bun makers I very very although I do
have enough hair to make a nice big bun
um unfortunately it's just very very
fine and it's not that it's thin I have
a lot of hair it's just fine if that
makes sense so I don't have nice thick
kind of coarser hair so it does fall out
of buns and ponytails kind of easily so
I do like to texturize it up especially
when I'm wearing my hair up but you guys
have probably see me wear a few of these
headbands on camera and these are I
haven't tried these yet they're supposed
to be those little curlers that you
leave in overnight and they're supposed
to make your hair really curly
I have a few like this from forever21
that are also a little foam hair curlers
are super cute I think I got those last
year around Valentine's Day actually so
yeah I think for the most part I am one
of those girls that I would just have
been so happy to have had curly hair I
love wavy hair and curly hair and of
course I have fine straight stick-thin
like hair you know it's just like
straight it doesn't have a lot of volume
so a lot of the products I use are to
protect my hair because they also do
bleach my hair however a lot of them are
also to give me like some texture if
that makes sense so anyway let's start
here I have a bunch of shampoos here
right here I have the Red King Diamond
oil next to it I have the red kin frizz
dismiss shampoo then I have the mane and
tail shampoo this is nice for oh it just
realized it's been it's the thing that's
holding this up the mane n tail shampoo
is nice I've had that for about two and
a half years it's really nice if you're
trying to grow your hair out it is very
very good at strengthening your hair not
necessarily making your hair grow faster
but definitely strengthening it I have
this Pantene 3 minute miracle
what is this repair and protect deep
conditioner this is my all-time favorite
shampoo of all times the Swap Moroccan
infusion color care shampoo absolutely
amazing
I also really like add the og axe
products you'll see a lot of those in
here I have these Sunkist blonde lemon
highlights shampoo then I have one of
the coconut water ones from otx I have
the red kunal soft which is really
fantastic I have the nourishing coconut
milk shampoo from OGX and then they'd
bergamot too this is the shampoo and
conditioner I have the Garnier Fructis
daily care shampoo which is also really
fantastic
if you biotin and collagen shampoo from
OGX and then I just have this little
sample here from Beauty Protection
protect shampoo whatever I haven't tried
it yet and I have not tried this one
uber list hydrating shampoo I also not
tried this I got this in my glossy box
for the month it is the lemon rinse it
is a clarifying shampoo alright moving
on over here I have this little box here
I used to do these treatments all the
time like in middle school in high
school this is the Clairol shine happy
it is a clear shine treatment I remember
them working so I picked another one up
when I saw it I'm excited to try that
out I have a few little products here
from caviar anti-aging line this is the
yeah caviar Repair multivitamin heat
protectant spray I don't think this
brand is that fantastic I know a lot of
people rave about it I don't love it but
I have you know used up some of their
products this is the replenishing
moisture milk the pump on that broke so
that was kind of annoying something I do
love when I do heat style my hair is
this fight Oh fight till carotene this
is the weaken damaged hair Leoben
it is a heat protectant spray a little
that heat protectant spray it's amazing
this is the sebastian style bird nine
multi benefit hair spray this is
fantastic really really wonderful I also
really like this right here this is from
bumble and bumble this is the thickening
hairspray I really like that if I want
to have a textured ponytail I have the
Marrakesh ends this is a Argan and hemp
oil therapy split end mender really
really nice I haven't tried this yet
this is the bumble and bumble
hairdressers primer oil I don't really
know how to use this invisible oil
primer how do you use this this is
before you use heating tools I got that
in a 500-point part from Sephora so I
really don't I didn't buy it you know
here I have the antigravity this is a
oil-free volumizer from Kevin Murphy
where I get my hair done Bay style Kevin
Murphy products so those are really
really big there I have the shea
moisture shea moisture african black
soap dry scalp elixir this is amazing if
your itchy dry scalp the Garnier Fructis
sleek and shine this is a leave-in
conditioning cream I really enjoy it a
lot and you get a lot of product for the
amounts of money that you spend which is
about under $5 I have the bumble and
bumble prepped a powder this is equal
parts dry equal parts dry shampoo style
extender and volume in a pinch it's
amazing it's just a volumizing powder
it's great when I wear my hair up and
then I have the s factor Flatiron spray
right there it's really awesome it
smells like strawberries then I have the
L'Oreal power moisture this is a 10
second hydro detangler it's just ok not
my favorite now this is a favorite this
is the otx lemon highlights highlight
activating citrus oil mess I love it
really fantastic product this is the
Melissa Autry from her line this is her
sea salt spray and then I have two of
these little it's a 10 miracle leave-in
they're quite nice I do prefer the one
that I'm using currently which is not in
here because
using it currently it is the keratin one
and also the silk infusion one the hot
toddy from dry bar this is a heat
protectant spray haven't even used it
yet and I have the shine cream called
the chaser from them haven't tried it
yet either oh wait no I have tried it I
did like the chaser this I have not
tried this is from bumble and bumble
it's an all style blow dry thing I don't
know and then I have tried this this is
the grooming creme from bumble and
bumble it smells like a men's hair
product but I like it this is one of my
favorite oils the argan oil of Morocco
penetrating oil from OG acts fantastic
the Pantene BB creme that's just okay
the brioche EO Bruce Karl milk this is a
reparative leave-in conditioning spray
quite good I do like this from dry bar
the 100 proof treatment oil I also
really love this right here this is from
otx as well this is the nourishing
coconut milk and tea breakage serum
fantastic let's see here over here I
have the pro Ganic this is the volume
you put this in my damp here it is
called the volume root boost finish plus
body builder really really nice it
doesn't leave your hair crunchy which I
like and then I have this from germ AK
Beauty I love this it's the silver
brightening miracle leave-in
conditioning treatment it's got a little
bit of a purple tone to it which is
great if you have blonde hair because it
will make it nice and Ashley instead of
golden I love these I have many many
bottles of this this is the john frieda
sheer blonde go blonder controlled
lightning spray it does have hydrogen
peroxide in it so be careful if you have
damaged or fragile hair then I have a
Johnson's baby powder that's nice in a
pinch if I don't have a dry shampoo
which right now I don't need to go ahead
and pick one up the Garnier Fructis
style curls shaping spray gel this is
nice you guys can see it's like an
actual gel can you see that it's not
cool yeah so I like this when I do the
braids at night and I want to wake up
with like nice soft waves I do spray a
little bit of that on to the waves and I
really enjoy it the Oscar blondie
texture and volume spray again really
really nice for when I want a messy
ponytail the shea moisture
raw shea butter extra moisture
transitioning milk another fantastic
fantastic product I love the Shea
Moisture line the Tresemme thermal
creations that is probably my all-time
favorite leaving I was gonna say
conditioning spray but no it's for like
heat protectant it's amazing they
Tresemme split remedy that's pretty darn
good it does help I don't think it
actually repairs your split ends I don't
think that's possible but it helps seal
them this is the Stila hair refresher
and gee blossom it's just a hair powder
and then I also have this one right here
from Stila and that is in creme bouquet
and I love that scent I have that any
perfume as well that is the bedhead it's
called the after-party sleek and shine
like serum or something it's quite nice
I love the cheese silk infusion and this
is great from Pantene this is called the
moisture silk whip it's like three
dollars at Target really fantastic the
Nexxus Hydra light that is a weightless
moisture root lift mist I absolutely
love it and I love that right there from
frizzies it is a glossing mist so those
are all of my hair products and I do
exchange my hair products out once a
week so I'll choose a new shampoo and
some different kind of styling things
depending on what I want to do is my
hair if I want to do waves or I wear my
hair up all the time I think the last 25
like videos I've done
I literally have probably been breaking
my hair up girls I don't know I love
throwing my hair in a ponytail or
throwing it in a bun so I just kind of
choose depending on what I'm doing
whether I want my hair just to be
natural that way just straight and you
know like very flat or I can do some
curls or something like that and I
usually just braid my hair so anyway
that is an overview of my heat tools and
my little hair accessories and all my
hair products I hope you guys I hoped
