hope you guys are having a great day I'm
in a different setup right now it is
very early in the morning at a family
cabin and people are sleeping upstairs
so I don't want to wake them so I'm in
the basement right now there's a little
light fixtures like broken up to where
some stuff back here old microwave you
know whatever this is our summer cabin
so we don't spend the whole year here so
we have some stuff piled up in the
basement anyway today i am reviewing for
you guys the new hard candy klamath
large invisible camouflage foundation i
purchased this at Walmart where I
believe eight dollars and might have
been seven you know what no it was eight
dollars even and I really really like it
and heard candy is a brand that you can
only get at walmart or walmart com I
don't think they have an online website
maybe you could find some of their
products at like cherry culture calm or
websites like that but overall they
don't sell them at like you know Sephora
also obviously not support that's only
high ends but ulta and you know other
makeup stores don't really have this
brand so you definitely need to pick it
up at walmart or walmart com i will link
below for you guys can find it but
anyway I've seen a lot of people
reviewing this foundation lately and I
was a little hesitant because a lot of
people were saying it's like half a
shade too dark or it starts to change
like on the skin and I just was thinking
oh well I'm obviously going to be
picking up the lightest shade and it's
going to turn dark and it's going to be
pink or orange I'm gonna hate it and I
really just you know what I'm trying out
a new foundation I don't want to have to
mix it with like a white mixer
foundation I want to find a good solid
color match so I was a little nervous
however I found a really really good
color match in the shade of porcelain
this is the lightest shade that they
have and I was comparing this one too i
think the other shape is called light
and this one just seemed to have a lot
more of a neutral undertone so my
problem with finding foundations is that
um usually i can't find the undertone
like i'll find a shade that kind of
matches the undertone will be all wrong
this is a neutral undertone so whether
you're really really pink or you're
really really warm undertones this is
going to just neutralize all of
yeah and it really just makes it easier
to blend it makes it easier to find you
know that color match and it's okay if
it kind of you know neutralizes the
whole face who doesn't really have color
to it because you're going to add color
to face you're going to add blush you're
going to add bronze or things like that
so that's a tip for you fail girls out
there who can't find a perfect color
match maybe go with like the neutral
lightest shade so anyway like I said
this is the lightest shade it have a
nice and neutral undertone and it really
really is a beautiful foundation I am
wearing it today on my face I like to
apply it with a damp sponge today I used
my real techniques that just happens to
be one of my favorite but I also really
really like the Beauty Blender um I
would say that it just glides on
beautifully it kind of reminds me of the
Sephora taunt infusion or the tint
infusion that I reviewed probably in
about December it has kind of n silicone
e texture to it which makes it really
really easy to blend and I do want to
say right away one pump is a lot a lot
of product I am wearing three pumps on
my face today the reason I did that was
number one I made a mistake of putting
body sunscreen on my face last night and
I woke up with a bunch of little raised
red bumps all over and I didn't want to
use any concealer in this video because
I wanted to show you guys how about the
foundation covered by itself so I knew
that I needed a little more product
however and the second thing is that
this layers beautifully this is the most
beautiful foundation for layering I've
never found a foundation that I told
layer three layers on without looking
cakey and this foundation has done it
for me it's beautiful so you can really
work your way from I would say it's
light to medium coverage for one pump
and then if you want to do a second pump
you can work your way to definitely
heavy coverage like I said it's so
blendable it kind of has that silicone e
texture to it which makes it really
really easy to blend you can blend it
with your fingers you can use a sponge I
tried using a brush but it's not my
favorite for any foundation I feel like
a brush time it takes away some of the
coverage that you can get so I prefer
the sponge but fingers is also good
really beautiful and I do think you get
more covered with fingers than with a
brush in my opinion unless our stippling
it on but like i said i used my real
techniques sponge and then i set it with
the NYC smooth skin pressed finishing
powder this has been a favorite of mine
lately this is in the shade translucent
I feel like it gives a little bit of
coverage but it's not to NAT and I
really love the texture of this
foundation kind of like a demi map like
not to drawing not too oily on
combination skin and I have no issue
with this breaking down with my t-zone
during the day or emphasizing the dry
patches on my cheeks so I would say if
you have dry skin or even oily
combination this is a you know a
universal foundation that everybody can
try um I did wear it with a silicone
primer today I have not been liking
silicone primers lately however I have
tried this foundation with hydrating
primers now makeup extenders you know
just like normal kind of primers so I
thought it was time that I try it with a
more like silky silicone II want to see
if you know it made it more matte or if
it made it more oily you know I just
wanted to see and so far it's really
good I'm not too oily I'm not to Matt
you know everything is just a nice Demi
matte finish and it's really beautiful I
will say you can see a little bit of
redness over here by my nostrils that's
probably just because I've had kind of a
sniffly nose and you know i usually do
use concealer in that area but like i
said you can use it without concealer
like I did today and get a really nice
you know coverage and like I said three
layers is very full coverage but it
doesn't look like it it doesn't look
cakey on the stand it's really really
beautiful you can tell you're wearing
makeup but it's not like obvious like
Revlon Colorstay or cap on d tattoo
rocket so anyway like I said I use this
primer today and I really like it on
beautifully I think foundations no
matter what kind of texture they are
going really well with a damp sponge but
also especially this foundation just the
blend ability of it is insane I love
that has a pump I think that's awesome
you get a pretty good decent amount of
product in here and I think for eight
dollars it's like a total steal because
think about
drugstore you know brands right now are
really really going up in price like
that infallible Pro matte foundation
which I love from l'oreal is like
fifteen dollars when I brought it in
Manhattan II was literally fifteen
dollars and ninety-nine cents that's
crazy so it's really lovely to find a
product that is eight dollars and really
feels like it is drugstore oh Christ I
really do like the gift glamour flash
burns Calanthe Lodge the hard candy
brand in general I like a few of their
concealers that some of the concealers
are a bit too dark I love their blushes
their highlights they have some really
nice product so i definitely recommend
checking out the brand there's a few
hits and misses but um you know it's so
cheap and cheerful that just a cheap and
cheerful cheap and cheerful us that you
really can try out a lot of products
without leaving any hole in your wallet
so anyway really loving this foundation
love the color match think it's great
i'm really happy with the texture i love
that i can build a layer upon layer and
not have it look cakey and you know the
wearability is great to it lasts very
very well throughout the day i am
wearing a setting spray today I think
the settings rave and the primers really
do prolonged aware of foundations I
really believe in them and I just think
that you know it really lasts all day as
long as I used settings for in a partner
so really really happy with this product
I hope you guys enjoyed this review if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
