have a holly wanted to share with you
guys today I picked up things from Ulta
and also from bhcosmetics so let's just
get started I'm going to start with what
I got from bhcosmetics I ordered online
and they were having lots and lots of
like cool sales and just like free
shipping and all this great stuff so I
went ahead and ordered some kind of
diverse products that I really wanted to
try out from them so the first thing I
picked up was the bhcosmetics Studio Pro
makeup brush cleaner and it looks like
this and it comes in this nice um what
is this 5.98 fluid ounce bottle and the
reason I got this was because I want and
need I am in definite need of a brush
cleaner like an like I am I was going to
say automatic brush minute you know one
that you clean the brush and you can use
right away something that you're not
deep cleaning your brushes with I do d
clean my brushes but I'm spot cleaning
is definitely something that I need to
like really step my game up on so I
definitely thought this would help I was
considering going back and picking up
the one from Mac because that's the 1
i've used for many years and i had run
out recently and I just thought you know
what I should try and see if I can find
someone you know another one from
somewhere else because it is pretty
expensive at Mac and I go through really
really quickly so i picked up this one
and i heard its comparable to the mac
one it also came with a nice little pump
so you just put that in there and you
can spray it on to the bristles rub it
onto the you know tissue or paper towel
and then basically just spot clean your
brushes and you can use them almost
immediately which is really awesome they
drive really quickly because it has
alcohol in it and yeah so anyway I
picked that up I will let you guys know
if I like that and if I do think it's
comparable to the mac um brush cleanser
one so next I picked up this like angled
kind of brush it's it doesn't even say
what it is it's just a BH Cosmetics so
it's this nice like I almost feel like
goat hair or something like it's really
really nice and soft and it's kind of
like it could be a contour brush or
maybe a blush brush but it's angled and
I just thought it was a really nice
shape so I'm gonna try that one out
I also picked up their large stippling
brush um i don't think i would use this
for foundation I'm not a huge fan of
using stippling brush is for foundation
but maybe I just haven't found the right
one so maybe I'll try this for
foundation maybe not maybe I'll use it
for blush or you know whatever I want to
use it for but I thought that was really
nice it is duo fiber and its really
really soft so definitely look forward
to trying that one out I also picked up
a spoolie from them you can never have
enough school easy guys honestly gotta
take care of those brows so picked that
up and then I got a flat like eyeliner
brush so it's not angled it's just
completely flat all the way across and
it's really easy to pack on gel eyeliner
or shadow with a brush like this and its
really really dense and soft so thought
i would try that one out and i also got
this what is this i don't even know how
quite how to describe this I guess it's
like it's really not dense and it's not
like a kabuki it's just like a I don't
know what I was thinking I could use
this flaw maybe blush or something like
that but super super soft like
definitely definitely synthetic bristles
and it does kind of like give way like
you can kind of bend it so it's not like
a stiff stiff like kabuki style brush
but um I don't know this will be
interesting I'm not quite sure what I
thought I should get this more but
whatever i'm going to try it out um and
the last brush i got oh sorry that was
the last brush I got next I got the
flawless brow pencil in blonde and I
really want to try this out because I'm
a huge fan of brow pencils I just think
that brow pencils for me personally work
better for my brows then like gel or
creams do just because I don't feel in
my brows a whole lot unless I'm really
really feeling it but mostly on a
day-to-day basis I just use a pencil so
this is what the pencil looks like you
get to the color on one side this is the
shade blonde and it
looks like this so it looks like it's
going to be a nice color match very ashy
which is good and then on the other end
you get a spoolie so that's great too
love must Belize so that is what the
shade looks like and again this is in
the shade blonde just wipe off my hand
quickly my nose too I just have been
getting I don't even think of allergies
of the star burgers I don't have
allergies but I just had a runny nose
telling ya hey wait moving on I'm the
last couple things I got from
bhcosmetics for some of their glitters
so they have like a glitter collection
and they come in these cute little boxes
really really cute so I thought I'd pick
up a few shades thought they'd be fun to
work with so I got to the shade of gold
which is just exactly what it says they
really really gold glitter very pretty
then I picked up mermaid blue which is
like so summery and I just felt like oh
my gosh I have to get that like I can't
not get that so this is a mermaid blue
really really pretty kind of match with
my nails but I just thought that that
was absolutely gorgeous and it has all
those little on like green shimmers in
it and things like that love it I also
picked up jungle green which I thought
was also quite summary and fun and it's
just like this nice green color with
little gold shimmer isn't it pretty and
the last one I picked up was baby pink
which is pretty self-explanatory at the
baby pink color and it's got little
silver shimmers in it really really
pretty so that's when I got a BH
Cosmetics I know it wasn't a huge amount
of stuff but they were having you know
those sales like I said and I just
thought they always have some kind of
thing going on whether it be free
shipping or like fifty percent off your
order or like it by palette get a free
palette so I thought it would be just
fun to try out some things that I
haven't tried
I'm really excited for that brush
cleanser and I'm really excited with
glitters all right i'm going to show you
guys what I got from Alton now Alton was
having like 31 days of like sales on a
certain item every single day they would
have an item that literally was full
priced and then it would cut down to
like half price and they would say this
is like the item of the day blah blah
blah it was on their online website and
I ended up ordering a few of those so
the first thing I got actually was not
on one of their like 31 days of beauty
um yep 31 days of sales or beauty or
whatever but this is the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer in pore
minimizing this is supposed to be very
very similar to the benefit professional
and I'm all about trying new stuff like
this like you know poor concealing
things so I'm excited to try this out it
really does feel really really soft on
the skin and it really does leave a
beautiful soft finish on the skin so
we'll see some people are saying it's
better than the benefit Porefessional so
that's pretty awesome but anyway I
thought I'd pick up just the smaller
size just in case I end up not like you
you never know you never know sometimes
those kind of products you can really
dry out your skin so we just want to be
careful um next I got the itch cosmetics
bye-bye redness and this was originally
i think around thirty dollars and that's
how it originally sells for like on the
website however they had that 31 days of
beauty or whatever or sales and this
went down to like 13 or 15 dollars so i
thought i really really should try out I
don't have a lot of products you're in
cosmetics but I really think highly of
the brand I think they're wonderful I
like what they do and I like their
thoughts on what makeup should be so I
thought I'd try this out and it looks
really really scary and intimidating and
totally not my skin tone however it must
be one universal shade for everybody um
again not really sure how that's
supposed to work out because that's
looking a little dark on my skin but
maybe it blends in better or something
like that or maybe you just put it on
the red areas of your face I've seen
people use the different ways whether it
be for foundation or just covering up
like rosacea or level like broken
capillaries maybe that's what i'll do
but I've heard really good things and it
seems like it's really smooth and easy
and creamy to blend and for like 13 or
fifteen dollars camera for the exact
price I just thought well I have to
purchase it at least true so I thought
that was a great deal next I got the
Bliss fat girl six pack this was also
one of those things where it's like I
would never pick it up at full price
because I think it's kind of gimmicky
however it went down to literally like
twelve dollars and it's usually like 36
by thinks so I was like I should try it
out it's basically just a tummy toning
gel with six active ingredients and an
ab activator applicator so has this
smells like peppermint bubblegum or
something but I have this cute little
thing you just like rub it on your tummy
and areas that you want to like tone up
so I thought it was fun for summer and
again I would never purchase this at
full price but because it was um so much
on sale and so like lo like in price I
just thought you know what I might as
well I see it all the time at sephora no
class so why not give it a try and the
last three things I got were also on the
little like Beauty steal giveaway for a
certain day and those were the it to 10
products and basically if you purchased
one you got like a deluxe size free with
it so I ended up getting I could not
decide between the it's a 10 miracle
leave-in plus keratin and the silk
expressed leavin so I got both um so I
got the it's a time silk Express miracle
leave-in it looks like this and you just
spray it on damp hair it detangles it
cuts down drying time shield against
prison Hans's body protects colors it
gives explosive silkiness glossy
build-up free just some really really
really good things it sounded like and
then I also got the it's a 10 miracle
leave-in plus keratin which I've heard
is really really good too and it says it
it helps maintain keratin strengthening
like ingredients and treatments increase
styling imagine ability perfect for all
hair types replaces lost protein and you
guys know I have been coloring my hair
this month so I thought that this would
be good because you do lose protein and
keratin when you strip it of you know
its natural oils and things like that so
anyway so i picked up the full size of
those two and because i got that i got a
free it's a 10 miracle leave-in product
and this is like a big deluxe size
sample and it's funny I actually have
tried the regular one before it was
before I was coloring my hair and I
really really hated it it was too heavy
it just did not feel good and I hated it
I actually ended up giving it away so I
when I saw that you know what I was
skeptical too skeptical kept the bowl
skeptical to try the brand again because
I really didn't like this one so when I
finally went and purchased these I was
like oh man this is the free product you
get with it I'm going to hate it however
the other night i did use this on my
hair and I sprayed it and it left my
hair beautiful and really really nice
and silky and so I think that what
happened last time was that it was
before I was coloring my hair and my
hair was just too fine and if it was
left like a greasy mess that wasn't
actually taking the product in so I
think what has happened and what has
changed now is that I color my hair now
it's a little more dry it's got a little
more texture to it it really can soak in
the product so I do like this now I like
the regular Miracle ten leavin however
i'm really excited to try out the silk
silk express hopefully that will leave
me is really silky hair and also the
miracle leave-in plus keratin because
everybody raves about this one so um
also if you purchased one of those you
also got a it's a 10 miracle deep
conditioner plus keratin so this is just
a little I'm deep conditioner mask so
anyway those were some deals that i have
gotten lately online I'd definitely be
on the bhcosmetics website they have
crazy sales &amp;amp; great deals like all the
time so definitely check out out
and i love that all too had this 30 day
of sales going on with different brands
because I'd really got to try a bunch of
new stuff that normally I probably
wouldn't have purchased because it was
like really pricey and I wasn't sure
about but I ended up picking up some
stuff but I was just like you know what
it's so low in price and I've had my eye
on it so why not try it so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this review I will see
you review did I say that I feel too
many reviews you guys I feel too many
reviews that's why I keep saying that I
hope you guys enjoyed this hall please
