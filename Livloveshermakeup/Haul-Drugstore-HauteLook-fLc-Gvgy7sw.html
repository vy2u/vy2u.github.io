kind of on a filming kick today so if
you see me wearing this shirt for like
five videos in a row that's why I'm just
kind of pre filming stuff I have a lot
of stuff that I've collected like whole
kind of stuff that I just don't want
sitting around the apartment right now
in a box like I want to show to you guys
and yeah and i have a few reviews also
so anyway today I'm going to be hauling
for you guys some things that I picked
up from hautelook and also from the
drugstore so this is going to be a whole
drug store and hautelook so let's just
get started I have everything in this
little box right here and yeah so the
first thing i'll start with the
drugstore stuff i picked up this NYC
city proof 24-hour waterproof eye shadow
stick and the color is 620 murray hill
champagne so it's just like this big
chubby stick and it's like this really
nice kind of champagne e color and i
just think this would make a nice base
and also i put it right there um it's
just really nice like a nice Sheen and i
just thought it'd be fun to try out NYC
is really cheap and cheerful so i
thought i would just try some of their
new stuff out i also picked up this
little quad from Rimmel London this is
the glam I squad eyeshadow ombre in 03
one day fair it looks like that and i
thought the shades were just so
beautiful it has a little sponge tip
applicator which i'm going to toss but
these are the shades and you get like
this really nice dark color a cream
color and then those two colors right
there or what like made me really want
to get it so this topi one and that pink
I just thought they looked really really
pretty um it looks like the little like
shadow pots are kind of small so that's
going to be kind of hard to work into
but they really feel nice and creamy and
pigmented so I excited to play with that
little quad from Rimmel um the next
thing I got were some of the new
wet'n'wild blushes I love wet'n'wild and
their blushes are like
exception so they have some new
repackaged our essence Avery package
because these are not the same colors as
their other blushes but they have some
new blushes that are in different
packaging and this one is the center
stage collection wet and wild fergie and
this is an a 160 brush with brilliance
and it's this gorgeous peachy color with
tons and tons of golden shimmer and it
feels like freaking butter butter I tell
ya better that is a swatch of it I think
it's so beautiful it just feels so
creamy I'm so impressed I just Oh went
wild always um either really impresses
me or really like does not impress me so
this one definitely impress me the
pigmentation and equality that texture
is wonderful and I think that's a
gorgeous color so really excited to play
with that I also picked up another one
of their blushes and this one is like a
pool toned pink and it is in a 159 brush
with danger and it's just a really matt
cool toned pink I think it's going to be
beautiful and the texture is the same
it's so creamy and beautiful and i love
it so this one looks really really cute
it's like Barbie doll pink right there
so I am really really excited to play
with those I'm gonna definitely pop
those out like tomorrow like ASAP as
soon as I can put them on so um really
really excited to play with those I
think I'm going to like the cool toned
pink one the most but um I should I
won't say that yet because I have to see
what they look like on my skin tone but
i highly recommend you know checking
those out those were just a few dollars
um and then everything else is from
whole look so let me show you guys I got
one of the Mario Badescu strawberry face
scrubs this is just like a scrub that
has actual raspberry raspberry
strawberry seeds in it as the exfoliant
um so I've got actually a 2-pack of this
I already popped one in the shower and
I've used it today I mean loved it so
gentle and nice and has really a small
ingredients list just stearic acid
strawberry extra
axi moly end which is algae just stop
this really good for your skin and um I
always use scrubs in the morning and I
like trying new things so this will be
good strawberry face scrub from Maya
badescu I think I got two of those for
like fifteen dollars on hautelook whole
look is amazing they have great deals um
next I got a few things from pure
minerals this is the pure radiance and I
need to get this tag off I hate when
they cover the product with a tag or
something like that like a sticker it's
like don't you know that's going to ruin
the product I'm we gonna get that off
Google alright so this is the pure
radiance powder this is supposed to be
like a kind of highlight I guess um yeah
it's right there so this is supposed to
be just kind of like a nice highlighting
powder um we'll see how that goes it
looked prettier on the website the color
I don't know we'll see it looks like
it's not super shimmery maybe it'd be
nice just to pop on the cheekbones then
I got two blushes from pure minerals I
got this one which is mineral blush in
Cherry opal it looks like that's kind of
like a deeper color I'm not quite sure
how this is going to work with my skin
tone but we're going to try anyway and
that is a swatch right there kind of a
deep color but I do like it and I love
blushes I love trying new colors out so
why not right and then I got one other
blush and this one is in Polynesian pink
and this one's like really nice too it's
like a peachy color with gold shimmer so
I thought that looked really really
pretty I just want to compare something
really quickly look at like the wet and
wild the amount of products you get
compared to the pure minerals this is
like three dollars and these were like
seven on sale on whole look that's crazy
anyway um okay and then I got this
palette from simply spoiled cosmetics
this is their profession Calot it's huge
I did not expect it was going to be this
big but you get six huge haha pans of
color in here so it smells kind of
chemically
gross but um I won't be smelling it or
eating it or anything for why do I care
let me put it on my face but this is
almost like a contour palette like I'm
what I'm impressed like look at that
that's so dark and it just looks so like
wow like it's impressive I'm really
impressed so um I'm definitely going to
play with that i think i could contour
with like probably back color this one's
gonna look too dark and maybe mix those
two together but this one would be nice
for cancelling out like under the eyes
and they just look so pigmented I'm
really really impressed so I mean what
the heck that thing was only like ten
bucks on there so and goodness you have
enough product to last you a lifetime
literally it should last you a lifetime
seriously um next I ended up picking up
some of this stuff from Nene Anka I'm
sorry Nia nika Mia mica I'm not quite
sure how you pronounce it but um I was
looking at this right before i took my
spring break trip and i thought these
were going to be here before then they
didn't end up showing up until a couple
of days ago so i didn't have time to
bring the stuff on that particular trip
but for my next trip i'm definitely
gonna pack this stuff this is a jeweler
jewelry portfolio and organizer so it
holds all your jewelry when you travel
and i've noticed something like this is
going to be really helpful because when
i travel with my jewelry like as stuff
gets all over the place and it's just
like a mass but what i liked about this
the most was that it had this little
section here where you can actually hang
earrings and I think that's so helpful
because my earrings always get tangled
up when I travel with them and sometimes
I don't even pack your incal I'm like I
know they're going to get tangled what's
the point so that's like really nice
jewelry organizer to travel with I also
got the clear for takeoffs clear
security bag it meets the carrion
regulations of traveling this one is um
cute like polka dots public baths and
stripes so you get tons of little stuff
in there perfect for eye cream space
spray you know shampoo conditioner
whatever you want to use and then i also
got one just like that
this one is clear so and this one also
has two little spray bottles and then I
also got this good hair day um hair iron
case and Matt so this is what you put
like if you're traveling you put your
straightener in here and then this is
like heat protected so you can lay it on
there and it won't like burn anything so
i thought i was going to keep two so
these were all really cheap and cheerful
work on hautelook and yeah so that was
my little haul I hope you guys enjoyed
this drugstore and Holt look hall if you
did give this video thumbs up and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
