today I'm doing a haul for you guys I am
combining three different stores I'm
doing back and body works which is this
big white box right here drugstore com
and also face a TA so I'm going to start
with face atelier because they only
purchased one thing and this is the face
atelier ultra foundation and this is in
the color let me get it out for you guys
this is in the color ultra foundation 0
minus and it's just too plain white
foundation and the reason I got this is
because lately I have picked up a lot of
foundations that have just been too dark
on my skin and the best thing you can do
when it comes to that situation even if
it is like the lightest shade in that
range sometimes the best thing you can
do is just get yourself a white
foundation mixer and mix until you find
your skin tone so that's just what I'm
going to be doing I do have one from
Illamasqua on their rich liquid
foundation in the color are f-105 but
honestly I think this one is a bit of a
thinner formula the illamasqua one is
very very sick and I don't like that so
um I mean I like it but only for certain
certain occasions so anyway I picked
that up next to drugstore com I just
ordered a few things the first thing i
got was this Rimmel glam eyes mascara I
remember using this a few years ago and
absolutely loving it so I thought I'd
pick it up again I also got this clairol
shine happy natural instincts shiner and
shinier and brightener brighter shinier
and brighter sorry I shinier and
brighter with every use this is a clear
shine treatments I can only find this at
drugstore com or all top so happy about
that Lily what are you doing my cat is
getting up to some naughty things so um
next I got this wet and wild mega ice
cream eyeliner in black I love this
cream eyeliner I have gone through a
whole thing of that before so excited
about that the next thing I got is the
biore free your pores 14 combo deep
cleansing pore strips so you have some
for your forehead and some for your nose
you look like that
really like those ones that have the
combo packs that um you know can do the
forehead and chin and the nose next I
got the physicians formula I booster
two-in-one lash boosting eyeliner it
says it's a precise brush tip applicator
and this is in ultra black tie you to
try that out next I got the Revlon
age-defying wrinkle remedy line filler
looks like that I also got the NYX
eyeshadow base in whites I just wanted
to try this out again I use this a
couple years ago i actually used up a
whole thing i thought it'd be nice to
use it reminds me of the milk jumbo
pencil but i'm not as slippery so
thought i'd try it out again next I got
the wet and wild um wet and wild fergie
I think this is the forget collection
right and it's in Sugar Plum Fairy 908 C
it's just a really nice deep color I
like that so that was from drugstore com
and now let's grab this big box over
here this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works the
reason I'm combining the three of these
is because I didn't get a lot from each
store so I just thought this made more
sense if that makes sense okay good i
got three of these plugins wallflower
plugins um they're just black plastic
but they're cute I feel like black goes
with anything so you know i also got two
more of the wealth or plugins these are
from my bedroom but these are a little
prettier they're kind of like gold and
silver thought those were cute and then
I got a wallflower spiced apple toddy
plug-in set this is a really really
great scent I love it um then I got two
of the cinnamon sugar doughnut
Wallflower plugins it's one of my
favorite senses they come out this time
of year with then I got a lemon plugin
for my kitchen and a pineapple mango for
my bedroom
um and i also got 33 wit candles in warm
vanilla sugar like i said i love this
scent this time of year it's one of
those sense that's like um if you have
gone through all the Christmas descends
this is just like one of those that's
left that just smells like amazing and
it's really good for I feel like the
month of februari and marsh just like
working your way into the spring months
so love those and I also got a coupon

you want to go on to the actual website
