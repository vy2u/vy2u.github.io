you guys I picked up some things online
I wanted to share what I got with you
guys um I picked up some things from
Sephora calm and also lime crime yes
lime crime please don't you know get
angry at me for shopping there I did not
have any issues i know that there have
been a lot of controversy about lime
crime lately but i really wanted to try
out some of their velveteen lipsticks so
i will start with my lime crime
purchased um i just got three of The
Velveteen so the first one I got was in
salem which is like a dark brown color
it's really really beautiful and these
are just like extremely highly pigmented
and awesome so salem looks like that I
just thought it would be fun to try this
out I know it looks really dark but I've
seen people post pictures of this and it
just looks so interesting and I don't
know I don't have a lot of love colors
that are that particular shade the next
velveteen lipstick i got is in riot
which is like kind of a like Rosie new
dish color it's really really pretty too
um and it looks like that it's just like
a kind of just like a rosy rosy nude
kind of color I thought it was pretty
really pretty um I feel like lime crime
has these colors that like are very very
different like I can't find cubes for so
that's kind of why I purchased them and
the last one I got is cashmere which is
really really popular and I have no idea
if this is going to look good on me but
I had to get it because everybody talks
about it it looks like that and it's
kind of like a gray with like a pink
undertone that probably sounds really
gross but it's actually really really
beautiful and again it's just so
different looking so those are the three
that I picked up cashmere Salem and riot
I'm really really excited to play with
these and try them out and now let's get
on to the Sephora part of this hall the
first thing I picked up a sephora were
the new I masks so they have those face
masks that you can get the sheet masks
now they came out with I'm ass so I'm so
excited so I picked up three of them I
got the
honey I'm asked which looks like that I
got the Lotus eye mask which looks like
that and I got to be Ling's I Ling's hi
I'm asked so basically all of these do
different things they have different
purposes this one the Ling's I I'm asked
is a what is it for anti-aging and
smoothing the Lotus eye mask the pink
one is from moisturizing and soothing
and the honey one is nourishing and
balancing so those are just really nice
to have the little patches pop them onto
your eyes when you need a little bit of
a boost I like that idea the next thing
I got was this Lancome blush palette I
saw a talkie glam life guru here on
YouTube showing this as one of her
favorite like palettes but like one of
her favorite blushes it's just this
really nice sleep packaging and the
color i got the palette in is called a
blush palette in 323 rose flesh and
these are the colors and i just thought
that blush in there was gorgeous like
it's just it's like everything it's just
got tons of shimmer and it's like so
smooth and creamy really really
beautiful then you get kind of like a
darker like bronzy kind of shade or
almost like you could probably contour
with that because it's got that toe
penis and then a highlight and these
just feel so creamy so really excited i
mostly got it for that blush color but
um I can't wait to play with it I got
those are so pretty i love it love it um
the next thing I picked up was some of
the little yes I got sucked into this I
love my Beauty Blender I have my pink
beauty blender I love it so I thought I
would try out the micro mini Beauty
blenders so basically you get to in this
little pack and these are for like under
eye concealer and like small places like
around your nose I'm gonna use it to
blend in my um sorry i was watching to
my other video no i do not burn myself
um i'm going to use it to apply my
under-eye concealer and you get them wet
and they kind of blow up and you just
had him in under the eyes so thought
those were really cute and yeah I got
suckered into buying that look so the
next thing I got to ease the Sephora
triple actually triple action cleansing
water for face and eyes makeup it be
gone and this is like a micellar kind of
product I have been so into my seller
waters lately for whatever reason but it
says um it says my solo which are small
purifying bubbles effectively capture
impurities and remove makeup no need to
rinse cleanses face and eyes in one
gesture so I don't really use my seller
waters to remove like face makeup or eye
makeup I actually just use them on the
days when I'm in a hurry in the morning
and I need to wash my face and I don't
have time to actually wash my face so
this is easy you just pump it onto a
cotton pad run it all over your face and
voila you have a clean face so I think
that this one will be good I hope so um
I'm excited to try this out and I think
oh I also got another thing this is the
acne clinic acne solutions clinical
clearing gel salicylic acid salicylic
acid acne medication mr. percentage it
doesn't say the percentage of the salsa
acid but I had a sample of this in one
of my little Sephora boxes from last
time and it really burned and it didn't
feel good on my skin but man it cleared
up my pimples that I had from pms stuff
like instantly overnight so I was like
I've got to get my hands on that so I'm
not quite sure what the percentage of
salicylic acid is in here but it says to
apply a thin layer to face twice today
after cleansing I will never wear this
during the day you should not wear any
acne treatment during the day because
you'll get burnt on your face I'll just
do it at night over my night cream or
retinol whatever I'm using or spot apply
using another leave on acne treatment
and so I got the smaller little thing
just to make sure that the sample that I
have used up wasn't like a one-time
thing you know like it was like oh was
so great just that one time and then I
end up hating this so I just got the
little one it's like point five and i
think it was like ten dollars 15 maybe
um so yeah it did burn my face but man
it worked so yeah the rest are all
samples they are very generous with
their samples so far is I got the
veloute tint oil nourishing lip oil in
this from YSL and cheering me cherry my
Chevy II so it looks like that pretty
color and I got la vie a bev from
Lancome this is a perfume sample sounds
good um I think she was like 100 point
perf the Lancome bye yeah bi-facil
double action I makeup remover this one
go yeah so it looks like that just a
little thing of eye makeup remover I
have really good reviews online i was
going to purchase it at some point but
then it had like a 100-point things i'd
like to try it out for us the make up
for ever stepped one skin equalizer base
smoothing primer on this was another
little 100-point perk and then these
actual samples um the lancome ready for
your close-up Visionnaire this is the
corrector advanced skin corrector sample
and then they gave me a whole little
baggie full with samples so nice two of
the benefit Porefessional 'he's not that
i needed i literally have my
professional right there but these are
nice for travel um another one of the
Lancome Visionnaire correctors another
one of the Lancome vision hair
characters get a few uses out that that
will be nice ah let's see here two of
the losi town come plus you precious
cream I think I've tried this once it
was really nice super super thick and
moisturizing and then two of the
immaculate liquid powder foundation
