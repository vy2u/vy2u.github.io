thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having an excellent day um
this is going to be a beauty and bath
and skincare sort of hole I think there
are some bath products in there
somewhere I did some online shopping on
the mac cosmetics website also sephora
calm and ulta com so i'm going to show
you guys what I got I will be posting a
clothing haul right after this video so
if you guys are more interested in that
sort of video you can go check that one
out but for all of you tea lovers this
one will be for you so let's just get
started I'm going to start with what I
got it Mac because they only got two
things and i am going to swatch as much
as i can for you guys so let me roll up
my sleeves so i got two products at mac
and they were basically two products
that I've been wanting for a very long
time the first thing is the naf lip
pencil in whirl this is very very
popular on youtube because of the whole
kylie jenner lip thing and whatnot i
guess she uses the world lip pencil but
i also picked up um the world matte
lipstick I saw emilynoel83 do a I think
she did like haul a couple of weeks ago
and she mentioned this lipstick and I
didn't even know that they had a world
lipstick and I think she said that too
um so anyway it looked really beautiful
when she's watched it so I thought I'd
pick it up so let me show you guys I
haven't even opened it yet so this is
the world lipstick like I said it is a
mat and the color is like this beautiful
reddish sort of brown I know that um
like for Kylie Jenner and things like
that she is much tanner than me so it
probably will look a little more nude on
her but it looks like that on me it is
quite dark but it's beautiful so it's
kind of like a reddish neck lips Oh
smells mac lipsticks smells so good um
it's kind of like a reddish brown color
and I think it's going to be gorgeous
for fall and then I'm going to swatch
the world lip pencil for you guys you
guys can see I'm sure that these two
together will be great so we're really
really excited about these I just heard
really really good things and I think
that just the lip combo together will be
great so that's the lip pencil and that
is the lipstick so I'm super excited I
think these are going to be gorgeous for
you know the fall and whatnot and I want
to say right away I'm sorry again if
there's boxes behind me we are moving
soon into our bigger apartment so that
is why there is all this stuff I
shouldn't say to a new apartment we're
moving up in our apartment to a new
apartment but anyway so um that is the
swatches very very pretty and yeah so
that is what i got from mac um we are
going to move on to sephora com I picked
up the Marc Jacobs modern war o de
perfume spray it looks like this I just
couldn't resist any longer i really
loved this scent I've had samples of it
and I was just like oh it smells so good
I love the scent of gardenia and that is
what is in here or no yeah gardenia so
if you like the smell of gardenia you
will love this perfume because it smells
just like gardenia if you do want to do
for it I actually have a dupe in my
collection for it I know why did I buy
this if I have to do but I'm just a
beauty lover I had to do it so um if you
do want to do for this um Pacifica makes
a perfume spray that is called Tahitian
gardenia which basically smells the
exact same however this one has way
cuter packaging but anyway this is what
it looks like it smells amazing I'm
gonna get myself a little spritz oh it's
just smells so good it is very kind of
flora Lee in summary but I just love it
I think it will be great going into fall
and I just I love it I love the
packaging and love everything about it
it is quite expensive though I think
that was like seventy six dollars and
that's the smaller size that's I think
one fluid ounce they also have 1.7 fluid
ounce oh look at those swatches you guys
that is a beautiful color world is
gorgeous from Mac love that alright
moving on um they had like one of those
point perks the bite Beauty limited
edition I think this is in the color
Bellini this was a 250 points and I
jumped right on it because I love
anything for bite beauty I totally trust
all of their lip products so um this was
like I said a 250 Point perk and the
shade is called Bellini you get this
cute little bite Beauty mirror and then
you get the little mini
so cute bellini lipstick and it is a
gorgeous shade you guys see that I'm
going to do a little swatch of that so
you guys can see but it is like the
perfect hot pink color I just love that
that is gorgeous so you get to be little
lipstick and then you also get one of
their I think fruit glosses oops i just
dropped him on the floor one of the
fruit glasses I think it is um yep lush
fruit lip gloss in the same shade which
is Bellini and this is like oh my god
it's like almost as big as the as the
lipstick but only bite Beauty can do
that so that is the lip gloss and that
is the lipstick they're going to look
gorgeous together I could not pass this
up i was just like forget the makeup
forever whatever 500-point one I want
that play beauty one so that is the lip
colors so got that little set for 250
points another sample i got was the
Lancome navier battle this is a great
fragrance I really really like it and
then I got two samples of the bumble and
bumble surf film wash shampoo and creme
rinse conditioner I just thought these
looked interesting maybe it would be
good for days where I want to like braid
my hair or make my hair kind of wavy
this would help to hold a curl better if
you have flat fine hair like I do you
know the struggle struggle is real
another little 100-point perk or no i'm
sorry this is um one of those like
online special offers if you type in the
code choose oil on sephora.com you can
choose like an oil product this was one
of them this is the YSL a tint oil the
left and it looks interesting this is
what the little applicator looks like um
okay like completely almost completely
sheer but um I don't know i dont i I've
never tried this I don't know the
formula or anything like that I thought
it would be a little more pigmented than
that but I guess it's really just like a
really light wash of color apparently so
I don't know what shade that is but I
picked that up and then the last sample
i got was from the brand nude and this
is the nude omega treatment milk and i
thought that sounded really beautiful
and hydrating and
Polly and it would be nice to put on my
skin so that is what i got from sephora
let's move on to the last box that is
from Ulta and I got a whole bunch of
like miscellaneous stuff here but I
wanted to show you guys right away um
they had this like a little card in here
showing the benefit has the benefit
brand has a new eyelid primer it's
called the BB cream eyelid primer I
think it looks so interesting it's like
very woo that looks kind of pretty now
do you see that color is kind of coming
out from a hand now it like came out
clear but now it's kind of pretty anyway
sorry yeah um do you see this though
this is so interesting so the benefit BB
cream eyelid primer that sounds like
really hydrating and nice so i think i'm
going to go in and maybe pick that up
its $29 it says it hits broad-spectrum
SPF 20 instantly color correct and locks
on I shadow and it said a beauty bonus
visit your nearest benefit brow bar bar
inside ulta to receive a complimentary
Air Patrol make make upper that what's
called makeup work it says plus enjoy
free deluxe mini with your benefit
product purchase so um but I'm
interested in that definitely gonna
check that out um so yeah that they
didn't even give a sample or anything
with it that was just that little card
that really interested me but the first
thing I got from otto was a toner I have
not tried this one but the toner i'm
using right now is running low so i
picked up you know something to have as
a backups or you know the next product
i'm going to be using so this is the
l'oreal hide refresh toner it says it
reflection refreshes reflections it
refreshes in a splash it is alcohol-free
it has beta hydroxy acid that sweeps
away dull tired skin pro-vitamin b5 that
helps protect against moisture loss it
refreshes in the splash at reflections
it refreshes in a flash regular smoother
brighter complexion and leave skin soft
and supple it is ninety-nine percent
alcohol free that's why i was wondering
why it had that little star down there
says alcohol free with a little star you
know kind of like kind of alcohol free
look with that come on Lori oh and then
it says dermatologist tested
and yeah so anyway I thought I'd pick
this up and try it out let's smell it
see what it smells like it smells like I
don't know it's not like a offensive
smell by any means so um kind of looks
like that color the lip clutter can't
stop looking at this now so shiny but
anyway so yeah picked up that tuner the
next thing I picked up was the Garnier
clean plastering cleansing oil for dry
skin I have tried this before I really
really like this I'm running low on my
boccia makeup break up cool cleansing
oil so I thought that I'd give this a go
again because it is cheaper and I think
that cleansing oils are the best way to
remove my makeup personally there's just
no tugging and ripping at my skin and I
find that my skin is way less irritated
when I use cleansing oils to remove my
makeup so anyway pick that up um I also
picked up these kind of random um bikini
zone Medicaid gel this is for after you
shave down there and you know I used to
do waxing I've done at home waxing I've
gone and gotten waxed and now I'm just
into shaving myself hush um so basically
this is a medicated gel that helps stop
any kind of irritation redness and
itching so if you get little bumps down
there like razor burn and I also picked
up the bikinis on anti bumps shave gel
so this is a special shave gel made
exclusively for you downstairs area um I
also picked up another turkey band this
is from Turbie twist these are like
those microfiber headbands I wear these
when I do my makeup I wear them when i
am going into the shower and i'm about
to put my shower cap on and I'm not
washing my hair I use these they're
awesome really really great you can see
they're great for like cleansing your
face you just your hair won't get wet at
all so I love these um and then I picked
up at the Loreal infallible eyeshadow in
892 amber rush I've heard such great
things about the shade and I cannot for
the life of me remember if i have this
shade or not but on i saw a post on
pinterest recently that said this brings
out any eye color so i was like oh well
that would be nice to try out so that's
what it looks like let me do a little
swatch oh god it's so beautiful huh it
is so shiny and
so beautiful Wow so that is the shade it
really is gorgeous I think that will
really bring out hopefully my eye color
so really really looking forward to
using now I really forgot about how
wonderful these shadows are they're so
creamy and like blendable and gorgeous
yeah oh yeah that's gorgeous love it so
picks that up and then um let's see here
i also picked up a Revlon super lustrous
lipstick in 671 mink you guys can tell I
am going for fall lipsticks am I wearing
a sweater today it is 63 degrees no joke
it was 63 degrees here today in
milwaukee wisconsin so fall is here
early and i am all all into it okay i
love it so oh I've been picking up you
know these kind of darker lipstick shade
it's sort of like you know the Macklin
and whatnot um not that I don't love
these over here that was beautiful but
um yeah this looks nice so this isn't
671 mink I love the formula of these
it's like a really really nice deep
brown color I'm going to swatch it like
right over by the macworld so you can
see the macro has a lot more like tow
penis in it that's the mackerel and this
is mink from Revlon so Revlon has more
of a warmer toned whereas a whirl has
more of a cooler tones but still all of
them are gorgeous and they're all going
to give you that kind of um you know 90s
you know 90s clip or 90s s makeup so
again that's macworld and then this is a
Revlon Colorstay in mink so anyway um oh
no sorry I'm going to say that it but no
we have a few little samples here from
auto let's see what thank God it looks
like we have hugo boss which i think is
a men's cologne yes so i would give that
to my boyfriend and then there is a
sample of the pink sugar Oh de toilette
and that just for the ladies Oh for me
and I know what the smell like I think I
need to look at it first to make sure oh
no it is the one yeah
I think this is the one um this is very
very like strong and overpowering I
think I've had quite a few samples of
this before but they really do last all
day the Pink Sugar Ray brothers do so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this hall
although the swatches too and yeah i
will be posting a clothing haul right
after this one so go check that out if
you're interested and i'll see you my
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
