have a haul for you guys i am going to
be hauling from sephora and also from
makeup geek which I'm super-excited
about this is my first makeup geek box
ever or package from them so the person
who inspired me to go and get some was
mama loves mascara here on youtube i
will link her channel below um she like
every time i watch a video from her like
after her color pop hall or after her um
her hall on makeup geek products i knew
i had to go on purchase so I'm really
happy I did I think they look really
gorgeous all of the things that I
purchased and yeah so let's start with
makeup geek um I still have the receipt
for this so I'll show you guys what I
got I ended up spending 120 nine dollars
and fifty five cents and um I purchased
let's just start out these come with
with v palettes by the way they're
little madness i purchased two of the
large Z palette um they're just two
black ones like this and the reason I
did that was because I knew I was
getting blushes and Tom blushes and
eyeshadows so let's get started with
this one first this is the eyeshadows
and I got four of their regular eye
shadows and then four of the foiled I
shadows so I'll show you guys what I got
here are the colors I thought this was a
good way to try out the brand just see
if I like them so the first one right
here is called beaches and cream it's
that nice kind of creamy peach color the
black one is called correct um the one
next to it right there is called
pretentious and then the mob one is
called unexpected so those are the ones
on the top and those are just their
basic eyeshadows and I believe those are
like five dollars or 599 apiece actually
let's look at this they are 599 a piece
yes now the ones on the bottom are the
foiled I've shadows and those are 999
apiece so let's start over here this one
is called mesmerised really pretty the
kind of kiel one is called who
DD the next one is called grandstand and
then we have flamethrower so those are
them up close I haven't even swatched
these yet but honestly I'm not going to
do that until I do my review so until I
start actually using them but I thought
all of them are really really gorgeous
and I cannot wait to try these out next
I got four of the blushes also in one of
the big c palettes they look like this
gorgeous I'll start with this little
light pink one over here this is called
first love that darker pink right here
is called rendus Wren divis rendus but I
can never say that word whatever i'm
sure you guys understand hahaha next one
is called secret admirer and the last
one is called spellbound so really
really gorgeous again I will definitely
review these I cannot wait to play with
these so that is what I got from a
makeup geek and then I'll show you guys
what I got from Sephora really quickly I
got the kat von d luck at a tube
foundation in 42 light this color was
like sold out for a while like I mean it
wasn't sold out i think that they
stopped like producing it for a while
this is like the lightest of the
lightest one that they have i actually
have three of these now including this
one I have light 42 light 45 and then I
think 46 so this one hopefully will be
lighter than the others the other ones
are too dark on my skin I usually use
them just for what I want to do like a
cream contour or something like that so
hopefully these ones will work out or
this one girl the late what are you
doing no do not eat this don't eat those
next I got the I guess I'll go with this
first beauty blender I needed a new one
oh my god dirty and gross I also got the
I think there's a 100-point perk
philosophy amazing grace firming body
emulsion looks kind of nice I also got
the no reason to hide philosophy multi
imperfection transforming syrah lots of
nuclear
to try out I'm excited and the dr jart
derma clear micro water and i also got a
misty or blooming bouquet sample a
product candy sample and the algenis
genius ultimate anti-aging eye cream
sample so that was my little haul I hope
you guys enjoyed this I will of course
be doing swatches and a review on those
beautiful beautiful makeup geek blushes
and eyeshadows I just have to start
using them and I can't wait to dip my
fingers in there and starts watching
them before that video huh so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this I'll see you
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
