video I'm going to be sharing with you
guys a halt I ordered some things from
Sephora calm and also a boat look so I'm
just going to show you guys what I got
let's start with visa for a box so the
first thing I picked up from Sephora is
the peter thomas roth clinical skincare
rose stem cell bio repaired gel mask it
looks like this and i saw emilynoel83
the other day talking about this on her
channel and i was like oh my gosh i
remember i used to have that product i
would say it was probably last year at
this time during the summer um I got a
trio with the cucumber mask the pumpkin
enzyme mask and this one and this one
was my favorite out of all three and
unfortunately I dropped it on the floor
and it shattered it's not actually glass
container but it's plastic but it still
broke open and all of the goodness came
out it was all over and I was just such
a mess I could not clean it up I ended
up having to throw away so I'm really
really happy i decided to pick this up
again she was talking raving about him I
was like I remember I loved that mass so
I went ahead and ordered this and like I
said it's the gross stem cell by repair
gel mask it's really really pretty like
um thick creamy pink gel as you guys can
see it has this really interesting
texture it smells really good as smells
like roses and I would say roses and
like herbs mixed together it smells
really really good and it's just so nice
on the skin it just feels so luxurious
and great and you can even pop this in
the fridge and pop it on your face and
that will feel really good because it's
all gel and I just think it's the
perfect time of year to have this kind
of mass so that is the first thing I got
to be second thing i got was the dolce
and gabbana light blue Oh de toilette
spray in 1.6 fluid ounces everybody
raves about this and I did try it on on
the back of my wrist at sephora and i
absolutely adored the scent so i thought
i'd get it so i picked that up i also
got this little duo of the benefit
realty's it looks like this and in here
you get a little tiny travel size of the
they're real mascara which is one of my
favorites and they also get the
benefit push-up liner which I could
never tried before so I thought I'd try
that little kit out because I really
want to try that liner I also picked up
this little for shadow and liner palette
from Sephora this was in the sale
section it's being not that shy number
14 and it just has some really really
pretty shades in there they just kind of
like spoke to me and I just really
really like that green shade I've been
really into greens lately so I thought
this was really really nice and have to
try that out I also picked up another
one in the sale section this is the
Sephora colorful 5 mild to wild in khaki
and it comes with a little brush I don't
know about that but the colors are just
gorgeous and I absolutely love that dark
green color with the gold sparkles so
really really pretty kind of jungle
green colors next I got these Sephora
jelly masks and moisturizing and energy
six mono doses it's a vitamin cocktail
so you get six different little pouches
and they're basically just jelly masks
that are filled up in this little like
air bubble and they're just like
separate uses so if you're traveling
take like one or two of these they're
really small you don't have to bring
like a whole big jar of masks with you
you guys know I love masks so I just
thought I have to try these out these
aren't you from Sephora so I just
thought those would be fun it does say
that they really intensely moisturize
the skin they tone and energize they
leave a luminous effect and a
brightening effect so I thought those
would be nice it does say to just apply
it to your face and then wipe off with a
cotton ball so it's one of those really
quick maps you don't have to wash off
and next I picked up two of the Sephora
cream lip stains I've never tried these
out and I saw two in the store that I
really liked and they happen to be the
ones that are constantly sold out and
they just have the two that we're like
on display and so I went online and got
these ones but the shades are African
violet which is this really really
beautiful color right here and
so polished purple I guess they are sold
out in these two shades particularly
quite often however if you go online you
can probably find them then I just have
some samples on they were having like
little was it their weekly special thing
was all about perfume so I did get a
little mini of the dolce gabbana light
blue I just thought the bottle was so so
cute and I also got the YSL black opium
and i thought this bottle was really
cute too haven't smelled that but i'm
sure it's good and then also i'm just
random samples toka or taco the Margaux
perfumed looks like that got two of
those two of those and also the Khloe of
de perfume got one of those and then
buxom had the show some skin weightless
foundation light to medium coverage
foundation samples and honestly on the
website llegando support website they
never have my shades so I never pick
foundation samples however this one had
ivory and fair shades so I thought that
this would work so i can try that out so
I'm excited to that and then the last
two samples I got word the tart guard
which is the new tart sunscreen that
they basically came out with so excited
to try that as well so that's what I got
from Sephora let's move on to hope look
um the first thing I picked up they had
this like French brand on there that was
all about skincare and masks all
different sorts of math with you guys
will see in this video so I got really
excited I love again skincare and masks
so I tried out you know everything was
like two or three dollars so i was like
oh what the heck on guys we'll just try
a bunch of different stuff so the first
thing i got were the makeup remover
wipes with cucumber and a low then I got
to the forever luminous decollete mask
so this is like a mass that you put on
your chest I know that sounds silly but
you know when you're doing anti-aging
kind of stuff and whatnot I mean you
always should practice that kind of
stuff I'm just 21 years old but still I
like to practice anti-aging things the
chest of the neck are usually the first
area that kind of gives away your age if
you've taken good care
the skin on your face it's usually the
neck that gives your age away so good to
kind of take care of it once in a while
so these are chest masks and this has
papaya aloe and vitamin C in it I also
got to the neck masks which have a pearl
and coq10 then i also just thought well
what the heck i have to get the lip mask
instead i thought our so cool these are
like hydrogel lip masks and they look
like this and you take them out of the
packaging and they're shaped like little
lips and you actually just put them on
your lips and I was like I'm totally
into that I gotta try it so anyway going
to try those out um and then I also got
the refreshing under I strips these are
just like a little sheet masks for under
your eyes in cucumber and lemon and this
is supposed to be very anti aging and
brightening so that's for the good I got
to one of the face wraps which is just a
sheet mask and cucumber and a low and
also in avocado and vitamin E and i also
got hand Bob's with cocoa butter and
vitamin E and i also got one ones for
feet and actually my mom is visiting me
currently and she used her feet once
today the each one's the flipped one was
today so she used them she really really
liked them you guys will be seeing that
in my empties video and let's move on to
some other stuff josie maran was
recently on hautelook and i kind of went
a little crazy and bought some stuff i
probably didn't need I got the josie
maran be renewed whipped argan oil ultra
hydrating body butter with honeysuckle
and white tee and like i said i have so
many body butters that i really didn't
need this so i am giving this to my mom
another body butter i'm also giving her
ass beat josie maran model citizen
whipped argan oil butter limited edition
african red Rubio's Rubio's sent I'm
also giving her this one I really love
the way those body butters work like i
said i have so many right now in like my
stash that I really just don't need to
have them right now so I gave both of
those to her another thing that I also
gave to her I got this little trio of
the Arcan bombs I have no idea this was
going to be so big so basically these
are just nourishing foams that you can
put all over your body
um and yeah I dip my finger in there
pretty um basically you can just use it
all over your bother to soothe and calm
rough patches soften lips or even to
tame frizzy flyaway hair so it's like an
all-in-one kind of product so um I had
no idea this was going to be so big I
thought these were like lip balm sizes
so I'm going to give her the big one
which is unscented which she likes and
I'm going to keep the two tiny ones
probably use them as lip balms I have
the sweet citrus scent which is really
really nice and also my favorite scent
which is the vanilla apricot I love her
vanilla apricot sent in general from
that line is just so so good another
thing that was on there was the josie
maran argan aluminized which looks like
this and this has been recently
discontinued because they started like a
whole new packaging kind of scheme going
on so everybody raves about this one and
again it's like the old one but it was
like eight dollars on there so I
definitely had to pick that up and then
I picked up three of these like body
miss um and these are from I polo nyali
seductive elixirs they're called um this
one is mysterious rose i also got
playful lychee and the last 1i got to a
sexy vanilla so these are basically just
like body sprays so anyway that is what
i got from sephora and outlook i hope
you guys enjoyed this hall if you did
please give this video a thumbs up and
I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
