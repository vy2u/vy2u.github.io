of a haul for you guys I went to target
and I also went to runs no bowl I want
to show you guys a few things I got now
especially one thing in particular that
is kind of makeup related or beauty guru
related so anyway let's just start I'll
start with target because this is all
beauty products the first thing I picked
up or two mascaras the first one is from
Maybelline this is the falsies volume
Express it is in 280 blackest black I
love this master I've gone through quite
a few of these and I thought I'd just
pick up another one because i haven't
used it in a while the other mascara i
got was covergirl clump crusher in 800
very black this is amazing amazing one
if you want really nice precise lashes
and no clumps again haven't tried that
in a while so thought i'd go back and
get another one the next thing i got was
the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
concealer um this says its oil free its
shades 105 and 110 so it looks pretty
fair and I'm excited to try that I do
like the foundation the matching
foundation that comes with this so I'm
excited to try this next I got two of
the elf studio tone correcting powders
in cool these are my favorite setting
powders for my foundation of all time I
don't like the warm ones I only like the
cool ones i don't use any other powder
from any other brand to set my
foundation except for this so had to get
two of those those are only three
dollars a piece which is awesome next I
got two lipsticks from Maybelline the
first one is one of their new ones which
is the mat collection and this is in
touch of spice 660 it's this gorgeous
gorgeous mauve color and I am actually
wearing it right now I put it on on the
way home in the car in the little mirror
and I love it it's like this nice deep
mob kind of spicy looking color and
people are really raving about this
right now and I think it's gorgeous so
the next one I got was 420 deepest
cherry again from Maybelline really
really deep and dark I hope that I can
share this out hopefully it won't look
that opaque but I can play around with
it and figure something out for that the
next thing I got was the l'oreal visible
lift serum absolute
this makeup in 145 classic ivory love
this makeup I really love L'Oreal
visible lift line for my foundation I
really noticed that other foundations I
just don't like as much so that's like
my go-to line however I did pick up
another L'Oreal foundation I did I pick
up their infallible Pro matte 24 hour
foundation it says the finishes demek
Demi Matt it wears up to 24 hours the
coverages medium and the textures ear
light so we'll see about that there's
like a matching setting spray that comes
with this I didn't pick that up because
i recently picked up an urban decay one
but i would love to try that out i think
that's awesome that the drug stores
during to come out with um makeup
setting sprays the next thing i got was
the aimer smart shade CC luminous primer
it says this is a complexion correcting
primer it just has this really nice like
pinky iridescence to it and i'm kind of
back into the hang of using primers i go
on and off between liking primers and
not liking primers using them not using
them and right now i'm liking them the
next thing I got or the last thing I got
yes from target is the Maybelline
instant age rewind eraser for dark
circles this is the brightener in 160 it
has like a pinkish undertone and i love
this i have used many many of those and
i just love the color i love how it
hides any um you know it really does
brighten and it really does conceal my
dark circles so yes i went to barnes
noble and i'm just going to show you
guys the first thing I wanted to show
you was kind of related to like beauty
channel things I got this book this is
the Michelle Phan makeup book and I
didn't know that she had come out with a
book so I thought that was kind of cool
I'm a big fan of Michelle Phan I think
she's wonderful she really made a name
for herself and um yeah I just think
that's awesome I think that's really
great when people do that so this is the
book it was $23 and it's like nice like
really really hard cover and it's like
500 pages so I'm excited to go through
this and yeah so that's the first 1i got
the second flip a dot um if people are
interested in this this is called
organized now think and live clutter
free I'm really into organizational
things and just organizing in general so
I thought this would be really really
fun to go through
and it's really really cute little book
and yeah I thought this would be really
nice and this was eighteen ninety-nine
see here the next thing I got oh this is
just funny get this wasn't like the
fifty percent off bin and this is how to
tell if your cat is plotting to kill you
I have two cats I love cats and I think
that they're sometimes just really evil
but in a cute way so I thought this
would be really fun to go through and
just laugh about it is the new york
times bestseller so you know it's gonna
be funny um the next book I got was
delirium this is the new york times
bestseller and i think i heard all that
glitters talk about this on her channel
on her glitter literature channel or
something like that um I really i love
reading too so i thought that you know
she really highly recommended this and i
thought i'd pick it up it's part of a
trilogy so i can read two more books
active asset will go with that um the
next book i got is eating mindfully this
was bargain-priced only seven dollars
and 98 cents but i really want to get
into the hang of eating a little better
from my new year's resolution i tend to
eat like just jumpy food and i just want
to start eating a little more clean and
things like that and i think that that's
important and it's good to be very
healthy so I thought this would be fun
to go through and it says how to end
mindless eating and enjoy a balanced
relationship with food so that sounds
kind of fun and the next thing i got was
just this little notebook it's just at
oracle and it basically just looks like
this i thought it was beautiful and it
just opens up and you can just it's like
a notepad I like to have things like
this in my purse so I'm going to keep
that in there and then I got a little
thing of cards and I really liked this
paper and how it was packaged so you
have the envelopes there and then the
actual cards are here are those are the
envelopes in that regard i'm sorry but i
just thought these were just so cute and
i love the design on the front i think
those are just really really sweet and
um I don't know what kinda reminded me
of the little notepad to which i think
is so beautiful so anyway that was my
hall from barnes &amp;amp; noble and at target i
hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
