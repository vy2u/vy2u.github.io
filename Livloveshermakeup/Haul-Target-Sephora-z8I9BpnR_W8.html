hair my hair has been all over the place
today um it's just it's a hot mess it's
super super hot here today in New York
City for whatever reason it's just it's
been crazy warm and I feel like I'm oily
and my hair is all over the place it's
just doing it something so we're just
gonna let it be during this hall so
anyway I have another haul for you guys
tonight this time it is going to be from
target and sephora i went on to their
online websites and purchased some
things so let's just get started i'm
gonna start my target cut the little box
right here so the first two things i
picked up our hair color Oh shocking so
I'm gonna play with some hair color I'm
not quite sure this one is from Revlon
it's the dark ash blonde color silk it
looks like that kind of looks like my
color right now let's be completely
honest haha yeah it kind of looks like
the color I have right now like
literally the color of my hair at this
very second but um we're going to see
what will play with a little bit and
then I got this other one that's from
Clairol expert and this is in limit of
that light blonde number 9 so this one's
a lot blonder maybe I'll mix the two up
do something I'm not quite sure what did
or something else so anyway I picked
those two up I also picked up a triple
shine nail polish from sally hansen in
hype nautical yeah hype nautical 370 and
it looks like that it's like this
gorgeous gorgeous teal color with tons
and tons of shimmer love it and i also
picked up a sally hansen hard as nails
xtreme where and this one is in pink
satin been really into like this like
glossy going to finish so i think this
will achieve that kind of like the one
I'm wearing right now for wet while I
love it so I also picked up another nail
polish from sally hansen hard as nails
xtreme we're in monarchy it's kind of
like pacific blue or blue pacific or
whatever except to have a little bit of
a sheen in it and really into that scene
on my nails for whatever reason i picked
up some good e26 piece and 50 piece
bobby pins in blonde
this is the big ones and here are the
little ones with okies oh sorry I didn't
know they even had a tiny little ones
like that so excited to try those next I
picked up some things that I heard
emilynoel83 here on YouTube talking
about and I was my girl I love her I
listened to everything she says so I
knew I had to pick up with you these
brushes she had recommended the up and
up brushes from target so i picked up
the kabuki brush which looks like that
let's take it out to go look at it o.o
cyclery down there so it feels really
really soft it feels a lot like the elf
or maybe even softer so excited to try
that she also recommended the blush
brush and i believe the powder brush set
this to volvo of course this is the
blush brush looks really nice and again
is very very soft and these are really
well priced like under ten dollars each
and this one is the powder brush and
this one is really nice too so I really
like that she also recommended like a
foundation one or something that was
like a bookie something but um target
com only had that in store so they were
like no you have to purchase it in store
you can't buy that bike and the last two
things I got from the online website
word the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towelettes like this these
were like 24 10 on there I think and
then I got to the makeup remover country
toilets and hydrating as well so those
will be fun to go through let's move on
to the Sephora box because they did get
a bunch of goodies from there the first
thing I picked up um was the two-faced
hangover RX coconut water electrolytes
probiotics ok RX that says that
replenishing face primer from Too Faced
you guys know I love to face and I've
heard so much about this primer and it's
been out for a while it's nothing new
but um I just heard so much about it and
I thought like coconut water something
really nice to put on my skin during the
summer so I picked that up um it's like
a pump which is really nice I really
like that so we just pump it out put it
on your face and you're good to go so
picked up that primer I also picked up
the two-faced
sweethearts perfect flush blush in
there's something about Barry and these
are not you either but I've been eyeing
them forever and I just thought you know
what I might as well get I already know
what it looks like everybody talks about
it really cute packaging and this is the
shade it's my beautiful I really really
like that I don't know why I smelled it
doesn't smell like anything but anyway
so yeah those were two products from to
face that like I've been eyeing for like
a year now and I just thought I might as
well get mine is well girl you might as
well I already wasting your money on so
much makeup anyway right okay next I got
the josie maran coconut water color
cheek jalay in pink escape and they had
an option where you could get the
smaller one so i got the smaller one for
fourteen dollars to try i think the full
sizes like 28 but i got the smaller one
just to try to see if I like the formula
I actually didn't want this particular
color and I did swatch it and it does
look actually prettier than I thought it
would it's not that deep but um I like
the formula so I think I will go and
pick up the actual shade that I wanted
which was like a really bright orange
Coral so um yeah got that then I got two
of the NARS illuminators um I don't have
any of these and people talk about them
a lot and they just look like they're
really nice and light and pretty so I
picked the one up in Copacabana which is
like a vanilla II kind of pinky color it
looks like that really really pretty and
i also picked up super orgasm which is
like a bronzy with like pink other times
i would say so that one looks like that
and i think that's so beautiful ah like
giving me life and the last thing I
picked up from Sephora was become skinny
bird and it says our weight loss program
now you just want to put it out there
I'm not by any means trying to lose
weight however I have found lately I'm
graduating soon from college
I have found um right now particularly a
little stressed out and what happens to
me when I get stressed out is I like
stress eat and I just wanted something
that would help me from stress eating
and like shoving everything that's bad
for me into my mouth so I thought I'd
pick these up because it says it helps
with stress eating so it's not like I'm
trying to lose weight I just want to
make sure that i'm not putting horrible
trap into my body so this is the hum
beauty starts from within skinny bird it
has a car caralluma fimbriata 5-htp
chromium and green tea leaf extracts and
it says yeah 5-htp metabolism booth
green tea extract appetite so basically
it just helps control and also helps
control blood sugar so I mean like I
said not trying to lose weight but um I
think it would be nice because I know
that by the time like finals come around
with me and things like that i'm going
to be stress eating like crazy like
crazy just taking it all in so um I
thought that these would be good around
that time and even maybe like around the
time where it's that time of the month
or you're pmsing these would be good so
anyway it says I'm skinny bird has been
formulated to help keep unwanted pounds
and check our unique smac formula have
been designed to reduce stress eating
boost metabolism help curb appetite and
control blood sugar so I thought this
was a healthy way of just watching you
know what I eat I'll show you guys what
samples i got i got the shadow of dior
perfume sample I got the Daisy Marc
Jacobs perfume sample and I also got the
desi Marc Jacobs so fresh and then i
also got oh they always give me extras
do you better get that like with the
support boxes they always give you extra
samples i don't know why i love it um
the Daisy Markakis looks like I got two
of those and then they also gave me the
Olay henriksen sheer transformation
oil-free perfecting cream and a religion
broglio don't despair repair deep
conditioning mask
so I'm just like to try all these new
products out and yeah I hope you guys
