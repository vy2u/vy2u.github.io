for you guys it's a collective haul i
did some online shopping at a few
different places and i thought i'd share
what I got with you guys so the first
thing I went on to tart calm they were
having a twenty percent off sale on
their whole entire website last week so
I went on and purchased um this oh I
don't even know what this is called
doesn't even say on it but this was one
of the holiday kits um that tart came
out with from this year and it looks
like a little like bookcase or something
like that and oh my gosh what is the
name of this it didn't even say on the
receipts because it was like in the sale
section and I don't even think that they
sell it now I mean it was just one of
those things where it was like sixty
dollars and then I got twenty percent
off so with shipping this was like fifty
or sixty dollars I thought it was a
really good deal so i'll just show you
guys what's on the inside um the first
thing you get is this little turquoise
box and it opens up yet you get 2 full
sizes of the tarte amazonian clay
blushes a lipsurgence lip gloss in two
of the lipsurgence lip cremes so it
looks like that really really beautiful
and i'll let you guys know if I can get
this out what the names are so the tarte
lipsurgence is in wonder rare and then
the lipsurgence is just the lip gloss
and then the Blessed shades are in I
guess I'm just reading the back savored
and pampered so savor it is on the top
and pampered is on the bottom let me
show you guys what they look like have
they're really really beautiful shades
and I do love that you get full size so
this is savored and this is hampered the
lake which is a beautiful beautiful
peachy color so I'm really really
excited to play with that little side of
the palette it's like already worth it
to get like full-size it in just this
one box it's already like fifty dollars
so it was worth it definitely this whole
kit was so the second little box you get
looks like this
this was kind of their holiday packaging
they did this year you probably
recognize it from like this you know
just that cute little adder a nut tart
did this year so in this one you get two
little eye palettes and i will show you
guys what those look like the little
purple one opens up and has these colors
and the second palette the little
turquoise one opens up and has these
colors sorry if you guys can hear the TV
on in the background tape a friend here
and he's watching CNN listen to the news
um and then this is the last little box
you get in the sets and it opens up and
you get to full sizes of the lights
camera lashes and three eyeliners so I
think this was a really really good deal
again i got it for like 50 bucks because
they had that twenty percent off and i
just thought it was great so that's what
i ordered from turn i also got a little
sample of the tart high-performance
naturals Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation with frogs spective
broad-spectrum SPF 15 they have the
shades fairlight honey light neutral
light medium sand and medium honey so
hopefully fear lice honey we'll match
and i can try this out because i have
been interested in this foundation so
that is what i got from tarte let's move
on i went on to milan ease website and
there was a reason for it um when I was
visiting um in Minnesota over the
holidays my family I picked up one of
these blushes they are the powder
blushes the rose powder blushes and this
one is in Coral Cove and I had this
color and I had picked it up and I
absolutely loved it and it dropped on
the floor and it shattered and I tried
putting it back together and it didn't
work so i went back on to the Milani
website i think that these are limited
editions so i went back on and i ordered
this one again which is coral cove but i
also ordered two of the other ones
because they are limited edition i
thought you
what I better just get all the colors or
as many as I could get these were the
ones they had on the website this one is
romantic rose really really beautiful
and the last one I picked up was tea
rose so really really really excited to
play with those they are just so
pigmented and buttery and easy to use um
the next thing I got a few things from
hautelook and they were all from the
bomb the brand the bomb so i will show
you guys what I thought the bomb
cosmetics is on there sometimes like
maybe once a month it is on hautelook so
sorry I just like stuttered and drop
something but um I was excited to see it
on there so the first thing i got was
the pudding lid on it eyeliner primer I
line up ty just the eyeliner primer
eyelid primer it looks like that and it
just opens up I love the packaging from
the calm and it looks like that and this
was like you know I think all the
websites like 19 this was like nine
dollars so I was like oh what the heck I
might as well I've just been trying a
lot of different eye primers lately and
yeah next I got the cindy lou manizer
betty lou manizer and very lou manizer
and i kind of have a little story behind
these i absolutely love the mary-lou
manizer and I had this and kind of like
what happened with my Milani blush the
packaging just was like week and it
dropped on the floor and I opened it up
and it was just shattered I tried
putting back together and was just too
soft i couldn't do it so I repurchased
this one this is the mary lou and this
is a highlighter and it's definitely
like a golden undertone highlight it
looks like that it's gorgeous it's
beautiful on any skin tone I highly
highly recommend it um and then I have
never tried the betty lou manizer but I
picked that one up but this is more of
like bronzed highlighter so i'm guessing
the formula is the same super cute
packaging and it's just this really deep
bronzy highlight color and then the last
one is their newer one this is the cindy
lou manizer which is more like a pinky
the highlight so this one looks like
this super cute it's kind of like a
peachy pinky highlight so really really
excited to play with those they were all
like nine or ten dollars which is a
great deal so and the last thing i got
was the how about them apples cheek and
lip cream palette again super cute
packaging and i think i heard
emilynoel83 talk about this on her
channel and it just looked so like
tempting it comes with this big big
mirror and then you get these lip and
cream colors I love little men on the
side so I'm excited to play with that um
and you know you guys will probably be
seen that and get ready with me or
something like that so that is exciting
and the last place are sorry another
place I ordered from was amazon I just
got this derma roller this is a 540
microneedles roller it's a professional
skin treatment I've heard a lot about
this and this was only like twenty
dollars i thought i'd try it it's
supposed to be really really good for
like pitted acne scars just acne scars
in general wrinkles things like that so
um yeah it says to thoroughly cleanse
can twist from all traces of makeup pat
dry with it out for best results that is
recommend to use the Austral role of the
topical application of a hydrating serum
so interesting so you're supposed to go
down the face um and across and then do
it like diagonally too so I don't know
we'll see how that goes I got the little
truffle color and I decide to use this I
don't think it's going to hurt I've had
like a micro needling treatment before
an actual spot and that actually did not
hurt at all so I can't imagine that this
would it's only one point Oh mm so yep
that's what it looks like so I'll keep
you guys updated on that if it helps
with any acne scars and things like that
cute little case too and the last
website I ordered from it was a Walmart
and the first thing i got was this hard
candy glow all the way infused with
24-karat gold doll flick doll face face
and body lou manizer L is for living
always talks about this on her channel
she talks about mixing it with I think
her foundation or you can also just use
it as like a normal highlight but I
thought it looked pretty and it was very
very cheap for this big big thing so I'm
going to try it out i also got two of
the Maybelline Color molten I shadow
doubles duo's whatever this one is in oh
oh man I took the name offshoot should
shoot shoot ok well the duo looks like
this it's like a dark kind of plummy
color and eat gold color and I like the
texture of these they feel really really
cool and then I also got to kind of a
pink and dark plum color so love those
duos so far I get my fingers in them
next I gots the hard candy camouflage
heavy duty concealer again this was a
recommendation from Ella's for living
she talks about this all the time it's
her favorite under-eye concealer so that
I tried out and also came with this
little pencil but this one like i
swatched it this is super orange but
this one matches so i don't know what's
going on there but it was free you know
this little part was so who knows if
i'll use that but this seems really nice
it has a very creamy texture and i'm
excited to use it i also got a hard
candy gloss aholic holographic 3d lip
gloss it's really cool it's called over
the rainbow and it's just got pinks and
you know all the colors of the rainbow
basically in it so kind of just reflects
off your lips and I also got a Revlon
creme lipstick in chocolicious it's just
this really nice deep brown color I saw
someone I'm makeup social wearing us the
other day and I was like I have to get
it so that's why I ordered it and i also
got um 245 smoky rose this is just a
beautiful kind of basic neutral
color next I got the l'oreal true match
um cram corrector in fair / light and
one two three I've used this before it
was really really creamy and easy to
highlight with so i thought i'd try it
again think i had a different shade
before so hopefully that won't be a
little more highlighting um next I got
to the Maybelline master conceal
camouflage and concealer mine is in the
color 10 fair and then I also got to the
maybelline fit fit me concealer in 15
fair so yeah that was my whole I hope
