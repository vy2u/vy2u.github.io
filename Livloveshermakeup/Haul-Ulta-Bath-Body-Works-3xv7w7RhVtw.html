thank you for joining the first of all I
just want to before I start this call
talk about the change of background I am
now in Milwaukee with my boyfriend we
are staying in his apartment until we
get a bigger apartment if you guys have
watched any of my previous videos I
probably mentioned the past month or so
that I am moving in with him and we are
getting a larger apartment soon however
it's not available yet so we are staying
in his apartment for now so this is
going to be probably my setting for the
next you know couple of months
definitely for my videos um I know that
the past you know probably months and a
half have been a little weird because
I've been changing my background a lot i
was up at my parents cabin um and you
know before that i was obviously in
manhattan in my bedroom it was easier to
film there but now i am milwaukee so
anyway um that is what the change of
background is um it will be like this
for probably the next three months
before we get our bigger place and then
I will have a nice room where I can do
everything and set everything up the way
I want it to and what not so anyway just
bear with me when it comes to the
background but anyway I'm today I'm
doing a haul for you guys yesterday my
boyfriend and I were walking around and
we hit up ulta and also back in body
works so let's just get started I'm
going to start with what I got it ulta
so the first thing I picked up um I've
been wanting to try this forever I've
seen this on pinterest a million times
this is the philosophy pink frosted
animal cracker shampoo shower gel and
bubble bath it looks like this and it
smells so good it smells like pink
frosting I'm and if you guys know
exactly what like the actual little
cookie is that they're talking about or
the little cracker that they're talking
about they're like those animal crackers
that have the pink frosting and the
little sprinkles on them they're so so
good i love them i love eating them and
i just thought that the sense of this
was amazing so i picked this up and i
don't know if i'll use it as a shampoo i
may try it as a bubble bath but mostly
I'm just going to use it as a shower gel
and
and the price on that I have my receipt
I know you guys always ask what is the
pricing of everything so the price on
that with eighteen dollars and you do
get 480ml or 16 fluid ounces so that's
quite a large amount of product so I
think it's worth it and the second thing
I picked up was from otx or the organics
brand this is the sunkissed blonde lemon
highlight shampoo it says they tropical
blend the brightening lemon citrus oil
to enhance shimmery sunlit highlights
all year long with rich coconut oil to
smooth and add shine while exotic key
lime extract takes you away to a sensual
paradise so it's just a normal shampoo I
thought I would try this you guys know
that I am progressively going lighter
and lighter with my hair I'm trying to
do it slowly so that I don't damage it I
don't want to just throw a bunch of
bleach on it and be like okay call it a
day you know because then it's gonna
break off and be gross and I'll have to
cut it because I want to maintain the
length but I do want to get you know
blonder and blonder so I thought that
this could help keep things you know on
track and I picked this instead of the
john frieda one I know that John Frieda
has a lot of different ones they have a
nice tone correcting one which i am
using right now and but they also have
one that is like a yes but it's called
go blonder and that's supposed to help
to you know just lighten your hair a
little bit too with like peroxide and
things like that but I thought I tried a
different brand because they have used
all of those different ones from john
frieda next I picked up the living proof
frizz freedom with the first
breakthrough of its kind in over 30
years this is a little like trial size
of the living proof ashampoo no free
shampoo no first conditioner and the
nourishing styling cream i recently got
a sample or not example but like um you
know i guess you could call it a
sufficient size sample of this
nourishing styling cream from um where
was it from I was it all done no no it
was Sephora so I'm i have almost gone
through the whole little tube of it i
really really like it so when i saw this
at the checkout i thought that i would
just try out also you know the shampoo
and conditioner so these are nice like
deluxe I samples basically
um however i did pay for it let me tell
you guys how much that was and how much
the john frieda shampoo was too so the
organics sunkist belong shampoo was
thirteen dollars or any sorry seven
dollars and ninety-nine cents and the
let's see here living proof wrist
freedom trio was twelve dollars so i
think that's worth it and it will be
nice to try it out and we'll see how
know it goes next I picked up again I
was at the checkout and I always get
taken in by those little like samples
and deluxe I samples this is the batiste
dry shampoo coconut and exotic tropical
um I really like the scent of it it just
smells like coconuts and i love the
batiste or batiste formula ab dry
shampoo so i pick that up and that was
let's see here but tease dry shampoo
that was 399 for that little tiny one
and then i picked up to facial masks um
so the first one I picked up was the
deep down detox ultra cleansing mud mask
with orange and bergamot it says the
super cleansing detox mass cleanses
impurities for a clearer brighter
complexion the energy of orange
recharges while sea salt cleanses and
bergamot balances your face will notice
the difference so I heard this is really
really good and comparable to the a glam
glow super mud one so I wanted to try it
out and then from the same line i also
picked up at the i think it's called
yeah formula 1006 i also picked this one
up this is called keep your cool skin
call me gel mask it says coconut books
cucumber I'll this unique gel mask helps
reduce the appearance of nasty breakouts
coconut suits blemishes while refreshing
cucumber helps calm even the most angry
of flare-ups the result skin is school
skin is cool calm and under control so
I'm excited to try those out I've never
tried this brand but I've heard really
really good things so yeah um and both
of those masks were let me look at my
receipt um let's see here formula
templates like those were each four
dollars and forty-nine cents so pretty
good um you know deal for 3.4 fluid
ounces of masks so really exciting about
that so that is what I picked up with
all
and now we are going to move on to Bath
and Body where it's like this big ol bag
right here so let's just get started um
the first two things I picked up were
too deep cleansing hand soaps my
boyfriend and I really really like the
formula of the deep grunting hand soap
more than the you know gentle foaming or
anything like that so um these were each
four dollars each I got the honeydew
cooler and this one is supposed to be a
blend of summer melon and frozen Kiwis
so that sounds really yummy and I also
picked up sparkling sweet nectarine and
this one is fresh nectarine and sweet
basil so both of those just smell really
fresh and nice and i know but like those
so like I said those were both four
dollars each and then I picked up one
Wallflower um this is going to be for
the living room and this is in mahogany
teak wood I just thought that this was
like a unisex kind of scent that we
could have in the living room basically
so um you know really really nice sense
I already have the wallflower for it so
I just needed the bulb and that was
let's see here um look on my receipt
that was four dollars also for one
little ball but that's kind of expensive
I probably should have gotten it in like
a little kit or a pair but I didn't and
then next I got some of the three wood
candle so right now they have these POC
tails that are out which is really cute
it's kind of their summer saying for
their three wick candles and it
basically shows the recipe of what you
can actually do on the top on the lid so
um this one is called spidey real I'm
sickle and it says you need a cup of
crushed ice two lines freshly squeezed
and cherry infused vodka and then it
says cocktail hour so really really cute
that you get a little recipe with it I
really think that's adorable but this
one is called like I said spiked cherry
lime sickle and it smells amazing um and
these were all twelve dollars except for
one of the candles that got all of them
were twelve dollars so um this one says
a blend of summer cherries juicy
Parisian lines and sparkling sugar
crystals that deliver happiness like a
cherry on top so really really excited
to burn that the next one I got another
pop tales this one is called watermelon
lemonade
and for the recipe you need to pink
watermelon slices one freshly squeezed
lemon and chilled Prosecco young but
anyway this one's kind of cute because
it's got like rainbow colors going
through it and it smells really really
good just like fresh watermelon and it
says the scent is let's toast to a blend
of juicy pink watermelon freshly
squeezed Meyer lemons and bubbly
Prosecco so smells really really good
really fresh another pot tail to the
last little pop kills one I got was
called pink-apple punch it says you need
for pink lady apples sliced this is for
the recipe 1 honeydew melon cubed at
french champagne and it smells really
really good really like the smell of
this one it's very very bubbly and
sparkly and I just really like it and
this one says it says RSVP for a cool
celebration of pink lady apples juicy
honeydew and bubbly champagne so really
really like those little cocktail ones I
think they're so cute the way that they
look and also I love that they have a
little recipes on top so all of those
were twelve dollars and then I picked up
a few of these candles these were like
their spring candles and these were on
clearance and let me look and double
check the price for you guys um these
were on clearance for six dollars and
fifty cents so that's really really good
this is the white barn lilac blossom
this is one of my favorite spring sense
that white barn comes out with or bath
and Bodyworks comes out with and it says
that it is the belle of the spring
garden lilac blossom mixes with lily of
the valley valley and sweet violet to
create the ultimate spring of floral
scent and it really just smells lovely
it's a really really beautiful scent so
I'm excited to burn that and another one
that was on clearance um for how much
did I say I say six dollars or six
dollars fifty cents this one was six
dollars fifty cents this is um Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works home this is the Oceanside
spent I thought this was really really
nice it kind of reminds me of like
mahogany teak wood another candle what
I'm in a mint
next and just like those kind of unisex
sense that kind of go a little more on
the manly side I thought my boyfriend
really like this one um it going to
smell like cologne its really really
fresh it kind of smells like their
winter sent sparkling icicles if you
guys have ever smelled bad but it's just
really fresh I really liked it it said
is 8 it says it's a blend of sun-ripened
citrus juicy melon and refreshing Ocean
air brings you to a perfect day on the
shore so excited to burn that and the
last one was actually full price it was
$22 and like 95 cents or whatever um but
I had to get it it smelled so good and I
thought my boyfriend would really like
it to you but I really liked it um so it
kind of brings back you know memories of
New York since my boyfriend was there
and I was there so it is called New York
black tie and oh my gosh I already
started burning it it smells so good it
smells like a hunky man okay it just
smells so so good and it says it is a
perfect date for any night in the big
city it says it has green sage
sandalwood and tonka bean and it is so
good if you guys can get you know your
hands on this definitely definitely
smell it see if you like it you don't
even need to smell it just order it it
smells so good like I said this one was
not six dollars or fifty cents or twelve
dollars but I had to get it even though
