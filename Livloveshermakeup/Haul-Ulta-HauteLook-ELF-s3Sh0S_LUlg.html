have a haul for you guys um buy some
things from eyes lips face calm a few
things from hautelook that I told you
guys about in my last video and also on
one or two things from Ulta so let's
just get started um the first thing I
want to show you is what I got it ulta
because i only got three things the
first two things are these rimmel london
pro vaca lips I've been hearing a lot
about these and have been seen a lot of
first impressions and I'm really
impressed so I picked up these shades um
550 play with fire which is like a nice
deep red and i also picked up the shade
kiss fatale or kiss fatal and it looks
like that it's like a nice DP berry
color so I'm really excited to try those
out like i said i think i've heard like
some really great things about them so
maybe I'll do a first impressions I'm
not quite sure but stay tuned for that
um next I got the pur minerals soul mass
palette from Ulta I've been looking at
this for a while and debating whether I
needed it and of course I don't need it
but I wanted it so I went ahead and got
it and let me just say this packaging is
so key to open stuff like that and the
palace right there is no cute oh I love
that so this is what the palette looks
like not my favorite packaging but the
colors in here are gorgeous that's the
back the back has the names of the
colors so that is very nice and when you
open it up these are all gorgeous matte
colors as you can see maybe I should go
like this and you see that pretty so
these are really like mop and pink toned
but um they're all mad I think they just
look I our members watching them in Alta
at one point and just thinking wow I
really should get that at some point so
I'm really really excited to try this
out it does come with this little brush
here that looks pretty nice for packing
on color so I'll keep that and I will
definitely be doing review and swatches
on this for you guys so
stay tuned for that and let's get into
the whole of hall or the hautelook
portion of this hall um let's see here
oh also from sorry from Ulta I got a
little sample of the becca shimmering
skin Perfector in opal I've heard really
really good things about this so I
actually cannot wait to try this that is
one sample I want to rip open
immediately so next we have some hot
looks tough I got this lorac lorac and
steel over on there a couple of weeks
ago so i got the lorac pearl eyes eye
primer and pearl eyeshadow duo it looks
like that and i really love the lorac
what is it behind the scenes I primer so
I this kit had a full size of that this
one is like a really really nice and
smooth and not sticky at all so I really
really love it so have a full size of
that and then it came with this
eyeshadow single in a pro to go
eyeshadow in the color pearl so looks
like that I did dip my finger in this
already so if you see it a little indent
don't worry hasn't been tampered with um
next uh I got I think they have like a
set of seven of these lip glosses on
sale for like I'm gonna say like
thirteen dollars that's crazy but i
ended up paying seven of these lip
glosses so the first one is in alex and
it looks like this and i thought these
were so cool they have like all this
mixture of color in them Michael so
that's the color Alex the next one is
Josh I think this is all named after the
lies this is josh it's got some silver
and light pink in there very cute the
next one is Nick
it's more of like a light pink with gold
and a little bit of white in it so cool
next one is crisp and oh this one's
beautiful it's like super shimmery hot
pink light pink ooh I like that one the
next one is Mark and by the way these
are the lips with benefits lip glosses
from lorac and this one's more of like a
nudie one new deshay some gold in there
where's that silver no it's kind of
peachy gold please just look awesome I'm
super excited and the next one is Chuck
like check bags and this was more like
mom it's nice they're really hitting up
all the colors so that's like a mob
color and the last one is Ben and this
one's like peachy with just liked pearl
pink and silver in it so super excited
to try those out it was such a great
deal was probably like a dollar fifty
for each gloss basically in the kit so
really really excited to try tho about
and the last thing i got was from i'm
sorry i got two things from steel i will
start with this one I got one of these
stila convertible color duel and lip
cheek crees this is in Dahlia I've never
tried these but I've heard great things
and every time i go to sephora i always
see them like displayed on the top of
the Stila like section and they look so
pretty there like opened up on the
display like this and just sitting there
and i always thought they
so pretty so this is the colored dahlia
it's just a really nice deep like plum
color wow really pigmented I like that
so super excited to try that out now
what am I going to rub my finger on to
clean it off let me get on this is that
bad now throw it in anyway it was really
key little display it's a great little
palette okay that did not really come
off but that's good that means could be
a really good product um and the last
thing i got was from hautelook was the
steel of garden of glamour makeup set it
looks like this and on the inside you
get an eye liner a lip glaze another one
of those convertible cheek lip colors
any little palettes that's what the set
looks like so you get one of these stila
smudge stick waterproof eye liners I'm
not a huge fan of these um I have a few
that came with like my in the light in
the garden palettes and I don't love
them but maybe I need to try them again
this is in the color damsel so it's like
a nice deep brown color and you know
this one I think came with the Stila in
the light and like this is the kind of
color I would like as an eyeliner
instead of like a pitch black in my
waterline I'd like this so I need to try
these again cuz my first impression was
no hey next you get some of the Stila
lip glaze and this is in banana berry
which looks really pretty i recently got
this Stila lip glaze set review and
swatches coming soon on that but um I
want to try every single shade out
before but I really like them and this
is a new color to me banana berry so
it's a really nice pinky nude completely
matte very cool and then you get the
convertible cheek / lip color and it
looks like that so it looks like this
one's going to be a little more pinky oh
it's beautiful this is in peony that's
very very pretty
and the last thing you get is a little
palette and this is the Stila garden of
glamour I shadow palette ed and it
doesn't have a mirror but those are the
colors I thought they were really really
pretty and on the top it says do what
you love and follow your passion a very
cute nice little message so I'm excited
to play with that again this is pretty
cheap buttonhole look everything was
always pretty cheap on whole look so
that was nice to get all right let's
move that box over there and dig into
what i got from out so Oh have been
stepping up their game recently and I
thought you know I better get on some
bad check out some of the new stuff and
the one thing I'm like ridiculously
excited about is this Ben young do you
see that this is an ultimate kabuki
brush what does that remind you of this
looks like the Becca or the novice like
contour brush the stick is huge but it's
so soft and awesome look at that you
guys yes oh yes doing it right what can
I say so soft so silky sawed-off you can
use this for like hardcore contouring or
blending out I don't even know it's just
awesome so I have not tried the Becca
one and I have not tried the NARS one
but I want to try this one first before
i got those other ones to see if this is
good and this feels way softer than
their other likes to do brushes for some
reason but good job good job coming out
with something like that the next thing
i got was this elf studio moisturizing
foundation stick and i got this in the
shade honey i thought that i could use
this as like a contouring kind of thing
um I don't know I just don't it'd be
kind of cool to start doing some cream
contouring and that is the color
obviously it's darker than my complexion
but that's the point when you contour
right so I'm going to try that out
see how that goes I also got the eyes
lips face mineral glow looks like that I
guess this is just like a I don't know
elf mineral glow in shimmer looks like
this and that's kind of the color back
there you guys see that so it says on
the back here that this is oh wow no
parabens no preservatives no chemical
dyes good job elf step in their game on
it says the sheer powder will add an
illuminating glow that will leave your
skin look and healthy and radiant our
mineral glow powder is a hundred percent
mineral base with no parabens
preservatives or chemical dyes so says
shake the National Medal go back and
forth to get excess powder loose on the
tray gently glide the powder into a
bronzer brush to grab the powder bring
your brush to the cap and work to the
people wha apply to areas of the face
that need highlighting so I guess it's
like a highlighting powder so we will
see about that um next I got this elf
studio party in the buff moisturizing
lipstick open this up and check it out
this is one of the newer colors I think
they've had to be moisturizing lip
sticks for a while now but I've never
seen this color and I thought the
packaging look to really sleek and you
can store it like this so you can see
the color so this is party in the buff
like a nice nude I like that that looks
like an orange undertone that's kind of
cool next I guards one of the press
mineral eye shadows like I said I've
been really impressed with like the
mineral line from ELF lately so I
thought I might as well get a few little
products so this one is the pressed
mineral eyeshadow in birthday cake and
it's just a light pink color looks like
that
it's pretty shimmery and yeah next I got
to the press mineral foundation and I
actually got this in warm again kind of
for like contouring or just like using
as a bronzer and if I like the
consistency ooh very sleek packaging
okay that whoa okay has a powder puff a
big nice mirror and that is the product
let's huh oh my gosh oh my gosh it's
like butter oh oh like I'm sorry but
this is like so smooth you guys see that
ah I really should probably get this in
my shade I mean this is like the darker
right cuz I thought I could this isn't
warm I thought that I could probably
make use it for contouring but wow super
pigmented and so smooth and creamy good
shot elf can you take this again I'm
break my fingers sure you get you a
tissue box right here like next to me
why don't I have one of those i also got
to the prism eyeshadow palette I
actually opened this one out of a deep
palette because I had to see these
colors I have all of them not have
sunsets naked and this is the last one
I'm going to toss this um it is in smoke
I love these these are awesome great
pigmentation they can be used wet or dry
they feel amazing and i highly recommend
these i think they're like nine to ten
dollars a piece totally worth and i have
all of them now and i love them and the
last thing I got yes laughing is the
mineral pressed blush and this is in
wonderlust oh my gosh I can't get over
that foundation you guys oh my goodness
where you go
to touch it again that press mineral
foundation pick this up guys pick this
up amazing feel so smooth and creamy I
gotta pick up my shape now alright this
