this video is going to be a hall from
Ulta calm and spore calm let's just get
started I'll show you guys what I got it
ulta first because I didn't pick up that
much I got this bareMinerals six steps
to gorgeous ulta exclusive six piece
collection of color and finishing
essentials and this odd was on like a
special one day where you could get this
for twenty-five dollars on the website
so I jumped on that because I thought
that was a great deal let's open it up
and I'll show you guys what you get so
we get a bare minerals brush like this
super super soft just looks like that
and then you get the ready blush in the
color to do to do the one open this no
no no like why why bare minerals ok
there's the ready blush in the one it's
really nice kind of peachy color and
then you get the bare minerals mineral
veil which is like a nice setting powder
but it's like a finishing powder it's
really really beautiful then you get a
full-size of the marvelous Moxie bare
minerals lip gloss in spark plug a nice
kind of mommy color then you get a
full-size at the lash domination
volumizing mascara and it looks like
this the wand can you guys see that it's
like twisted so cool cool cool cool and
then you get a well-rested face and eye
brightener so you got all of that for
twenty-five dollars I don't know if
that's still going on on Alta but check
it out and if you get sign up for their
emails because when they email you and
they say like okay one day only
$25 you get all those products get on it
because it's a good feeling so again
that was the six steps to gorgeous and
then I got a Cano a love story sample
and I also picked up a revlon colorburst
matte lip balm in the color elusive I
thought this was gorgeous and it looks
like it's maybe like one or two shades
deeper than my natural lip color so it's
really easy for every day and yeah that
was it so now let's go on to the super
apart I really only ordered a few things
but it was one of those orders where I
ended up using a lot of my points and it
seems like they gave me double samples
of everything which is kind of cool so
let's just get started I got to this
Sephora kiss kiss gloss rose universal
it just looks like this and see if I can
open this and show you guys this was
just one of those things that was like
oh do you want this and I was like yes I
do it just looks like this really nice
pinky color it's just like a gloss that
you can put on your lips and I love
glosses and little tins like that I
think it's so cute next I got to the
bare minerals the posh neutrals
eyeshadow palette um I have a few
bareminerals talents and I love them
especially this ready eyeshadow 8.0
formula it's gorgeous so this is the
packaging it's like rose gold so so
pretty and on the inside a little thing
that says hello and palate and you get a
little brush and whatnot and these are
the colors they're super gorgeous
they're like pinkies lots of sparkle
lots of glitter I just thought they
looked really really pretty and um I
don't know I just thought yeah I'm gonna
get that so got that and then the other
thing I ordered which is like crazy
because I don't know I'm like the last
person on earth to probably get this
palette but I got the original Too Faced
chocolate bar palette um I over
originally no recently got the
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette it was
like why have I never gotten the
original one so I
wondered the original one and you guys
probably all know what this looks like
but it looks like this and you get
gorgeous shades on the inside beautiful
beautiful beautiful really really pretty
so I'm excited to play with that and
then the rest of the stuff is samples
and point stuff so I got this jurlique
rosewater balancing miss a refreshing
mist you hydrate and soften and i like
to use stuff like this to set my makeup
so i will use that to set my makeup i
also got a tart high-performance
naturals the sculptor contouring face
slenderize ur see here looks like that
and kind of like the clinic chubby
sticks contour and this is in park at
princess um then i got this vib rouge
Marc Jacobs beauty this is like the
little gift for the year or whatever
Gabi Bruce cheers to another beautiful
year and then you get this cute little
lipstick here looks like that see the
color pretty pretty very nice deep red
kind of like almost oxblood color and i
get i like it and let's see here ah just
like stuff overflowing on the table now
then I got the Marc Jacobs Heighliner
gel i crammed in black it looks like
this and it just twist up like that so
I've heard a lot of good things about
the Marc Jacobs eyeliners so thought I'd
get one of those from one of my hundred
point perks or whatever oh this is not
something that I got as a perk but I
forgot to show it this is the glam glow
thirsty mod hydrating treatment they
just came out with like these smaller
little versions of these at sephora or
maybe they're not new there's just the
first time I saw them
so I picked up at the thirsty med 1 i'm
probably going to pick up the green one
to the Kiwi kind of one what is that
like the dual cleanse one I love that
one and I really like the exfoliate 12
so my pick that one up as well but it
has like a really nice coconut smell or
earlier no smells like almonds smells
like almonds I've tried a few um a few
samples of this and I was like I have to
get it so I got the little tiny one to
kind of try out to what night it was
only like nineteen dollars then I got a
sample of the glam glow youth my tinkle
exfoliate treatment this is the other
mass that I really like from them it's
super super exfoliating another 100
point perk is the Olay henriksen truth
serum collagen booster potent vitamin C
complex I've been trying out lots of
different serums lately just like sample
sizes or deluxe ice samples and just
trying to find the 1i like um I recently
went through a big thing of the what was
its synchronized complex from Estee
Lauder yes advanced night repair and I
just I don't know I've never fallen in
love with the serum so I thought I'd
just try bunch of different ones and
then get a full size of the 1i like the
rest are all samples which is crazy
because I do not get three they sent me
like double of everything I don't know
if that was an accident or whatnot but I
got three of the thirsty cleanse from
glam glow these are the cleansers these
match the treatment which is the mask
they smell like it and they have the
same kind of mud in them I really like
this I would definitely pick up a full
size of that cleanser I got the josie
maran argan matchmaker serum foundation
in fair / light so that's perfect for my
skin tone dakota lee plenty o koo
lachlan lazy oh so this is I cream and
then another one of the cuddly i cream
yeah I think they just gave me doubles
of everything by accident I'm not good
lighting I think it's great they gave me
three of the amazing
cosmetics line smoother plus primers so
it's like a primer that also helps
minimize the appearance of fine lines
then I got a looming Finland bright now
vitamin B vitamin c BB serum and this
was actually a sample from Ulta as well
it's just at the bottom of the box and
then the last sample i got from sephora
was the smashbox photo finish foundation
primer which i really like and then
another 100 point park was this little
cute little tote I just like this kind
of stuff for carrying groceries or even
after I go to Sephora and pick up lots
of makeup and want to carry back so
anyway that was my Alta and Sephora haul
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll see you my next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
