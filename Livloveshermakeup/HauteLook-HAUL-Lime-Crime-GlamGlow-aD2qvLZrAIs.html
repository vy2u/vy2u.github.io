just go like that oh wait welcome back
to my channel happy Friday Friday bye
yeah yes okay sorry oh my god probably
was seizure from me doing that anyway
welcome back to my channel I have a hot
look hall for you guys today I'm super
excited I already tried filming this
video and I already got into all the
products and swatched everything and I'm
so upset because now you can't see the
products when they were just straight
out of the packaging of it anyway I
ordered some items from Glen blow and
also from lime crime so I'm gonna show
you guys what I got so yes I did order
some lime crime items I have personally
ordered from the lime crime website I
love their lip velvet teens velvet teens
that how you say yeah they're limb fell
the teens I did pick up another one of
those as well I know that a lot of
people like had issues with the whole
like breach the security breach my
recommendation is just to go ahead any
time you're shopping online just use
paypal guys seriously just use paypal a
I always use paypal but if you are
scared to shop on the lime crime website
thank you have a lamp I'm on hautelook
once every leg only once every six weeks
I see them on there so anyway the first
thing that I did pick up again I already
started watching it and everything I'm
sorry but I was really excited for this
this is the Lime Crime Venus palette
check out the packaging oh my god I love
this may be like my favorite packaging
ever it says Venus on the back and it's
so funny because it does have a mirror
by the way it's so funny i did a
comparison video the other day on the
violet boss slow powdery on the vinyl
boss holy grail I shadow palette versus
the modern renaissance from anastacio
Beverly Hills I feel like this palette
could literally be in that category as
well you get these nice cranberry shades
with like warm brown super super
beautiful you're getting mats you're
getting shimmer shades I'll swatch a few
of them for you guys they're super
beautiful when I just did the other
video or try to film this video I was
watching them and they all going really
really nicely they're very very
pigmented and I believe lime crime is a
cruelty-free and vegan brand which is
cool so yeah let me swatch a few of
these mats or super buttery these are
all very very pigmented this shade right
here called shell is amazing so let me
go ahead and do a little swatches
watching for you guys so here we have a
nice transition shade called divine
right here we have the first shade in
the palette which is called Venus
then we also have shell so here's Venus
and then their shell which is like
reminds me of the shade orgasm from NARS
I'm just really excited to dig into this
palette I think it's beautiful and I
think I got this for like seven or eight
dollars which is an amazing amazing deal
so I'm really excited to play with my
new little eye shadow palettes now they
second item I got was another lip
velveteen because these are just my
favorites how you say it Velveteen spell
the teens yes and the shape that I got
is cement and I do love these I love the
formulation on these I just love them I
have salem i have kashmir and i also
have rose blood is that what it's called
I don't know I can't remember what the
other one is called but i thought i
would pick up the shade cement it's just
a beautiful cement grey color and i just
love the formulation on these are super
creamy they smell really good they don't
feel like anything on the lips you guys
know i'm very picky as a flutist what is
on my lips and honestly I just can't
even feel these on there and they drive
down mad so there is a cement super
super excited to play with that I think
that's going to be a gorgeous shade
especially with like I don't know maybe
like a cool tone smokey eye I love that
all right and then the last few items
that I picked up work from glam glow so
one of my lovely subscribers let me know
the glam glow was on hautelook and glenn
lo is like never on hautelook and you
guys know I love Glenn boom one of their
treatment mask is $69 so when I saw
these two I was like I need those in my
life these two little things where I
think $65 and you get a full-size of
thirsty mud a full size of the youth
yeah us mud then you are getting de left
side samples of the super mud in each of
these you are getting at brush you are
also getting thirsty cleanse a deluxe
eyes in here and then you were getting
youth cleanse in here so that was like a
great deal i could not believe it you
are basically getting like three extra
products for the price of what's the
actual treatment mask is so you open it
up it says hello sexy and this is
everything that you get in there i'm so
excited so here we have the super mud
treatment which is like their best known
i think it still is their best known
treatment or mask it's really really
wonderful if you do have problematic
skin if you have um you know like
breakouts if you have
I love the smallest I don't know what's
wrong with me but anyway sorry if you
have breakouts if you have oily skin and
things like that you definitely would
enjoy this product so this is what it
looks like and i'll probably have to dig
into this one it's like the little lid
off but i really do like this and i'm
actually using um is it super mad at the
cleanser yeah i'm using that in my
shower right now so i love the
formulation on this and you are getting
that little one in there it's basically
like a free item that you get in there
you are getting a little deluxe sized
brush here as well which is awesome for
applying the mask so here we have the
little brush if i can get your little
ass out there we go so basically like a
kind of like a foundation brush and then
you have this little like what is this a
little silicone tip over here not quite
sure what that's for but you get that in
there and then you are getting thirsty
cleanse which is a nice little side like
this is a really really good size there
are let's see your 1 ounce or 30 grams
of product in here I love thirsty kinds
really really good one if this was
actually an item that I got to that made
me want to go and look into their
cleanser lives and then of course what
we all want is a full size of a glam
glow mask for $65 because that's a
really really good deal so anyway here
is the full size mask and this is
thirsty mud and thirsty mud is beautiful
even if you don't have dry skin you can
use it i like to use it when my skin is
a little more on the dry side especially
during the wintertime not going to take
that peel off yet because i know that i
won't be cracking into this right away
but yeah this is a beautiful beautiful
product and i highly recommend checking
out the gladwell masks in general
alright and then the second little
bubble that we have here i have to get
all of the light laying off sorry guys
but anyway i was excited to get these i
think it was my subscriber renau who
told me that they were on hautelook so
thank you so much because honestly i am
just one of those like people like i am
pretty good with checking the whole
let's website for the most part i'm
pretty good but there are times where
like I totally just forget to go on
there and I always get so mad at myself
because I'm like I'm it's such a good
deal which by the way if you guys are
not familiar with fellow I guess I'll
tell you what love is while I open this
sucker the whole look is basically just
like a flash website like it's a flash
deal website where you can get like
high-end products for like fifty to
seventy-five percent off these actually
might have been cheaper than sixty
dollars
I think I'm thinking that they were like
around maybe 59 super super cheap but
anyway you can get all of these high-end
brands and they change them up every day
every week it's crazy but it's awesome
and yeah really love the website so here
is the youth one so let's open it up
hello sexy and we have the same thing
going on in here so here we have the
youth cleanse which I have tried before
I'm not a big fan of youth cleanse but
that's okay i will still use it and then
again we have the little brush and then
we have the deluxe size of these super
mud treatment which again these go for
like twenty dollars these little tiny
ones go for like twenty dollars at
sephora so you're getting such a good
deal with these and then we have a full
size of youth mud yes oh my god this is
one of my favorite mass from Glen blow
my two top favorite bags are this one
and also dual cleanse but they only had
this one and thirsty mine on the website
but seriously if you ever see these on
hautelook go ahead and get yourself
definitely get yourself a little bubble
or whatever this is because honestly
you're getting a full size of this
you're getting a deluxe size of super
cleanse or super mud which is like their
top-selling mass and you're getting the
actual little cleanser if you're kidding
a brush you're getting such a good deal
so yeah I pick that up as well so anyway
that was my little hautelook hall I hope
