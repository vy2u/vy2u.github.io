this is going to be a hautelook hall I
recently ordered some things from the
nordstrom rack or hautelook website and
if you guys don't know what what look is
it's basically a website that sells
certain brands like designer um yeah I
would say mostly like designer brands a
lot of makeup brands things like that
and they go anywhere from like 25 to 75
percent off and it's usually one of
those like flash deal sort of things so
it's only on there for a few days but
anyway um they had illamasqua on there
recently they had stila they had butter
london and they also had the bomb
cosmetics which one of my subscribers
let me know that the bomb like which day
it was on there so thank you so much to
that subscriber you know who you are
thank you so much um so anyway I wanted
to share with you guys what I picked up
and yeah let's just get started I'm
gonna do swatches as well so I'm gonna
start with butter london because i just
picked up to nail polishes from there
but these were half off I think they're
originally what like fifteen dollars so
they are around eight seven seven eight
dollars so the first shade I picked up
is called marrow and this is a gorgeous
kind of like um I don't even know like
silvery neutral purple color with tons
and tons of little silver itty bitty
silver iridescent and shimmers in it so
anyway that's what it looks like I think
it's really really beautiful it's got a
lot of like a gray undertone in it yeah
a lot of gray undertone in and it's just
really really pretty I thought it looked
really interesting and I don't really
have anything like this in my collection
and the second one I picked up is called
shag and this is just a gorgeous
gorgeous fall color it's basically like
a burnt orange with tons and tons of
iridescent sand gold shimmer in it so
that is what shag looks like and I'm
just so excited to play with these two I
think they're just absolutely gorgeous
gorgeous colors and again for half off
totally totally a good deal so those are
the first two things I picked up next I
will show you guys what I got from the
bomb I wanted to pick up some stuff but
I've never tried before I'm always so
tempted I don't know why but every time
the bomb was on hautelook I'm so tempted
to
by another mary-lou manizer or like
betty lou manizer I don't even know like
I'm so tempted to just buy things that I
already have because it's such a good
deal but I'm not going to be doing that
I do not need extras of products in my
collection so I decided to pick up some
stuff that I have never really tried it
but I have heard things about some of
them i have heard things about so this
is one of them that i have heard things
about from emilynoel83 here on youtube
she talks about this this is the time
bomb face primer the packaging did get a
little bent up in shipping and anyway it
looks like this and I'm all about trying
new primers especially face primer so
this is what it looks like and I recall
her talking about this having kind of
like a silicone e texture to it but
let's see here that is what it looks
like and yeah it feels really nice and
silicone e but not super super thick
like say the Porefessional from benefit
it just feels kind of light kind of like
the one I'm wearing today actually on my
face which is the Smashbox photo finish
light so um yeah really really excited
to try this out it was a really great
deal this was I believe like half off so
excited to try that one the next thing I
picked up I decided to try some of their
like skincare and makeup removing items
so this is the time bomb skincare white
TI perfection gel infused with Brazil
nut to extract so this looks really
interesting it says I perfection gel
hydrates and smooth the area around your
eyes replenishing fine lines so anyway
this was half off and I thought that
this was huge for like an eye cream Iran
I gel this is get a huge amount in here
you get um one fluid ounce but look how
big that container is so it has a nice
little pump and um let's see what the
texture is like okay so definitely
definitely looks like a gel and oh
interesting so it's not like super
silicone II feeling at all actually it
actually is kind of leaving like a sheen
to the skin so it definitely has some
hydrating properties in there it doesn't
seem like this sinks in super quickly
but that is okay so i look forward to
trying that as well again i've never
tried any skin care products from the
bomb so we shall see how this works out
for me
and yeah I really really like that
packaging about that pump is really
really nice and I feel like you get a
lot of product in there so that is
really exciting alright so the next
thing I got from the bomb is this little
mount foam or Mont bomb take a peek
eyeshadow palette it looks like this
it's for girls on the go it says they
have the cutest packaging has this
little like slip out thing right here
and this is what the actual palette
looks like so I was really drawn in by
this because of the colors they looked
so like fall and um like winter esque if
that makes sense so you get four shades
in here one of them is Matt and all of
the others have shimmer in them so the
one that is matt is that color that one
right there and that one is called
Cortina and then I you have what dessert
zermatt Aspen and Whistler you do get a
nice little mirror in there and i really
want to swatch these so let's go ahead
and do that and the first one is xem at
who feels really creamy and this is like
that black shimmery color it's got a
little bit of like a gray undertone and
it actually I was got no it's not a gray
undertone it's got tons and tons of
silver shimmer in it so that is Sir Matt
the second one is called aspen this is
that beautiful maroon kind of color
really pretty all these feel so buttery
you guys oh I love it yes yes yes that's
um Aspen the third one will need a
little at the third one is called
Whistler and this is kind of like a topi
pretty like pinky undertone sort of
shade can you guys see that oh these are
going on so beautifully and then you
have Cortina which is that matte color
and this looks like a perfect transition
color ooh so so nice can you guys see
that so those are the colors and I'm
super excited to play with this because
this looks beautiful the finish is
really really really nice and you do get
a little bit of kick up it looks like
they are a little dusty but overall a
really really cute little palette great
for on-the-go beautiful colors for fall
and winter and this was like eight
dollars so can't get anything better
than that guys alright and then let's
see here another thing I picked up from
the bomb was the bombs away
I make up break up so this is a
fortified with vitamins a c and e and
plant drive lipids and this is just a
balm that removes your omega and I
figured if I'm going to try a bomb from
any brand it should be from the bomb
when it comes to eye makeup remover so
this is what it looks like and that this
was like five dollars you guys so I
thought well you know it looks like you
get a good amount of products in there
it is pretty big and a super cute
packaging and it's just a white bomb
that i'm guessing turns into like yeah
it feels like an oil so it's like a bomb
that kind of turns into an oil and it
does feel quite thick on the skin but i
think that that will take I makeup off
really nicely and of course it won't
pull and tug at your eyes as much as
like a makeup remover wipe would so
really really excited to try a vet out
as well and I'm hoping that I like these
kind of skin care products from the bomb
i think i think i do so far they seem to
have a nice texture and then the last
thing i purchased from the bomb is this
the bomb girls lipstick and my bills be
paid this is what it looks like super
cute packaging and i thought this looked
really nice um oh really really liked
packaging like aluminum but this like i
said is my bills be paid and I just
thought this looked like a beautiful
fall color let me go ahead and swatch it
yeah it's like a very neutral sort of
peachy nude really really pretty um it's
not super super opaque but I seem to
like the texture already it kind of
glides on in more of like a sheer finish
but looks like it's going to be really
really comfortable to wear on the lips
so I am excited about as the at all
right and next let's get into illamasqua
so illamasqua was on there and i was
like oh my gosh because if you don't
know illamasqua illamasqua is definitely
a high-end brands they have expensive
expensive products and they are sold in
sephora and one of my favorite things
from Illamasqua are their powder blushes
you guys their powder blushes are so
silky and pigmented and easy to blend I
think I have three or four I have
tweaked which is like a bright red sort
of shade I have
um lover which is like a bright orange I
can't remember the other shades but I
have like four of their really really
vivid ones and then one neutral actually
the blush in katy which is a beautiful
cool tone pink but anyway i was so
excited when i saw that they had their
powder blushes on there so i picked up
three of them and i tried to get them
more in neutral colors because i do have
some of the really really bright ones
already so the first one I picked up is
naked rose and again these were fifty
percent off which is a great deal these
are normally like twenty two dollars a
piece I think so really really nice deal
um but anyway this is naked rose and
this is a matte and it just looked
perfect for fall super super natural and
basic it kinda reminds me of tarts and
what's that called that one really
really neutral shade that they have
except this moves a little more pinky
but it kind of reminds me of Katie they
just have the creamiest texture you guys
I can't even describe it but it looks
kind of like Katie as well except it's
definitely got a mob undertone but super
super beautiful um so excited to play
with that that's gonna be gorgeous for
fall they do get a little bit of kick up
because they are so powdery but it is
because they are so creamy and battery
alright the next one I picked up is
called ambition looks like that and this
one I believe has some sparkles in it I
don't have one yet that has like glitter
or sparkles in it um we'll see how this
goes it looks like it's kind of like
chunky sparkles but who knows it may not
be but this is the same kind of
undertone as the other one oh yeah it
definitely feels like the letter it's
definitely not as creamy as their mats
but that is the shape right there still
very very beautiful and highly pigmented
oh look how light reflecting that shade
is Oh super super gorgeous you guys
super gorgeous so those two are kind of
similar in tone except one has shimmer
or glitter and the other doesn't so this
one right here is naked rose and this
one is ambition really really beautiful
and then the last one I got is called
let's see here tremble and this was more
of like a warmer pink and this is also a
matte so this one looks like and i love
the illamasqua packaging is not pretty
but this one looks like oh I can open it
this one looks like this so this one
definitely has a little more of like a
coral undertone definitely a little more
peachy super super buttery because it is
that matte texture oh my god this is a
beautiful color wow really really
interesting i don't think i have any
color that looks like this in my
collection a lot of these illamasqua
blushes have like this like white milky
undertone and it just looks so perfected
on the skin like it makes your skin even
out even more of that make sense I find
when I'm wearing Katie that really cool
toned pink blush I was talking about
like it really it like covers like it
will cover certain things on your skin
like I have a lot of acne scarring like
right in this area and it like converse
at it's gorgeous but anyway I'm feeling
like this shade tremble is also having
that kind of covering effect on the skin
so far it looks like it has got that
kind of white undertone so really really
beautiful so I'm so excited to play with
those and then the last thing I picked
up um well actually the last brand I
picked up a few things from stila so the
first thing was the Stila illuminating
tinted moisturizer with broad-spectrum
SPF 20 in shade 01 that's the packaging
and this is what it looks like and I
just thought this was like a lot of
product in here and it seemed like it
was going to be a really good deal so it
is oil free and water-resistant for 80
minutes not quite sure to this you match
me like I wasn't really I don't really
know but let's see here okay Wow nice so
this is what they tinted moisturizer
looks like a lot comes out at once um
wow yeah it looks like it's going to
match my skin tone I never know
especially with tinted moisturizers but
wow you guys that looks like some really
good coverage right there for a tinted
moisturizer I mean this is not a BB
cream or a CC cream it's a tinted
moisturizer so really really nice I am
excited to put that on my face and so
that is the Stila illuminated tinted
moisturizer you get a lot of products in
here 1.7
announces all right the second thing I
picked up was the Stila um perfect and
correct foundation in a fair this is
what the packaging looks like and I've
heard a lot of good things about the
perfect and correct timer i believe it
is it's got like a bunch of different
colors in it like Sam and Kyle like
salmon tongs and green tones and this is
kind of similar except like foundation
wise so it looks like it's got to swirl
your way to a useful and flawless
complexion so maybe like I don't know
like a moisturizer mixed in with the
foundation but let's try it out to see
if the shade is going to be a match so
that is what the consistency looks like
kind of like moosie and this one seems a
little darker this is their lightest
shade fair I'm sure I can work with it
but it looks a little yellow we on my
skin tone to be honest actually that
tinted moisturizer seemed like it was
lighter and will be working better but
I'm sure I can make this work but it
looks like half good coverage and it's
got kind of a moosie texture so it's
probably really easy to blend so that is
exciting and then I also got to be stila
CC color correcting cream in SPF 20 with
SPF 20 in shade fair 01 looks like that
and you've got a big nice container here
really cute packaging 1.3 fluid ounces
in this product and let's see here so
this comes out literally like a green
tone and this is color correcting so
that's probably why but you start to
blend it into the skin okay I like that
yeah kind of color matches really nicely
or it seems to UM as I blend it in it is
coming towards that kind of like yellowy
tone that the other one did but
definitely a little more easy to blend
and um I don't know it seems like the
color is a little bit of a better match
because it's got those color correcting
um shades in there but I am excited to
try that one and definitely be tinted
moisturizer looks like it's going to be
good match for me we'll have to play
with the perfect and correct foundation
a little bit to see if that's going to
work
right next I picked up a color bomb
lipstick this is in Alyssa looks like
this and this is like a very very dark
color from what I remember um I don't
know if these are extremely pigmented or
if they're more like color bombs but
this is what the packaging looks like
super super pretty kind of rose gold
color there so this is the color yeah
super super dark but I thought I'd be
beautiful for fall oh my gosh okay so it
actually is super super super pigmented
but it looks like it has some nice like
hydrating properties to it but oh look
at that shade oh my gosh you guys
beautiful like Barry undertone it's not
as dark as it looks in the packaging the
beautiful kind of berry maroon undertone
oh my god I cannot wait to play with
that it looks perfect for fall and
really really comfortable to wear on the
lips super exciting wow that looks great
alright the next thing I picked up was
the steelo stila all over shimmer in
rose gold shimmer I already have the one
in kitten so I thought I'd pick this one
up it's basically just a liquid
illuminator and I thought that color was
gorgeous it kind of reminds me of the
NARS super orgasm I do have that one in
liquid form as well but this one just
looks so beautiful rose gold so rose
gold e so let's go ahead and swatch that
it comes out like this with a little
brush and let's see here Oh beautiful
color beautiful beautiful so this is
what it looks like just swatched on to
my hand and then when you blend it out
it looks like that ooh super gorgeous i
love that kind of golden undertone in
there when the light hits it the right
way it's so like reflecting and
beautiful love it alright excited for
that and then the last two things i
picked up or two of their um what are
they called magnificent metals lip
glosses they look like this in kind of
that navy blue packaging and the first
one is in the shade rose quartz really
really beautiful packaging and do you
see how gorgeous that color is it's like
very rosy with tons and tons of like
iridescent stew it lots of gold shimmer
in there
so let's see it's got a little doe foot
applicator um and not super super like
pigmented color but I feel like these
are more like gloss toppers to go on top
of any kind of lip color that really
gives like a nice dimension to your lips
you know will make it look really really
lovely with those light reflecting
particles and then I got the shade
garnet I feel like this one will be a
little more pigmented because it is a
beautiful deep kind of reddish mauve
color again it has tons and tons of gold
shimmer in it lots of little light
reflecting powders or I mean particles
powders it's pretty early in the morning
right now guys ah let's see here really
really beautiful that's garnet I think I
could like garnet more but oh my gosh
they both look beautiful you know what
would look even more gorgeous wearing
that Alyssa color bomb with the garnet
on top ah lovely love love love it so
that is what that looks like and that
completes my whole so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little hautelook hall if
