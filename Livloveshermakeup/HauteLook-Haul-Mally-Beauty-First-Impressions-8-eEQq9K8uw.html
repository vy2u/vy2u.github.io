thank you so much for joining in I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day
today I will be doing the haul for you
guys it's going to be a little different
though and please let me know if you
guys like this idea so basically I got a
box yesterday from HauteLook I had
ordered a few products from Mally beauty
malee Beauty was recently on HauteLook
and I ordered a few products and I got
them in the mail yesterday and I thought
it would be kind of fun to you know use
the products before I holla but that
makes sense I normally don't do that so
I thought that it would be fun for me
today to do my makeup using the products
that I got and then show you guys what I
got haul them and then also give you my
first impressions so I hope you might
enjoy this sort of video if you do
please let me know so I can film more of
them for you but yeah let's just get
started so like I said Mally Beauty was
on HauteLook
there was some great deals going on I
think I didn't pay more than $15 for
every single item or you know maybe even
ten dollars I don't know but a really
really good deal I was excited
malee tends to be a little on the
expensive side in my opinion so I was
really excited that they were on
HauteLook
and I don't own a ton of Nally products
so I thought it was a great way to try
some new stuff out so the first things
that I picked up I'm going to just show
you guys everything first haul at first
and then I would give you my first
impression so I picked up three of the
ever color ultimate waterproof eyeliners
they come in packaging like this I want
to say right away I apologize if my
lighting is going in and out in this
video I am in front of a window and we
are having some weird weather here it
gets really cloudy and then this time
comes out and then it gets cloudy and
this mint comes out so I apologize for
that
just hang in there so anyway like I said
I've got three of the epic color
ultimate waterproof eyeliners and the
shades I got were green means go and
they look like this they are retractable
I'm gonna do swatches for you this has
green means go which is like a beautiful
hunter green it's almost got some gray
undertones and it's got a gold shimmer
in it which I think it's really really
beautiful and if the second eyeliner I
got within the color blue streak and
it's like this gorgeous gorgeous like
sapphire color I love
it it looks like that and let me swatch
it it's just oh my god it's so beautiful
it's right there isn't that a pretty
color and love that color and this one
has like it doesn't have any shimmer
it's pretty much matte but it's just
gorgeous and the last one I got is in
the shade autopilot violet and this is
also really really gorgeous it is like a
beautiful purpley color and I believe
this one is also matte yes this one is
also matte so those are the three
eyeliners I picked up the one I am
wearing today the one that I tried out
was the hunter green color that one that
is what I'm wearing on my waterline and
my um what's it called you know the
upper lash line inner rim this what's it
called like I always forget that um so
I'm wearing it on my waterline and my
tight line all right so those were the
eyeliners that I got I think they're
really beautiful like I said they were a
great price and my favorite one is
definitely the blue one but I am wearing
the hunter great one today I will give
you my first impressions on that in a
minute once we go through everything
else the second thing I picked up was
the Navi pro tricks nose contour kit I
thought this would be really interesting
I am wearing it today
um and I don't have like a particular
nose contour kit I don't do a lot of
nose contouring so I thought this would
be a nice step into that whole process
so inside you get this beautiful little
sleek packaging it's like this pink
color and it opens up and you get a nice
sized mirror and then you get a
highlight and then a contour shade so
this is the highlight and that's the
contour the highlight is actually really
really pretty um it's like a champagne
II sort of color you probably can't see
it but it's really really nice it really
doesn't look like much in the pan but
when I applied it like down my nose
after do using the contour today I was
really really impressed so that is what
it looks like it's really nice um I have
the shade fair because I am fair and I
didn't want anything too dark or too
noticeable so that is that and it does
with a double-sided brush so it comes
with a side that is a little more dense
and thick and shorter and that is the
side that you use to apply the contour
and then the big fluffy side you use to
blend out and then apply the highlight
so that is that and then the last thing
I picked up with the Maui Beauty
ultimate performance Perfector pencil
duo in fair these are basically like
little concealer pencils that are really
really fine tipped like you know the
applicators really really fine I did
find that one of them is a little
lighter and one of them is a little
darker you won't be able to tell right
now but when I applied them today I did
find that one was a little darker one
was a little lighter but really really
nice matches for my particular skin tone
so basically what I use these for and
what it says on the website that you can
actually use them for is two before
after you put on your primer and before
you put on foundation you can fill in
anywhere where you have like crevices or
fine lines creases things like that and
this will actually fill in the wrinkle
and it kind of makes sense you know
wrinkles are a little you know they tend
to go into the skin and they tend to
have a bit of a shadow to them and I
have a few fine lines around my forehead
so what I did today was I'd take one of
the pencils and trace in just a little
line in between both the fine lines that
I get right there and they're a very
expressioned faith so right there and
right there and then I did it right here
on my mouth and then a little bit
underneath my eyes and I am pleasantly
surprised that after I finished my whole
makeup process um it really really
doesn't look like anything is sinking in
or anything is like you know has creases
or anything like that so I am liking
these um like I said you can use it for
that you can also use it for like spot
concealing like a really precise spot
concealing because they are so small but
overall I kind of got it to you know
fill in those little fine lines because
you know it content to look for the
cakey and gross if you know you have
like a heavy foundation on or something
and throughout the day it tends to kind
of wear weird you know what I mean like
in certain areas it will start to break
down and you know sink in and things
like that and that's not fun so anyway
those were the products I got I'm going
to give you guys my first impressions
now
I did applying the makeup about an hour
ago so I'm gonna start with the
eyeliners they are all the same formula
but I only used one of them I've used
the hunter green color today I put it on
my here I go again my waterline and my
tight lines there I got it my waterline
on my tight line so um I think that it
looks really nice I did think the color
was a tad muddy and I think that you can
kind of in the swatch you can't really
it is a little muddy in the swatch but
just going onto the eyes I couldn't
really tell if I had put like a brown or
a black or like a grey eyeliner on so I
think it's just the color but the
formula glided on really really easily
and I'm hoping that it wears all day so
my first impression of that product is
that I do like it I think that I'm gonna
like these two colors more the purple
and the blue a lot more than the hunter
green but the hunter green kind of went
with the theme that I was going for with
my eye makeup today so that is the one I
went with so so far I do like the eye
liners next I'm gonna talk about the
nose contour kit I actually really like
this um I think it looks pretty
noticeable like I said I do not contour
my nose every day so it's not something
that I'm used to
I think this is gonna take a little bit
of like getting used to but like I said
I really really loved that highlight
shade in there I thought that was really
really pretty that nice champagne kind
of color it looks really blah in the pan
but I think it really ended up looking
very nice down the bridge of the nose I
think I'm gonna have to work on kind of
blending out a little more with the
darker like contour shade but overall I
think the color is good and I am excited
to keep using it and my first
impressions for that are that I really
liked that so far and the last product
is the ultimate performance Perfector
pencil duo and like I said I use this to
fill in any kind of fine lines and
wrinkles today and before I applied my
foundation and so far it looks really
nice and smooth nothing looks too like
crazy and creepy and you know like
creased in if that makes sense
so I am liking these a lot so far - I
hope it will last all day because you
know the more you wear your makeup and
the more you move your face and things
like that the more it starts to kind of
wear in the areas where you have fine
lines
so hopefully it will stay put and I
won't have any issues so yeah really
really like those two so I'm really
happy with everything I got I hope you
guys liked this kind of different haul
type of video um I got to show you guys
everything and then I got to try them
out and so far I'm happy with everything
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
