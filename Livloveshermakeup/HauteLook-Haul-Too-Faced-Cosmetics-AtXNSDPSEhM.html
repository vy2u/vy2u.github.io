you so much for joining me I wanted to
come back on here today and share a call
with you guys I recently was on
hautelook and I thought that they had to
based on there so I of course got so
excited to face is my favorite high-end
brand and when you can get it for such a
great price and just like you know like
fifty percent off literally I jumped on
it so I picked up a few things from
hautelook from the toothpaste sale and i
will show you guys what I got so the
first thing I picked up and I just want
to say everything literally was like
fifty percent off so these items are
normally around you know they can range
up to like forty five fifty dollars or
even like I mean normally I would say
thirty to fifty dollars and I got
everything like literally ten fifteen
dollars so a really really awesome deal
um so the first thing I want to show you
guys that I got is the two-faced
sweetheart beads radiant glow face
powder comes in a cute little box like
this and these are basically a little
like heart speeds that will like bronze
up your face and just make you look
really healthy and nice and i think the
packaging is just adorable it's like
this little cardboard box and you just
um pull the lid off like this and
there's a little sponge uh you know
applicaton them applicator this is just
to protect the beads because you could
put it on your face like that but you
probably don't want to but this is what
the product looks like and you guys can
see there are these tiny little hearts
you got some yellow one some pink ones
and then some bronzy ones and you just
like swirl your brush on top and then
you apply to your face so I'm really
really excited um to use those I think
that it's such a cute concept and you
know obviously this is the time of year
for a little bit of a glow so really
excited for that product the next thing
I got was the two faced natural face
natural radiance face palette it comes
in packaging like this and this is one
of those like cardboard boxes like
they're typical on shadow boxes except
it's for the face so this is natural
face natural radiance face palette and
it opens up like this it's just a little
cardboard box in and in here you have a
bronzer you have a concealer you have a
blush and then you have like some or I'm
sorry yep this is a cream blush this is
the blood
and then these are the concealers so you
can mix and match according to what your
skin tone is of course i'll probably be
using that lightest shade and then you
get this beautiful cream blush which is
like kind of like a mommy coral color
and then on the bottom you get a really
really shimmery powder blush and then
you get the bronzer on the side so
really really pretty I think that this
will definitely give your face a lot of
radiance and it's perfect for the summer
time so really excited i got that the
next thing I got um for a great deal
just like every everything else I was
just so excited you guys like seriously
all of these products like everything
ended up being under I think sixty
dollars it's crazy but this is the
smokey eye shadow box I love these
little shadow boxes from Too Faced and
this one is the smoky one I did not have
this one yet so this is what it looks
like um and it's gorgeous I mean these
colors are really really beautiful and
smoky so you have the daytime you have
the colors Firefly clothes and up in the
smoke the classic with a white line nice
ash and smokin hot and then you have the
fashion one which is in a flash smoking
jacket and smolder so different kind of
looks that you can wear they kind of
pair them this way but you can obviously
mix and match any color that you want of
course and yeah I'm really really
excited to try this out and play with it
um and the last two things that I picked
up were these soul mates blushes /
bronze or duo that I saw come out around
i would say februari and i really wanted
to get these but they were like full
price at 26 or thirty dollars and when i
saw that they were on hold look for like
10 or 15 I knew I had to get them so
this is the soul mates this one is Ross
and Rachel and this I love is so cute I
mean I just love the packaging it's
basically like their new blush packaging
except it's black and sleek and bigger
um and these are the colors for Ross and
Rachel and I love that they go after
names of like television shows obviously
this is friends and then they have big
and carry from Sex in the City but
anyway this is Ross and Rachel so you
get rid like a nice cool tone bronzer
with like a dark pink for the blush and
I just love
packaging you guys it is so cute and
then the other one I got was Carrie and
big and this one is a little more of a
warm bronzer and then a coral peachy
sort of blush shade again really
beautiful packaging with that nice
magnetic closure and this is the colors
that you get for Carrie and big so a
little bit warmer with that coral and
let me hold them up together so you guys
can see don't want to blind you with the
mirrors but you can see the difference
so carry a big Ross and Rachel so really
really excited to play with these I
wanted these when they came out in
February I just didn't want I don't know
I just there were other things that were
out and I didn't end up spending the
money on these but I'm so glad i waited
because i got them for a super sale on
hautelook so anyway those for the
products I've got from hautelook odd
during the two-faced sale definitely
keep your eyes out for when to face
comes back because these are just great
prices for these ATMs so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this video please give
it a thumbs up if you did and i'll see
you in my next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
