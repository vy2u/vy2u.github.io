want to say really quickly before I even
get into this if you came to this video
wondering when another beauty video will
be up it will be up at 6 p.m. tonight I
will be doing at my new - blush showdown
video so that will be live at 6 p.m. but
this video is just gonna be a little
different I'm just sitting down and
talking to you guys about like my
overall health as of right now I have
been off of my channel for over a week
now not answering comments not doing
anything like that and yeah I think that
I owe it to of my subscribers who have
been here for a while and asked to just
the ones that know I do have lupus and
things like that I feel like I owe a
little bit of an explanation and just I
want to tell you guys where I've been
I've always tried to be very open with
you guys on my channel very honest and
yeah I feel like I need to tell you guys
where I've been so honestly really
quickly I was just practicing my flute
so if my liquid lipstick looks crazy
that's why also they're redoing the
condo above me and like I can hear the
guy drilling so if you hear that I
apologize but anyway yeah let me just
tell you guys where it been I have been
in a lupus flare up in the past week I
would say it kind of started maybe about
a week and a half ago if you watch some
of my videos
leading up to like the Battle of the
highlighters video or what else I can't
remember the other videos that I felt
last week but some of the videos leading
up to it I was starting to experience a
few lupus symptoms a lot of them just
being kind of like cognitive things just
like not remembering what I was talking
about or things like that and I really
really wish that I would be a little
more aware of those symptoms you guys
because I'm one of those people where I
will watch a video back and then I'm
like holy like I totally was going
into a lupus flare and I couldn't tell
like that highlighter video at the
Battle of the champagne highlights or
whatever I watched that back and at the
end I was getting all mumble jumbled
with my words and at first I thought it
was just funny I was like well I can't
get my words out but then I realized
after looking at my face in that video I
actually was like what was I talking
about and that is such a big lupus
symptom for me just being in a lupus fog
that's what Tom and I like to call it
just being in a fog leading into a lupus
flare up I start to forget things I get
very forgetful and just very um I'm very
off I don't seem completely like myself
and then after a lupus flare up probably
like right now after a lupus flare up
for about a week I'm also just kind of
out of it my brain is kind of foggy so I
also would love if you guys I would love
to have your help a little bit and if
you notice that I am acting a little off
in my videos or something like that
please throw something up in the
comments section let me know you know I
hope you are taking care of yourself
Olivia or you know I think maybe you're
going into a lupus flare up like
literally you guys could message me that
or something like something along those
lines because I never notice it I will
tell you the cognitive thing and just
like being able to talk and being able
to like hold something up and speak
about it at the same time I remember a
video last week I kept dropping
something just like of things that were
like a little outside of what I normally
deal with I guess you could say but
anyway
I would love to have your help if you
ever notice that I seem a little off in
videos I normally don't watch my videos
back I did watch that highlighter video
back so if you never noticed something
please let me know in the comment
section um but overall yeah I'm just
here to let you guys know I am okay I
was hospitalized this time again
unfortunately it was for dehydration
again and this is not one of those
things that's like super super severe I
just spit on my ring light this is not
one of those things that's super super
severe but when I go into a lupus flare
up I swear to you I just can't keep
anything down
I can't keep food down I can't keep
water down I can't keep soda down I
can't keep anything bubbly down I just
feel so sick and I constantly and
throwing up and just vile and disgusting
Ness and I can't keep anything down so
but one of the biggest issues for me
personally is sorry I keep looking into
the viewfinder I just haven't filmed in
like a week it's not because I want to
look at myself I just want to make sure
like I'm in frame oh yes keeping food
down and things like that so for me
personally I just can't
I can't keep down like I can and I
tend to get very severely dehydrated to
the point where I like I'll pass out and
basically what had happened was I was
supposed to go on vacation this past
weekend
supposed to go to Florida if you guys
follow me on snapchat or Instagram which
by the way I want to talk about this
really quickly I am trying to find a
better way to sit down and be able to
talk to you guys when I'm not feeling
well because I know not everybody has
Instagram not everybody has snapchat I
do want to say really quickly I am very
I'm quite active on there
so if something is wrong even during my
flare-up I still tried to push through
in at least post one snap a day or
something like that I've talked about it
one of my biggest insecurities is coming
on camera or something like that during
a flare up like that is like Oh
horrifying to you the thought of that
actually makes me just want to be like
nothing like go hide in a closet
I cannot even like comprehend that just
because of all the symptoms I get the
skin issues the hair issues not only
just these like you know outer physical
symptoms that I get but also just
feeling like crap I mean I feel very
depressed and very very depressed during
that lupus flare ups and I really want
to get out of bed and things like that
and I know I've touched on that before
but that is the side that I don't want
you guys to see I don't want to share
that that is a horrible side of me and
when I'm just depressed and sad like
that I don't want to bring that on my
channel now at some point I think it
would be important for me to bring it on
my channel and to sit down and to show
you guys because I think it's important
also for people to understand you are
not always happy or always in a good
mood or bubbly or whatever I tend to get
that comment a lot of people just saying
you're oh well I mean I get it in a
negative way and also in a good way
people say you're very bubbly you cheer
me up I'm so happy that makes me very
very happy that is just how my
day-to-day personality is but I also get
people that are like literally like
what's wrong with you you can't be that
happy all the time and the truth is I'm
not nobody is when I'm in a flare-up I
did very depressed and just a very
shutdown just I don't want to be outside
I don't want people looking at me things
like that so anyway I wanted to say
really quickly I do apologize I'm gonna
try and find a way to piece things
together so that I can update you guys
on camera even if the camera's not
facing me I could at least do a little
update video like pointing
but we know you know or something like
that so that you guys can know I'm okay
because I know not everybody has
snatched out an Instagram thank you so
much to everybody who left sweet snaps
everybody who left sweet messages on
Instagram people who are commenting on
YouTube saying are you okay I'm
concerned thank you so much I read
everything I will get back to all of you
I have not been answering comments for
the past videos but this video I will
absolutely be answering comments to the
video tonight all the videos from going
on from now I will obviously be
answering comments but I hope you guys
understand why I kind of have to pull
back and take a break when I am in a
lupus flare up I'm just not able to even
like sit up straight let alone answer
comments you know and I don't mean for
that to sound like it's a hard tap
answering comments is not a hard task
for me at all I actually find it quite
easy and simple if I let them you know
rack up for two or three days then yeah
I'll be sitting there for like 45
minutes or an hour but that's something
that I enjoy doing I enjoy connecting
with you guys um anyway getting a little
off-topic but what I really wanted to
say it was you know thank you to
everybody who is very concerned I hope
that I don't over concern any of you and
that is so not my intention okay my
intention is never to make you guys feel
like something's really really wrong and
I'm going to try my best next time I end
in a flare-up to go ahead and update you
guys a little more and be able to update
on YouTube as well so yeah about the
fluid things the fluids situation thing
situation whatever I was just not able
to keep any fluids down and I basically
kind of passed out and I had to bring
myself to the hospital now a lot of
people are wondering why Tom still went
to the condo I was going to be filming a
condo tour and all this kind of stuff we
were gonna be gone for fourth of July my
parents have a condo down in Daytona
Beach Florida and we were going to be
there the reason that Tom still went was
because he invited his friend from New
York and also his friends and girlfriend
and they still needed to get into the
actual condo so Tom had to go down and
also I am NOT a very pleasant person to
be around when I'm in a flare-up um
I don't like beat baby I never have I
know that some people really feel like
it's it's necessary when you feel sick
or this or that I just have this weird
complex about me
never liked feeling babied it has always
made me feel weak and I think that that
is an insecurity of mine because if
someone is seeing to you you know like
oh they want a baby or they want to stay
with you and help you and things like
that that is never reached okay I know
that it's a week that I look at it that
way and that I see it that way and that
is just my own personal insecurities but
I don't like to be babied because it
reminds me is that I'm sick and I'm not
feeling good and I have a disease and it
makes me feel like okay and you
know I'm not saying like you guys leave
in comments that's definitely not saving
me I'm talking more about like you know
Tom being around 24/7 or someone trying
to come and help me and this and that I
drag my ass to the hospital myself I'm
very very like particular about those
kind of things I just don't like to be
babied especially about health stuff
because I think it's a constant reminder
that I'm sick and then I don't feel good
and and the I I would say lupus is
probably one of the biggest struggles
that I've had to deal with I feel like
I've had it relatively easy like growing
up and things like that I was never in
mmm you know my family had money we
never had any issues with health
concerns or anything like that I always
always always always just couldn't have
had it easy to be completely honest and
this is one of those struggles that it
doesn't matter if you have money or if
you don't have money or this or that any
sort of health related concern or really
can just put a toll on you because
there's really nothing you can do and
especially when you do have a you know
disease that doesn't have it a cure you
know it kind of sucks
so anyway sorry I don't mean to digress
and run off everywhere but I just want
to hit up a few points that I'm trying
to make so anyway I didn't bring myself
to the hospital I've stayed overnight
for dehydration it really wasn't that
bad kind of my own fault because I can't
seem to keep the fluids down which I
don't want to be like it's your fault
you didn't drink fluids but I need to
try harder I just need to try harder
need to keep trying to put them down and
my lupus doctor is going to go ahead and
my rheumatologist are going to go ahead
and write out a prescription of for IV
fluids for me this is something I used
to do with my cat Lily she had kidney
disease and I would actually have to
give her IV fluid treatments at
nighttime this is something that I am
going to do myself
and basically get little fluid bags and
walk around with the little you couldn't
know what I'm talking about how the
fluid things so I can give myself fluids
during my flare-up because I think one
of the biggest issues is the dehydration
thing and the lack of having water or
you know anything in my body I can't
keep done juice I can't keep down soda
anything so just having some nutrition
and having some water in my body would
be very very helpful having fluids
basically so yes I was in the hospital
symptoms were not horrible at this time
I do still have some little skin stuff
that I'm dealing with you probably can't
see because I covered them up pretty
well today I get these little flak
things that are kind of like scab ease
and they just itch they itch like a
 okay like I itch and from
my experience those little they're not
actually called scabby side okay I think
scabies is actually like a I don't even
know I think it might be like guy I
don't know it's Kathy's like crabs or
something I think it's like scabby
because it just itches that's what I
think of them and also they peel like
little scabs so they're not actual
scabby but I get this little skin
condition where I just itch and itch and
itch there's these small little patches
on my skin they look like a little red
dots they're not raised or anything like
that but they itch and then they start
to peel off and I know that if I eat too
much things you start to scar so I've
been really careful about bad got them
all up in my hairline I mean I have been
a fool girl I have been really really
pulling and picking at my scalp I have
some open lesions right now some hair
loss things like that I know a lot of
people have been asking about my hair in
general saying that it looks kind of
like tangled up and weird that's just a
hairstyle that had something to do with
lupus if you guys have been watching me
for a while I have very very fine flat
straight hair I've been back homing this
 out of my hair lately just so I can
throw it up in a bun I still I'm going
to be getting a my hair done now I need
to wait till these actual lesions heal
up completely until I can go ahead and
put bleach on there because if I have
open lesions on my scalp and I
bleach in there that was gonna hurt like
son of a bitch okay I'm not doing that
so anyway as far as that is concerned
yeah no I mean I've just been wearing my
hair like this this has been kind of my
go-to hairstyle I know a few people have
been like can you please just wear your
hair down or something like that well
now after having this flare-up - I'm
definitely keeping it up because they do
have some open lesions and things like
that but for the most part not too bad
as far as symptoms are concerned I do
want to let you guys know that I was
brought into a program by rheumatologist
they have like a lupus program at one of
the hospitals that I go to and I was
actually accepted into the program so I
will be trying out some new non
fda-approved drugs these are basically
just it's like tester drugs so I will be
taking a shot in my butt every single
month I'll be going in and they'll be
giving me a high dosage of steroids and
prednisone is one of those women I don't
really like taking prednisone I do take
it when I'm gonna flare up I get like
moonface and just all these weird
symptoms from it if you take prednisone
for too long basically you can get some
really kind of unattractive symptoms but
I think it's important to remember as
well like I have lupus and lupus attacks
the hair and the skin and the nails and
all that kind of stuff I just have to
know that I'm not gonna be feeling that
great about myself during a flare-up and
I'm not gonna look that cute either and
I just have to know that it's better
that it happens on the outside rather
than the inside I don't want my internal
organs shutting down I would rather have
some you know open lesions on my scalp
or on my face rather than you know
having you know my kidneys shut down or
god forbid in my liver or something like
that so anyway that is kind of what's
going on with that so I would be going
in and getting a shot in on my butt
every month I did get one last month and
it was 45 seconds long I was like are
you freaking kidding me right now the
thing hurts so bad because they put it
right into the muscle and they wanted to
do it on your dominant side I'm
left-handed and it was just it was
really painful anyway I will be doing
that and that has a combination of I
believe a strain of antibiotics and also
steroids I'm pretty sure I don't know
Tom read all the paperwork he's the one
who helps me get into all these programs
and things like that so anyway I'm in a
lupus
program for that they're going to be
doing some sorts of physical therapy
with me as well you guys know that I do
my fingers actually look relatively good
right now um I don't know how they're
looking in the viewfinder but they swell
up to like four times the size when I'm
in a flare-up I'm now out of the
flare-up but when I'm in a flare-up they
swell up a lot they're still a little
swollen
I do have rheumatoid arthritis so very
hard for me as a flute is very very
difficult for me to practice I can't
practice that pretty much very hard and
just kind of one of those things where
it's like really like really the one
thing I need is you know my mobility and
my fingers so I'm during flare-ups that
are very very tough but they're going to
be doing some stuff with like RA and
they're gonna be giving me certain drugs
for that so we shall see how that goes
my knees are deteriorating datura
deteriorating pretty darn quickly
I do have RA or three that's in my knees
as well and my knees
we're like the first one to go before it
like my hands I mean my hands are pretty
good I only get RA when I'm in a
flare-up which is great if I had re all
the time I don't think I'd be able to
play my flirty bar but as far as my
knees are concerned those are pretty
blown out it's been difficult for me to
like hit the gym and things like that
and I've been trying to get like a
little more in shape you guys know I'm
not overweight I'm not underweight I'm
just right in between I'm about 105
pounds and it's not necessary for me to
go to the gym but I do think it's a very
therapeutic to move my body and to try
and get a little more blood flow going
in my legs I am prone to clotting and
things like that not only do I take
birth control but also because of lupus
I unpro into getting clots in my legs
which could lead to you could lead to
like a PE or a pulmonary embolism which
is basically where a blood clot will go
to your heart or to your brain and get -
yes so I don't mean to be so blunt but
seriously um I do have to be kind of
care you know careful about that but for
the most part I think that just like
moving my body really really helps so I
have been trying to hit the gym now it's
you know not gonna be as frequently I
was hitting the gym every single day
about a month ago I literally was
starting to get like a little some
definition a my tummy
like I would say they're really good
about it and now I'm just kind of back
at that point to where you know that's
not really something I can be doing
every single day as of right now so
overall yeah that's kind of just what I
wanted to update you guys on not
horrible horrible symptoms this time
again I was hospitalized but it was kind
of just because I wasn't getting enough
fluids down so nothing severe or
horrible I am feeling a hundred percent
better to date like today I feel great
you know like I said a swelling and like
my RA is pretty much gone in my fingers
and my knees I feel so blessed that I
only get you know the RA when I'm in a
lupus flare up I feel blessed that I
have an autoimmune disease that only
comes in flare-ups because there are
autoimmune diseases where people have
them all the time and I cannot imagine
taking you know prednisone and
antibiotics and all that every
single day I just can't imagine and so
yeah I just want to give you guys a
little bit of an update like I said that
new to blush showdown video will be live
at 6 p.m. thank you again to everyone
who have reached out I really love you
guys I want to know what you've been up
to it's down below please don't worry
about me I am okay and I'm gonna figure
out a better way to take care of this
situation I know I said this in my last
video but I am going to find a better
way to take care of this situation next
time maybe the update you guys with a
little video even if the video is not on
me I can like point out the window or
something just let you guys know for the
people who don't follow me on snapchat
or Instagram will let you guys know how
I'm doing and if I'm okay so anyway
thank you for joining me guys and I will
see you at 6 p.m. I just scratched
myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
