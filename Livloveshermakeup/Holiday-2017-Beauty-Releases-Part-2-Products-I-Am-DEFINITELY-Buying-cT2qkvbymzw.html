channel today's video is going to be
part two in my holiday beauty releases
2017 a series so I did a part two one
into this video where I talk to all
about brands I would recommend you guys
check out as well as avoid during the
holiday season so I'll go ahead and
throw that up in the cards if you are
interested but today I'm going to be
walking you guys through all the holiday
sets and kits that I will for sure be
purchasing so let's go ahead and start
with a little bit of a Rouge event that
will be happening online as well as in
store at Sephora on Saturday September
9th from 8:30 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. now
I am not waking my ass up 8 a.m. to go
to Sephora and sip on some champagne and
walk through the aisles at 8 a.m. on a
Saturday like that's just not gonna
happen so I will be placing on my orders
online oh but the one kit they're really
really caught my eye you guys is the
drugged elephant kits now I'm not a huge
fan of the siefer Maday serum I think
it's good but I also feel like you can
get comparable products for a cheaper
price but I have to say everything else
in this set I really really want so I
will for sure be purchasing that you can
also get to the Urban Decay vice
lipstick set they have something from
you know benefits they have this really
really great little Beauty Blender set
where you can literally get like four or
five little Beauty blenders for like 60
bucks or like 50 bucks which is a great
deal and they have the tarte set which
you can preview which i would not
recommend you guys check out go ahead
and watch the part 1 video where i talk
a little more in depth about tarts
holiday sets especially their eye shadow
sets I would not recommend them but
everything looks very very intriguing
and interesting they also have a set
from Smashbox here with the cover shot
palettes as well as a highlighting
palette so there's a lot of stuff to
choose from but for sure I know that I
will be purchasing at that drunk
elephant set are you guys moving on to a
new color pop palette that actually
released this morning this is the new I
think I love you palette it does retail
for sixteen dollars and it will be
restocked on September 15th at 10 a.m.
Pacific Standard Time if you guys want
to pick it up now originally I was not
super interested in this when I first
saw it and then I changed my mind
because I have been loving the color pop
formula and if you guys didn't know I am
a teacher and I start teaching in two
weeks now this is the kind of pile
that I can wear to work every day this
is the kind of everyday neutral palette
that I can wear during the fall time
wear to school wear to teach where to do
all that kind of stuff so this is
definitely a palette that I'm interested
in I have already gone ahead and placed
my order
like I said I did place my order this
morning it was kind of a hot mess
because I feel like it's always a hot
mess with color pop now when it comes to
their eyeshadow palettes but I'm very
excited to go ahead and pick this up as
well as review it for you guys all right
up next guys we actually have a chart a
brush set here so although I have talked
about not loving every single Tarte
palette that comes out during the
holiday season specifically again their
ice shadow palettes I will say their
brush sets are fantastic and this set
right here is called the treasured tools
a brush set it is $44 for five full size
of brushes it looks like you have a nice
kind of contour or powder brush you also
have an under eye setting brush you have
a highlighting brush you have a blending
brush and then also a foundation a brush
now I loved my Nicole conceal EO tart
sets that I got it during at the spring
time last year as well as the holiday
set from last year which was also a
brush set so of course I have to go
ahead and pick this up I already placed
my order again I will have my review up
for you guys next week but yea if
there's one thing that I would recommend
purchasing from Tarte during the holiday
season it is one of their brush sets
alright guys moving on if entia Beauty
is releasing a two-night so the whole
entire collection is releasing on let's
see here their website as well as on the
sephora.com website at midnight Pacific
Standard Time so I'm very very
interested
Rhianna has stated that this is a
cruelty-free brand which is awesome so
I'm pretty excited I feel like there are
a lot of products here and some of them
don't look at that amazing like these
smaller little brushes I don't really
get the point of those I'm not really
understanding the blotting powder the
cream highlighting sticks you guys know
I'm not really into that sort of thing
but I will say the double-ended
highlighters or like the little
highlighter duo's are definitely
intriguing me and then it looks like
they have like a foundation or concealer
and I would also like to try out so I
definitely will be picking up the
foundation or concealer as well as one
of little highlighting duos and I will
for sure it be reviewing that for you
guys I know a lot of people are saying
this reminds them of like the k'kaw sort
of collection and I don't know I'm not
really getting those sort of vibes but
of course I have to go ahead and review
this stuff for you guys and I will
you know if it's good or if it's so
that will happen next week but yeah I
will be purchasing those tonight and
then up next guys I know I have already
talked about the new Anastacio Beverly
Hills a blush kits as well as the new
goloka that we'll be releasing for the
holiday season but I have a better
picture here to show you guys so will
hands down be purchasing probably the
later blush kit as well as for sure and
the actual glow kit so the glow kit has
a marshmallow as well as butterscotch
from the what was it called the sweets
glow kit which I do have and then I also
have starburst now I never got the gleam
glow kit - which is everybody's favorite
so I'm very excited that starburst is in
there and the gumdrop looks like a
really nice kind of sandy color and I
feel like that would work for my skin
tone currently so will for sure be
purchasing that you guys know I love the
honest usnea Beverly Hills of glow kits
and then the blush kits look very
interesting so one of them is super
super dark and this is just not going to
be flattering for my skintone so I won't
be purchasing that one but the lighter
one you can bet your ass that I'm going
to be getting so you have four different
blushes here one is a little more of a
cool tone pink you have a warmer kind of
bronzy color more of a plum kind of
color and then a bobby color I hope that
we get better pictures of these soon
because I feel like this is not a great
representation of what they probably
look like but definitely getting those
you guys I'm super super excited and
those will be releasing it very soon
they said it in October so yeah very
excited for those alright up next guys
we have some products here from bite to
beauty now every single year I always
get their little lipstick or a little
bite to remix set that they come out
with which is $25 they usually have like
a lip gloss set or they'll have you know
like a lip gloss and lipstick pairing or
they just have lipsticks you know but
they have a great little set that they
release every single year they're
cruelty free they're vegan I mean these
products are literally edible they're
food grade okay I love this as far as
lip sets are concerned especially for
twenty-five dollars so this little sneak
peak right here it looks like when you
zoom in you can actually see that this
has some of their crema lip glosses
which are kind of like I think they're
sort of dual crown glosses from what I
remember so I might be interested in
this one or just a little one that comes
in the red tin which they do every
single year but I will for sure be
purchasing one of them so I'm very
excited to go ahead and review that for
you guys because I'm gonna do a then and
now on that as well which is a series
where I compare it last year set or the
previous year set to the new set and
this is something that I collect every
single
so will for sure be getting that alright
guys up and next I have talked a little
bit about the Kat Von D saint and sinner
pallets but hell yeah I'm getting this I
regret not getting the movie of me being
a local it but need a local palette
every single year I love my metal matte
palette this is absolutely something I'm
getting and now I just love the
packaging I mean it looks absolutely
impeccable now the colors I know a lot
of people were saying you get like four
different white colors in there and all
this kind of stuff I feel like we're not
seeing a good enough lighting here yet
to actually determine what these colors
truly look like but one side is very
colorful which is supposed to be the
center side and the one side is a little
more light and you have more everyday
friendly sort of colors which again I
can go to work with and I could probably
you know pull off the brighter colors
for work as well because I work at a
conservatory not like a you know private
or public kind of school setting so they
they allow us a little more leeway but
yeah I just feel like this looks like a
great palette I love the formula that
she comes out with during the holiday
season although I'm not a huge fan of
every single eyeshadow palette that she
has released I always loved her colorful
one so I'm for sure going to be
purchasing this so let me know if you're
gonna get it as well and down at Bulow
alright guys up next Urban Decay yes
bigger releasing a urban decay naked
skin what is it called naked skin
cushion foundation so I have to say
although Urban Decay doesn't have it the
most like consistent brand in my opinion
and their base products and their face
products are really really good I like
their powder highlighters or like their
powder blushes and their concealers
their color correctors their foundations
are impeccable some other eyeshadow
palettes I feel like they're a little
inconsistent and a little unreliable if
you know what I'm saying but overall I
will say this looks like it's gonna be
 fantastic now I am someone who
definitely definitely has not been into
those full coverage foundations any more
I love a good cushion foundation but a
lot of Christian foundations are not
cruelty free so this is something I am
for sure going to be picking up it looks
like it's gonna release first in
Singapore which totally makes sense
since they are very much into this sort
of a foundation application over there
you know like cushion compacts and
things like that but yeah very excited
for this and the packaging looks out of
this world alright guys and finally
palate I will for sure be purchasing
this holiday season I know I already
talked about it in my last video but it
is the cover FX highlighting a palette I
just can't say no to this it looks it
beautiful I know a lot of people were
saying will it work you know for your
skin tone it looks so similar to the
Nicole Guerrero I feel like these ones
are gonna be a little more of like a
smoother finish the Nicole Guerrero
definitely has like a high shine impact
I feel like these are gonna be a little
more wearable I love that there's one
kind of duochrome shade in there I love
it that there's some bronzing shades in
there because you can use those as a
bronzer or the blush topper if you do
have a fair complexion and then those
lighter shades just look beautiful
especially that pink that cool tone pink
is just calling my name I feel like it's
a great deal it's a great value set so
absolutely going to be picking that up
as well so anyway guys that is it those
are the I guess around one of products
that I will be picking up during the
holiday season let me know what you
think down below and let me know if you
want me to do a part to you if I have
some more but yeah pretty much that's my
wish list and for sure the products that
I will be purchasing so that's it for
this video guys thank you so much for
joining me how many times can I say
that's it that's literally it
alright I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
