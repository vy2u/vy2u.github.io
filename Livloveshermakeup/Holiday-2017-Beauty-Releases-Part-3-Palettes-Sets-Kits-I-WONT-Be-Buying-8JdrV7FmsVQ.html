my channel thank you so much for joining
me today I wanted to walk you guys
through part three in my holiday 2017
the beauty releases series now if you
missed part one or two I'll go ahead and
throw it up in the cards for you guys
part one was talking about brands that I
would recommend you guys looking to
during the holiday season as well as
brands that I would recommend you avoid
party was talking all about palettes and
sets and kids that I will be purchasing
during the holiday season and today
we're gonna be talking about some pallet
sets and kids that I will be avoiding
and not purchasing it during the holiday
season so let's go ahead and start this
off with a big bang the lorac mega pro 4
I am NOT going to be buying it now you
guys know I have had a little bit of
issues lately when it comes to lorac and
their cruelty-free status I was getting
a yes and no answers from different
lorac representatives which really
really bothers me it's either your
cruelty free or you're not I don't want
to hear a back and forth on who yes oh
no you know I really don't like that so
that was the first alarm that went off
in my head a second of all you guys know
that I really do love at the pro formula
from lorac but I do find that they tend
to money together I did a video a couple
of days ago or maybe it was about a week
ago which I'll go ahead and throw up in
the cards but talking about palettes
that really do kind of money together
palettes I have a lot of kick up and a
lot of powdery mess basically now that's
never really been a huge issue for me I
still really enjoy at my lorac Pro
palette but I have to say looking at the
color selection on this particular
palette I'm a little worried now I'm all
for pastel and cool toned colors you
guys know me I love cool tone colors I
naturally have a cool undertone in my
skin right now I'm Sol tan so I may look
a little more on the warm tone side but
I naturally do have a cool undertone in
my skin so when I look at these colors
they really do speak to me but knowing
that this formula is a little on the
muddy side I don't feel like I need to
be able to differentiate where I put
certain colors on my eyes I am NOT a
professional when it comes to makeup and
I don't feel like this is gonna be a
palette that looks pretty on my eyes
because I just don't have those blending
skills so if you are someone who has
never tried the lorac Pro formula you're
really hoping that all of these would
really pop on your eyes and maybe you're
kind of a beginner and makeup or you're
not you know an expert like me honestly
I feel like this is gonna be a palette
that you might want to avoid I know they
have a ton of different color selections
the lorac pro 1 is a really fantastic
palette if you're looking for an
everyday sort
Hallet but for me this just looks like
something that's going to money together
on my eyes I'm not going to be able to
differentiate between the colors and I
already know this is not gonna be
looking good on me so that is why I will
not be purchasing it at the lorac mega
Pro 4 up next we have a rather shocking
one this is the hourglass holiday 2017
limited edition ambient metallic strobe
lighting a palette you guys know I am
crazy about hourglass and this does
retail for $62 and it has a limited
edition shades in here that are a
metallic strobe lighting powder now
originally I thought that these were
just going to be the strobing powder
formula and I kind of looked at the
palette and I thought hey I sort of have
full sizes that looks similar to that
this guy right here it's called
incandescent light which is a little
more pink tone this guy right here is
called brilliant light which is a little
more golden and I definitely have a lot
of full sizes of ambient lighting
powders in my collection now when I saw
swatches of this I realize that this is
a really wham-bam in-your-face kind of
formula one of my favorite things and
one of the things I say over and over
and over about hourglass is the fact
that they have this really beautiful
lit-from-within sort of glow even the
strobing powders even though they do
have a little more particles of like a
high shine glitter and they're very
finely milled but like a high shine
glitter they still look very natural on
the skin so when I was actually looking
at swatches of this I was slightly taken
aback because this is a whole new
formula the metallic sort of finished
and I really wasn't into it after I saw
swatches I really wasn't into it so
that's why I'm not gonna be purchasing
yet I love my ambient lighting powder
formula I love the strobing powder
formula but if I want a high shine sort
of impact with a highlighter I'll go
through my wet and wild you know facial
a sort of highlighters right here this
one right here is called precious petals
these are gorgeous I have a lot of you
know powders in my collection that can
give me a high shine look for 399 499 so
that's not really what I want from
hourglass I also feel like I am really
on overload when it comes to hourglass I
have a lot of products that are similar
to one another so I don't personally
feel like I need this in my collection
if you are new to hourglass and you want
to scoop it up and let me know what you
think of it but ya won't be purchasing
that all right up next we have three a
different blush palettes here from Tarte
cosmetics now normally you guys know I
do kind of pick up the depart holiday
palette I
I absolutely hate the big bunch of books
I will be declaring on my second one and
as I try out the first one I can't
remember if I tried out the first one I
don't like any of those but I will say
their holiday formula isn't horrible
it's not like the full-size products but
it's not horrible I have the 2014
palette here which I love this is
probably my favorite one I know it had
really bleep bulky packaging but I love
the color selection in here I absolutely
adore at my touches of blush palette
which was made here in the US beautiful
beautiful very similar to the full-size
Amazonian clay blushes and then last
year's palette was pretty damn good I'm
not a huge fan of the highlight in here
but I'm not gonna say that this was a
bad palette because this is pretty darn
good now when I was looking at the color
selection for this year and the palace
that they're coming out with the first
one is called the blush the star and the
second one is called the blush and bliss
palette and the third one is called the
cheek charmer so the cheek charmers are
just little deluxe sizes of the blushes
and then you have the blush of bliss
which is kind of a layout similar to the
Tartus blush palette and then you have
the blush Bazaar which is the layout of
last year's holiday palette I'm not
feeling these warm toned colors and I
know that sounds really really strange I
just feel like I have so many warm toned
blushes in my collection and I love that
they did something different because if
you look and you open up a lot of these
blush palettes from Tarte you can tell
they really kind of stick in the neutral
category they do a lot of pugs they do a
lot of pink colors but I'm really not
feeling the the warm tone colors and I
know I'm not really talking you guys out
of purchasing anything here but for me
personally I know it's kind of just a
superficial and artificial explanation
but I'm not feeling the colors and I
don't think it's something that I would
reach for all that often I have enough
warm toned blushes in my collection I do
pull a strong cool undertone I look
better in light pink and pinky tone to
blushes but I have it this new little
honest Aussie a Beverly Hills blush trio
and peachy keen absolutely love it is
filling out my need for warm toned
blushes and here is my NYX single in the
shade cinnamon this is like the most
gorgeous orange toned blush you could
ever get and I did notice in in these
holiday palettes there are a lot of red
tones as well I do not look good in red
tone blushes it really brings out just a
readiness in my complexion so I know
that's a little bit of a superficial or
artificial reason I'm not really talking
you guys out of purchasing yet I
wouldn't say go ahead and purchase you
know the brown one if you guys want to
get a nice blush palette I think it is
very similar
when I looked over the ingredients as
last year's palette so if you're into
the colors I would definitely go for it
but for me personally I'm not going to
be picking up any of those all right up
next we have these Stila Holliday kits I
will not be picking up the liquid
lipstick it although I'd really do like
these stay all day liquid lipstick
formula it's pretty good not the
eyeliner I can't remember they may have
this sale they sort of formula for the
lips it's pretty darn good I still find
it a little on the dry side very similar
to the cap on deed liquid lipstick so if
you like that you might enjoy those but
yeah I just personally won't be picking
up a huge set of liquid lipsticks I
don't wear liquid lipsticks enough to be
able to justify that and then we have
the Stila glitter and glow there is a
little trio set to theirs out so let's
see here one two three four five six a
little six texts that you can get and I
personally will not be getting this
either because I have eight different
full sizes of these Tila glitter and
glows again a little bit of a
superficial or artificial reason not to
want to take something up this is
actually something that I would
recommend to you guys I love these Tila
glitter and glows they are absolutely
amazing if you are going to get them go
ahead and like tack them on to the lid I
see a lot of people don't like these
because they kind of swipe them onto the
lid there definitely one of those really
interesting glitters that are bound into
a really nice kind of ah nothing like a
sticky formula they just have this
really really beautiful kind of smooth
you know watery consistency that they're
blended into and if you just tap them on
top of your lid when you're done with
your eyeshadow they look amazing and
they really give a beautiful glow so
that's another you know palette or set
to that I would definitely recommend you
guys look into if you're interested in
this deal liquid or closely because this
is a really good value set but for me
personally I already have enough of
these in full size I wanted to talk
about that because a lot of people were
asking me anyway
alright guys and finally we have two
different skincare sets here the first
one is from Tasha Harper this is Colby
glow for its stats now this is a
cruelty-free brand I believe somewhere
her products are vegan as well I have
tried out to be resurfacing masks I
thought it was pretty good but the other
product that I've tried out from them I
was not so impressed with I wasn't so
impressed with know this little guy
right here does reach out for $60 which
I still feel like it seemed really
really large amount I feel like you can
get a lot of skincare sets around the
holiday season for a lot cheaper like
literally if you go to the gifts section
on Sephora you can find them for you
know under $25 you can find them for
under $10 even and I just feel
this is something that I don't want to
spend my money on I already got the
drunk elephant skincare cept and that
was like a whopping that was around $90
but I feel like you get more bang for
your buck although this does look
intriguing I know a lot of you want me
to try out more taught to Harper Harper
products this is just not something that
I will be picking up thank you for
attacking me and it's that way and then
finally the first aid beauty this is
called it the tales of fattest cannon
this is a $52 set it is a 110 dollar
value you get a lot of product in here
but I have to tell you guys I know so
many of you want me to love first a
beauty but I doubt I don't like anything
that I've tried for them I find it that
their products go bad very very quickly
especially for skincare when you're like
me and you have a large collection and
you kind of swap out your skincare on a
weekly basis that is just not good
second of all I hate the smell of their
products um a lot of people tell me they
don't have since they don't have sense
but for some reason I always get this
very musky strange odor with any sort of
products that I try for them and third
of all did they do a lot for my skin
I've tried that whipped um you know it's
like a body butter or face butter try
that on my face it really didn't take
care of dry skin for me I've tried out
their serum I wasn't a huge fan of that
there is not a lot that I've tried out
from the first day Beauty lined that I
like so again thank you for tagging me
in that but that is something that will
be staying away from for the holiday
season so anyway guys those are some
pallet sets and kids that I will not be
purchasing I will definitely do another
kind of version of an anti haul on some
more if I see some more products that
I'm not going to be buying but I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
