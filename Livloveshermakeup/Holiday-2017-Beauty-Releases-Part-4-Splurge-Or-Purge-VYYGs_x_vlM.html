channel today I have part 4 in my
holiday 2017 a beauty releases series to
share with you guys if this is going to
be called a splurge or purge and
basically it's just a will I buy a video
the difference between antique halls
will I buy it's like wishlist videos is
it's kind of like a combination of an
antique Hall and a wish list my friend
Samantha March actually created this
particular series on YouTube and she
talks about four or five different new
makeup releases every single week on
Wednesdays so I'll go ahead and link her
channel as well as this playlist down
below or her playlist for the entire
series and she'll talk about it on
camera and go off of trend mood ones
Instagram which normally I get all of my
makeup news from trend mood one she's
just really really on top of everything
so I really like to follow her but she
always like goes ahead and leaves like a
lot of different info before the product
actually releases some people say it's a
little shady of her she's been a little
shady in the past Sofie or Sophia the
girl who does run trend mood but I
always think it's really nice cuz I want
to know how much product I'm getting I
want to know when it's gonna release all
that good stuff so anyway I'm like I
said it will I buy it is basically me
talking through and kind of deciding on
camera will I splurge and go ahead like
first impressions wise like yeah I'm
gonna get that or will I purge it off my
wishlist and basically out of my brain
and say yeah I'm not gonna get that so
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
want to start with the Kat Von D metal
crush palette this has seventeen
thousand nine hundred thirty four likes
on the Instagram page already which is
crazy for trend move that's a lot a lot
of people thought this was going to be a
shadow palette I wish you would have
done an eye shadow palette and a
highlighting palette but yeah this is
actually a highlighting palette we do
not know what the inside looks like at
all but what I can say is that look at
that rainbow kind of effect I feel like
she is going to be doing more of like a
colorful highlighting palette which is
so in right now that's so on-trend I'm
kind of like the Aurora glow Couture
moon child so I'm very excited for this
and on top of that the metal crush
eyeshadows are fantastic so the fact
that she's going to make that into like
a highlighter formula which a lot of
people use those eye shadow singles
and highlight anyway this is just it's
very exciting so I'm going to go ahead
and say splurge for this one for now
once we look at the inside we shall see
but yeah it does include three different
highlighters with 0.08 ounces of product
each so I'll keep you guys updated on
that but so far I'm gonna go with large
for sure alright up next week
should have a Becca palette here it's
funny I already picked up the what is it
the sister palette to this which is the
face palette this is the apply ski glow
collection eye palette I keep seeing it
and I was a little confused I thought
that these were like little minis of the
shimmering skin perfecter press but
they're not this is called an eye lights
palette it is already available at Becca
cosmetics as well as on the sephora.com
website you have eyes shadows in Pearl
rose quartz moonstone opal topaz toasted
marshmallow and hot cocoa $45.00 it just
looks so incredibly like basic to me
when I look at it every single time I've
been talking about holiday beauty
releases this hasn't come up because I
forget about it like it just looks very
very boring to me however like I said I
did get the face palette I love Becca
face products in general so I'll go
ahead and review that for you guys
tomorrow but this eye palette here does
not get me excited and I mean how do we
know that it's actually like an
eyeshadow formula and they're not just
going ahead and repackaging the actual
highlighters into tiny little pans I
feel like you're better off going ahead
and getting the actual face palette but
I'm gonna go ahead and say purge for
this it's gonna go right off the
wishlist it was never really on the
wishlist
but it's just it's it's out of my brain
it's purged off my brain okay I'm done I
don't need it it looks very basic and
you don't have anything that's matte and
there's just kind of weird it's like
kind of strange product let me know what
you guys think down below
alright up next I'm gonna have my
thoughts on this baby this is the new
Tarte cosmetics tartlet toasted
eyeshadow palette it is dropping for
fall 2017 holiday 2017 on October 15th
on their website you get a mixture of
matte and shimmery shades in here
trimmer array shades and as you guys can
see it's all warm tone so originally I
was like I don't need that but you guys
know I on turtle lot but I will say
my favorite favorite formula from them
is the tartlet in bloom I also love the
rainforest that the C eyeshadow palettes
but I have to say this is my favorite
formula they come up with so many
different goddamn eyeshadow palettes and
none of them are a good formula usually
so I I want this because I feel like
finally they're going ahead and doing
something with that awesome formula that
they already have the Amazonian clay
formula it's like made here in the US
it's just buttery and silky easy to
blend goes on great has a nice like
cocoa scent to it so I'm
excited for this I know I know it's all
warm tone shape I have colors like that
in my collection but I love this formula
I know what it's capable of because I am
able to use my tartlet in bloom and
literally blend out my eyeshadows in
like two minutes so I want to get this
I'm definitely interested October 15th
I'm gonna go ahead and say splurge are
you guys moving on I've got a little
friend here I have not introduced her on
camera yet she's freaking out right now
and shaking because she's scared of the
camera but she was scraping on the door
and she wanted to come out this is
Khaleesi this is my new fair that I
adopted she's super super tiny as you
guys can see I'm just gonna put her on
my lap and kind of wrap this video up
because she was clawing at the door why
were you crying and now you're shaking
you wanted to come out and I'm you're
scary anyway guys I'm moving on we have
the new a color pop what is this my
little ponies collection so inside of
here you are getting a brush set or you
can buy a separately brush set for $22
makeup bag for 18 pressed powder
eyeshadow palette for 16 a press powder
highlight and star flower and trickles
eight dollars each
super shocked super shocked super
shocked I cannot talk today shadow and
cherries Jubilee Posey and Sunbeam those
are $5 age can you not eat my makeup off
that'd be great ultra glossy lip in
flutter Valley Dream Castle and Pony
lands those are six dollars each ultra
matte lip and lemon drop Moondancer
dream castle six dollars each you can
also get sets you can buy the whole PR
package which I don't recommend doing PR
packages are such a waste of life space
in my opinion they just do really really
extravagant things and it's like extra s
buck for no reason whatsoever
why are you freaking out now okay I'm
gonna put you on the floor there you go
don't make any noise she'll probably do
horrible things anyway you can get the
whole PR package for $135 and they also
give you a sticker sheet I don't know
they're my little clown thing that was
kind of like 80s wasn't it I'm a 90s
child I did not play with my little pony
I played with Bratz dolls they had I
shadow all the way up to their eyebrow
and I was like yes yes but then you can
also just get set 1 which is the makeup
bag makeup brushes all makeup and a
sticker sheet for 110 not be buying
those sets for sure but you know I mean
I'm not gonna like the pressed powder
eyeshadow palette definitely did catch
my attention it's only $16 and I just
feel like that's really good price you
guys know I've been loving these super
shock
it's not super shock I hate those ones
I've been loving depressed
powder eyeshadow formula from them but I
have to say I watch undream Italiano's
review on these and although I look that
I look that she had going on it seemed
like the sort of thing that I could
create with the belle of the ball a
little quartet or a little club that I
have from colour-pop so I don't feel the
need to get this um I mean lately I've
just been feeling like I need everything
that has to do with that press powder
eyeshadow formula but this one I just
don't need okay sorry this video is
gonna need quite a bit of editing I feel
like I've been piecing together Clips
lately in certain videos mostly just
reviews cuz like it's easier with
reviews but when it comes to stuff like
this like I'd rather just talk through
all in one take but my ferret's are both
just sick right now they both have like
a upper respiratory infection I won't go
into details it's making me sad so like
if they're scraping on the door I want
to go get down but anyway she's fine
let's move on I really don't think that
I'm gonna be picking up anything from
the colour-pop My Little Pony collection
I'm just not interested ah the awful
glossy lips look pretty but I don't need
them so I'm gonna say purge purge for
sure alright guys and finally we have
the complete collection of Fenty Beauty
they're coming out with a holiday 2017
collection they just released and now
they're doing holiday like release
that's amazing like oh yo this is the
galaxy collection and it says colorful
shades you have like an eyeshadow
palette yeah I don't know when I look at
this eyeshadow color I think of kid
makeup I don't want to I don't want to I
want to think that this is gonna be
great quality but I really don't know
anyway colorful shades a purple
holographic packaging you do get four
lipsticks there are four glosses in the
collection three eyeliners and the
eyeshadow palettes plus and I brush it
will be available October 13th on their
website and at Sephora and my thoughts
on this are I I don't know I'm so torn
I'm so torn like that I shadow palette
it looks like it's all shimmers and very
very colorful but not like bold colors I
feel like my Kat Von D safety center has
kind of like filled the need for
colorful eyeshadow palettes for the
holiday season I guess I'm just nervous
okay because like Fenty yes they have
been having like great reviews with
their foundation and all sorts of
different things I haven't tried any of
their products yet cuz I'll be doing a
first impressions for you guys on the
foundation on Friday but they've been
really I would say overall it's been
like a solid 3.5 4 stars across the
board people seem to really like the
collection but
how do we know this eyeshadow palettes
gonna be good I'm the eyeshadow palettes
are so difficult to do like can they get
it right right off the bat I don't know
I don't know it makes me nervous
I know I could return it if I needed to
but I'm gonna have to see perche guys
I'm gonna have to go with purge I just
want to see other reviews and I don't
want to be the one reviewing yeah you
know like I'm sure a lot of you are
gonna say like okay I'm gonna wait for
lives review on that well I I think I'm
gonna wait for other people's review
first we'll see what people say um I
believe someone said desi Perkins did a
video but she had like a lot of cuts in
it and like editing and you couldn't
really see how everything was blending
so maybe I'll stop by and check out that
video I do like desease Channel she's
great at makeup but I don't know you
guys I don't know it's kind of
lackluster that palette is looking but
like I want to love it because I love
everything about fenty like it the whole
collection the concept everything but
yeah I'm gonna have to go with purge I'm
gonna have to go with purge and same
with the glosses the lipsticks and the
three eyeliners so anyway guys not an
except for this will I buy a video is
definitely a little more chatty sorry
had a few interruptions but I hope you
guys enjoy the video thank you so much

thoughts are down below on these
products and I will see you guys
