welcome back to my channel today I have
a quick little rundown review and kind
of a little bit of a demo for you guys
on four different holiday and fall 2017
releases basically I feel like this
video is gonna be kind of a jumbled mess
but I really wanted to be able to review
all of these before you guys without
doing separate videos I just don't have
time for that right now I am so
incredibly behind on video so I just
wanted to go ahead and push these all
together I'm gonna leave timestamps down
below if you would like to skip to a
search in a section but I do have the
cover FX perfect highlighting palette
for holiday 2017 to share with you guys
I also have the charts and goddess Club
highlighter I do have a little demo that
I'm going to insert on the treasure
tools of brush sets I did speed up the
footage just to give you guys a little
bit of a heads not normally I don't like
to speed up footage I want you guys to
be able to see everything in real time
but because we are smashing everything
together in one video and it's gonna be
a little bit on the longer side I did go
ahead and speed up the footage and then
finally Becca dude recently sent over
the gradient glow highlighter which is
new for fall 2017 I thought I'd give you
guys my thoughts on that as well so
let's go ahead and start with this baby
right here this is the gradient glow
shimmering skin Perfector press it does
retail for $38 on the ulta.com website
in here you are getting five
best-selling a shimmering skin
perfectors all in one place you are
getting a moonstone opal bronze amber
rose gold and topaz now like I said
originally I had no intention of
purchasing this it looked way too dark
as far as swatches are concerned but I
have been using this as a blush topper
and I actually really do enjoy it I
would say it's very comparable to the
Oprah highlighter and blissful if you do
have blissful I don't feel like you need
it this gradients glow highlighter I
feel like when you mix all of the shades
together you get a really nice kind of
rose gold color with a little bit of a
silver ship it's definitely very
beautiful on the skin but if you have a
porcelain complexion if you are super
super light in skin tone this is not
going to be a true highlighter for you
just a little bit of a heads up now if
you do have a medium complexion or a
deeper complexion I think this is going
to be absolutely gorgeous on you my one
complaint is like why didn't they just
kind of mix these all together and just
make one solid color because although it
looks a very very pretty there's no way
that you can actually take a brush and
fit into those tiny little sections
right there
unless you were actually using like an
eyeshadow brush that is the only thing
that could actually fit in here so I
really gets kind of silly nobody's gonna
go in separately with a brush I feel
like you're gonna have to go ahead and
swirl them all together and you do get a
universal color and that is different
then I've seen other you know Becca
shimmering skin perfectors turn out to
be ice watch this neck - like champagne
pop as well as Prosecco pop and it
really does have its own true identity
it's a really really pretty rose gold
color with a little bit of a silver
shift like I said and overall I mean I
just feel like it's one of those things
where you know they could have just made
it one solid color instead of doing the
whole gradient glow thing but I think
they wanted to do that for packaging
purposes as well so but that is what
this watch looks like as you guys can
see it is definitely a little dark for
me personally but again it's beautiful
as a blush topper very very happy with
this I would definitely give it four out
of five stars
alright - moving on to the cover effects
holiday at 2017 a perfect highlighting
palette this may be right here I would
give 5 out of 5 stars this is very very
comparable to the Anastacio Beverly
Hills glow kits in my opinion now it's
very comparable to the four pan pallets
of stars the formula is concerned and
it's very comparable to the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills Nicole Guerrero Guillou
kit as far as color selection is
concerned but if this is what it looks
like on the inside you are getting
beautiful package for $39 here you can
purchase this on Ulta which is where I
purchased mine you do get a huge mirror
here which you never get in the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills glow kits you do get a
sticker with the actual names on the
back and some of these you can actually
purchase in full side in the liquid of
form so you want to pair them together
and really get like wham-bam in your
face kind of highlight I believe you can
go ahead and do so with this particular
palette the shades we have in here are
blossom which I do have on today we have
prism rose gold golden peach celestial
and gilded you guys will be able to see
if you do it stay tuned for the rest of
the video you'll be able to see me apply
a bellossom and I went in a very lightly
but you can still see it the pigment is
quite bare and I mean I would for a
little more light makeup in general
today but I still feel like these are
very very like seen from outer space
kind of highlights however and they
aren't glittery none of them are
glittery now if you're looking at this
and saying okay well I'm very fair
complected how will I be able to use
these or how will I be able to get some
of these shades to work for me
personally
I can go with four of these as a true
highlighter and two of them as blush
topper so the shades that I can wear as
a true highlight are definitely this one
right here which is called blossom I can
also wear golden peach that's the one I
had on in yesterday's video if you guys
were curious I definitely can wear this
shade right here which is called
celestial and I definitely can wear this
one right here which is called prism the
only ones that I would really consider
too dark are this one which is called a
rose gold and also gilded the olden I
can actually use as a bronzer it looks
like it might be kind of sparkly but
it's not whatsoever and then golden
peach I can also use as a blush topper
or a bronzer so I feel like I'm getting
a lot of use out of this palette you
guys can see I've been digging in there
and definitely the color selection
reminds me of the Nicole Guerrero glow
kit so if you were not a fan of the
formula on this if you felt like it was
too chunky too much sparkles or you just
never were able to get your hands on it
because it was a limited edition I think
this is a really really good one to pick
up now as far as formula is concerned
it's not similar to the Nicole Guerrero
it's definitely similar to their 4 pan
palettes that they come out with as far
as honest hacia Beverly Hills blow kits
are concerned so I would say it's more
like this one very very nice kind of
finely milled and not too glittery and
not chunky and this is definitely a
little more powdery but I feel like they
go on and they have that really like
baked Chalet sort of highlight look they
really mold into your skin they have a
high shine metallus eyes sort of finish
and this is just a really really
wonderful highlighting palette and this
is for sure the best highlighting
product that I have found for the
holiday 2017 season so far I definitely
want to go ahead and also compare this
to the new honest toffee a Beverly Hills
glow kit which I did a pick up I did
pick up at the blush kit in radiant I
also did pick up let's see your the
prism palette which I'll be reviewing
and also in the new glow kit so I'm
excited to see how that compares to this
but so far this is definitely an item
that I would recommend to so many
different people it doesn't emphasize
texture does it look bad on the skin it
looks great on the skin I feel like it
would work for like a multitude of
different skin tones very very impressed
with the holiday 2017 cover FX perfect
highlighting palette moving up right
along we have the Tarte rainforest of
the sea limited edition goddess glow
highlighter yes you heard that correctly
this is part of the rainforest of the
sea a limited edition a collection now
this is not worthy of being part of the
rainforest of the sea collection from
Tarte cosmetics store cosmetics and that
rainforest of the sea Cola
was one of the best collections they
have ever come out with hands down I
mean I'm not the biggest fan of tart in
general I have started to like them a
little more lately I've been a little
happier but I feel like around the
holiday season I'm kind of like no thank
you but yes this is part of the
rainforest of the sea collection and
this retails for $35 right now it is
averaging about a 2 to 3 star rating on
the sephora.com website I would give it
1 to 2 stars and the only reason why I
would give it 1 to 2 stars is because
you do get a whopping 12 grams of
product in here
it is packaged beautifully a nice sized
mirror you have a nice snap closure here
I really like what they did as far as
the packaging is concerned and the
aesthetic I think is really cool
but I will say this is not a good
highlight you guys it's very patchy on
the skin it doesn't look beautiful on
the skin I feel like even if you have
really oily skin and even if you had
just the smoothest skin ever this would
still go on and it would still emphasize
texture and just the fine lines and
wrinkles and all that kind of that
you don't want on your face it's got
glitter infused in here it's a dry as
sandpaper a sort of formula it looks
beautiful and I want to love it however
I don't I tried it with so many
different brushes I've tried it with a
fan brush I've tried it with like a
really nice kind of don't brush like
this one right here from the treasured
tools brush set I've also tried it with
you know might luck see a tapered
highlighting brush my Sigma tapered
highlighting brush this highlight does
not work for me it is going back to the
store I will be returning it I know I
talked about it in my September 2017
beauty returns but overall you guys this
is just one of those things that I would
say stay away from when it comes to the
holiday season ok this is definitely 1
or 2 stars out of 5 going ahead and
returning that and finally guys I want
to go ahead and talk about the charger
tools the brush set I'm gonna go ahead
and insert some demo clips as I talk
about these this does a retail core
let's see here
I haven't pulled up right here
forty-four dollars on the charts comma
website inside of here you are getting
for a different face brushes and then
you are getting one eye brush now they
did also release another set on the
sephora.com website as well as their
website this one is called the limited
edition artful accessories brush set now
this one has three face brushes and two
at little eye brushes both of these do
come with a beautiful little compartment
to put your brushes in it is really
really nice i currently have mine over
on one of my little
and I have my backup primers and they're
currently really really nice packaging
really do enjoy what's going on here as
far as packaging is concerned but yeah
the reason why I didn't want to pick up
at the artful accessories is just
because I prefer tart face brushes over
there eye brushes so that's why I went
ahead and picked up the treasured tools
brush set instead of the artful
accessories so anyway you are getting
five at different brushes in here let's
go ahead and start with the first one
and this is an angled a foundation a
brush you can use these things for
basically a multitude of different like
purposes if you want to you can apply
concealer with this you can go ahead and
fly your foundation with this your
powder as you can see in the little
devil clip here I'm applying my
concealer you can also do color
corrector and then I'm taking my
foundation and basically going in
downward stroking emotions I notice if I
do too much circular motions this really
does pick up a lot unlike my peach fuzz
and little tiny bits of texture on my
face I wouldn't necessarily recommend
you guys do tons of circular motion
unless you have really really nice
smooth skin when it comes to to
foundation up brushes but I really do
like this isn't as good as see these
Sigma f80 a foundation of brush I prefer
that one just because it's a flat top
and it really oh really blends it nicely
and covers a little more surface area
but overall I feel like this is a really
nice brush and I'm very happy with it
and look at the cute little packaging
all right up next guys we have this
angled brush right here as you can see
in the demo clip I am using my Tarte
Muro Muro butter bronzer in the shade Oh
bronzer to apply this and I just really
like this I have a little bit of like
flimsy bristles these are cruelty free
they aren't vegan if you guys are
curious it's very very soft but it's
perfect for bronzer if you don't want
something too precise and - in fact I'm
not great at blending my bronzer so I do
prefer having a brush that has a little
more fluff to it so I really do like
this one very very beautiful up next we
have the blusher brush so this one I've
been having a little bit of difficulties
with I have been finding and that this
sheds quite a bit now it's only shedding
when I'm actually washing it not when
I'm putting it on my face how bad is it
when you start putting a brush on your
face and actually starts leaving hairs
on your face like no thank you
that's not doing that
it this is not doing that particular
thing but I do feel like it kind of
starts to fall apart when I am washing
it which I also don't like and now you
guys can see as well it wasn't glued and
properly here at the ferrule so I feel
like it starting to fall apart a little
bit as well it's not the most amazing a
blush brush I've ever had I've had
better blusher brushes from charge
cosmetics but it still is pretty cute
and it does apply a blush topper as well
as blush quite nicely so and that is the
blush brush up next we have the little
domed brush here this is what I like to
use for highlighting you can also go
ahead and use it for color correcting
blending and concealer setting your
under eye whatever you want to use it
for but I really like it for powder and
baked Soleil highlighters I feel like it
picks up the right amount of product but
you can still tap it off and it won't
get stuck in the bristles here it's a
beautiful really really soft is super
super gorgeous on the scan and I like to
go ahead and kind of swipe it on and
then blend in circular motions because I
like to take my highlighter a little
lower onto my cheek area just so it can
kind of brighten up the apples of my
cheeks and I really really enjoy this
this brush right here and the foundation
brush are definitely my favorite I would
literally buy this brush set just for
these two brushes right here and Tarte
brushes in general do lasts a very long
time if you guys are curious and then
finally we have the little eye brush and
now this guy I like to use for nose
contouring and also I actually really do
enjoy it for inner corner highlights but
I do not love the way that it packs on I
guess like eyeshadow I will try foiling
it and I still feel like I kind of get a
little bit of fallout with this now you
can try going ahead and blending your
lower lash line it kept getting in my
actual eyeball so I wasn't a
huge fan of that like I said not the
biggest fan of turds eye brushes I wish
they would have just done a cool set of
eye brushes and then a whole set of face
brushes because these are just such good
quality over here or at least these guys
are but the eye brush has been bad it's
not anything that I'm like mad about but
it definitely is something that I wish
they could have gone ahead and just put
another face brush in so anyway guys out
of this whole entire video what are the
products that I would highly recommend
the most the first one is the perfect
cover FX what to call holiday
2017 Berkman highlighting palette from
cover FX a second place is definitely
the charge treasurer tools brush set
third place is the Becca gradient
highlight and fourth place is definitely
this guy right here this good to know
place
don't buy this highlight okay
it's not that good so anyway I hope this
video was helpful to you guys thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
