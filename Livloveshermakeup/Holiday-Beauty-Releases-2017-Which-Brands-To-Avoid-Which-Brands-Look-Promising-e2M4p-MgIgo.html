channel today I have a viewer requested
video all about holiday beauty releases
for 2017
which brands to avoid and which brands
that look promising so let's go ahead
and jump right into it I have been
purchasing holiday kits for a very very
long time well over 4 years now which is
longer than I had my YouTube channel and
I have noticed that some brands are
really good with their holiday releases
and it's definitely worth picking stuff
up and then some brands really suck and
stuff with their holiday releases so let
me tell you which brands I think you
should avoid for the holiday season the
first one is definitely to face now
Tuesday's always releases the same sort
of thing every single holiday season and
I ended up picking it up every single
holiday season I fall into the hype I
really shouldn't because every single
year I end up decluttering their holiday
palette so I find that a lot of their
holiday palace just have the same a
color layout the same sort of shades
sometimes they'll have a palette that
has a bunch of different colors in it
and the only pop of color you'll see is
like a blue turquoise or even like a
purple shade the rest are all neutral
they're very firmly pressed shadows they
are not the sort of consistency that you
would get from like a chocolate bar
palette and then a lot of the times
they'll throw in like a highlight and a
blush and you'll just have these roads
of neutral colors and you get this big
fat palette with absolutely no mirror
it's cheaply made everything comes in
cardboard packaging and you think you're
getting a lot but unfortunately the
quality is just not good so that is
definitely the first thing I want to
recommend you guys stay away from is Too
Faced holiday eyeshadow palettes they're
absolutely horrendous it looks like this
year they are releasing something called
the best year ever palette which again
you just get a bunch of like rows of
neutral shades with again a little bit
of like a purpley and blue shade thrown
in there you also get HLF sides of the
better than sex mascara and then they're
making it even more childish by throwing
in some stickers that you can decorate
your palette with which some people are
really into I did not like that for
their totally cute eyeshadow palette so
I'm sure as hell not going to pick that
up they are releasing a chocolate ball
to this year which is a little different
so in here you do get the original
chocolate bar palette as well as the
semi-sweet and also you can see bon bons
palette would be matte chocolate chip
palette as well as the white chocolate
chip palette and all three of the
chocolate Soleil bronzers as well as
some of their liquefied lipsticks and
chocolate flavors this look
somewhat interesting if these are the
original true og formula as far as
chocolate bars are concerned you might
enjoy getting this but again I'm going
to skip on that and then finally guys
they are releasing the white chocolate
bar palette for holiday 2017 and it
looks horrendous to me
these are some of the worst colors I
have ever seen as far as the palette is
concerned you have some random green
shades you have a periwinkle shade
thrown in with the shade called cake
batter which is like a true solid
creamsicle like orange creamsicle sort
of color you have a random peach shade
thrown in here and then you have black
sugar which is from the white chocolate
chip palette you have a few kind of
dusty grayish tones I mean this palette
just looks so uninteresting to me and I
am not intrigued in any way shape or
form but also going to be passing on
this so I don't think this looks good
again if it is the original true
chocolate bar formula and you really
like the colors I think that that might
be something you want to pick up for me
I'm looking at that I'm thinking like
whatever happens with like a mint
chocolate chip palette everybody was
saying that they were going to do a
chocolate bar mint chocolate chip
you know version whatever happened to
some nice beautiful dusty pink colors
you know I know they kind of did that
with the white chocolate chip palette
but this one again doesn't look like
it's going to be friendly for every
single skin tone out there and honestly
the shape looks so uninspiring and how
are you supposed to put you look
together using a dosa shape I just don't
understand I feel like it's going to be
a supplementary palette so yeah
definitely get a skip on that as far as
the base is concerned will not be
freaking up any of their holiday
eyeshadow palette the next brand I want
to talk to you guys about that I would
definitely recommend avoiding is the
tarte eyeshadow palette with a release
again super super neutral very firmly
press all of them look exactly the same
I will insert some photos from last
year's collection so you usually get you
know like a little eyeliner as well as a
mascara with a bunch of different
eyeshadows that are all the same sort of
color you also do get some blushes and
bronzers usually in a separate palette
or towards the bottom of the palette
kind of like YouTube based ones and I
will say usually there excuse me
usually there holiday of blush palettes
are really really phenomenal and
actually some of like their little lip
kits are really phenomenal as well but
when it comes to their eyeshadow
palettes I just don't think they're good
at quality I feel like again they're
very firmly pressed that they all are
the same they really don't look that
great on the eyes you can't tell if
you're friends when you put
kinda shadows on your eyes I noticed
that they just get really muddied it
together and it's just not a palette no
matter what they release this year is
probably going to be the same as last
year it's honestly something that I
would just stay away from like I said I
use me that their blush talents as well
as their lip kids are pretty darn good
so if you want to pick up a chart
holiday kit I would recommend getting at
their Amazonian clay blush palette which
they release every single year which is
a great value and really good quality
usually or some of their lip kits but
yeah I would definitely stay away from
their eyeshadow palettes you guys and
finally the last round I would let you
guys know that I think you should
probably avoid that this holiday season
is definitely benefit so benefit usually
releases like a cheekathon palette or
some sort of pellet that has all of
their box of blushes in it and I notice
that when I get these kind of kids at
first I really enjoy them but
unfortunately the actual expiration on
there goes by way too fricking quickly
and somehow they start to get very
Chucky and very powdery I also do notice
that when you get them in pala form they
are not the same as full-sized so if
you're hoping oh my god I get that as a
tool I get benefits hoola light I get
Danza line and get all these different
things in one big talent unfortunately
they are not the same as the full-size
I've gone through quite a few of the box
blushes as well as bronzers and I know
that for a fact so what I also recommend
you guys stay away from benefit all
right guys let's talk about some brands
that really look promising this holiday
season
the first one is Besame cosmetics so
they are actually releasing a snow-white
collection and I believe this is going
to hit two before the holiday season you
guys how it looks amazing it's
got pastels in there it's got cool tones
it's got warm tones
everything is very cohesive I like the
way that it lines up I am so interested
in picking that up and then they also
have like a mirror that's going to
relieve they have a highlighting palette
I believe they have some lipsticks I
mean the whole collection looks
absolutely beautiful and like I said I
believe that this is releasing it before
the holiday season but you know what I
feel like that means that they're going
to be good stuff in store as far as
Besame of concern for the holiday season
so very much looking forward to that I'm
also very much looking forward to cap on
B's collection so she's going to come
out with a liquid lipstick vault which
she always does she also is going to
have something thats related to I
believe the Lolita collection again as
far as liquid lipsticks are concerned
and then I said
palate which looks absolutely stunning
Kat Von D is really known for having
these great eyeshadow palettes with a
lot of pops of colors in them and during
the holiday season so I will first sure
be picking it that up and then I also
want to recommend to you guys hourglass
hourglass always has a beautiful
luxurious palette that releases every
single year the one that they released
last year in my opinion really did not
have the greatest tones to it I felt
like it was not a universally flattering
a palette the one at prior to that the
2015 holiday palette was great it would
work on all sorts of different skin
tones but the one last year was really
designated for those of you with like a
fair - light complexion so I hope that
this year they release another one there
really has some deeper tones in there so
that people with a deeper complexion can
work with it - but usually these are
beautiful they do cost $80 so I
purchased it every year because I love
the ambient lighting formula so would
highly recommend you guys check that out
as far as Urban Decay is concerned they
have not shown any like previews of
pictures yet but I will say last year
when they release their urban decay of
ice lipstick talipes the junkie as well
as the black male I would absolutely
blown away ok and I am NOT someone who
huge on lip product so if they release
another lipstick palette would highly
recommend you guys pick that up as far
as like their bike palettes are
concerned some of them are hit and miss
I know that they do release of ice
palace usually in the fall time so if
you're interested in the colors would
recommend checking out if they release
another vici shadow palette but I will
say you do get a mixture of glitter and
few shades in there you get some
shimmers and also some masa master super
silky and buttery which I feel like is a
very consistent thing for Urban Decay
but unfortunately some of those glitter
shades are a little chunky and hard to
work with your next you're going to need
a glitter glue so I just wanted to give
you a heads up another brand that I'm
pretty excited about is Marc Jacobs Marc
Jacobs is a cruelty free a brand their
perfume collection is not that the
makeup is and I've never actually picked
anything up from the holiday collection
but so many people have been saying I
must this year so I think it looks like
they're going to have a maze eyes shadow
palette as well as a collection of a
little lipstick so that's definitely
something I would keep your eye on and
as far as skincare steps or concerns
Sunday Riley relief a badass set last
year so would highly recommend keeping
an eye on all sorts of different skin
care steps but definitely Sunday Riley
and definitely Olay Henriksen they
always have like full 5 products that
you can get for half the
price and everything's full-size in the
kit it's not like little Deluxe's it's
like full-size everything which is
awesome and then finally I want to
recommend you guys definitely check out
some perfume kiss I feel like the cap on
these saints and sinners I get the
feeling that they're going to do a
little perfume kit which would be
awesome a lot of perfumes unfortunately
are not cruelty free but if Kat Von D
does release these full-size seats and
center during the holiday season I am so
picking those up because usually what
brands will do is they will take their
perfumes they will give you full size of
every single one and then cut the price
like so that you're basically paying for
one perfume but you get two or three
which is awesome so would highly
recommend you guys check that out so
anyway I hope this video was helpful let
me know if you would like me to do
another video when we get closer to the
holiday season when all these pallets
actually start to release and we can see
more swatches and we can see more
pictures of the actual product itself
but yeah that is it for this video thank
you as always for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
