today my boyfriend is filming me thank
you boyfriend I'm showing you guys a
really really fun holiday spa water
recipe um I found this on pinterest and
it was actually a disclaimer right away
it is by Audrey Jones she's the one who
made this whole recipe and basically
it's just a spa water recipe with on
apples and cinnamon and all you need is
a picture of water I have a fruit
infused picture so this is where I'm
going to put the fruit but you also need
one cinnamon stick this is from 365
organic these are from whole foods and
then you need to apples you can do
whatever apples you want she recommends
Fuji or let's see here I think she just
recommends Fuji because they're the
sweetest these are gala or they might be
honey Chris I'm not quite sure but I cut
two of those up and I'm just going to
tell you guys what she says about this
it is a famous detox drink and cinnamon
has a lot of health benefits at
including lowering cholesterol fighting
diabetes it helps relieve arthritis pain
and of course I'm apples are high in
vitamin C and B complex so for her
recipe um she recommends having one
Apple that's thinly sliced she said she
likes Fuji because it's sweeter you want
to cut away the seeds I don't have to do
that because i'm using a fruit infused
pitcher like i said and i will link
below where you guys can get that I got
it from amazon Thank You leora for
telling me about it and then she
recommends one cinnamon stick so i'm
going to show you guys how I personally
do it so like I said I cut up to apples
um and I'm just going to put these in
here and I cut them up into little
bite-sized pieces but if you don't have
a fruit infuser like this where it has
like the little vents so that seeds and
the actual pieces of fruit don't go
through when you're drinking it um you
can cut it into bigger slices anyway I
cut about two of these and I'm just
filling it up and then I'm going to
stick my cinnamon stick in right away
because it's kind of big and long and I
want it to be able to fit in there and
I'm just going to keep filling it up
with apple slices little bite-size
those places just until it gets to the
top so about right there and then for me
i'm just going to screw this on and if
you don't have like i said if you don't
have one of these you can just dump it
right into the picture of water but
anyway i'm just going to put this lid on
and I let this infuse for about an hour
and a half in the fridge I recommend
using cold water you can also put ice at
the bottom and then fill it up that way
but look how pretty it is and it looks
really really pretty too if you just put
like the Aqua sizes and the cinnamon
just in the water it's also really
really pretty so I hope you guys enjoy
this recipe I hope that you try it for
the holidays a lot of Christmas drinks
and just holiday beverages in general
are very high in calories so this is
zero calories per glass so I highly
recommend you guys try this out let me
know if you do in the comments below and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
