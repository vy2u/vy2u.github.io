this video I am showing you guys the
tutorial on the look that I've been
wearing all week on my eyes I have
already done this side of my face I'm
going to do this side
but anyway somebody requested that I do
a tutorial using one of the two face
palettes so this is using my Too Faced
natural matte palette I've been using
this all week I really really like this
book I think it really opens the eye up
without looking overdone so let's just
get right into it shall we
the first thing that I already did
off-camera was primed my eyes I used my
Smashbox photo-finish hydrating under
eye primer underneath my eye area and
then on my eyelid I used the lorac
behind the scenes eye primer this one's
getting a little older and it's starting
to get really tacky but it was actually
really really good I feel like it's been
holding my shadows really nicely on my
lid all week
so anyway I'm just gonna kind of pull my
hair out of my face a little bit and we
are just going to go right into it so
this is the Too Faced natural matte
palette I love it it is all matte colors
as you guys probably have guessed and
the reason I'm calling a honey butter is
because this tutorial honey butter
because this shade right here called
honey butter is so beautiful and I'm
going to be wearing that on my lid so
anyway let's get right into it
the first thing I will be doing is
taking my Sigma tapered blending e-40
brush and I'm going to go into the
lightest shade heaven which is right
there I'm going to go in there tap off
the excess and I'm going to put that all
over my lid all the way up to my brow
bone even a little bit underneath my eye
and on the inner corner of my eye next I
will be going in and taking that shade
right there called lace Teddy which is a
beautiful kind of matte like paint color
using the same brush I'm going to be
going in and putting that into my crease
using that as my transition shade just
doing back and forth swiping motions
what do they call it windshield wiper
motions windshield wiper motions not
Swiper anyway just kind of making sure
that I have a nice little transition
color going on there so that when I put
the darker color into my crease it
blends nicely alright next I'm going to
go into my crease brush and I will be
using my sigma tapered blending e35
and I'm going into that shade right
there called strapless that's definitely
my second favorite shade in this palette
putting a little on my brush tapping off
the excess and I'm going to putting that
right into my crease I love this shade
it's like a deep rusty kind of brown
color it is so so beautiful I think it's
gorgeous I really think that this I look
is very flattering if you have
light-colored eyes I think you'd really
like it so just going back and forth
back and forth
like that and then I'm going to go back
to that papered e-40 brush and I'm just
going to blend it back and forth really
really lightly to make sure everything
is completely blended like that next I'm
going to be going in with this um town
brushes this is the c3 30 Pro blending
crease brush it looks like this and I'm
going to be going into that shade right
there called a chocolate cookie it's
really really pretty it's a little more
rusty and warm colored or warm toned
than the strapless shade I'm going to go
in and definitely tap that one off
because it is quite powdery and also
very very pigmented and I'm just going
to place that on the outer corner of my
eye or like the outer V I'm just going
to place that kind of stamp it down
there and then go into the beginning of
my outer crease and just kind of blend
that together just kind of focusing that
on the outer part of my eye and not so
much the inner part then I'm going to go
back to that Sigma e-40 brush oops
that's the e 35 the Sigma e-40 and I'm
just going to blend that but this time
going to do circular motions
like that and then the next thing I'm
going to do is take this little urban
decay dual ended brush I'm going to be
taking that side right there which is
like a flat what is this like shader
brush a flat something brush and I'm
going to go into honey better and I'm
going to put that all over my lid just
kind of stamping that color on there I
love this shade that's why I wanted to
call it honey butter cuz it's so pretty
and I mean honey butter sounds so good
doesn't it like yes I would eat it
alright once I have done that I'm going
to go in with my ELF profession
Primavera my ELF professional eye crease
brush it looks like that
and I'm going to be going back into that
shade strapless and of course tapping
off the excess and going underneath my
lower lash line and kind of just smoking
this out underneath
like that
and then I'm going to be going back into
the e-40 brush I'm going to pick up a
little more of heaven and then I'm going
to go right underneath my brow and on
the inner corner of my eye and then just
kind of make sure everything else is
really nice and blended then I'm going
to be taking my what is this called
Bethany boudoir finishing brush going
underneath to make sure I don't have any
fallout because these are really really
soft powdery shadows so they do get a
little bit of fallout now I'm just going
to be curling my eyelashes using my
Revlon eyelash curler for ten seconds I
like to kind of pump it because I feel
like it really holds a curl then because
I like to wear a lot of mascara and I
don't want my lashes looking like
they're pointing downwards alright then
I'm going to be going into my benefit
they're real mascara I'm going to be
applying one coat of that and then after
I will be applying another coat of
mascara so I'm going to be applying one
coat of this
like that and then still like a while
it's still kind of wet I will be going
in and applying another mascara and the
one I'm using is the L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black and this will really help
to lengthen has a nice little skinny
wand and I'm just going to apply one
coat of that
I love this tiny little Monde it's so
great for reaching those little tiny
lashes on the bottom all right and that
is the lucky guy they feel like it's
really really simple it's very very fast
um and it has taken me literally like I
mean probably what I'm talking it's
about ten minutes long but when I do it
in the morning it really only takes me
about five minutes um what I'm not
really on each eye I guess five minutes
together literally I probably could do
it in five minutes if I wanted to but I
like it because I feel like it really
does open the eye up a little bit I
totally forgot something that's really
crucial the laura geller waterproof
eyeliner eye brightener I was going to
say it opens your eye up because you
have that um white eyeliner on your
waterline and then I start wait a minute
I forgot to put that on but yeah putting
this on the waterline is just going to
make it look even better and really
really open up the eye the reason I like
this white eyeliner is because it has a
little bit of a yellow tone to it so
it's kind of like a banana shade so this
is the laura geller eyecare waterproof
eyeliner in eye brightener so that is
the last step you could do that before
you then put your eyeshadow on but I
forgot not a makeup artist you guys know
that but anyway I really like this look
I feel like it's nice and pretty and um
it makes your you know it makes your
eyes look like a little more open
without like overdoing it and everything
is completely matte so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next one
