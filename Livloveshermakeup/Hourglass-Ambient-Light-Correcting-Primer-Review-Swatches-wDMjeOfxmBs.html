this video I'm giving you a really quick
little review and some swatches on the
new hourglass ambient light correcting
primer did I see that right yes ambient
light correcting primer and the sheet
that I picked up is luminous light there
are three different shades that you can
pick up on these sephora.com website it
will of course link below in the
description bar where you can pick them
up if you are interested but there are
three different colors the first one is
luminous light which is the one I got
and the reason I didn't pick up all
three was because they didn't think all
three of them would be flattering on my
particular skin tone and I don't want to
just pick up items to then just return
them later so I did get a luminous light
the second shade is called mood light
and that's more of a pinky color and
then of course we have dim light which
is the you know I feel like a cult
favorite it's like a beautiful kind of
beachy sandy color so anyway these are
$44 apiece on these sephora.com website
you did get one fluid ounce of product
in here which is about the standard
amount when it comes to a primer usually
they're about one fluid ounce to like
1.35 fluid ounces so you do get about a
standard amount even though the
packaging looks like there's not that
much in there you do get one fluid ounce
weight that quickly but anyway this is
supposed to be a light correcting primer
that blurs smoothes and perfects the
skin for a soft subtle glow it says the
ambient light correcting primers are
infused with light correcting pigments
that act as a first filter to neutralize
brighten and soften light on your skin
they blur imperfections and smooth the
skins textured texture for flawless
makeup application it says this allows
the primer to create a better starting
point for makeup or simply be worn alone
it says unlike other primers this
oil-free weightless formula instantly
absorbs into the skin imparting a
natural looking glow without feeling wet
or greasy on the skin it's designed to
further enhance the lighting effect of
the ambient lighting collection by
creating the first layer a light on your
skin and it is formulated without
Peregrine's parabens parabens anyway the
thought the outer packaging looks like
is just a really pretty kind of bronzy
box typical hourglass that is what it
looks like and then this is the actual
packaging do you like the actual
packaging I prefer when my primers had
either a pump or a squeezy tube
some of them come in like little like
glass containers and stuff like that I'm
not really into that like the dropper
for me why not I
okay with those but I do prefer a little
squeezy tube like this or one that comes
with a pump so this is what it looks
like like I said I did get the shape
luminous light and this has kind of that
matte texture it's that deep dark brown
color but it is one of those textures
kind of like the NARS packaging where
you definitely can get your finger
prints on there so it's kind of I feel
like this is gonna get like all messed
up in my collection at some point it's
not gonna look so cute
but I do think the packaging is quite a
sleek and quite classy so anyway this is
the shade luminous light let me show you
guys what it looks like on the back of
my hand quickly as you can see it has
kind of like a kinky yellowy undertone I
would I feel like it's kind of like a
neutral undertone which is why I thought
from my fair complexion it was going to
be the best color selection I thought
the mood light shade also looked really
beautiful because it does have that
really strong pinky undertone and then I
was thinking of dim light and I was like
oh I know that that is one of the
ambient lighting powders that I reach
for probably the least my favorite
ambient lighting powder is definitely
ethereal light which is the cool tone
white powder but anyway here we have
luminous light and you guys can see even
though goes on it kind of has like a
strong yellowy pinky undertone it
basically just blends into the skin
beautifully so if you do have a fair
complexion like me these are not this
particular shade at least the luminous
light shade is not going to taint your
skin a different color which i think is
great so this is what it looks like once
it's on the hand and you may be thinking
like what I don't see anything right now
you have to look really really closely
but you guys there is a beautiful subtle
sheen there and it's it's gorgeous it's
just absolutely gorgeous the formulation
on this is beautiful if you are one of
those people that does not like having a
heavy like temeka comb silicone primer
on your skin or if you don't like having
something too hydrating you are going to
adore this primer it definitely prolongs
the wear of your makeup I am wearing the
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
today and underneath it I'm wearing my
Bobbi Brown extra SPF tinted
moisturizing balm so I quite a bit of
like face products on it and I know that
this is going to make my foundation last
absolutely all day long it really really
does it with anything it could be like a
moisturizing balm like this a BB cream a
heavy duty foundation it really helps
with creasing and helps to prolong the
wear of
make up and also it doesn't disturb the
actual finish of your makeup sometimes I
feel like if I have a really silicon
primer underneath a foundation that has
you know this kind of like that it estee
lauder double wear that kind of is like
paint on your skin almost it sometimes
disturbs the actual finish of the
foundation this will not do that it
immediately sinks into the skin so I
think if you do have oily or combo skin
you're absolutely going to love this
because you cannot feel it on your skin
if you do have dry skin or aging skin
and you want a little bit of moisture
this is not going to give you that I
would recommend just going in with a
nice good heavy duty oil or moisturizer
before putting this on all this is
really going to do is in part a subtle
glow on your skin and then it's also
going to prolong the wear of your makeup
it definitely helps with creasing I
notice that I don't get as many creases
underneath where I do have fine lines
underneath my eyes and also around my
mouth or on my forehead from going like
this all the time I notice it helps a
lot with that my makeup just looks like
I just put it on at the end of the day
which i think is amazing so I highly
highly recommend checking these out like
I said I only have this one particular
shade so I can't speak on the other two
I'm guessing that the mood light and
also dim light have maybe a little more
color to them because they are a little
deeper in tone than Lubin lit and
luminous light but I'm really happy with
this one I think it's beautiful if I
could compare this to one of the ambient
lighting powder colors I would compare
it to either diffused light it's like a
mixture of diffuse light and ethereal
light so you get kind of that I just
pull like my hair out so you get kind of
the mixture of like a cool tone with a
yellow tone and it just literally just
leaves a beautiful beautiful glow on
your skin so I really like this product
it's kind of one of those products you
put on your face and you're like is this
even doing anything because again I feel
like primers are so in right now like
the domestic palm sort of primers are
very in a very very hydrating primers
are very in this is neither of those
things it's just going to extend the
wear of your makeup help with creasing
and also give a subtle glow to your skin
of course today like I said I am wearing
that my Estee Lauder Double Wear which
is a very heavy duty coverage foundation
you cannot see the actual glow that this
imparts underneath that foundation but
if you reign a tinted moisturizer or
something like the Bobbi Brown Bobby
ground Bobby
it's an moisturizing balm you will be
able to see the soft and luminous glow
that it gives so I hope you guys enjoyed
this quick little review and swatches on
the new ambient light correcting primer
in luminous light from hourglass I'm
loving it I think it's gonna be perfect
for summer and yeah I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
