thank you so much for joining me today i
will be doing a review for you guys on
the new hourglass ambient lighting edit
palette it looks like this this is the
outer packaging it's like a nice soft
gold color always loved our glass
packaging it's so beautifully a very
like well thought like put together it's
just like very very nice well put
together anyway this is what the actual
palette looks like it's gorgeous it's
like a rosy gold sort of color it is not
as deep as if you've seen the modernist
i shadow palette they all kind of come
with this kind of packaging like that
mirrored sort of thing going on except
they are like different colors the
modernist eyeshadow palette I'll kind of
like a deeper color and this will come
where Rosie can probably see right out
my window is I do this but anyway um
this goes for eighty dollars on the
Sephora calm website which is very very
expensive this is definitely one of
those gifts that um if you are going to
gift it like it is pricey but it is
wonderful like it's a really wonderful
gift if you are someone who has not
really tried things from our glass this
is a great way to go in to try out their
ambient lighting powder some of the
blushes and even the bronzer so i'm
going to show you guys what is in here
you get this nice little mirror here and
then you get six who are just colors so
you are getting right here you have an
ambient lighting bronzer you get an
ambient lighting blush right here
another ambient lighting blush then you
get the powers up here so this is I
believe what is mine called diffuse
light which is like a warm yellow tone
then you get this middle color right
here and they call it a ambient lighting
powder in iridescent life but I think
that this is I think on the website they
call it like an editing like a
brightening or editing powder so I don't
know if it's really technically under
the ambient lighting powders or a
different kind of thing but it's kind of
one of their newer things it doesn't
look like the ambient lighting powder
zit have a lot more shimmer and it
reminds me more of a highlight than the
ambient lighting powders but I'm not
quite sure if it's supposed to be an
ambient lighting powder or something
else I think it's called editing powder
but it's a very nice kind of pearly pink
soft color and then you have another
ambient lighting powder right here
called dim light which is
I'm very very popular shape so I think
I'm just gonna I could go on and on and
on about this video and just talk about
you know is it worth it or not but I'm
just going to say right away if you got
last year's blush palette which have
like a trio of blushes or if you got the
ambient lighting powder palette which
was like a trio of powders to a lot of
people got both and honestly if you have
either of those or if you have both you
probably don't need this I do think
there is a bit of overlap I believe mood
exposure which is this nice like plummy
blush color within the blush palette I'm
not quite sure if this one was in there
that one is called luminous flesh it's
also really gorgeous it's more of like a
pinky peach sort of color um but I know
that there is like a lot of overlap and
especially if you had the ambient
lighting just the powder palette I
believe both of these were in there so
diffuse light and dim light and if not I
just feel like they're so close in a
color that it's just not really it's not
necessary to really overlap and do that
I would say the only reason you should
get this palette is if you are new to
our glass you have not tried out
anything because you get a really nice
selection to get a bronzer you get some
blushes you get some of the ambient
lighting powders which are like their
best selling products um so that would
be great like if you're new to our glass
if you're gifting this palette to
someone who's new to our glass but I
would say if you had last year's blush
palette and the ambient lighting powder
palette you don't need this I just don't
think it's necessary the only two things
that you're getting that I really knew
our this editing powder which is that
kind of like pinky color right there
that I told you guys about they have a
lot more shimmer and sparkle to it than
the normal ambient lighting powders and
then the other new thing that you're
getting is that bronzer up there these
are relatively new the bronzers are
released i would say probably it's right
there um these released I don't know
maybe three or four months ago so they
are relatively new however I have to say
right away they are not my favorite
thing in this palette and I'm glad I did
not end up purchasing a full size of
that so I am somebody who has one full
size of the ambient lighting powder I
have a theory of light which is like a
cool toned white I do have one of the
blushes it is in diffused heat I have
one of the eyeshadow palette and then I
have a little trial size of dim light so
the only thing that actually overlaps
for me um with my collection and this
palette is dim light so everything else
is new to me and I think that that makes
it worth it for me that makes it worth
it for the eighty dollars i would say if
you do not have or if you do i'm sorry
if you do have like one or two of these
in full size or even in another pally
probably don't need to splurge on this
like i said the only two that are kind
of new to the palette or new to their
palette format that they've done last
year and this year is the editing powder
that kind of rosy one and the bronzer
and I'll be completely honest those are
two that are actually not my favorite in
the palette so let me just talk a little
bit about the ambient lighting powders
at the top so you get a dim light and
diffuse light and they look like that
this is diffuse light and this is dim
light dim light is more of like a
neutral kind of peachy color and what's
they called diffuse light keep wanting
to call it a theory of light it looks
very similar to the ethereal light one
but it's a little more like yellow tone
these are really beautiful you can use
these as highlights you can use them all
over to set your makeup I really like to
use um I like using them as highlights I
do have them on today I think dim light
is beautiful it's really really a nice
color match for every single kind of
skin tone if that makes sense I think
it's beautiful on pale skin I think it's
beautiful I'm deeper skin it makes a
beautiful kind of highlight um and it's
not something that I could set my whole
entire face would since i am quite fair
but i think a lot of people could and
then a diffuse light which has that kind
of yellow we tone to it is really really
beautiful underneath the eyes which is
what i also did today so definitely the
ambient lighting powders in here
absolutely gorgeous those are kind of
what our glass art is known for and
they're spectacular now the shade in the
middle this editing powder even though
it says that it is a bag of lighting
powder it's an iridescent light it's
just got a little more chalkiness to it
it's a little more um I don't really
know oops hold on a second somebody's
calling me
anyway yeah it's a little chalky it's
just a little I don't even know how
white to describe it like it's just when
you dip your finger in it does not feel
like the other ambient lighting powders
and I think it's because it has a little
more like grit to it may be a little big
bigger chunks of glitter or something
like that but it just doesn't go on as
smoothly and nicely as the ambient
lighting power so it's actually not my
favorite I did use it down my nose today
if you're seeing that light a little bit
up below and sparkle I used to down my
notes on my chin and then a little bit
here on the outer part of my cheekbone
but overall definitely not my favorite I
would definitely stick to one of the
original kind of ambient lighting powder
even if this does say it is a legging
powder I really don't know what I just
because on the website I swear it says
it's like an editing powder so i think
it is labeled differently under the
website but i would definitely stick
with dim light or the diffuse like or
like ethereal light those kind of
separate ones that you can buy
separately I think they're $58 um but
you can get them in there they're
gorgeous so I would definitely stick
with that formula I'm and then the
blushes right here this one right here
at mood exposure I'm wearing today oh my
god it's gorgeous it is a beautiful
mauve kind of color and they are mixed
with I believe if the ambient lighting
powder so they have that kind of
marvelled up like color coloring
basically going on and this is just a
gorgeous color I've kind of shared it
out right there can you see that it just
gives such a luminous look to the cheeks
and it is beautiful it is so flattering
perfect for fall I love that color and
that one is like I said mood light and
then your mood exposure I'm sorry and
then you also have a luminous flush
which is this one down here and it's a
little more pinky a little more peachy
and it looks like it's got like a yellow
undertone so the ambient lighting powder
mixed in there is a little more of
yellow undertone it might actually be
the diffused right one but anyway that
is right there so a little more pinky
but really really gorgeous um these
don't go on super super heavily
it's not like pure pigment right on your
cheeks it kind of put they find out
beautifully and we just give a beautiful
like slush from within so I absolutely
love the blushes have one there and one
there and they're just gorgeous they
look absolutely gorgeous on the skin and
then the last thing in here is the
bronzer and actually I don't like this
that much either so it looks like that
and you misty I'm quite fair I have it
right there it is a little orange cheek
it is a little orange e on my skin tone
and it's a little light so I know that
when you go onto the website you can
purchase the light shader the dark shade
but the one that comes in this palette
is oh my gosh we'll just went into there
oh I don't like that but the one that
you can get in this palette is like
shape so if you are like deeper in skin
tone than I am or you have quite a tan
or things like that this may not even
show up on you so that's kind of you
know that and the editing powder what I
don't like in this palette for
everything else the ambient lighting
powders out in dim light and my gosh
what's a code to feels like I can't seem
to remember that those are absolutely
absolutely gorgeous and then mood
exposure and this luminous flush blush
are absolutely amazing so yeah I would
say if you picked up the blush palette
from last year or the ambient lighting
powder palette from last year I think
you can still get those by the way maybe
not the blush line but I'm pretty sure
you can still get the powder one and
it's around sixty dollars and you do get
a bigger size I would say you probably
don't need to get this um you're going
to have some overlapping going on and
also um you know the two new products
that are in here the editing powder and
that bronze are not that great so those
are kind of not really my favorites so I
kind of wish I had gone and splurged and
gotten the powder palette from last year
and also the blush one because I feel
like I would have gotten more and those
are the two formulas that I like the
most so anyway I hope that kind of
narrowed it down I could go on and on
and on because you know it's just one of
those things i don't know i can go on
and on and on and talk about oh you can
have this but oh it's nice to have that
color too but I really think that if you
picked up the ones from last year you
really probably don't need this one but
for someone who doesn't have
any of these products in full size which
I don't I only have this one in half in
a trial size I think it is worth the
splurge so um I will link will ever you
guys can pick it up if you are
interested and if he keeper watching see
you my next 15 guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
