video is going to be a review of
swatches and also a comparison of the
new hourglass ambience lady at it's
surreal palette but this is $80 yes I
purchased them for $80 on these
sephora.com website I'll link down below
where you guys can pick it up if you are
interested this is currently only
available for VIP and vib Rouge members
it is new and it is exclusive and it is
limited edition it is packed with
universally flattering powder bronzer
blushes and a covetable highlighter all
into one little contact these are never
before released shades of pressed powder
bronzer blushes and highlighter it says
you need everything you are you have
everything you need to brighten contour
and highlight the skin yada-yada-yada
they travel where the case features the
latest addition to the ambient lighting
collection including surreal light which
is the sheer nude powder it says it is
formulated with photoluminescent
technology that optically transparent
particles flatter the look of skin
refracting favorable light the result is
skin that looks smooth even and enhanced
and not masked at all these soft focus
technology also helps to minimize the
look of wrinkles and imperfections
neutralize discoloration and it helps to
emulate the appearance of younger
healthy-looking skin for a lift within
holiday glow now this palette contains
zero point zero point 14 ounces or four
grams of the ambient lighting powder in
surreal light you are getting 0.04 or
1.4 grams of the ambient elating bronzer
in surreal bronze to 0.04 ounces or 1.4
grams of the ambient lighting blushes in
surreal glow and also surreal effect and
then you are also getting 0.04 ounces or
1.4 grams of the ambient stove strobe
lady powder in surreal strobe light
which is a glittering peach so I want to
touch on that really quickly because so
far I made a big big no-no and they
actually wrote on the actual website
when this first release that you are
actually getting 0.14 ounces of product
in each pan now if you bought last
year's holiday palette you know that
this ship is tiny okay like the palette
size is tiny it's really tiny and the
pan size is even tinier these are super
super tiny little products so I knew
right away that that was wrong a lot of
people reported the problem to Sephora I
was one of
I said hello you gotta fix that because
I'm sure that there were people out
there that unfortunately placed an order
thinking they were getting this amount
in every single pan so the only one that
actually has zero point fourteen ounces
is this one right here and that is the
one that has four grams of product
everything else has 0.04 ounces or 1.4
grams of product so anyway and this is
the outer packaging absolutely stunning
so excited to see that they did
something a little different this year
I really adore last year's pallets but
I'm not a huge fan of the hourglass
packaging I like that they do this like
kind of chocolatey Brown mirrored thing
I think this one's really really pretty
but I'm not like the biggest fan of the
silver one or like this interesting kind
of like dirty bronze color but I thought
this was absolutely stunning so this
year they did like a marbled effect if
you put it up a really really close you
can obviously tell it's plastic and it
is kind of like cheaper feeling but from
far away it really actually looks like
it could be stoned like it's really
really gorgeous on the back they have a
sticker here and it tells you everything
that you get in here so you are getting
a finishing powder a bronzer a blush no
you're getting two blushes and then an
ambient strobing lighting powder so I
was super excited to get this yes you
are not getting a lot of product in here
but I feel like that's like typical
hourglass honestly do you guys remember
when these released these aren't the
modernist eyeshadow palettes you can't
like nothing in here and this was
literally like a $60 eyes shadow palette
I absolutely adore it but I just wanted
to kind of show you guys like I've
always thought that hourglass was more
of like a luxury brands like right a
step maybe right below luxury brands
they always don't give you like it seems
like they usually just don't give you
that much product and you pay a lot for
it so I'm not really fussing about the
price I know that there are a lot of
people out there that are like $80 it's
way too much and if you feel that way
then absolutely I just scratch myself
then absolutely I think that you don't
need to get this it's not something that
you absolutely need to have in your
collection
but if you did pick up the 2015 holiday
palette and you loved it as much as I do
then yeah I think that it is worth it to
go ahead and pick up this new one so I'm
not going to spend too much time talking
about the sizing and everything because
I'm already aware that I spend a lot of
money on hourglass products they're just
a little more high-end like higher ends
than a higher end there
more like luxury products and I've
always just kind of thought of them that
way so I just wanted to point that out
but I'm a big fan of their eyeshadows I
also really really adore their ambient
lighting powders I have the little trial
sizes or the travel sizes I also have
full sizes and then I also adore adore
adore the ambient lighting strobing
powders I think I have all of these now
so that is one of my favorite
highlighting formulation so I knew right
away that I really wanted to get my
hands on this palette I'm a big fan of
last year's palette I really thought
this was gorgeous and honestly I reach
for this all of the time so in last
year's palette you were getting an
ambient lighting strobing powder two of
the ambient lighting powders you were
getting an ambient bronzer and then two
of the blushes and so for this year
you're getting something a little
different so you're getting that big
compartment right here which is kind of
like a finishing powder then you're
getting two blushes you're getting a
bronzer and then you're also getting one
of these strobing powders which is like
a limited edition shade so this is
really really gorgeous I mean it does
open up and you have a huge mirror here
and I just love the colors in here now
it says on the actual website that this
is supposed to be flattering for every
single skin tone I highly highly
disagree I feel like this is actually
not as a versatile as last year's
palette I think last year's palette
really would have been great for a lot
of different skin tones but this is
really more catered towards I think fair
to light and medium skin tones I think
if you have a very dark complexion
these are going to look slightly
actually on your skin honestly because
everything has a little bit of like a
grayish undertone or even like a soft
light I don't even know how to describe
it but a little bit of like a gray like
a grayish thing going on Gray's it's got
a little bit of like a gray undertone
and I just noticed that last year's
palettes like there were deeper shades
in here like you could get that gorgeous
gorgeous moon exposure blush which is
like a nice deep berry I felt like the
bronzer was a lot darker and when I hold
the two of these up together I
automatically just think that this was a
little better and a little more
versatile for all sorts of different
skin tones than this year's palette now
obviously I am pretty fair complected so
I'm not gonna complain too much on that
but I did want to point that out because
I think it's important to note if you
really loved last year's palettes and
you do have a deeper complexion you
might want to go in store first and
swatch this out to make sure it will
work for your skin tone
but overall I'm really really happy with
this you guys I think it's absolutely
beautiful
I love the packaging I travel all of the
time with this particular palette so I
know that I'm really going to be
interested in this I think that all of
the powders in here are exactly what
you're used to when it comes to the
hourglass ambient light like formulation
they're very very soft very very buttery
they go onto the skin absolutely
beautifully and they really do have that
sort of like airbrushed look to the skin
if you've never used like an ambient
powder ever before they basically have
this effect where they kind of they
highlight your skin or you can use them
to like set in your makeup but also they
do blur imperfections and if they just
make you look absolutely like a
luminescent and gorgeous so I've always
been a big fan of the powders in general
and I feel like the blushes in here are
also very very nice they all seem to
have that very similar formulation the
only one that is a little different in
formulation is the strobing powder and
that is because it does have little
pieces of shimmer in it now it is the
identical formulation to all of the
other strobing powders that I have and
it's not chunky in any way shape or form
but I did want to point that out that
it's not as smooth as some of the others
but that's just because it does have a
little more chunk of glitter in it and I
don't even want to say chunks of glitter
because it's really just finely milled
pop like glimmer or shimmer that I did
want to go ahead and point that out so
if you do have like full sizes of the
ambient powder highlighters blushes
bronzers whatever yes this is the same
exact formulation they're very soft
they're very buttery and they have that
air light texture and consistency to
them they just glide over the skin one
of my favorite things about this
particular formulation on just the
hourglass products in general their face
products is that they literally just sit
on top of the skin in a beautiful way
not like they're going to emphasize
texture and fine lines and wrinkles they
just look beautiful on the skin they're
very very light you can barely feel them
on so anyway I'm very very happy with
this I feel like the wear time is just
as strong as the other products that I
have purchased from them I would say
that these wear a really nice time as
long as you're wearing a good a nice
tacky foundation and a good primer you
can also use the setting spray if you
want them to last a little longer but I
would say these definitely last on my
face anywhere between 8 to 12 hours so
really really
but yeah let's go ahead and starts
watching some of these I guess we will
start with this little guy right here
which is the finishing powder in surreal
life so this is like the new hot item
and is this beautiful kind of greyish
color but it's got this golden undertone
to it and it's absolutely stunning and I
do want to tell you guys right away if
you're not familiar with the hourglass
of brand these don't swatch incredibly
well because they're very very light and
like ethereal looking on the skin so
they do look better when you have them
on your face I do have this talent on my
face today layered with a few other
products that I had in shop and swatch
my stash but I just wanted to go ahead
and point that out because you may be
like oh my god does not pigment it at
all but if you do know the ambient
laning formulation it's not so much
about pigmentation it's more about the
consistency and the actual formula if
that makes sense
okay so here is the actual finishing
powder this is the new part of the
actual ambient lighting collection and
that is the finishing powder in surreal
light and I feel like it's like a gray
undertone powder with a little bit of
like a peachy iridescent very very
beautiful and I just think it's
absolutely stunning so there it is
alright
and the next one we are going to go
ahead and swatch is number two which is
the bronzer this is in the shade surreal
bronze light and this one is definitely
a little more again I feel like it has
like a little bit of like a gray
undertone going on comparing it to last
year's bronzer that was in this palette
I feel like last year's bronzer
definitely shows up a little more and
has a little more of a warm undertone
whereas this one has a little more of a
cool undertone so there it is swatched
and let me go ahead and swatch last
year's bronzer because I think you guys
will be able to see that difference so
this is this year's bronzer this is last
year's and that's why I was saying if
you do have a darker complexion just be
aware of that because I feel like this
shows up a lot more than this year's
bronzer but this year's bronzer is
beautiful if you do have fair skin like
I do it is really really stunning on all
right and then the next one that we have
here is the blush in surreal glow lips
sorry all glowy and surreal glow is
really pretty it's kind of like a rosy
pink shade and then
little bits of this little guy right
here which is surreal like mixed into it
so it is that one right there very very
pretty kind of like rosy tones I like it
I like it a lot and I'm gonna try and
build these up as much as I can
but like I said if you are familiar with
our glass products they don't really
swatch that amazing way so there is the
bronzer and then there is the blush
should be first blush which is called
surreal glow and then we have surreal
effect and that is another blush and
that is this one right here this one
definitely is a little more cool toned
and then it has this mixed in as well so
really really enjoy that and I love that
their bronzers and their blushes they go
ahead and they do mix in their ambient
lighting powders in there with them I
think that's so special because those
ambient lighting powders well those are
beautiful
so there is that cool toned pink color
really really gorgeous and then the last
one we have is the strobing powder and
like I said the strobing formulation is
one of my all-time favorite highlighter
formulations and this particular shade
is called surreal strobe light and it's
a beautiful kind of deeper peachy color
but it has a lot of golden shimmer in it
so there it is so this one's a little
more gray toned maybe a little bit of
peach undertones here but this one's a
lot more like stronger when it comes to
the actual peach tones and that one
looks like this it's so beautiful it
does look kind of similar to if you are
curious it does look a little similar to
brilliant light or brilliant strobing
light which is one of the strobing
powders I think this is brilliant
actually yeah so here's brilliant this
is more of like a true Goldy color yeah
that one's a little more yellow tones so
here is the one in the palette and then
there is the one in the compact so
really really beautiful like I said I do
like the way that these look I think
they are very very beautiful on the skin
but I guess my biggest issue is just the
fact that I feel like these are not
going to show up on every single skin
tone I'm gonna go ahead and do some
swatches of the Masters palette over on
my other hand really quickly this is
just like one swipe you can kind of see
the difference here I feel like these
were a little better as far as tone is
concerned because
they would work for every single skin
tone or at least most skin tones but
yeah those are the swatches I think
these are incredibly incredibly
beautiful really nice if you do have
fair to light skin and also if you have
a medium complexion I feel like that
shade right here this particular one
which is the strobing powder in surreal
strobe light I think that would look
absolutely stunning but overall I have
nothing to complain about yes I knew
that it was going to be the same exact
size as last year's palette and at first
when I bought this I almost returned
this because I was like damn $80.00
that's a lot but I reach for this all
the time so I knew I was gonna love this
one
so I hope that you guys enjoyed this
review swatches and little comparison
video I will be doing a video called
holiday palettes then and now where I
compare a bunch of different holiday
palettes from last year versus this year
so I will go ahead and do a little more
in-depth comparison between the two of
these soon but I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
