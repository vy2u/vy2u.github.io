channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day I'm giving you guys a review today
on the new ambient strobe lighting
powder from hourglass I purchased this
on the sephora.com website for $38 you
can also get it on the hourglass website
yes and they have four different shades
currently that are available there are
three kind of pinky or rosy shades and
then there's one that has a little more
of a golden tone to it and that is the
one that I picked up and will link below
both of the websites where you guys can
pick this product up if you are
interested they are not affiliate links
but basically this is supposed to be a
strobing powder and I feel like strobing
from me personally I just think of like
contour and highlighting you know
highlighting is where you're bringing
out certain areas or certain features on
your face and contouring is where you're
shading so I always think of strobing I
just you know associate it with
basically highlighted but it's kind of
this thing on YouTube it's very big on
YouTube and Instagram you call it
strobing or kind of giving light to your
face so that is what did they describe
it as I am gonna read a little bit about
what they say only sephora.com websites
so the hourglass ambient strobe lighting
powder
each one is $38 I want to tell you guys
right away you only get point 16 ounces
of product in here which I feel like is
very very normal for hourglass hourglass
in my opinion is very very overpriced
for the amount of product that you get
however I personally find that they make
really really really wonderful products
so I am willing to go ahead and put that
kind of money into a product that is
only point 16 ounces but some people may
not be into that but again I do feel
like you get a very very small amount of
product for the price so they have four
different shades the first one is called
iridescent which is kind of like a rosy
pink color the second one is called
incandescent which is a little bit of a
lighter peach color that you have
euphoric which is more of a kind of like
tan taupey color and then you have the
one that I picked up which is brilliant
which is a kind of gold color and it
says this is a collection of
illuminating strobing powders that are
designed to sculpt the face with light
creating depth and dimension for a
refined natural looking highlight and
the in strobe light powders
formulated in a shear base that's
infused with concentrated ultrafine
micro-pearl particles in a number of
sizes and refraction levels for
natural-looking luminescence without
leaving a heavy metallic finish
developed with photoluminescence
technology it captures diffuses and
softens surrounding light to refine the
appearance of the skin use it wet or dry
for different levels of intensity taking
you from an everyday strop highlights to
a dramatic evening strobe highlight
these universally flattering shades are
perfect for all skin tones and they're
designed to be used with the ambient
strobe light sculptor which is I believe
like a brush that you can get with it I
can get it which is sold separately for
the most effortless application it is
formulated without parabens and it says
designed to emulate the way in which
strobe lights capture and reflect light
on the face and the in strobe lighting
powders contain a more concentrated
level of micro-pearl particles in
varying sizes and refraction levels than
the original of original ambient
lighting powders combines with a sheer
base the powders impart a highlight to
the face in its purest form without
masking the skin beneath it so I want to
say right away basically what this is
and I know they keep saying no no it's
different and it's special in my opinion
all that this product is is a ambient
lighting powder with flecks of glitter
in it now I do want to say right away it
is very very micro-fine glitter and it's
not going to be super super noticeable
on your face I am wearing this product
on my face right now and I have to let
you guys know right away I'm actually
really really enjoying this I am a big
fan of the ambient lighting powders in
general I do have a full-size of
ethereal light which is the cool toned
white powder that I absolutely love I
also have a smaller size of the ambient
lighting powder in dim light which is
also beautiful it's got a little more of
kind of a tan undertone and then I also
got the hourglass Holliday palettes that
came out this year and in here you
actually had one of these strobe
lighting powders that release this was
the first time we ever saw it and the
color that you have here is iridescent
light which is that kind of pinky color
so in here you do have let's see here
diffuse like dim light which are both
and the
powders then you have iridescent light
which is the stroke powder and then you
have two blushes and a bronzer so I
really do like the formula of the
ambient lighting powders from our glass
a lot of people don't and I think it's
because they don't know how to use them
they can be used in multiple multiple
ways for a lot of different things you
can use them to set your under-eye
concealer you can use them to highlight
your face you can use them to even set
in your foundation if you want to but I
think you're either a fan of the ambient
lighting powders or you're not so
basically what I'm trying to say is that
if you are not a fan of the ambient
lighting powder as chances are you are
not going to like this new strobing
powder but anyway this is what the outer
packaging looks like very true to our
glass that kind of darker coppery you
know metallic box but I have to say the
actual packaging of the products I'm
loving this is the first time they've
done silver for one of their face
products and I love anything silver I
think it's a very bright very
eye-catching and compared to some of the
other packaging that they have I just
think it looks better it looks a lot
more crystal like a lot more bright and
I prefer it so this is what the outer
packaging looks like you have that
mirrored effect you open it up you have
a little mirror and this is the shade so
like I said I got the one that is called
brilliant which has kind of a gold
undertone and the reason I reached for
that one was because on the sephora.com
website the colors looked really really
dark those pink ones just looked very
very dark and honestly I have fair skin
and I don't want to have anything that's
super super dark if especially if I'm
trying to highlight with it or do these
strobing method so that is the reason I
chose brilliant and I have to say like I
said already I really really enjoyed
this formulation I think it's beautiful
it's a very very subtle highlight for me
so let me go ahead and swatch the color
for you guys like I said this is kind of
like an opalescent yellow gold color and
it's absolutely beautiful I'm gonna
build up the swatch on my hand so you
guys can really see because if you are
familiar with the hourglass formula it
really is this lightweight highly
blendable sort of powder and it really
does kind of sink in right away and it's
not that it sinks in it really just
gives a light glow to the skin it is not
like hella pigmented like some of the
highlighters
there this is not supposed to be a
full-on highlight you know this is
supposed to be like a glow from within
sort of product and like I said a I'm
wearing it today I applied it with this
bareMinerals brush and I just feel like
it applies beautifully with any sort of
brush I can just happen to the product
and dust it where I want to and even
though this does have little tiny like
light reflecting glitters in it they are
so might like micro fine micro fine is
that even a word
they are so finely milled that it's not
anything that's noticeable the other day
I was actually standing and I was kind
of like the Sun was going down I was
standing in the light and my boyfriend
actually turned to me and was like wow
your skin looks beautiful and I was
wearing this on my cheekbones and I
think it's very very subtle but
absolutely beautiful on the skin I think
it is a little more than a typical
ambient lighting powder if you like to
highlight with the ambient lighting
powders which I do with ethereal light I
think this one is gorgeous I really do
like to highlight with this one but it
doesn't have those light reflecting
little glitters in there so it's a
different sort of thing it's just not as
noticeable whereas this one's kind of
like a step up or a notch up from the
typical ambient lighting powder but it's
definitely not a full-on highlight so if
that's not what you're looking for
you're not gonna like this product and I
highly recommend not picking it up
because 4.16 ounces for $38 you know why
would you want to spend your money on
something that you're not going to get
that full-on pigment with but if you are
a fan of the ambient lighting powders in
general you really like that kind of
barely they're sort of touched on like
that luminosity that just kind of comes
from within sort of glow you're really
really going to like these strobing
powders let me go ahead and swatch the
one that came in the Holiday palette it
was funny because when I reviewed this
holiday palette that color right there
that iridescent light is that what it's
called
yeah era doesn't like strobing powder I
actually didn't like it and I thought it
was the formulation I was saying oh
those glitter particles you know they're
too big I don't like it I just didn't
think it was that great but I think it
was the color I'm just not a huge fan of
really really pink highlights on my skin
tone I should be because I have fair
skin but I'm actually really a
of like golden highlights I think it
looks really really beautiful so it
really wasn't the formulation that I
wasn't a fan on a fan of it was the
color so again here is the brilliant one
and I'm gonna swatch that in next to
iridescent and I'm gonna try and build
them up as much as I can but if you guys
like aren't familiar with this product
it really is lightweight so you have
iridescent right there and then
brilliant there so you can barely see
them but you can see even though they do
have glitter you don't see any kind of
chunkiness on the skin there's no
texture it's just absolutely beautiful
and my my hands are very dry right now
so you would think that it would pick up
and accentuate like patches or dry
patches or whatever on my skin but it
really doesn't so like I said it really
does apply beautifully with any sort of
brush I use this flawless face one today
from bare minerals and I feel like you
don't have to be super super surprised
parenthesized you really can use any
sort of brush like this one is really
really big and I had no problem just
kind of dusting it all over it because
it's not one of those products that's
like BAM in your face so you can use
whatever kind of brush you want to I
really find that these wear beautifully
on the skin especially if you are
wearing a foundation and you do have a
primer on and especially especially if
you go ahead and you set your face with
a setting this so I think that they
really really are wonderful I'm I'm a
big fan I already went in and took
incandescent light which is kind of like
that lighter peachy or color not one of
the pink ones but the peachy color and I
put that on my loved list at Sephora so
overall I think it's really really nice
I think that if you have pale skin
you're really gonna like that brilliant
shade just because it has a little bit
of luminosity but that kind of golden
glow um what's that other shade that
kind of darker one with the neutral
undertone that one is called let's see
here you for it that's kind of it looks
like in the picture that it's similar to
dim light but it has more of obviously
the little flecks of glitter in it so if
you really really like dim light on your
skin tone and you want something that
highlights even a little more than this
one you're probably going to like to
show you for it so overall I think this
is a really fantastic product
I am happy with it I will be picking
another one up and I would say go and
store swatch it if you're not interested
in the formulation if you're like oh
what is that what do I do with this then
don't you know don't get it it's not
going to be worth the money just because
our class is very pricey and if it's
something that you don't really know how
to use or you're not sure what you would
use it for it chances are you're not
going to want to grab it and you know
reach for it in your collection so I
think if you are a lover of the ambient
lighting powders in general you're gonna
love these as well but if you are not
then you're not gonna like them so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
review thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
