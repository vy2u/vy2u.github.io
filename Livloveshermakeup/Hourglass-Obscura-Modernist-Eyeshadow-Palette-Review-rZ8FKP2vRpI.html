um first of all I just want to say I
have a new camera so now you guys can
watch me in 1080p instead of just 750 or
whatever but um so if you want to do
that please go ahead and let's just get
started this video is going to be on the
new hourglass modernist eyeshadow
palette um they have released seven of
these pallets on the Sephora website and
I purchased mine in the shade obscura
the packaging looks like this and I must
admit it is really beautiful it looks
gorgeous it's like this nice almost like
purpley rose gold packaging but on the
website this looks a lot bigger and I
think that's something that a lot of
people are saying I watched a few
reviews and also I have seen on actual
Sephora website some of the reviews were
like wow so little small this palette
goes for $58 it retails for $58 so
that's a lot of money that's almost $60
that's basically like an Urban Decay
Naked palette which comes with way more
shades so it's kind of interesting I
think hourglass is very very much a
high-end brand but at the same time you
know it that's like the one thing that I
don't like about this palette I must
admit and I'm gonna tell you guys I
absolutely love with the colors and the
shades the pigmentation this is what it
looks like on the inside as you can see
you get this nice creamy color you get
some deeper Browns that are both matte
and then you get to silvery I'm not
silvery but shimmery um blood bronze
colors and they're gorgeous
obscura is more of a like I think they
described it as a not natural palette
that they described it as like earth
tones which i think is like pretty you
know I would say that that is what I
think of when I see this I think it's
absolutely beautiful
let me just show you guys here quickly
I'll just swatch a few of these I did
use two of these on my eyes today as my
look so this is kind of first
impressions but at the same time it's
not because they used it today these are
actually the two colors I've used so as
you can see that was just like one
little swipe they go on so buttery and
so pigmented you
it's really really beautiful but the
best part is watch this watch how um
blended out these can get do you see
that so they are really really easy to
blend on it the I and I absolutely love
that so I would say in general know that
if you order one of these for $58 it is
a small little palette it's about the
size of my hand
literally a pretty small hands too just
so you know okay sorry have eyeshadow
all over that eye pretty spot this one
I'm pretty small hands that's my point
this is a small palette it does come
with this tiny little mirror here but
just so you know tiny worth it for $58
if you're a shadow like table like I am
and you really love creamy beautiful
pigmentation high pigmentation stuff
that's easy to blend yes definitely
worth it if you are someone who is
looking for more variety of shades you
may go with the Naked palette or you
make it like a to face palette those are
more around the 30 $40 range lorac
palettes those are around the $40 range
I think
our glass is just known to have some
really high-end makeup I mean even their
primer is like $50 so that's just you
know how I feel about this it's kind of
my first impression slash review with a
few little swatches here let me go ahead
and swatch this other matte color right
there this is more of like a smoky Brown
and it's also very beautiful I'm just
gonna kind of blend it out right there
but gorgeous a little more with like
gray tones in there but I mean I think
that the colors in here in gorgeous the
only two that are shimmery are the two
like bronzy colors and then you have the
two dark Browns one is more of cool
tones the other one is warmer and those
are both matte and the highlight color
that kind of creamy white color is
definitely I would call it matte it's
almost like a satin finish I think I
call it a satin finish so there are the
colors again up close you can see it
does have this kind of like ribbed
texture on top which i think is
beautiful it's super soft creamy I like
mine and I may consider getting another
one because they did come out with seven
different ones and by the way it was so
hard to pick on the website which one I
wanted because they had ones that were
like rose colored rose
and then they had ones that were like
you know really really warm and things
like that so I kind of just went with
the earth tones something that I knew
could be you know I could pull off and I
think a lot of skin tones could so again
this is obscura and I do love it I just
don't love the price but that is my
little review slash first impressions
let me know down below if you guys
picked one of these up and if you like
it or not I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
