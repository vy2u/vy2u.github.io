wanted to show you guys today what I've
been doing to gradually lighten my hair
I made sure that right now I'm in
natural lighting so you guys can see I
have all natural lighting just a window
no other lights going on here
and so that you guys can see the actual
color so as you can see my hair is
probably gotten like 2 or 3 shades
lighter I have actually been using this
product right here this is by John
Frieda this is the sheer blond go
blonder lightening spray and I have been
using this and what I do is once a week
after I get out of the shower I towel
dry my hair and then I spray this all
over my head and then I blow-dry with my
brush and this is a heat activated kind
of thing it has I believe no peroxide or
anything like that it just says it
permanently lightens blonde hair but it
has them I believe like chamomile and
some lemon or something in there so it
gradually lightens and yes this can be
damaging to the hair you don't want to
do this if you are super super you know
processed here and that's already super
damaged you probably don't want to do
this but I have had pretty good luck
with that and anytime I get any
brassiness after I use this I've been
using the sheer blonde color renew tone
correcting shampoo from John Frieda so
this has helped to neutralize any
brassiness that I might get and yeah so
right now is this nice kind of
strawberry blonde ish color it has a lot
of dimensions to it as you can see and I
really like that I usually normally just
have this kind of mousy as you can see
from my eyebrow color mousy kind of
eyebrow will not I rock color all over
hair color and it gets kind of dulled
during the winter time so I thought I'd
kind of spice it up and do some of this
and then also I'm thinking about going
and getting some boxed highlights and
doing that myself I used to be a
receptionist at a hair salon so I know
how to mix up all the colors and do all
that kind of thing I could either
probably go to Sally's and pick up some
real stuff and do at home oils or I'm
thinking I want to do the frost and glow
by Revlon which I trust and I have done
before so anyway I just wanted to share
with you guys how I've been gradually
lightening my hair
and I think it's working out well it
hasn't been caused too much damage yet
and I really like the like a
multi-dimensional look that it's giving
to my hair so I just wanted to share
that with you guys and I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
