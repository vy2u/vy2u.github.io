in this video i'm showing you guys how i
pair my fragrances a few people have
asked me about this and it's probably
because they have seen my weekly
favorites videos where I always almost
always show a perfume and a body this
and I combine them basically every
single week and wear them on my body I
like to wear my perfumes on my pressure
points I have heard the basketballs to
make them wear longer like on your skin
or on your body so I wear them on my
wrists I have it on my neck and then on
the back of my knees that is where I
apply my perfume and then for body mists
I just like to use it to touch up during
the day so that I don't have to reapply
my actual perfume but so I ways my
little tip for you guys on how to pair
them it basically just go with the
overtone smell the overtone of your
perfume and the overtone means it's the
first thing that you pick up on right
here i have my marc jacobs manoir
perfume and the first thing that I smell
when I take a whiff of it is gardenia
like flowers gardenia things like that
if I slick smell it a little longer I
start to notice that it has some
muscular warmer undertones to it but i'm
not going to concentrate on the
undertones a lot of perfumes especially
perfumes have a lot of complicated
overtones and undertones whereas body
miss really only have maybe one or two
overtones and undertones but for the
most part perfumes tend to be a little
more complicated so you want to take the
perfume and then match the body mist to
the perfume so try and find the overtone
so the overtone of this is basically
floral so I try and find a body mist
that matches that and I really like this
secret wonderland Signature Collection
fragrance mist from Bath and Body Works
the other tone on this is sweet but the
overtone is floral so these two pair
really really nicely together same thing
with these two perfumes i have the paris
hilton perfume with the sexy little
things fragrance mist from victoria's
secret these are very very fresh
perfuming sense they have a little bit
of a warmer undertone both of them do
but they pair really well together
because the overtone is very fresh and
bright and also the versace bright
crystal again i have a lot of perfume so
I really kind of use tons and tons of
stuff I'm
and match basically everything I will be
doing a fragrance collection video or I
guess I'll call it a perfume collection
video so these aren't just like the only
ones that I mix and match match I mix
and match everything but these are just
ones that I think I've shown in my
weekly favorites i'm pretty sure so this
one is the versace bright crystal this
has a very sweet undertone and so does
the Victoria's Secret strawberries and
champagne however where they both really
really match beautifully is the fact
that they both have a very very fresh
overtone so I try and match you know the
body mist to the perfume so those are
just a few examples you can match you
know a spicy scent you can match a
floral scent to a fresh scent sweet
scent whatever all you want to do is
smell your perfume the overtone is
always the most powerful so that's the
first thing that you smell and you want
to match your body mist to that so
that's my little tip I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you next time
