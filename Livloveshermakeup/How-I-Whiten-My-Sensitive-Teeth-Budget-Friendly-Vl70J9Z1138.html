thank you so much for joining me in this
video I'm going to be showing you guys
how I wait in my sensitive teeth on a
budget yes I've tried everything under
the moon I literally have a big pile
here of tres white strips I want to show
you guys a few products that I've tried
that have not worked for me I have a big
pile of Crest Whitestrips here that are
going to my boyfriend because I just
can't stand them on my teeth I have very
sensitive teeth I had braces for about a
year on the top and bottom when I was
younger I got them off in eighth grade
and ever since then I have been trying
to lighten my teeth um I do drink you
know like tea and things like that that
tends to stain my teeth but also I'm
very very fair and I find that you know
if you don't have like a nice like color
to your skin sometimes your teeth can
actually look darker than your skin tone
that has happened to me before it's
really really horrible you don't want to
be paler like your skin is paler than
your teeth that's really bad
anyway so I do notice that they're not
super super white all the time I have
been doing the system I'm going to show
you guys for a week now and I have
noticed that they look a lot lighter
like I said I'm very very fair so like
for them to look this white it's really
really good um anyway so I'm gonna show
you guys quickly like I said I have
tried the Crest Whitestrips I have tried
the gentle routine I have tried the
there's a few in here the professional
effects one goes on for 30 minutes the
other goes on for 5 they both leave my
teeth feeling horrible and aching I also
tried these little ghost smile pre
whitening gels these you take and they
go into like q-tip for and you break it
off paint it onto your teeth and then
put a white strip or any kind of
whitening system on over it I have tried
it with the system I'm gonna talk about
in a minute and also with the white
strips horrible really really left my
teeth aching um I do want to show you
guys one thing that I do like from crest
I like these little crests NC stop
strips they're pretty pretty good they
are a little expensive but what you do
is you take a little strip and you put
it on your gum line where you know that
you're gonna be having like an aching
tooth kind of issue because it's not the
teeth it's the gum that gets sensitive
and you leave it on for 10 minutes and
that really does help to kind of reduce
any kind of aching before you do whiten
your teeth
however I notice that Orajel is the best
I play flute so I can't use this all the
time because it will numb your mouth
completely however it's really really
good it will stop the pain instantly in
any area if you're having a really
really sensitive area because then you
know you can't drink anything you can't
eat anything cold or hot feels horrible
it's like digging your front teeth into
an ice cream cone horrible feeling so
anyway I have a pretty high pain
tolerance and I just can't deal with my
teeth aching all the time it really
really bothers me like I said I'm a
flute player too so like I need my mouth
to be feeling good and you know it
doesn't when I use these products so
like I said all these white strips and
things like that are going to my
boyfriend it's such a pain because they
are so expensive you know I've tried all
their formulas all the crest white strip
formulas and I do know that they work
they work it's just they hurt even the
gentle routine which is only on for five
minutes it hurts so anyway I'm going to
show you guys the system I have found
that has been working for me I have been
using it every single day this week
without any sensitivity I've not had to
use a fancy strip and I have not had to
use for a gel so it's actually really
really good price budget I already put
the formula on there but it comes with
this little mouth tray and it's just a
little rubber mouth tray and what you do
is you put the gel onto the mouth tray
you pop it in for five minutes and you
have no sensitivity and your teeth
whitened so this is the plus white five
minute premier whitening system speed
whitening gel this is not a sponsored
video I know a lot of people talk about
this but this has been great um I got
mine I believe at the drugstore maybe
about a month ago I had just tried it
last week so I didn't open it up right
away because I had this whole little bag
filled with white strips and all these
whitening things and I just thought okay
I'll just see what works and this was
the last thing I grabbed because it was
so cheap I thought I probably wouldn't
work that well but this is amazing the
combination of these two is amazing so
what you do whoops lady went weird what
you do is you take the gel and you just
put it on the top and the bottom of the
tray if you guys can see the gel is on
there you just put a good amount and you
pop the tray in for five minutes and
then you take it out and just your teeth
look really good you can rinse your
mouth out if you don't like the taste
the taste is not
horrible it's not like oh my god it's
like vulgar it's like I just want to
spit it out it's a little minty um but
in five minutes the trave really should
you know the gel really should adhere to
the teeth so you shouldn't have that
much like remaining in your mouth you
can leave it on after or you can rinse
you know your mouth out if you don't
like the taste I usually just leave it
on because it doesn't bother me and like
I said I'd get absolutely no sensitivity
which is awesome so I got this like I
said it was under ten dollars which is
great compared to the white strips so
I'm really really loving it definitely
check out the five minute white
whitening gel I think some people have
even said that they can get this at
their dollar store which is awesome
awesome awesome awesome so I don't know
what it is about this it just doesn't
make my teeth sensitive it says to pop
it in for five minutes and if you have
very stained teeth 15 to 20 minutes I
would not go past the five minute mark
if you do have sensitive teeth even if
they are very stained just continue
using it you know every single day and
it's like you know it just doesn't feel
like anything cuz it's like five minutes
so um anyway I just want to share that
with you guys if you have sensitive
teeth like I do I also have some enamel
wear like at the front of my teeth
enamel is kind of wearing down and
that's also a sense you know that also
brings on a lot of sensitivity so this
is a great little system I absolutely
love it I will be giving all those Crest
Whitestrips to my boyfriend I feel too
guilty throwing them out because they
are so expensive um but this system is
the best and I have used it every single
day for a week and I notice that my
teeth are just a lot lighter and
brighter and it just makes me happy so
I'm probably gonna start using it you
know every other week and I feel fine
doing it every single day but you could
do it you know every other day things
like that so anyway I will leave a few
links below if you guys are interested
like I said this is not a sponsored
video I know a lot of people talk about
this but it really works that's why they
talk about it um so I will leave a few
links below where you guys can find it
on Amazon drugstore comm things like
that and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
