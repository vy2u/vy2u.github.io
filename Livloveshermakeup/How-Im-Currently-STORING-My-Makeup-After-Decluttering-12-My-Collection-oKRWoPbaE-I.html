walking you guys through what I am
currently using to store my makeup since
I have decluttered half of my collection
in the past year and a half so I thought
it might be fun I guess that we should
start probably with these little
dressers here so this is how I store my
makeup in this dresser right here which
I got off of Amazon I will have it
linked down below as you guys can see
this is kind of how I have my filming at
background and then over here is another
little antique that my mom gave my
boyfriend and I when we moved into our
new place it is so gorgeous
and I have just some stuff here some
wall art so there were little eyelashes
my friend made this for me it says gypsy
soul we actually did not know that this
was like a slang term so I just wanted
to say that right away so you guys know
here in America we kind of think of
gypsy as being like light hearted and
like a free spirit so I'm sorry if you
find that offensive like I said I had
absolutely no idea and then here is a
little 50k subscribers thing that
Rochelle also made it me when I hit 50k
to store the majority of my lip products
up here as you guys can see then I do
come a little creepy mask over here
because what can I say I'm just a creepy
person I will do a whole entire Beauty
room a tour with like the walk-in
bathroom and closet and all that kind of
stuff if you guys want me to but right
now this dresser is holding
miscellaneous products that I have just
not gone ahead and actually put into
their real home yet
and what I mean by that is every single
one of these drawers is just stacked and
filled with random products we've got
eyes shadow palettes we've got whatever
and they're all just sitting here and
none of this is the decluttered makeup I
have already gone ahead and boxed the
de-clutter makeup up over here as you
guys can see yes so this is kind of the
drawer that I go to or this is the
dresser that I go to when I want
everything to be lined up so like I said
I have makeup all the way down through
there and actually this lid it lifts up
as well and there's makeup in there too
so I'm trying at my best to really
really kind of minimalize my collection
and be able to fit everything in here so
in this drawer right here well I guess
we should start with the top and this
one is just random products that were
sent for PR that I have not tried out
yet or products that my friends have
sent me so that
what I do to keep that there just
because you know I'll reach for it if
it's right there
and then here I have like I said the
majority of my setting sprays a few of
my powders most of my powders are still
in there some primers Becca under eye
primer some concealers some more primers
and then here we have the majority of my
foundations I did declutter 20
foundations recently so I have about 20
here and then when we open up the next
drawer I have some highlighter singles
and then I also do have you know my
Anasazi of Beverly Hills glow kits I
have just some face palettes and Genya
so this is all miscellaneous blushes
liquid highlighters as well as bronzers
and I have a lot of like blush singles
and stuff like that I probably should do
a decoder because I really reach for
palettes a lot more but yeah this is
where I store those like I said I also
have some liquid illuminators down there
and then this final drawer is ultimately
where I wanted all my eyeshadow palettes
to be but that's just not going to
happen I have over a hundred palettes in
my collection
now I only have 50 so I have about 50 in
one two and three at the bottom there
and then this one right here go ahead
and estimate that there's probably about
twenty or thirty in there so I'm very
excited this will be easy when I do like
shop my stash because I can just kind of
open up the drawers with you guys and it
makes things a lot you some random ones
I'm trying to use up from covergirl I
have this one that I want to use up from
L'Oreal and then some of my favorites
over here like the Marc Jacobs
development noir I do have an amethyst
crystal right there here are some more
highlighter singles these are my Becca
cosmetics little flying saucers and this
is the background you see when I do film
so this little acrylic organizer was
actually a nail polish rack and I
flipped it over and went ahead and used
it for this then I have a little little
box right here that I got to when I went
out for dinner with Tom the other night
that sounds really weird like it was a
wedding ring in there or something nope
not that just a little box with some
cute stuff in it I have a few of my
Stila glitter and glows I have one two
three four five six here I do believe
that I have about twelve of them total
and I had plan on doing an upcoming
video so the other six are obviously in
the drawer over there
the emptiness okay this is the the
blackhole drawer and then right here I
do have a little box this used to be my
makeup memory a box I now went ahead and
transferred Maya
sentimental of beauty products into a
different box but these are little LED
roses and then I have the Too Faced
highlighter right there because I
thought it looked huge I know that you
can't see the roses when I'm filming
because it kind of like Auto blurs that
right here I found those on Amazon as
well and I also found this on Amazon the
canvas I have a couple of those around
cuz you guys know I'm a music organizers
over here dollar store a dollar store
Container Store
Tork Cosmetics yeah but it's cute so
whatever I'll use it dollar store glass
that I have they used to drink out of
and then this little thing is a jewelry
racket that I spray painted it silver so
anyway guys that's just kind of the
little overview after I have declutter
nearly half of my collection on what I'm
doing so that's like the black hole
drawer and everything will eventually be
in here and I'm very proud of that so I
hope you enjoyed this video thanks for
