I'm going to show you guys how to clean
a Beauty Blender sponge as you can see
mine is dirty currently I'm going to
show you guys three different ways to do
this let's start with the one that
doesn't involve the actual blender
cleanser which is the product that comes
with or the one that you can buy with
the Beauty Blender so the first point is
Dawn dish soap you can just take this
and you want to just have a dry Beauty
Blender here you blender put the soap on
there
kind of rub it between your hands really
kind of get it all set II put a little
water on it and then just keep it
rubbing and you kind of can see that
it's squeezing out a lot of that product
there you can add a little more to the
area where it's really highly stained
you kind of work that into your hand
like this and just kind of squeeze it
out and just keep repeating this step
with the water
squeezing and squeezing keeping and tell
all of these so there you go a really
nice clean beauty blender now I'm going
to put some foundation back on it so
that we get it kind of dirty again rub
that in there and I'm going to show you
guys it's the second way to do that you
can see it's now stained again the
second way to do this is to use
Johnson's baby shampoo
so again just put that right on there
this works best when the sponge is damp
already work it into your hand squeeze
it out and rinse
I'm gonna make sure you get all of the
stuff out
why
and you can see you have a I would say
pretty decently clean Beautyblender add
some more foundation on there wrap it up
and I'm going to show you guys the last
way to do it and it is using the blender
solid and you're just going to wet the
soap and take the view under and rub it
in there I find this is the easiest way
I know the soap does come out but this
is just the easiest way I've found I'm
gonna get it wet you know I think this
is probably the best way to do it but if
you don't want to invest I'd do the Dawn
dish soap the second best is the
Johnson's baby shampoo it doesn't get it
quite as clean but the Dawn dish soap is
really really good if you don't want to
invest
you can see most of it is clean there's
a little stain right there I'm just
gonna go right over that area again
squeezing I rinse with warm matter just
pleased to get all of the stress out
really well I like this curve you can
spot treat it right where you need to I
prefer cleaning my beauty blenders at
night so in the morning I can just cook
them into the water and cold water and
then just start but there is a nice
clean Beauty Blender and to let it dry
like to put in this little cup and just
let it sit like that it's good to let it
air dry but you don't want to put it in
an area where it's like closed off
because it will get moldy so hope you
guys enjoyed this video I hope it was
helpful and I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
