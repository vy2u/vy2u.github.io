I'm going to show you guys how to clean
a Beauty Blender sponge as you can see
mine is dirty currently i'm going to
show you guys three different ways to do
this let's start with the one that
doesn't involve the actual blender
cleanser which is the product that comes
with or the one that you can buy with
the beauty blender so the first one is
dawn dish soap you can just taste this
and you want to just have a dry beauty
blender here ET blender put the soap on
their kind of rub it between your hands
really kind of get it all set ii put a
little water on it and then just keep
rubbing and you kind of can see that
it's squeezing out a lot of that product
there you can add a little more to the
area where it's really highly stained
you kind of work that into your hand
like this and just kind of squeeze it
out and just keep repeating my stuck
with the water
keep squeezing and squeezing keeping and
tell all of these soap is out of the
gate leather and there you go a really
nice clean Beauty Blender now I'm going
to put some foundation back on it so
that we get it kind of dirty again rub
that in there and I'm going to show you
guys it's the second way to do that you
can see it's now Staind again the second
way to do this is to use Johnson's baby
shampoo so again just put that right on
there this works best when this bunch is
damp already work it into your hand
squeeze it out and rinse
make sure you get all upset out
and you can see you have a I would say
pretty decently clean beauty blender add
some more foundation on there wrap it up
i'm going to show you guys the last way
to do it and it is using the blender
solid and you're just going to wet the
soap and take the Beauty Blender and rub
it in there I find this is the easiest
way I know the soap does come out but
this is just the easiest way I found I'm
going to get it wet and start squeezing
it out I think this is probably the best
way to do it but if you don't want to
invest I do the dawn dish soap the
second best is the johnson's baby
shampoo doesn't get it quite as clean
but the dawn dish soap is really really
good if you don't want to get best
images
you can see most of it is clean there's
a little stain right there i'm just
going to go right over that area again
squeezing I Vince with warm water just
pleased to get all of the stress out
really well I like this hope you can
spot treat it right where you need to I
prefer cleaning my beauty blenders at
night so in the morning I can just cook
them into the water and cold water and
then just start applying my foundation
with them but there is a nice clean
Beauty Blender and to let it dry like to
put in this little cup and just let us
sit like that it's good to let it air
dry but you don't want to put it in an
area where it's like closed off because
it will get moldy so hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope it was helpful
and I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
