thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having an absolutely
fantastic wonderful magical day that's
just the mood I'm in right now I don't
know I'm having a really good day so I'm
sorry if I'm all like you know of course
the big boat but that's how I'm feeling
right now so prepare for some fast
talking and um probably a lot of
movement I'm gonna try you guys I'm
going to try alright
I'm very excited for this video and it's
not just because I have all these cute
little masks in front of me they're like
different colors and they look so
adorable but because this video has been
like on my list forever so if you guys
don't know I do plan my videos a month
ahead of time and I just write out a new
video idea of every single day of the
month whether or not I film it you know
if I'm not in the mood to film I don't
films but I try and get out a video
every single day because I'm usually in
the book to film so I have been wanting
to do this video forever I was supposed
to do it two months ago and then it just
so happened it was on a day where I
didn't wanna film and I didn't film so
it got pushed back and I'm so excited
last night when I looked at my little
notebook and I saw that I'll get to fill
this tomorrow so this video is going to
be on how to find the right glam glow
mask for your skin type so I really
really excited I love Glanville mask you
guys I've been using Lancome ass for
years and years and years since they
first came out I have had a full-size of
every single glam glow face mask I have
not tried their eye masks I think they
look really really cool I have not
personally tried them I'm just gonna be
talking about the face mask in this
video but the ones I'll be talking about
our super mud which I've had two full
sizes of this this is my only full-size
of the flash mud I had just one full
size of the gravity mud I've had three
full sizes of youth mud I've had four
yes four full sizes of power mud this
one is my favorite and then I've had two
full sizes of a thirsting I'm thirsty
money yeah there's too many so I thought
it would be fun for me to kind of sit
down because they do have a lot of
experience with them sit down talk about
which ones I think would be nice for
your skin type I want to say really
really quickly I think it's stupid that
I even have to put a disclaimer out
there but I get complaints all the time
anytime I do like a skincare video or I
talk about like my supplements
take and things like that people go
crazy and they're like you should have
take those you probably it's like listen
I am NOT a doctor I am NOT a
dermatologist I'm not trying to tell you
why to take anything or use anything on
your skin I'm just giving you guys my
recommendation so please don't freak out
it's not a big deal that's my disclaimer
I'm not a doctor I'm not a drug
dermatologist you guys are watching my
videos because you want to hear my
opinion on certain things and that's
just sick that's my opinion so anyway
let's just get into this video I am very
very excited so the first one I want to
talk about is my all-time favorite and
it is the glam glow power module cleanse
treatment I love this I have combination
skin just for reference but what I like
about this is the fact that it has a
wonderful wonderful kind of mud base and
then it has some really really nice
light exfoliating particles to it so
this is what it looks like it actually
smells like Kiwi which I think if I'm
anything
all of them smell really really good but
it smells like Kiwi it's not super
offensive I think if you have sensitive
skin you would really enjoy this I don't
think that the scent is too overpowering
are going to irritate your skin and the
exfoliating particles that are in this
one are not going to over like um scrub
your skin because you know if you have
sensitive skin you need to be really
really careful with scrubs because they
will you know your take your skin so I
think this one is absolutely fantastic
if you have a combination skin I don't
think if you only you're going to love
it that much what I really feel like it
does for my skin personally is just kind
of even out I feel like it kind of
balances it out so if you a combination
skin you're going to love this and if
you have sensitive skin you will also
love this one all right the next one I
want to talk about is thirsty mud and if
you have sensitive skin and dry skin
yes sensitives can enjoy skin this is
going to be your best friend I can even
get away with using this it's like a
moisturizer in the morning which is
crazy because it doesn't really have
like a sin it doesn't I mean it has a
scent to it but it doesn't have an
offensive scent to it which is why I
think you know sensitive skin people can
use it but what I really like about it
is the texture is very very thin and it
almost tastes like a moisturizer and the
color is kind of like a tan almond a
sort of shade but the exfoliating
particles in there are so so so faint
that you can't really feel it on the
skin so if you do have dry skin or
sensitive skin I think you could
actually get away with using this as a
moisturizer I
I look a little careful I don't like to
put too much in my t-zone just because I
am combo skin and I do get oily there so
I think if you have oily skin or combo
skin you should probably stay away from
this one but if you really really enjoy
just um like like a super dose of
hydration to your skin like if you have
aging skin if you have sensitive skin or
even dry skin I think you would really
really enjoy this one all right the next
one I want to talk about is super mud so
super mud is great if you have oily skin
congested skin combination skin if you
deal with breakouts you're going to love
this if you have dry skin if you have
sensitive skin and even if you have
aging skin I don't think this is going
to be the right treatment or mask for
you it is going to drive like some mint
on your face literally you can't move
your face you can't smile it's like one
of those really tight uncomfortable
feelings it has quite an offensive scent
in my opinion and I'm not trying to say
it's like offensive like I'll kind of
hate the way it smells I kind of do it
smells like black licorice I don't like
black licorice however I think that if
you are sensitive skins you're not going
to like this the particles in here that
aren't feeling they feel like
exfoliating are quite harsh and abrasive
so I think that that's just going to
irritate your skin further and like I
said if you have dry skin this is just
going to take out too much moisture it's
gonna suck out too much sebum in your
skin and if you have aging skin I opened
this is going to do anything beneficial
for you what I do like about it is that
I put it on dry skin and it will start
to change colors in the area where it's
pulling out like congestion of your skin
or pulling out oil so it's really really
cool cuz you can actually see it working
but if you have skin that isn't super
oily or you have skin that doesn't have
like breakouts or active like congestion
I don't think you're gonna like this so
this is a great one for oily skin
combination skin and congested skin
alright the next one I want to talk
about is youth mud and this is great if
you do have aging skin if you have dry
skin if you have normal skin if you have
combination skin and oily skin so the
only one that I wouldn't recommend this
for is probably sensitive skin it is
very strong smelling it really does
tingle on the face when you apply this
the only thing I don't like about this
is it has a very thick mud base however
as you guys can probably see it's got
green tea leaf particles in there and
they're huge so they start to fall out
all over you and I
I hate that because this is my second
favorite one out of the batch and I'm
like oh come on every time I put it on
those little leaves start to fall out
like on my clothing down my neck is just
really really gross and I don't like it
however the smell is amazing but it
really does start to tangle on your skin
so if you have sensitive skin this is
going to be too much for you it is
slightly abrasive it definitely has a
microdermabrasion sort of thing going on
so after you leave it on your skin for
about five to 15 minutes depending on
how long you can stand that tingling
feeling um after you leave it on you're
going to go and wash it off with warm
water and I like to start massaging in
circular motions so it's going to help
you know reduce any sort of like
hyperpigmentation you might have cause
it's laying the new skin come through
and also if you have dry skin it can
help with dullness um anybody who has
dry skin you just have a lot of buildup
of dead skin cells I know it sounds
gross but it's true
so exfoliating your skin can be quite
nice and I think that you would like
this a lot so this is for all skin types
except for sensitive in my opinion all
right the next one I want to talk about
is gravity bug this is a firming
treatment and it's really cool it's
actually a peel-off mask I have had some
bad experience with peel-off mask
because I feel like if you don't apply
enough of the peel-off mask you
literally will be peeling off tiny
little sections for an hour after you're
done with the treatment the one thing I
will say about this product is that it
will definitely like literally keep it
away from your hairline keep it away
from your eyelashes your eyebrows this
will pull your hair out okay it's a very
very thick consistency it smells like
coconut milk like literally smells
amazing if I can open it there um it
smells absolutely amazing it's this
thick white consistency and after it
dries on your skin it actually turns
silver so you know exactly when to wash
it off it feels really really creamy and
thick it doesn't have any sort of like
tingling sensation or properties to it
but I think that this is absolutely
fantastic if you have aging skin and you
want a little bit of firmness or to pull
your skin like a little taut
now I'm 23 years old so I don't have
tons and tons of issues with like
sagging or anything like that however my
mom who recently just turned 66 years
old was here recently to visit me and
she loved this along her decollete her
neck and she claims she has like jowls I
don't think she does she looked amazing
for her age but she has some sagging in
this area and she wore this and she
thought it was
really lifts and it firms it doesn't
take away any moisture in the skin which
i think is really good if you do have
aging skin and I think people with dry
skin would also actually really really
enjoy this I feel like it does brighten
up a little bit of discoloration it's
not as good as the next mask I'm going
to talk about for those kind of
properties but I think overall it is a
really really nice one and if you have
aging skin dry skin or even skin that is
like a little blotchy I think you would
really really enjoy gravity bud all
right and then the last one I am going
to talk about is flash mud and I love
this little containers my favorite one I
really really hope that they come out
with a pink one who else hope that like
I really really hope they do I think
they will be so cute but this is flash
mud which is a brightening treatment I
use this all summer this was like my
go-to you guys can see I'm almost up
like used up it's almost completely used
I'm almost up with this I almost
completely used it up it is absolutely
fantastic it smells like candy like
literally it just smells like candy
you know those little like Haribo Haribo
candies this one is my bike I used to
get those all the time just got on my
lip
I used to get those all the time my
dad's actually Swedish and when he would
come home from Sweden he would always
bring me like Haribo little candies and
that's exactly what it smells like
it smells like those little pink whales
I don't know if you guys remember we can
get those over the US but they're really
good smells exactly like candy it does
have tea leaves in there again not too
exfoliating crazy exfoliating it is
probably the second most exfoliating and
compared to the youth mud but it's not
so much like a microdermabrasion it's
more just like it's going to take off
the dead skin cells so if you have a dry
skin I think you would love this if you
have discoloration like I said I have
combination skin and I used to struggle
with hormonal acne along my jawline so I
do have acne or hyperpigmentation acne
scarring along those areas this really
really does brighten it up a little goes
a long way with this product and you
don't want to use too much because if
you do there is like this weird kind of
oily residue that will be left on your
skin after you wash it off again it's
kind of similar to the youth mod what I
would recommend is after leaving it on
for about five to thirty minutes go
ahead and add a little water on and
start massaging in so you really can get
those exfoliating properties because I
really what's going to brighten the skin
and then just be careful not to apply
too much of the product so I think if
you have I was skin I was gonna say
sensitive but now I think if you have
sensitive skin you're not going to like
this one has a strong sense and again
the exfoliating particles in there are
pretty heavy-duty it's going to be too
much for you in my opinion but I think
if you have dry skin this would be
really really nice to help like make
your skin not look as dull if you have
combination skin oily skin I think
you're going to love it as well and even
if you have aging skin because a lot of
people with aging skin have age spots or
even if you have like melasma I mean
whatever I think that this is a really
really fantastic one so if those are
kind of like little mini reviews and my
thoughts on which cleanse low mask pick
for your skin type they are very very
pricey so I hope that this was somewhat
helpful if you are going to go ahead and
purchase a full size if you guys have
any um thoughts or if you have used any
of these masks let me know below I'm
curious to see what you guys think of
them because I love the brand as a whole
obviously I purchased all these with my
own money I'm not affiliated with them
in any way but literally it's just one
of those things where it's like I love
this brand I don't know what it is I got
asked so many times I filmed a lot of
reviews like on the full-size like
products like this and people were like
did you get sent these products for a
review because like it sounds like too
good to be true I just really really
enjoyed these products so it's one of
those lines that I feel like my skin
really like clicks with I know that
sounds so weird but I feel like
sometimes you find a line and it's like
they can do no wrong they can do no
wrong they just work really really well
for my skin and I have noticed that
masking has helped my skin so much I'm
asked probably every other day I know
that's a lot but I do I'm asked probably
every other day whether I'm using just
one mask or multi-masking I will be
doing a video on multi-masking but yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this video like
I said let me know if you've tried any
of these or if you are going to try one
let me know which one and I will see you
guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
