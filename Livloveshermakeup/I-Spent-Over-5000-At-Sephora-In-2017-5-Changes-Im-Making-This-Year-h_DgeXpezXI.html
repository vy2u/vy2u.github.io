my channel I promise I will be filming
again in my beauty room tomorrow I have
left my ring light for probably a good
10 to 12 days at my dad's new place so
if you're wondering why I have been
filming I just kicked my camera if
you're wondering why I have been filming
with this background that's why but I
will bring it home tonight too because
uh I am in the mood to film again and I
know that it's been a little difficult
for me the past couple of months on
YouTube I have not been as inspired but
I have a little three-part series that I
want to do in the next couple of days
even though I said I wasn't gonna film
town Monday here I have
and this little three-part series is
going to be a little more I guess a
minimalistic now I have a no way shape
or form a minimalistic sort of channel
or a anti-consumerism channel I feel
like I fall right in between I am
definitely somebody who purchases a lot
of makeup but I would not consider
myself a hoarder I am more than willing
to declutter products that I also do
feel like my collection has been
overflowing lately so what I want to do
today is talk to you guys about the
amount of money that I spent at Sephora
in 2017
I'm going to talk about five different
things that I will be doing this year so
that that amount is not as high this
year and then tomorrow I am sharing my
minimalist wish list for these Sephora
vib sale and then I will also do a
recommendations video the next day and
for that recommendations video instead
of sitting there and saying this is my
favorite product this is my favorite
product this is my favorite product I'm
going to try and be a little more
inclusive and talk about products that I
think would work for a lot of different
skin tones products that would work for
a lot of different skin types etc so and
that is what we are doing the next three
days let's go ahead and jump right into
it guys I want to let you know how much
money I spent at Sephora even at 20 at
17 that amount is five thousand two
hundred and fifty four and
dollars and that is a lot of money to
spend at Sephora now I feel like my
obsession with Sephora at least started
when I was working as a skincare
consultant at Sephora when I was in
college I was working at a Manhattan
location I absolutely loved it that is
how I was kind of putting myself through
school and also my parents were helping
me since I was in college and it was a
really really great experience however I
definitely started to purchase very
and skincare I still do and trust me
there are some great great alternatives
at the drugstore but now being cruelty
free I find a lot of my skincare
products that I purchase are above the
$50 mark and they are definitely high
end they're cruelty free and they're
from Sephora so I feel like my skincare
obsession kind of started then now if
you go back and look at the start of my
channel to two and a half years ago I
had a huge collection still I have
actually started to really really
minimize my collection and within the
past year I have actually decluttered
half of my collection I know I still get
a lot of people telling me you have way
too much you have way too much of this
and I sort of agree but the collector
side of me disagrees I really love
makeup and it's not like I am going and
continuously spending to the point where
I have no money left I have a special
account that I treat myself with I call
it my M&amp;amp;M account it is my music and my
makeup account where I have extra money
where I can go ahead and spoil myself if
I want to purchase a makeup item or if I
want to go ahead and purchase like a
musical instrument or a score or
something like that and then when I did
start my youtube channel purchasing more
and more was definitely something that
was kind of in because I wanted to
review all of the latest products in no
way shape or form saying that I'm never
gonna purchase new products I definitely
will but I want to be a little more
conscious about it this year I'm not
somebody who spends a lot of money at
Alta I don't even think and that I am
platinum anymore at Ulta I just really
really enjoys Sephora and I'm somebody
who will buy $5 tops I don't do
with my hair I always throw it up and
abide it but there's something about
luxurious skin care and makeup that
really it really gets to me and it is my
hobby and obviously it's a little bit of
a collector saying and a lot of my money
goes up by by on those kind of products
so I'm gonna walk you guys through five
different things I will be doing so that
I don't spend another $5,000 at
Sephora in 2018 so let's go ahead and
jump right in number one I am going to
stop purchasing backup items I have a
huge thing about backup products in fact
I have a whole drawer filled
with a bunch of stuff that I'm probably
not going to get too especially skincare
that's probably going to go bad I need
to stop with this whole mentality of
my god I'm gonna run out and then I'm
gonna have to order it and then I'm
gonna have to wait three or four days
like that is not the case I'm Sephora
VIP Bruges I get very very quick
shipping for the most part and if I need
to reorder something I can do that I
also live 15 minutes away from a Sephora
so if there is something that I
absolutely absolutely need like I'm out
of makeup remover or something like that
I can just drive over there on the way
home from work and I can pick it up
myself
no more backups absolutely no more
backups number two well I'm going to
check the expiration date on a similar
product within my collection any time I
feel the urge to buy something new
specifically for foundations now I did a
foundation declutter recently I will go
ahead and throw it up in the cards I
kept 20 foundations and I decluttered 20
foundations foundations for me are one
of those products that go bad insanely
insanely quickly I love all 20
foundations that I have in my collection
currently but I know me and I know say
if Smashbox like put out a new
foundation I would probably jump on it
Smashbox is the brand that I love every
single foundation I have tried from them
personally I love these Smashbox camera
ready BB water drops I love their studio
Skin Foundation if they were to release
a new foundation I would immediately
want to purchase it so what I'm going to
do was go ahead and go into my
collection flip over both of those
foundations from Smashbox take a look at
the exploration see how much I've used
and tell myself sure you can purchase
the new one if you're gonna finish this
one before the expiration date now for
me I find that my foundations really do
not last more than 12 or 13 months to be
completely honest but when you have 20
in your collection which is a huge
amount and you are shopping your stash
of once a week and that means it is
going to take 20 weeks for you to get
through every single one of the
foundations in your collection so I'm
going to try my best to go ahead and
always check the expiration date and
make sure that I can use something up
before I purchase something else now
like I said specifically with foundation
I think that's really really important I
know that this will not happen every
single time and there are going to be
times where I talked myself into
purchasing something but I think with
cream products it's definitely something
I want to give it up number three I am
going to try and not be as aware of my
point perks as well as just samples in
general usually
they have these little weekly things
where you can go ahead and spend over
$25 or over $50 and you will get a
little deluxe size of something that's
usually new I'd be very bad bad habit of
wanting to get that little deluxe sized
thing and purchasing something I don't
need for $25 or for $30 or $50 or
whatever it is just to get the little
mini and I know this sounds so
backwards but it's just something that I
do I also am really really into
collecting at my points and right now I
think I only have like a hundred points
because I recently did a huge splurge
and I ordered a lot of products from
Sephora and on top of that I got a huge
point perk and I love the thought of
building up my points and then getting
something extravagant and huge and
wonderful but knowing that I have to
purchase something to get that something
extravagant and makes me go and purchase
unnecessary things so that is definitely
something that I am going to avoid this
year another thing that I want to be
careful with is I'm kind of scanning my
love's LeSueur my wish list on a weekly
basis and I want two separate products
that I want versus products that I need
when I do my wishlist video tomorrow you
guys are going to see there are only
five products on my wish list right now
there are two at the bottom is that our
products that I want versus three at the
top that I need when I say need I mean
obviously I don't technically need
anything from Sephora and it comes at
two of moisturizers when it comes to
skin care products when it comes to
removing my makeup those are products I
would consider I need a versus want and
then you know perfumes or a new
foundation or the latest and greatest
palette those are more so things that I
want so I feel like scanning my wish
list and just keeping track of
everything is going to be very helpful
as well and finally I am going to delete
the Sephora app off of my phone I am one
of those people that will sit late at
night on these Sephora app and I will
just sit there and I will pile into
my shopping cart
I will pile it into my loves list and I
actually did a video about a week ago
where I talked about some products that
were in my loves list and I don't know
how the they got there so I'll go
ahead and throw that up in the cards but
yeah
five things that I'm going to be doing
like I said I'm not one of those people
that's just gonna stop buying makeup I
would just like to be able to lower this
number five thousand dollars at one
specific store is a lot and granted I'm
not doing five thousand dollars a year
at Ulta or anything like that but it
still is a lot to spend on makeup in
general and when you combine that
together with different websites
throughout the year that I probably
purchase from that is a huge amount of
mine if I could cut it in half this year
I would be extremely extremely happy and
proud of myself and then maybe I can go
purchase a new record or purchase a new
flute I joined something that's gonna
need maybe a little more to me
personally so and that is it for this
video you guys let me know down below if
you would like how much money you spent
at Sephora last year it took me a while
to go ahead and tally everything up but
so far this year I have only spent at
$300 I know that's basically like 100
bucks a month about I think I'm doing
pretty good so yeah that's pretty much
it
I will see you guys tomorrow thank you
for joining me bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
