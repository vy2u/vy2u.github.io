my channel a long time no
see it has been at least six or seven
days since I have posted and the last
time I filmed was probably about a week
and a half ago or maybe even two weeks
ago so before we get into this video I
did want to let you guys know that for
the next two months all of May as well
as June I will be having a little bit of
a different posting as scheduled and
there are a couple of reasons for this a
number one we are moving I know a lot of
you seem to think we've only been in
Arizona for like five or six months
we've actually been here for at eleven
and a half months already it does not
feel like it but we are moving back to
the Midwest you guys I actually
announced this on my snapchat about six
months ago when we got our new jobs but
I know I officially have not announced
it on here so we are moving in five
weeks and second of all my health is not
good right now and I actually don't want
to go into detail on it I know that
that's gonna leave some of you a little
antsy it may be in the future I will do
a video on what exactly I'm dealing with
at the moment but honestly I'm just not
really comfortable with talking about it
on here right now so thank you so much
for understanding or at least the
majority of you will be understanding of
that like I said maybe in the future I
will touch on it but right now I just
really don't want to my health is always
in fluctuation sometimes I'm feeling
really great and sometimes I'm feeling
like you guys know I do have asthma
I do suffer from lupus I have a lot of
things ought oh you know lated things
that I deal with on a daily basis and
for the most part I usually I'm able to
push through and punch through and get
things done but right now there is
something that's completely different
for me that I'm dealing with and it's
been a lot it's been a lot so yeah that
is why I will have a little bit of a
different posting schedule if you are
wondering what the days will be it's
going to be Monday Wednesday and Friday
again this will just be for the next two
months and it is going to be a beauty
related content all three of those days
and I will get back to miscellaneous
Monday as well as midweek mysteries as
well as fails and Holy Grail shot my
stash once we're done and all moved in
so basically five days a week seven days
a week I'll be back to posting and that
will be sometime in July but anyway I
just wanted to say that before we got
into the video because I know not all of
you follow me on Instagram
or even on here on the community tab
section where I kind of shared the news
a couple of days ago but without further
ado let's
today's video which is going to be all
about flashback fails I don't think I've
seen anybody do this it's possible
somebody has so I will go ahead and
quickly search on YouTube and if anybody
has done a video like this I'll throw it
up in the cards I've seen people like
Samantha March and a lot of different
other youtubers do flashback favorites
where they go back and they discuss hey
boys - like this product well today for
doing something a little different these
are all products that I have tried at
one point and I decided to go ahead and
try them again I am definitely a very
opinionated person I'm very decisive and
if I don't like something I usually
don't like it but I am NOT opposed to
trying something out again I think a lot
of people get the vibe that I don't do
that but I promise you I do I actually
have an upcoming video for you guys as
well
discussing all about products that I
feel I was wrong about okay so that's
what we're gonna be talking about in
this video products that I tried again
and I still don't like and I will let
you know why but let's go ahead and jump
right into it that could cost medics
aqua luminous foundation the shade I
have right here is called fair and yeah
you know I first tried this out probably
about two years ago when it first
released I did a video a review video
where I ranted about the shade range
which was complete they did not
have a lot of dark shades and this
latest shade fair was way too dark for
me now that I have a little more of a
tan I'm down here in Arizona I self tan
probably once or twice a week this is
actually a perfect match for my
complexion however it really just
doesn't look good on my skin does not
help to smooth things out it doesn't
have a lot of coverage to it it's not
something that makes my skin feel
particularly hydrated even though it's
called the aqua luminous foundation I
understand it is water-based and I love
a lot of water-based foundations I've
been really into lighter weight
foundations as well as a lighter
coverage recently but this just does not
look good on my skin it actually really
emphasizes a lot of dry patches on my
cheeks so I did try this out again I
actually purchased this for the second
time the first one I returned the second
time I purchased this was recently on
what was it HauteLook and yeah you guys
I'm just not into it so I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter that - my friend
Brittany right - she went ahead and sent
me as well as probably every u2
bar on the planet a ton of pallets from
their website for PR and they ended up
sending me the Amazonia
palate as well as the retro love and I
gotta say hey guys I tried these out
probably about a month ago when I first
got my package
I'd recently tried them out this past
week again and I don't like these
palettes now there are a couple really
good at palettes that you can get from
Hache I am still testing all of them out
but I will do an in-depth video letting
you guys know which ones are good which
ones are not I'm very impressed with the
face palettes from a face candy which is
the amazonia palette but this eye shadow
palette right here is such a piece of
 it's supposed to be a do before the
kylie jenner palettes which I do not
support Kylie Jenner I do not support
the Kardashians in general so I will not
purchase any of that so I was
pretty excited cuz I love the colors and
the tones in here it reminds me a lot of
the lorac mega pro 2 and you have that
beautiful forest green color you have
some nice gold do you have some mattes
you have some shimmers you have a ton of
different finishes these are just
incredibly you know they're soft and
they feel pigmented they look a little
pigmented when you swatch them out you
get them on the eye and they just blend
away into nothing into like a
oblivion okay so they don't wear very
well even with any sort of primer that I
tried like a glitter glue a really
really long-lasting primer a high-end
primer a drugstore primer they don't
last on my eyes so I'm decluttering that
and I'm also decluttering the bad habit
retro love I know a lot of you did not
like subculture but I gotta say this is
worse than subculture okay this truly
makes a mess on my eyes these darker
shades like mod and free love and
nostalgia and hippie I mean they just
look disgusting on my eyes I
cannot blend these out I have a really
really difficult time they might go onto
the thinker and feel super smooth
somewhat decent when you swatch them but
then you start to blend and suddenly
it's like you have this patchy patchy
mess that just does not look good on the
eyes so like I said you guys yes they
sent me a ton of palace to try out some
of them are good some of them are bad
and these two right here are I
still don't like them move on to a
product here that I mentioned in a
product sales video nine months ago so
many of you in that video we're telling
me that I was using this product wrong
and that I needed to try it again
if this is the covergirl easy breezy
brow shape plus define in the shade
blonde and I can't I can't you guys I
have to declutter this I held on to it
because I wanted to try it again I am
all for you guys telling me Oh
hey this is how I used a particular
palate or this is how I use a particular
product to get it to work for me and
then I can try it again but this
honestly just leaves my eyebrows looking
white like this color is way too light
for me a lot of you were telling me go
ahead and mix it together with like a
darker brow pencil it honestly doesn't
hold my brows in place very well I hate
the brush I don't think that I should
have a spoolie like brush like this
where it has a bent almost like a
mascara wand it's just very very strange
for the eyebrow like I said the color is
absolutely horrendous I am naturally a
blonde I have been using a beta's what
is it Mulva conditioner which kind of
darkens up your hair a little bit so I
have been technically kind of dyeing my
hair a little bit but naturally I am
sort of like dirty blonde and this is
just white on my eyebrows so if you have
extremely like white hair or something
like that this might actually match your
eyebrows if you don't have a lot of
color or saturation to your eyebrows and
you want to darken them up just a tad
this might work for you but thank you to
everybody who told me I should try it
again but I've been giving this a go for
way too long it has got to go I still
don't like it alright here we have the
Laura Geller easy illuminating stick so
many of you were also telling me that I
just wasn't using this right and I
should give it another go it is
beautiful you guys I love her baked
gelato swirl illuminators okay and this
easy illuminating stick is in the shade
ethereal such a pretty color a baby a
bubblegum pink cool tone color with a
gold shift to it honestly gorgeous when
you get it onto the skin but there is
something about this consistency and the
actual formulation that just grosses me
out it's hella oily it honestly kind of
reminds me of like the fenty beauty body
lava a lot of you are recommending I go
ahead and just put it right onto like my
collarbone or right onto my shoulders to
kind of show like a little bit of a glow
I still don't like it that way cause it
just smudges all over my clothing it
will pick up my foundation and it will
start to peel with my powder so I can't
really wear it with any sort of
foundation or powder products if I want
to wear this and have to be by itself
and it looks strange by itself because
it has that really really artificial
baby a bubblegum pink sort of color to
it so this did not work for me I tried
it again guys I still don't like it I
know I've talked about this eye primer
before but so many people seem to enjoy
the lorac behind the see
I primer I'm thinking of my friend Katie
right now on Instagram if you're
watching hi Katie she has the channel as
well I'll go ahead and throw it up in
the cards Katie Marais she uses this a
lot in her Instagram videos I just tried
so hard to get this eye primer to work
for me
but there is something about this
consistency it's like my shadows don't
want to adhere to it but at the same
time it's almost like overly sticky and
tacky I just dropped it on the floor it
doesn't really matter there's nothing I
could really show you guys it just has
the strangest texture to it and honestly
my eyeshadow creases like crazy when I
use this eye primer so I was trying to
use up that little deluxe size sample
honestly I'm gonna declutter it I used
to not like it I still don't like it
it's not something that works for me
and finally we have a cleanser here that
I tried out around Christmas time I told
you guys on snapchat I said suck this is
a bad cleanser this is from Burt's Bees
it's the brightening daily facial
cleanser with Daisy extract there are a
lot of good products from Burt's Bees
and there's some products they're
like up 50/50 you know what I mean I'm
wearing their goodness close foundation
today one pump with that great all over
the face for me personally this on the
other hand very very strange slippery
consistency I have a weird thing with
body washes facial cleansers that are
like too slippery it's just a thing okay
but this honestly just doesn't do much
it doesn't remove makeup very well it
does not even work as a double cleanse
so even if you go in with a cleansing
balm and then going with this you're
most likely not gonna get your makeup
off it stings around my eye area and it
definitely didn't brighten my skin a lot
of you are recommending I go ahead and
use it on my body so I started doing
that and I only have a tiny little bit
left here so you'll probably see it in
my upcoming empties video but still it
has a little bit of oil in it so I was
using it to like wash my pits and
and I gotta tell you it just leaves this
strange consistency you know when you're
using a product that does have oil
infused into it it leaves a little
something there not into it so I did not
like that
in a December and I still don't like it
now so anyway guys that is it for
today's video thank you so much for
joining me I hope you guys enjoyed the
video I will see you on Wednesday okay
