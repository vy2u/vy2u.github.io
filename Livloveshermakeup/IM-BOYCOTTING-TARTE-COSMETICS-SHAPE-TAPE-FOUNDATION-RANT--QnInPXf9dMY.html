so today I have a rusty no video Tarte
cosmetics is the one that we are
roasting today in fact I'm
boycotting Tarte I'm done I'm finally
 done now this has been there
have been a series of things that have
kind of accumulated to this point if
you're curious I will not be buying from
Tarte cosmetics anymore not until they
can get their together and you
think that I already have in my
collection from Tarte cosmetics I'll be
doing a project pan video I'll be using
up and I will not be repurchasing I will
not stand for what this brand has to
offer anymore in fact they really don't
have that much to offer compared to
other beauty brands in the business so
if you guys didn't know Tarte to
recently release their shape tape of
foundation I actually heard about this
because uLTA Beauty came to me and one
of their reps came to me and asked if I
would like to do a sponsored video
trying out the new matte foundation as
well as the hydrating foundation I
declined and I later saw exactly what
was going on with the shade selection
now obviously when these photos surface
people were incredibly incredibly
shocked people with a medium to deep
complexion we're saying hey what the
 tarts and they went over and they
spoke up and they said hey Tarte
cosmetics what's going on here Tarte
took it upon themselves to start
deleting comments they even went ahead
and they closed off comments and then
late last night
tarkoff Lennox went ahead and said hey
we're releasing ten more shades of the
Tarte shaped ape foundation well guess
what too little too late buddy oh if
this is the thing I'm very happy that at
least you listen to people and you said
 we really really made a mistake
here and we need to go ahead and we need
to make this right let's release ten
more foundations but the way that you
guys even wrote to the newsletter the
way that everything came up made it seem
like oh everything's gonna be fine now
well it turns out it's gonna be five new
foundations afford the mat foundation
and five new foundations are for the
hydrating foundations that brings us up
to what a total of twenty foundations in
total now a lot of people are saying
well live you know if you know what the
turqu cheap tape concealer which I own
and I do like as a concealer you knew
that they were gonna release this as a
shade selection so you don't get to be
all up in arms and it's absolutely a
different case here it's heart-shaped
tape concealer when that first released
they had absolutely no idea if that
concealer was going to sell if that was
going to be a big selling product and
this is one of the most anticipated
foundation
cases of 2018 and they even surprised us
by showing that they had a Mac and a
hydrating foundation and they
knew that this foundation would sell and
they still came out with a shaped
election like that if this is the thing
when you're competing with brands like
fenty beauty and brands that are
actually catering to every single person
or as many people as they can out there
and are showing that they are inclusive
you are going to fall behind if you
can't be inclusive as well and tart will
you spend what probably three hundred
fifty four hundred thousand dollars a
year flying out beauty influencers to go
to tropical vacation so they can talk
about your products and take sexy photos
of themselves and their bikinis well
guess what
you also have enough money to go ahead
and release at least 40 shades for our
foundation there is absolutely no reason
why this shouldn't have been handled the
right way so anyway guys that's just
kind of this ropes video
 you tart I'm done I'm done I hope a
lot of you guys will be done with chart
as well because I'm sick of seeing all
these comments on my Instagram of all if
I'm if I don't say so myself all these
white girls just like me
saying oh well you know that foundation
will match me that foundation is gonna
be great stop being such an ignorant
little prick stop doing it you
need to understand that racism is very
real in this world it's very real in the
beauty community and when you go and you
purchase something like that that is
very inclusive for maybe your skin tone
but not people that have deeper
complexions or you say something along
the lines of well that every brand has
to cater to everyone do you want to know
why there are some black co2 makeup
brands out there it's because these
women can not find foundations and
makeup it will fit their skin because
these mainstream brands will not make
them I get so upset talking about this
I'm a white girl I am very very
privileged but this is disgusting and
disrespectful and as a human being you
should know better you should not be
saying things like that and you should
think a little more not just about
yourself but about other people this is
absolutely something that I had to talk
about I felt the need to talk about more
people need to talk about and I hope
with the reviews start to surface when
it comes to this particular foundation
people will be honest people will
mention hey guess what especially beauty
influencers who have influence on the
beauty community you gotta speak up you
gotta let these brands know that it's
not okay it's not all about getting PR
it's not all about you
being able to go on you know paid for
trips yes that's all fun and games and
that's a great but have a little
dignity you know have a little respect
Jesus so that's all I have to say for
this video between the braces me but
they posted on their Instagram in 2017
between the on and off good formulations
not good formulations this brand is not
that special that's what I'm realizing
they have some good products and they
have some products and you know
what I expect much more from this brand
than what I'm getting and what you guys
are getting so uh yeah that's it hope
you enjoyed the video if you didn't
enjoy it fine that's fine but I needed
to I needed to say something and yeah
I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
