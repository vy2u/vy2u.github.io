back to my channel today's video is
going to be my final thoughts on the
two-faced peanut butter and honey
palette as well as a little bit of an
unboxing and swatch fest on some of the
dubious place palettes I did order three
of them off of Haute look for $19 a
piece and the eye look that I'm wearing
right now is actually from the nubian
palette you guys will see a really
really laid back get ready with me doing
this I look tomorrow like first
impressions on the eyes but I wanted to
go ahead Anna swatch these for you guys
kind of unbox them with you because they
arrived so quickly from Haute look I
have never had an order arrived that
quickly from Haute look but anyway let's
go ahead and start with the Too Faced
peanut butter and honey as you can see
it is already back in the box and as you
can probably tell from the title I am
returning this you guys were a hundred
percent right I really wanted to love
this when I was doing my first
impressions on this a week ago which I
will go ahead and throw up in the cards
for you guys you could tell that I was
really trying to get this to work
Too Faced is my all-time favorite brand
and I have no problem with throwing them
under the bus when they deserve to be
thrown under the bus but I love the nine
piano palettes from Too Faced I
absolutely adore them they are my
favorite formula that they ever released
I mean I love all of them the natural
matte palette is great the sugarpop
palette is great all of them are just
really really beautiful in my opinion so
of course I wanted this to work you guys
but I really just feel like it's a
supplementary palette you have to use it
with another palette and I don't think
it's worth of these $36 I just really
don't so they palette that I was using
it with last week was the viola bas Pro
ride-or-die palette just using this
palette last week made me realize I
totally don't need the Too Faced peanut
butter and honey this literally has
every single shade in here that you
could need and I was rarely reaching for
this little palette right here so um
just quick rundown I feel like these
swatch poorly they don't go onto the
skin very well I don't know if I just
got a bad palette a few of you were
saying you even have a deeper complexion
and they showed up beautifully on you
but I felt like I really really had to
build I had to foil shades I had to
really work them up on my eyes again
like with the first impressions you can
really really see that I had to keep on
building I tried to use every single
shade in this palette I'm during the
first impressions and it's so funny the
color selection in here you have like a
yellow and then you have like a purpley
shade over here what does yellow and
purple look like
like a bruise like it's just so strange
the color selection overall everything
about it just kind of um I feel like the
more I used it you guys the more I
started to dislike it and you could tell
on snapchat I would check in with you
guys every day I'm like okay today I
hope on this and then I really went in
with a vial of vos palette I knew
probably by day four of using this that
it was going back to Ulta I just really
don't think it's good quality a few of
you were telling me because these are
really firmly press you were seeing to
take a tissue and kind of rub off that
top layer to see if I can really get
into some smoother more pigmented and
nice kind of shadows underneath there I
tried doing that could not get these to
work I have already hit hard pan on
Honeybuns as well as honey brittle but
my favorite treat in this palette is
honey brittle I think that's such a
beautiful transition shade but overall I
don't think these blend well I don't
think they swatch well I don't think
they even go onto the eyes that well
unless you really really want to take
the time and you have the patience to
really sit there and build up an eye
look for 20 minutes I'm not that kind of
girl I'm not a makeup artist this just
doesn't really interest me and I just
think the fact that it has to be used
with another palette like literally you
really can't get that great of eye looks
with just using this by itself the fact
that it has to be used with another
palette is complete when I buy
a palette I wanted to be able to perform
by itself so overall guys I am NOT
interested in this even though I might
have seemed interested when I first got
it again that was a first impressions
literally me opening up the palette and
trying it out for the first time
unfortunately after using it for almost
10 days now I'm just not impressed so
this is going back to Ulta would not
recommend to any of you honestly but if
you have the palette and you love it and
you love really really subtle I looks
I'm so happy for you normally I would
love really subtle eye looks but I just
feel like this is too much work there's
a difference between having a palettes
like this one right here the neutral or
natural matte palette this one is
beautiful as well super super neutral
kind of eye looks that you can get out
of here but there's just such a
difference between the creaminess and
the pigmentation when it comes to this
palette they do swatch slightly on the
poorly side as well however they go on
to the eyes beautifully and it's about
how they perform on the eyes and I just
feel like this is not that great of a
palette so anyway that is my final
thoughts I am returning it totally not
interested in this palette the more I
use it the more I hate it alright let's
go ahead and get into the unboxing on it
the dubious place palette so the
one that I picked up with a nubian
palette like I said I did I put this eye
look together today not quite sure how I
feel about this you guys I felt like
this was very difficult to blend if you
are like a professional makeup artist I
can see how this would work for you but
I'm a little worried about some of like
the more dramatic own sort of feeling
eyeshadows in here but anyway this is
what the Nubian a palette looks like it
has already gotten dirty it when we used
it that once but here are the shades on
the inside this is the really really
neutral one as you guys can see super
super beautiful let me do some swatches
for you guys and I think the mattes are
really really nice very finely milled
but some of these shades are very very
chunky and very very glittery so as you
can see like this shade right here super
glittery that's the one I have on my lid
when you guys see the video tomorrow if
you want to see it um you will be able
to see right away that that was just
like fallout velour things like that but
overall really really beautiful color
selection I think it's really nice I
think it will give you very pretty
sunset looking eye looks but yeah I
would say like I wouldn't really compare
these to like the violet Voss formula as
far as like their Holy Grail palette is
concerned or even the ride-or-die I feel
like those actually go onto the eyes a
lot better these do swatch nicely but
some of the shades here as you can see
are a little on the patchy side now I'm
not a makeup artist I'm just a girl who
likes to wear makeup and I said that in
you know tomorrow's video you guys will
see that I wanted to see how quickly I
could get a pretty eye look and this
took me about 13 minutes and you guys
know I don't edit my videos so you see
everything in real time and 13 minutes
is a little long for me I honestly do
not want to be sitting there for 13
minutes doing my eye makeup so I just
wanted to point that out but yeah this
is the anubian palette so this is just
the first version now the second version
it looks really beautiful and I haven't
dug into it yet but this is what the
actual packaging looks like I love the
packaging on these guys absolutely
beautiful it comes in a nice bubble wrap
as you can see and the shades in here
are amazing and the pan sizes are
freaking huge so here is the palette I
love that color that orange a yellow
color like yes alright so here are the
shades in the Nubian - so this one
definitely has more pops of color you
still have some of those neutral shades
I don't think you need every single one
of these palettes when I put all three
of them side to side by side like
Nubian at the Nubian 2 and then the
masquerade I see a lot of color
similarities they all seem to have a lot
of nice warm tone kind of colors that
are similar but yeah let's go ahead and
do some swatches of these again they're
really really dim ethic own sort of
foiled finished seems a little on the
chunky side and I had a really hard time
working that Dometic own sort of finish
into my actual crease with this I look
so I know that I was using the first
palette but I just wanted to give you
guys a heads up I'm just I can already
see that these are swatching absolutely
beautifully but these were hard to or
not these particular ones but the
formula is hard to work into the actual
crease let's go ahead and swatch some of
the maps in here Madagascar Morocco
those are really beautiful very
pigmented I thought I would really love
the more ooh those are beautiful I
thought I would really really enjoy it
the foiled kind of shadows but these
were just hard to work with that formula
um so these are the mattes I don't know
if the formulas are different in each
palette but yeah that is the Nubian -
very exciting and now let's go ahead and
open up the masquerade palette I have
heard such good things about this hold
on let me just get these two watches off
my hand quickly but the masquerade comes
in pink packaging you guys it looks so
beautiful I'm like yes yes yes so here
is the masquerade palette they are so
beautiful and these things are huge oh
my god I can't even believe it so let me
open this up and juvies place is cruelty
free if you are curious so here's the
pink one oh how pretty is that and I
this one also has yeah big big big pan
sizes these are huge like for the price
especially how I got them which was for
$19 is crazy
but again you guys can see there are the
same sort of colors going on here so you
have like those more neutral kind of
reddish brownish shades let's go ahead
and do some swashing this one is called
bori this is a beautiful kind of pink
shade oh my god these blues look
fantastic
do you guys see that I think they swatch
beautifully like I'm already seeing that
that's what's going on here my hand is
completely stained now do you guys see
that so anyway those are a few swatches
and then let's do the mats I don't know
if they have the same formula
through-and-through sorry my nose is a
little runny I don't know if they have
the same formula through-and-through
between all three palettes I'll have to
double-check that but I really like the
matte
like when I was working that into my
eyes today I thought that worked well
but yeah these foil sheets were a little
tougher to work with so this looks
beautiful very excited to play with
these please let me know if you would
like me to do like a get ready with me
featuring any of these other pallets but
yeah that first get ready with me at
first impressions on the Nubian will be
up to morrow so anyway that is it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
