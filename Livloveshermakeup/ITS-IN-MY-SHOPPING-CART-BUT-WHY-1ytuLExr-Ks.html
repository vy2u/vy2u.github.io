recently I have seen a lot of people
declutter their Sephora loves lists on
camera and I loved that idea so I
thought I would kind of piggyback off of
it and share with you guys a new series
all about it's in my shopping cart but
why why Olivia why is it in your
shopping cart so I do have my shopping
cart as well as my Sephora loves list
pulled up here so I can see all the
ridiculous things that I put into the
loves list and the shopping cart that I
definitely don't need and the first one
is from Anastacio Beverly Hills it's the
UM breezy highlighter I already bought
this I already bought this the other
night I must have put this into my
basket because I did not realize how
tired I was thinking maybe I don't have
it yet but I think that goes to show you
that my collection is huge and it's kind
of sad I don't even remember purchasing
that so I do have it and I will be
showing you in a shop my stash of video
so we're gonna go ahead and just
declutter that right off the love's list
cuz girl you are to get that all right
up next we have before solid jelly beam
illuminator the shade is called glazed
which is a frosted champagne it retails
for $40 I don't like liquid illuminator
so why on earth I put this in my cart I
don't really know now I remember
kind of talking about being interested
in this and really the only interest
level for me is that I want to poke it
and touch it I've seen Instagram videos
where people put it on their face and
they like slather it all over them put
their foundation on I don't think that
would look good on my textured skin I
have a feeling that would not be good
and like I said I'm not a huge fan of
liquid highlighter so how that ended up
in there I don't understand and we're
gonna go ahead and take it right off
also first Holly kicked me off their PR
list and the little salty about it just
a little bit just a little alright
moving on to the Natasha to Nona mini
sunset eyeshadow palette this was not in
my loves list until the other night when
I was reading comments about my anti
haul where I told you I don't need these
palettes from Natasha - no no and then a
bunch of you were saying oh if it's a
really good deal you really should get
it oh it's beautiful and then some of
you were sending me photos of your eye
looks and all this kind of stuff and
what can I say
the peer pressure got to me and I
honestly put this into of my loves list
and I don't understand why I get that
twenty five dollars is a pretty good
price but I've seen the size of this
like the size of your finger okay I'm
going to go ahead and link a review a
video above so you guys can see what the
actual size looks like but it is a waste
of product point of anti Hollis's to be
like I don't need it but you know this
is what happens on YouTube this is why a
lot of us end up collecting that
we're never going to get to or never pan
because we constantly constantly say we
need to buy it we need to buy it we need
to buy it but I don't so I'm taking it
off right now all right up next we have
the pretty vulgar phoenix rising
eyeshadow palette a lot of you were
asking me if I was going to get this and
because pretty vulgar is such a hit or
miss brand I have to go in store and
look at these products first but I can
tell right away I don't need this I
don't need this I can see that it's
beautiful warm tone colors but so is
literally every other palette that has
released the past six months so I
absolutely do not need the Phoenix
Rising eyes shadow palette I don't know
how it crept in there maybe because I am
sort of partial to some of the pretty a
vulgar products I do really like the
nightingale eyes shadow palette I like
their highlighter do I like their
highlighter that much I guess I kind of
like their highlighter see see what I
mean when I'm having to sit here and be
like do I like anything from the brand I
probably should not trust by just like
popping it into my shopping cart that's
not trustworthy so we're gonna take that
out and I feel like the brand is just
way too inconsistent for me to want to
what purchase something even just
purchase it online or pop it in my loves
list right up next we have the Becca
hidroméis set and refreshed powder again
you guys kind of started talking me into
this I ant I hauled it again and this
goes to show you that people who anti
haul stuff I've seen people that do anti
haul videos where they're like I bought
the anti health products and that would
have almost been me for this particular
powder because so many of you are saying
that you saw such a difference with your
skin luckily I went in store and I went
ahead and I swatch this out on my skin
and I immediately could tell this was
not going to be the product for me it
almost feels wet going on when you pick
it up with your brush it almost feels
wet again
it's a Hydra mist and set refresh sort
of powder but I don't think it's
anything special I really don't and some
of you were saying it's fantastic for
you and I am so so so happy for you but
I don't have super super high
expectations when it comes to powders I
just like something
set my face in I usually go for a
drugstore powder so I definitely don't
need this thank you to all of you that
kind of talked me into wanting it but
I'm glad I went in store and swatched it
out so taking that out of the loves list
and then finally the Stila eyes shine a
bright set I have this wicked obsession
with collecting a steely glitter and
glows because I like a lot of them funny
enough a lot of the Stila glitter and
glows are different they've got some
formula inconsistencies and I find it
very funny that I want to finish off the
collection it's kind of like my Beca
flying saucer collection I'm like I have
to have everything from the line I
absolutely have to have everything and I
look at the Stila glitter and glows and
I'm like I have to have it but I've read
reviews I've seen videos I've gone ahead
and swatch some of the shimmering glows
that's why I don't collect too many of
those and also some of the glitter and
glow stirs aren't that great but in this
little set you have the liquid eye
shadow in kitten karma and a liquid
eyeliner in intense black for $27 as a
$35 value are you thinking what I'm
thinking yeah
what the hell live I do not wear liquid
liner I never do in the wing or anything
like that I've done it once on video I
attempted I will throw that up in the
cards if you guys want to see it but
this I cannot believe that I was willing
to just sacrifice a product and be like
oh I'll just declutter that to a friend
or I'll get rid of it just because I
wanted this little Stila glitter and
glow liquid eye shadow which is $27 and
it's a small size it literally makes no
sense so anyway guys those are some
products that are on my shopping list
they no longer are I've cleared them out
I am so glad I did that because honestly
at least before a vib sale is coming up
soon and I only want to focus on
products that first of all I need and
maybe a couple that I want so anyway I
hope you enjoyed this video let me know
if you want me to make it a series and
I'll see you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
