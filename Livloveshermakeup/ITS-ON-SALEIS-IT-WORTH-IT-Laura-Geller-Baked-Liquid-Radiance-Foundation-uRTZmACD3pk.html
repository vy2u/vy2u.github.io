good morning thank you so much for
joining me I hope you are all having a
really fantastic day so far
it is really early in the morning I
literally still have my PJs on I have
not even put any accessories inand yeah
we are here to do a new little series a
new little series a new little series on
my channel we are kick-starting it this
morning and it is going to be called
it's on sale is it worth it so what
inspired me to do this particular series
was the 21 days Beauty event going on at
Ulta right now so I've been all over the
Ulta website every day like all day
every day and I basically mosey down
into the sales section the other night
and I found a foundation on there that
was literally marked down and it is a
high-end foundation it is the Laura
Keller baked liquid radiance foundation
the shade I have is porcelain and I
found this marked down to $20 from $38
so pretty much half off and I was like I
have to get that and I was thinking how
can I incorporate this foundation on to
my channel do I just haul it do I do a
first impressions what do I do and I
thought you know what it's on sale why
don't I start a new little series called
it's on sale is it worth it so I feel
like there's a lot of things that could
technically go wrong with this series
first of all if you watch the video too
late and the item is already sold out
and I don't know if you guys will like
this or not so I really want to know
down in the comments section let me know
do you like this concept do you hate
this concept it's going to be one of
those videos that you have to watch
right away if you want to get on like
the deal now I did pick up this
foundation about a week ago and right
now they still have all nine shades
available ranging from the lightest
shade which is porcelain which is the
one I have all the way down to the deep
shade and they are all on sale for half
off so I feel like it's going to be one
of those video series where like if you
see it you're gonna want to watch it
immediately because you know the deal
might not last that long so I feel like
technically there are some things that
could go wrong with this series so I'd
love to know if you guys love this idea
or if you hate it I did pick up another
one I picked up these Smashbox uhm BB
like ready water drops or whatever
they're called those are also literally
like $20 right now which was again like
half off so I did pick that up and then
I also picked up the Rimmel stay matte
from
which is on sale for 399 right now Ulta
so all of these actually have all of the
shades left so if you guys would like me
to also do a it's on sale is it worth it
on the Smashbox and the Rimmel let me
know in the comment section but yeah I
thought I would just go ahead and since
I am bare face I would go ahead and
apply this product with you guys and
then review it at the same time so we're
going to see if I can multitask like
that and kind of review it and demo it
for you guys at the same time and yeah
let's just get started so like I said
this is the Laura Geller baek's liquid
radiance foundation you get one fluid
ounce of product in here which is the
standard amount for a foundation it has
any really beautiful glass bottle it's
like a frosted glass bottle and then you
lift this up and you actually have a
pump which is really nice the shade I
have is porcelain and when I start
applying it on my face you guys will see
these run very very warm now I
personally have a cool tone you probably
can't tell right now because the lady
looks a little yellow but I personally
have a cool tone in my skin I'm very
very cool toned actually so this really
is one of those foundations I feel like
if the lightest shade runs very yellow
the rest of them are going to run very
yellow so if you do have a warm
undertone you would probably really like
this I have to do a few extra things
like setting it with a really really
kind of white translucent powder to make
it look more like my skin tone but I
actually really do like this foundation
so far so let me read the claims on the
altar comm website with this foundation
it says the next generation of baked now
in a full coverage liquid formula for
the very first time baked pigments
deliver the color correction you love in
a never-before-seen liquid foundation
loose pigments are coated in almond oil
then baked in Italy on terracotta tiles
to create perfectly smooth spheres of
color that lay evenly on the skin these
baked pigments are combined with a water
rich skin loving formula to create
radiance in a bottle with a blend of
illuminating and moisturizing
ingredients baked liquid radiance
delivers weightless creamy color
correction with a natural skin finish
the long wearing streak free formula
leaves skin glowing healthy-looking and
absolutely radiant so right away I'm
just going to say this is definitely not
a full coverage foundation I thought it
was going to be just because the words
baked are in there and I know you
shouldn't associate the words baked with
being full coverage but I just kind of
do and I'm actually really surprised at
how light of a coverage
this particular product is it feels
somewhat heavy on the skin but it
maintains like a light to medium
coverage on the face and I firstly
didn't like that but now I'm actually
really really enjoying it my favorite
way to apply this product is definitely
with my damp a Real Techniques sponge I
just like the way it distributes the
product and again the undertone in this
foundation is very very warm so I feel
like the sponge kind of helps because it
kind of sheers it out a little bit so
that it's not super obvious so I like to
apply apply on five pumps of this so
we're going to go ahead and do that I'm
going to shake it up really well I'm
going to go ahead and apply one two
three four five which you're probably
thinking like won't that's a lot of
foundation but you know what I like a
lot of foundation so anyway I'm going to
go ahead and pull my hair back first so
that I don't get this in my hair and
then I'm just going to dip in with my
Real Techniques sponge and start
applying this all over my face so like I
said I was really surprised at how
lightweight the coverage was now it
doesn't feel particularly lightweight on
the skin and you may be thinking like
what the hell why would you want a light
coverage foundation that feels heavy on
the skin and that's what I was thinking
at first but then I like watched how
long this wore throughout the day and I
was absolutely amazed so you guys can
see you can still see my little acne
marks through there my acne scarring but
this holds up all day long like
literally it has such amazing wear power
and I was surprised because they don't
claim that it has amazing wear power and
I feel like the way that they describe
this product was completely like not the
way it should have been described on the
website because it's not full coverage
it's very very light weight coverage
like a literally just pack I shouldn't
say lightweight it doesn't feel like
weight on the skin but the actual
coverage is very light
like literally sheer to medium coverage
you can still see all of your little
marks through it if you guys were
curious I was wearing this in
yesterday's videos and a lot of people
were asking me what foundation I had on
actually someone was like what BB cream
do you have on like literally that's how
light the coverage is is that it almost
looks like a BB cream but I love the way
it looks on the skin because when you
actually set it in with a powder this
stuff just does not get cakey whatsoever
it maintains a beautiful beautiful
finish on this
skin and it really just looks like skin
by the way I want to touch on this
really quickly all I did
I have not applied any primer or
anything like that I'm not going to be
using concealer I want you guys to see
just the foundation with a translucent
powder but I did cleanse my face I did
not use all my regular skin care items I
only use this Garnier micellar what is
this all-in-one uh micellar cleansing
solution this is the sensitive version
the reason I didn't want to put my
skincare on and all that kind of stuff
is because I feel like sometimes that
can change the way a foundation goes
onto your skin so literally all I did
was wake up and put the micellar water
all over my face and then nothing I
didn't put primer no moisturizer nothing
so I am taking this all over around my
eyes and you guys can see I only have a
little bit left and again I don't feel
like I'm getting the sort of coverage I
would want which is why I will go back
in with a few more pumps but I will say
honestly this is not a super super
buildable foundation and I know I'm
making is now really horrible like it's
really not that great of a foundation
but there's something about the way this
looks on the skin the finish of it it's
just so glowy and beautiful I think if
you have dry skin or aging skin you
would love this foundation because it
literally does not settle in anywhere it
does not make my face sting there are no
harsh ingredients in here like literally
I just love the way it looks on my skin
and my blueprint commented yesterday he
was like I really like your makeup today
and I was like I always say this on my
channel but when the boyfriend says
something when your man is like
literally like I like the way your skin
looks today it's like yes gotta keep
that foundation so anyway as you can see
it's not covering up my dark circles
it's not covering off all my little acne
marks and pimples but for the most part
it's giving you beautiful luminous
quality to my skin now if you do have
oily skin this just is going to break up
on you throughout the day I have
combination skin and I get oily in my
t-zone I do find that I have to touch up
with this product throughout the day
however if you have dry skin you're
going to love this this literally has
such a beautiful luminous glow to the
skin as you guys can see now you can see
it is pulling a little bit of a yellow
undertone we'll fix that in a second but
I mean it just looks so gorgeous on the
skin
I I really can't get over it and like I
said the wear time on this is really
incredible I feel like just the way that
this foundation is marketed was
completely wrong like not full coverage
the board's based totally throw me off
but it's really just luminous and glowy
on the skin and it kind of reminds me of
the NARS sheer glow foundation I had a
sample of that once and this is what
that this product reminds me of that one
so that is it this is about seven pumps
of this foundation and you guys can see
it's not building very well I just
wanted to go back in with another two
pumps to show you guys it really doesn't
build that much on the skin I feel like
even with a brush it's still just like
kind of shears out on the skin but it
never looks heavy or cakey I am one of
those people I personally really like a
full coverage foundation but I've been
loving this foundation because it looks
like skin and I feel like if you are one
of those people that has a really nice
even complexion to begin with and you
just want to even your skin out but add
in some moisture and things like that
you're going to love this and on top of
that if you are someone who has like
hombu skin like I do and you still want
to maintain dry areas on your face book
you want them to be moisturize like my
cheeks get very very dry this is going
to be beautiful just make sure that you
set it in with a powder if you have dry
skin I really don't think you're even
going to need to set it in with a powder
I think it gives such a luminous quality
that you're just going to want to keep
it like this but yeah so that is about
seven pumps which I know sounds like so
much the only reason I put so much on
like I said was to show you guys that it
really doesn't blend on the skin so in
my opinion one to two pumps that this
product is enough because it's not going
to build up anymore alright so next I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to set
this in with a powder because like I
said I do have combo skin I got to set
it in so I'll be using my essence all
about Matt fixing compact powder and I'm
going to be going in with my Tarte err
buffer foundation brush I'm going in and
then I'm just going to be stippling this
on to my face now this is going to go
ahead and change the finish of this
foundation the finish on this foundation
I think is beautiful it's very very
luminous and dewy which is why I think
you would love it if you do have dry
skin however I actually like the way it
looks when I do set it in with a very
matte powder because
and it just looks like that skin and I
don't know what is really really loving
this you gotten loving this foundation
and it's really really funny because
normally I would not like a foundation
like this but it's the way that it fits
on my skin that is what I'm finding so
attractive and alluring about it is the
way that it sits on my skin and I don't
know maybe I'm getting more into those
natural looking foundations I'm more of
like a full coverage Penn girl like
literally just like give me like ten
pumps of that Kat Von D foundation k but
I really love the way that this sits and
on the skins you can still see my
breakouts you can still see my acne
marks everything but it's pretty and it
holds up like just throughout the day
yes I do need to touch up in my t-zone
but on my cheek areas nothing gets cakey
nothing looks crazy it's just beautiful
right like that so that is the
foundation on my skin I think I touched
on everything that I wanted to touch on
hold on let me kind of take it down my
neck a little bit because it does have
that strong yellow undertone and one
thing I will do is later when I am doing
the rest of my makeup I will go in with
a like a setting powder with silica in
it so that it will kind of give it even
lighter cast on my face I guess that's
my only complaint is that this
definitely pulls a strong yellow
undertown I am somebody who has a very
very strong cool undertone in my skin so
I personally feel like this kind of just
looks wrong but once I put all my makeup
on it doesn't look as obvious as it
probably looks right now and I just love
the way it maintains like I love the
finish on the skin it's really gorgeous
so anyway this is the Laura Geller beta
liquid radiance foundation please let me
know down below if you like this little
series if you hate it umm and then that
way I will know if you guys would like
me to do one on the smashbox one as well
but yeah they still have all the shades
available as of right now and they are
$20 apiece as of right now it is
Wednesday March 23rd so if you are into
this I would definitely check it out
it's a very very light weight don't be
fooled by the name of
product it is not full coverage and I
don't feel like it's a matte finish
whatsoever it definitely is a dewy glowy
lightweight foundation that sits
beautifully on the skin so I hope you
guys enjoyed this little video thank you
so much for joining me and I'll see you
guys later for the tarte reviews bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
