back to my channel I want to say really
quickly if my hair looks a little damp
it's because it still is I put it in
braids overnight and it still is wet
because I'm up so early but anyway I am
here to give you guys another little
demo slash to review slash it's on sale
is it worth it video because I've had
such a wonderful response from you guys
yesterday thank you to everybody who
responded in the comment section after I
asked you guys if you liked these videos
if you would like to see more and a lot
of you just said yes and that you were
very very interested so thank you so
much for the positive feedback I'm so
happy to hear that in today's video I am
reviewing and demoing the smashbox
camera-ready BB water bot spectrum SPF
30 this is kind of like a BB water
foundation basically this is what it
looks like and this product is normally
$42 it is on sale right now for $25 on
at the altar comp website I am obsessed
with this I am in using this for about 5
days now you guys this is a beautiful
beautiful products if you are a big fan
or if you are trying to get into the
whole like water foundation trend like
the one from Tarte just released me of
the becca one we have the Stila aqua
glow it's a very very popular right now
to have like serum foundations or water
based foundations this product is so
similar except it gives a little bit
less coverage because technically it is
a BB water cream so it's kind of like a
beauty balm you do get SPF 30 in here
which is amazing and like I said this is
currently $25 on the auto comm website
so they have let's see one two three
four five six seven eight shades ranging
from really really like the shade that I
picked up is the lightest one which is
called fair which is a really nice match
for my skin personally it has a little
bit of a pink undertone but it is quite
good and it ranges all the way down to a
very very dark color that's called
actual dark right now you can also get a
free gift with purchase so I feel like
this particular product is facing out of
Ulta but I want to say if you are really
interested in trying out the new kind of
like water foundation trend and you
don't want to buy like the seal I will
go for $45 or any of the other ones like
the back of one or something like that
that are normally around 40 to 50
dollars I would highly recommend trying
this out scene if you like the
formulation because $25 is pretty damn
good so anyway I am just going to kind
of read a little bit about what it says
right here oh and the free gift with
purchase is a to-go size photo op
eyeshadow trio with photo finish lid
primer and hydrating under eye primer so
yeah you're basically getting a little
eyeshadow trio you're getting the under
eye primer which is really really nice
I've tried that and then you're also
getting the photo finish lid primer and
what that says with any $35 smashbox
purchase and this is a $25 product so i
don't really know but maybe you'll be
able to get it because it does say it's
free gift with purchase so who knows but
anyway let me read a little bit about
what it says on here so it says what is
it your skin needs a drink meet the
first and only BB with a water like
texture that delivers multiple benefits
in just one drop why get wet built-in
water technology means a liquid silk
consistency it literally glides onto
your face blends easily and moves with
your skin because it's alcohol-free
there is no drying cracking or caking
during wear the ultra hydrating oil free
formula also creates a sheer radiant
finish that makes you really love your
skin in every convince' belite and it
says here comes the complements it says
simply put we have no other BB
foundation with a thin water like veil
what makes it a technical technological
feast is their breakthrough system that
suspends pigments in h2o the big payoff
a BB that hydrates your skin throughout
the day and a demi matte but never flat
complexion and honestly I agree with all
of that I think this really does have
light to kind of buildable medium
coverage it really doesn't get all the
way to medium coverage so if you are
interested in a more medium coverage for
like a BB or like a water foundation I
would recommend this Stila aqua glow
that one feels like you can actually get
to like a medium almost full coverage
with that particular foundation I didn't
find that the back of one build too very
well on my skin also I never turned that
product because it was just too dark and
I know that they have since released a
new with lighter shade which is awesome
and then I would say the Tarte one I did
try a little sample of the Tarte one
that one kind of dries down to like an
interesting sort of finish so like it
dries really really quickly so I think
you can build that one as
but with this particular product it's
really one of those that like literally
I think you're the most coverage you're
going to get is almost medium coverage
so if you are interested in that I think
this is a wonderful wonderful pick for
the summertime
in the heat if you only or combo skin
you're gonna love this because although
it does dry down to a demi matte finish
it's never uncomfortable on the skin
it's like that's I'm all over my baby
blood there and for my Real Techniques
sponge the anyway it just dries down to
a really like Demi that beautiful finish
that feels so water like and liked on
the skin I do not notice when I'm
wearing this foundation I just think
it's wonderful so let's go ahead and I'm
gonna go ahead and just demo it on my
face oh by the way this has a really
strong wear time I was a very very
surprised because usually when you have
a product that's so sheer like that it
starts to kind of dissolve on your face
throughout the day especially for people
like me off combos can I get oily in my
t-zone I do find that I have to reap
outer in my teeth on throughout the day
but that's just something I deal with on
a day-to-day basis since like do you
have combo skin but for the most part
the wear time is very very strong this
will last you all day and I don't feel
like it starts to disintegrate like off
my face it really stays on nicely and I
just I'm really into this I love it so
it's kind of like a lighter version of
the water foundations or serum
foundations that are coming out right
now they all feel very lightweight on
the skin except this one's gonna give
you a little less coverage so anyway
yeah let's just get right into it I'm
going to go ahead by the way I already
pulled my hair back as you can see and I
did cleanse my face completely with the
Garnier micellar cleansing water this is
the sensitive version I took a cotton
pad and rub that all over my face and
what else did I want to say I don't have
any primer on or anything like that I'm
not gonna put any concealer on and
literally just gonna put the foundation
on and then I'm going to set it in with
my essence off same at fixing compact
powder all about that fixing compact
better I wish I could edit my video
sometimes I swear and then I'm gonna be
I'm just stippling that onto my face
with this Tarte err buffer foundation
brush so anyway this is what the actual
packaging looks like let me show you
guys this is a nice glass bottle it is
not plastic this is a beautiful glass
bottle you do get one fluid ounce of
product in here which is the standard
amount for a foundation it has the
little pump here because it will it's
like a dropper so you push that it will
fill the drop her off and then
usually like two pumps but you can just
I'm gonna start with one pump to
actually show you guys what it looks
like because I feel like the pump
actually does dispense a nice amount of
product so there it is very very liquidy
very very liquidy do you see that so
we're just gonna go ahead I'm going to
stamp that on with my Real Techniques
sponge and this is my favorite way to
apply this product you would think
because this is such a lightweight
product it would just like get right
into the sponge and the sponge would
absorb most of it but I actually think
what happens is if I apply this with a
brush the brush absorbs it so I'm not
having an issue with applying this with
a with a damp sponge but you can also
apply this with your fingers because it
does literally glide on like water it's
just lovely
so as you can see I've already used that
one pump so I usually like with this
particular product to do two pumps or
maybe even three depending on what kind
of coverage I want so I'm just gonna do
another pump of that really like that
the little applicator just literally
like the product picks up and deposits
the amount of product that you want
every single time like the little
applicator doesn't get all messed up but
you guys can see immediately this is a
really nice skin tone match for me I
mean it's a little on the pink side but
for the most part it's just giving me a
really nice appearance to the skin a
very even out complexion nothing crazy
nothing like super heavy-duty covers or
anything like that I do find that the
layers will build but not as nicely as
like the Stila aqua Cola foundation now
they seal aqua Cola foundation is like a
serum or water foundation this is
supposed to be like a BB cream but I'm
gonna see myself wearing this to the
beach I can see myself wearing this to
the pool you know what I mean just a
really lightweight little wash of color
it's like it was the best thing ever I'm
like how is this product on sale is it
because they're discontinuing it or are
they coming up with something new I
don't even know but I think this is
beautiful so there is two pumps all over
my face and I just want to say I'm in
the middle of my cycle right now so I'm
dealing with some nasty little breakouts
and things like that but I still feel
like this just gives a beautiful dusting
of color all over my face and I don't
think I look too horrible and this is
two pumps and it's not too oily it's
staying kind of like a Demi matte finish
and it just I literally feel like I'm
nothing on my face right now absolutely
nothing and I love that there is
broad-spectrum SPF 30 in here so I'm
gonna go in for a third time because you
know me I like to keep that face alright
so I'm going in with a third pump and
I'm just going to keep applying that on
some of my problem areas like I said you
really can blend this in with your
fingers as well I think you actually get
the most coverage with your fingers but
I just really prefer a EDM sponge
specifically my Real Techniques sponge I
have sense thrown away my Beauty Blender
these are more chatty videos so I guess
I can go into this little this little
rants but yes I have thrown away my
Beauty Blender I'm done with it I am NOT
purchasing another Beauty Blender I'm
over it
I hate it it stains too easily it's too
expensive if you are wondering which one
is better the Real Techniques sponge is
better alright guys so here is three
pumps and I feel like I have completely
evened out my skin obviously it's not
covering stuff like this over here but I
don't mind because the finish is
stunning I mean it literally just looks
like skin he looks like my skin I love
the way this looks I really really love
the way this looks I did the video
yesterday it's on sale is it worth it
with the laura geller
thanks to radiance foundation and that
one also looks very skin life but if you
have to choose between the two I know my
friend Haley texted me and she was like
which one should I get I would say this
one it has lighter coverage than the
Laura Keller one however it is it's
stunning
it is stunning on the skin and I mean
it's so funny that like Smashbox kind of
I mean a lot of people or a lot of
different brands have done the whole
like water BB concept matte water BB
concept but the water foundation or
serum foundation concept but I think
it's awesome that they did like a water
BB concept and I think this came out a
while ago and that's the reason it's on
sale because nobody really like I don't
know I don't know if it's because nobody
bought it or if it's just because people
weren't interested in the product or
sales weren't good but I think this is
stunning absolutely stunning
so hold on alright now I'm going to go
in and I'm just going to set this this
is what it looks like currently on my
face as you guys can see just a really
soft kind of Demi
semi-matte some units Debbie Matt sort
of finished it just feels like nothing I
don't feel like I have anything on my
face right now this is going to be such
a go to product from either summer I can
already feel it all right so like I said
I'm going to set it in with my essence
all about matte powder and I'm just
dusting into there and then I'm just
going to stipple this on to my face and
this is going to take a little bit of
that Demi matte appearance away it's
going to make it completely matte but
this is how I am going to keep this
foundation on my face all day because if
I don't set it in I feel like the wear
time is not as strong I really start to
feel like it kind of just sinks into my
skin and that's start to look to kind of
disintegrate but if you have dry skin I
don't think that's gonna happen I think
my oil is just kind of out of it like
eats up the foundation something so
gross but if you have oiler Thomas good
you know what I mean like those oils are
bad they completely will just eat away
your foundation so anyway I just say
like this so beautiful and natural and
I'm looking in the mirror right now and
I'm like it literally just looks like my
skin but better it's like the perfect BB
cream with sunscreen in it it matches my
skin it's beautiful it stays on all day
and it is ultra ultra lightweight so I
think it's beautiful so there it is
after I have applied the powder
beautiful shade match love the way it
just evens out my complexion
now I did just recently do a video on
the new one and done hybrid gel not
hydrogel hi Rena fountain what is it
called they wanted done from Urban Decay
you know that like a miracle complexion
Perfector I prefer this I prefer this
any day I think it gives the same sort
of appearance on the skin however I
think this one is more skin like so if
you were curious I feel like this
Smashbox BB water BB is a lot more skin
like I feel like the same power is about
the same on the two of them and the
coverage is about the same I don't know
I just preferred this one I prefer this
one I really really like the urban decay
Vaughn a lot of people were asking about
that one for the summertime but this one
like I said $25 beautiful on the skin
and the shade range is better the urban
decay one-and-done there's only like one
like light shade that's called light and
it's a
telling yellow or a little like pinky on
my skin was a pink ear yellow I think
it's yellow but anyway this is a perfect
shade match loving this I hope you guys
enjoyed at this little it's on sale is
it worth it I will say it is worth it
and I want to touch on something one of
my subscribers yesterday said in
yesterday's video my friend Tara hi Tara

know if you would purchase it if it was
still like not on sale because that's a
good point if someone is watching this
video and they just want to review on

water foundation love it i hope you guys
