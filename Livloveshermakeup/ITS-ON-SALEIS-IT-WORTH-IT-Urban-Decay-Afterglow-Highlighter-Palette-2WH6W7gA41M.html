today I am throwing it back and going to
one of my old school series this is
called it's on sale is it worth it and
this is where I talk about a product
that is currently on sale at Sephora or
Ulta or some sort of beauty related
website and I let you know if it is
worth the sale price and if it is worth
the full price now I'm gonna go ahead
and walk you guys through this I'm going
to insert some swatches and also I will
be doing a live demo towards the end of
this video but today we are talking
about the Urban Decay ons afterglow
highlighter palette this is currently on
sale for $19 on the ulta.com website as
well as the sephora.com website i
believe i might be out of stock on
Sephora but at Ulta you can pick this
one up as well as the sister palette
which seems to have these same exact
ingredients list and that one has a
little more lighter colors to it if this
particular palette has more a bronzy
kind of tones to it so if you do have
more of like a medium to deeper
complexion I'd probably go with this one
if you're very fair complected I would
go with the original one which is also
on sale for $19 like I said this is
normally 834 dollar palette so $19 for
four different highlighters is a pretty
good steal the claims on this
highlighter palette to include that
these have an eight-hour wear time
creamy texture and sheer to full build
buildable and blendable coverage which
is kind of interesting what you're
talking about highlighters now the
shades that you do receive in this
palette are OH&amp;amp;S which is a soft rose
gold also cliche which is a pale nude
shimmer a wicked which is a light pink
shimmer and no angel which is a pale
gold shimmer now I'm gonna do a close-up
here so you guys can see what the
packaging looks like please keep in mind
that this does have very iridescent
packaging so I'm sorry if it looks a
little blinding but you can see you get
a little mirror in here and then there
you have your four different
highlighting shades now the packaging
overall is not in my opinion 34 dollars
worth of packaging it feels a really
kind of cheap and cardboard but I do
like that there is a mirror in there I
mean that's a step up you know this
could be like the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills glow kids where there is no mirror
so I do appreciate them we get a mirror
in there now I am pretty familiar with
the 8 hour powder glow highlighter
formula from Urban Decay I do have a
three full sizes from them I have Ora
which is a light pink Emma this is what
it looks like I also do own in the shade
of sin which is kind of like a champagne
color and I also do own a fireball which
is probably my favorite this is a blush
topper if you do have very for a
complexion
but for me currently this is more of a
highlight it is a peachy color with a
violent iridescent or shift to I do it
like this highlighter formula but it's
not my all-time favorite these are a
true powder formula which normally you
guys know lately I have been routine for
a big Chalet highlighters I love baked
chalet highlighters because they go on
incredibly blinding they be very smooth
at texture and they sit on the skin
beautifully when you have a powder
highlighter and especially if you have
more mature or dry skin like I do it can
be a little more difficult to really
kind of buff this product into your skin
but I have to say the formula going on
in the afterglow highlighter palette
feels a little more smooth than these
guys right here sometimes I feel like
these are a little on the chunky side
and don't get me wrong I do still feel
like the one in the highlighter palette
or the formula in the highlighter
palette on all four pans it's still a
little bit on the chunky side but I feel
like as long as I have the right sort of
brush I can really get them onto the
skin and they look natural and they look
beautiful and they don't emphasize a
 ton of texture now as far as color
selection is concerned like I said they
do have two different versions of this
palette that you can pick up at $19 each
right now so if you do want a little
more lighter shades I would go with the
original give me I would note the
original afterglow palette and if you
want something a little more bronze II
and if you do have a medium to deep
complexion
I would definitely recommend going with
the OH&amp;amp;S I really am happy with these so
far I will say the wear time on these
highlighters is probably one of my
favorite things about them they do have
that more powdery texture but they cling
to the skin in a way that is going to
make them obviously last all day long
and they do have this almost sticky
texture to them and I know that sounds
really weird these are true powder
products they have no cream in them
whatsoever but they have a little bit of
adherence and they really kind of stick
to the skin all day and these are
probably some of the most long wearing
highlighters in my collection now as far
as the formula being compared to the
original highlighters it's very very
close I highly doubt you're gonna be
able to tell a difference so if you do
love the original powder highlighters I
think you would absolutely love this
palette so yes I'm gonna go ahead and
say that this is definitely worth with
the 19 $1 a sale price like I said as
long as you apply these the right way
they really do look beautiful on the
skin and I
like they would work for mature skin
normal skin a dry skin oily skin
whatever you have these really do hang
in there all day and the color selection
is very pretty so let me insert a photo
here of swatches for you guys as you can
see I feel like ons as well as no angel
are the two shades that really stick out
to me the most at the top we have ons
which is a beautiful beautiful kind of
coppery bronzy color the next one is
cliche which is more of a champagne
color and then you have a wicked and
wicked kind of goes onto the skin a
little more sheer and it has that very
beautiful pink iridescent to it but at
the same time there's just something a
little slacking or lack in there I don't
know what it is I love a pink highlight
but this one is kind of missing it for
me and then we do have no angel and no
angel is beautiful it reminds me a lot
of the original sin shade so next up I'm
going to show you a swatch of sin next
you know angel as you guys can see these
are pretty damn a similar so if you are
a fan of the sin highlighter or if
you've always wanted you to try this in
highlighter this is definitely something
that will give you that same sort of
vibe on the skin I highly doubt that you
will be able to notice the difference up
next let's go ahead and show a little
picture here of a wicked swatch tan x/2
aura now as you can see aura has a white
base to it so if you are looking for a
light pink kind of creamy highlight like
that and you want something that's gonna
work for a fair complexion I would
definitely recommend looking into the
original afterglow palette they have a
lighter pink shade in there
this shade right here which is called a
wicked I just feel like it doesn't have
that white base to it and you can see
the difference between the two of them
and then as far as cliche is concerned I
feel like cliche is just kind of
standing on its own it's not very
similar to sin it's not very similar to
any of the others that I have so I don't
have anything just watch that one next
to you but overall you guys these go on
beautifully they don't have any glitter
and then they look really nice on the
skin and yes I would highly recommend
them for $19 and even at $34 I still
think this is a pretty good deal so now
let's go ahead I'm gonna zoom you guys
in and we will do a little bit of a live
demo my favorite brushes when it comes
into this highlighting palette are
definitely this guy right here from
Tarte like I was saying earlier I feel
like I need something a little more
densely packed when it comes to my dry
skin because I need to be able to really
buff this in so I will go ahead and lay
the product down especially considering
this isn't a base shalay product it
doesn't have that instant pigment
station level to it and when I was
reading the claims for you guys on this
highlighter palette you might have
noticed they said you can do sheer to
build a bull kind of coverage and I do
like that about this palette so I will
go in with a very very densely packed
brush this is perma one of the Tarte
holiday 2017 collections the treasured
tools a brush set you can find anything
like this it's actually technically an
under-eye concealer brush but it fits
really nicely onto the cheekbones and I
will go ahead and pick up at the product
and then I will apply it to my cheekbone
and I like the way that a deposit it's
the color and then I go in with a
fluffier brush so today I'm gonna be
using at the shade a cliche because this
is actually one of my favorite shades in
here I don't feel like it goes on full
pigment as much as I don't know the
other two shades in here like ons or
angel or no angel but basically I just
like to put it right onto my cheekbone
and then I am one of those people that
does like to take it all the way down to
the apples of my cheek and sometimes I
do a little bit of padding emotion just
so I can really kind of pack that on
there and then I like to go in with a
little more of a fluffy or a brush to
actually buff it out into the skin to
make sure that it's not catching in
certain areas so this is the Alexi 5:22
tapered highlighter brush I'm sorry if
this is incredibly self-explanatory but
I always get asked if people people
always ask me if I will include demos in
these kind of videos so I just kind of
go in circular motions like this and
that is kind of what it looks like with
one layer on now you have the option of
course at building up if you would like
to but again I'm gonna take cliche and
I'm going to go ahead and put that on to
this side of my face and I'm just kind
of tapping it on and again I like to
take it all the way down to the apples
of my cheeks this will cause a little
more texture to be shown so if you're
not into that don't do this but that's
just what I like to do now when it comes
to the bridge of my nose as well as my
chin if I'm going to highlight those
areas I like to go in with no angel and
actually just go directly in with the
Luxy brush you can see how much product
actually kicks up when I do that so I
very lightly just go down at the bridge
of my nose I will take it up between my
eyebrows sometimes right here as well
and then a little bit on my chin now I
I'm not going to be wearing too much
highlight today so I just wanted to show
you what it looks like with one layer
but yeah that's pretty much how I apply
at this particular product like I said
when I put it on my cheekbones I really
make sure that it's blended in properly
you can continue to go ahead and layer
this product but this is what it looks
like with one layer so anyway guys that
is it I definitely think this is worth
checking out if you are interested in
the afterglow highlighter formula eight
hour highlighter formula from Urban
Decay definitely a nice little palette
to have in your collection and I would
recommend so I will see you guys
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
