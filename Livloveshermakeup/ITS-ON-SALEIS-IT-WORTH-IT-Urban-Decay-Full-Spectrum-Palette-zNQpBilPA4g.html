my channel today's video is going to be
a it's on sale is it worth it video so I
have not done one of these in probably
over six months on my channel if you
don't know what they are this is
basically where I give a quick little
review hopefully it's thorough enough
for you guys and ice watch my favorite
shades out of the item that I'm talking
about so I will also go ahead and swatch
this entire palette on my Instagram I
will leave links down below if you would
like to check it out I will be doing one
swipe swatches with my fingers and there
will be no primer on my arm no matter if
you're you know signed up for Instagram
or not I have a public profile so you
can click on those photos but yeah this
is where I try and give you guys a you
know review under about ten minutes and
I let you know if it's worth it
purchasing the item for sales so anyway
this is the Urban Decay full spectrum at
palette oh by the way like I said I do
have a whole entire playlist dedicated
to the subject matter I'll link it down
below can't promise that all of those
items are obviously still on sale but
this one is so the Urban Decay full
spectrum palette does have 18 different
eyeshadows in it this is made in China
if you are curious it's kind of one of
those holiday releases this year and it
would not sale pretty darn quickly it's
been on sale on the sephora.com website
for probably about two and a half weeks
normally it is 55 dollars it is
currently retailing for thirty-nine
which i think is pretty darn good for 21
I shadow so here is what the outer
packaging looks like I really like this
little jeweled effect right here it is
kind of hard to open unless you have
like nails I don't have nails because
I'm a flutist and I can't deal with
nails but oh yeah it is kind of hard to
open just want to put that out there you
do get a huge mirror here and here are
all 21 of your eyeshadows so you are
getting a large amount of finishes in
here some of them are a little more
foiled which is kind of a newer
formulation for urban decay some of them
do have a matte finish and then you have
that signature kind of urban decay
chunky glitter shades so anyway I think
that this palette is definitely worth it
for the $39 you guys um if you want to
play with color either in a muted way or
really really wham bam in your face kind
of way I think this is a great palette
to have so the shades that I do have on
my eyes today are the shade gossip which
is this pink color here and then also
this one which is called metamorphosis I
have that on my lower lash line I like
the way that this eye look turned
I did not foil these shades if you guys
don't know what oiling is that is
basically where you pick up the color on
your brush then you spray it down with
water setting spray whatever you want to
and basically it just gives a little
more vibrancy to the actual shadow that
you're going to put on so today I didn't
do that I just took it straight out of
the pan I put it on my eyes I feel like
it looks very very nice and muted if you
do want these colors to be exactly like
what they look like in the pan you can
go ahead and foil them and it's
beautiful so I do think that this is a
fun palette to have if you do want to
play with muted colors or if you really
want them to be Rambam in your face this
reminds me a lot to Abby Kat Von D mi
vida loca palette that came out last
year during the holiday season I
personally never purchased that one and
I'm still kicking myself for not
purchasing it now I will say from the
swatches I've seen and the tutorials
I've seen with that palette it looks
like it has a little more pigmentation a
little more blend ability these are not
necessarily hard to blend it's just I
feel like these are great for like the
lower lash line and like lid colors I
wouldn't necessarily take a ton of these
colors into my crease but again if you
want to spend 10 minutes blending out
your eyeshadow you do you boo so anyway
on the way that they put this together
was actually they wanted trios of ombre
colors so here you have your pinks you
have your oranges you have your yellows
your greens your blues your purples and
then your smoky colors I like the way
that they did that because sometimes
when you get a palette like this you
take one look at it and you're like what
do i do where do I even begin you know
what I mean so I do like that they put
that in little trios I think it's nice
18 of these shades are brand new to this
palette it is a limited edition palette
so if you do want it right now on sale
you should get it because it will be
going out of stock soon and then three
of the shades I don't know which ones
they are but three of them have been
seen before in actual palette so I do
think this is worth it for the $39 what
I purchased this for $55 I'm not quite
sure I even love Urban Decay palettes or
I hate them there is no in-between for
me I hated the naked palettes I didn't
like all the vice palettes but I love
the Urban Decay basics palettes I loved
the electric palette which is out so
currently on sale for about $25
I still do prefer the electric palette
over this one but you do get more
product in here and you are getting more
shades in here so it's all about what
feels right to you if you want really
really high impact like colorful shadows
I would go with the electric palette if
you want something a little more muted
you can go with this
so I like the versatility of this I
think most of them were a really nice
amount of
on the eyes like I said you should
probably bind some of these in with like
a glitter glue especially they do have a
glittery finish but overall I do think
it's worth it you are also getting a
double-ended brush that it's actually
really darn good here is the full
spectrum brush and you are getting a
blending brush on this side and it's a
very very densely packed it's actually
nice for working into the crease if you
do want to put any of these colors in
the crease and then this little smudger
brush right here is nice for just
packing on the lower lash line one of
the things that I do like about this
palette is that they did include a solid
matte white shade and it's like a cool
toned white is absolutely beautiful
underneath the brow bone and it's nice
for just like overall blending if you do
want to blend some of these shades out
but yeah I would say for $39 this is
worth checking out especially if you
don't have a lot of colorful palettes in
your collection so now let me go ahead
and swatch some of these shades for you
guys so the first one I want to swatch
that I really enjoy is the shape called
gold mine now this one does have a
little more of a chunky finish to it but
I swear to you it goes on the eye really
really beautifully especially if you
want to put it on your lid or if you
want to work it on your lower lash line
so there is the shade of gold mine it
has a really really nice yellowy base to
it I also really like the shade warning
this one is like a nice coppery shade
again this is like a little more neutral
you know this you could actually work
into your crease and it would look
pretty so here is the shade warning I
just love this foiled finish I think
this is beautiful I've never seen a van
de que do something like this I have
heard that they're new after dark
palette or all-nighter palette or
whatever I have heard that that is
filled with just like foiled shades I
may have to go ahead and pick that up
because I'm really enjoying this kind of
foil finish they're doing the shade
right here which is called minks it's
also really nice this is a true midnight
blue with a little bit of like a sheen
to it
absolutely stunning goes on very very
beautifully so there are those three
swatched and then the last one that I
want to show you guys that is a favorite
is paranoia I really love this it's like
a lilac II purple color and I just think
it goes on beautifully it kinda reminds
me of asphyxia from the what was it the
urban decay I can't remember what
palette but if the shade is Vixia so
anyway those are all the colors are kind
of like my top favorites I think they're
absolutely beautiful like I said down
below I will go ahead and I will swatch
all of them on my Instagram but yeah I
would say the foil finishes
we are like the top bitch kind of shades
for me I do like the matte finishes I
feel like the mattes are very silky and
I do feel like overall Urban Decay does
a nice job with mattes but there are a
few shades in here they're a little more
chunky a little more glittery I will
swatch like midnight blaze for you guys
you can see they just go on and they're
slightly patchy as you can see you do
kind of have to build up the color and I
would recommend wearing a glitter glue
with these but yeah for $39 guys and
definitely go ahead and scoop it up if
you want it so I hope you enjoyed this
quick little review on the Urban Decay
um what is this full spectrum palette
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you guys tomorrow for look of
the week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
