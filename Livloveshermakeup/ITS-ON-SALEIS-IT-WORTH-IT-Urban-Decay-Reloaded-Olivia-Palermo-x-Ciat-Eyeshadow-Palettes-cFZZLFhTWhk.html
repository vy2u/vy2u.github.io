you so much for joining me today's video
is going to be a it's on sale is it
worth it we're gonna be talking about
two different eyes shadow palettes and
how I like to do these videos is give
you guys just a quick little rundown a
quick little review I guess you could
say of the two palettes and then I like
to tell you the price point I'll give
you a few swatches and I'll let you know
if they are worth it when they are on
sale so anyway the two palettes that
we'll be talking about today are the
Urban Decay vice Ltd reloaded palette
and also the CIA Olivia Palermo the
smoldering eye shadow palette the Urban
Decay reloaded palette is currently on
sale for $34 at Ulta and the ciate is
currently on sale for $19.50 on the
sephora.com website so let's go ahead
and start with the Urban Decay reloaded
palette this is normally a $56 palette I
purchased it at full price this is on
the Ulta calm website and currently it
is $34 you are getting 20 shades in here
this particular palette is made in China
and each pan size is 0.8 grams I would
say you're getting about three to four
mattes in here five to six glitter
shades and the rest of them are like a
satiny texture and the overall packaging
is really really nice
so this is what it looks like you can
see they have these little gems here
that say Urban Decay you push this
button and you have a huge mirror that
pops out and you are getting twenty
eyeshadows like I said so I won't say
that this is not worth it but I'm gonna
tell you guys why it's not worth it for
me and why I personally if I ran out of
this I would still not purchase it even
if it was on sale so um although you are
getting twenty eyeshadows in here and
usually Urban Decay palettes are fifty
to sixty dollars I would say that for me
personally the reason why this is not
worth it when it is on sale or even just
at full price is because I find it's
very very hard to put an eye look
together with this the actual layout or
the color scheme is very very unusual
you're just getting some random pops of
colors thrown in all over the place and
when I first purchase this I really
really liked it but I noticed that every
single time I use this I feel like I
have to pull in another eyeshadow
palette although there are three
different transition shades in here or
at least to transition shades laced and
you also have these shades suspend and
you do have a nice
bone color called anonymous that are
completely matte I find that the actual
layout in here is just strange I
actually have to spend a few minutes
looking at this and figuring out where I
want to put the actual colors so
although it is a really nice palette as
far as like colors and pigmentation are
concerned I do think it does take a
little longer to actually put together
an eye look but some of my favorite
colors in here are definitely gold mine
asphyxia I really like hot pants and
also acid rain here are a few shades for
you guys if you are unfamiliar with the
Urban Decay formulation some of these
are a little chunkier and filled with
glitter and then some of them are more
of a satiny consistency these ones are
definitely a little more satiny you can
see the masses you have a little bit of
fallout and also they aren't extremely
extremely pigmented but I would say the
best shades in here are definitely those
satin and textures so I would say this
is not worth it if you are someone who
really doesn't like to spend a ton of
time on your makeup like I am like I do
I am if you're someone who doesn't like
to spend a ton of time
I'm your makeup in the morning like I do
then I would say um you know yeah this
is probably not something that you want
to pick up although it is a good value
at $34 even at $56 it's a pretty good
value because you are getting large pan
sizes in here just know if you do pick
it up you are going to have to go ahead
and pull in another eyeshadow palette I
wanted to show you guys it next to my
vice 4 palette which I'm obsessed with I
love this vice 4 palette from Urban
Decay this is one that I will be keeping
and I'm not going to declutter you can
kind of see there's like a color scheme
going on here you have a whole row of
shades that are filled with matte
transition shades and then you have
these nice jewel tone colors but they
all kind of go together nicely whereas
the Urban Decay reloaded I feel like
there's just random colors popping all
over the place so here is the advice for
it's got a little more of a seamless
layout and then here is the Urban Decay
reloaded so yeah I'm going to keep this
one and this one I'm probably going to
declutter I may pull out and do pot a
few of the shades in here but overall I
would say even though it's on sale it is
not worth it alright moving on to the
Olivia Palermo ex-cia or Olivia Palermo
ciate palette this is what it looks like
this is normally $39 I did purchase mine
last year during the fall at full price
and now it is $19.50
so you are getting nine different shades
in here one of them is the glitter
afford them are matte and the rest are
shimmer shades the actual packaging is
really nice it is slightly flimsy I
would definitely say the Urban Decay
packaging is really nice and sturdy this
one is not so much I feel like it could
just like break but anyway what I do
like about it is the fact that it's
super super small and slender it's
definitely what I would consider a purse
palette or a pocket palette you open it
up you do have a nice sized mirror here
and then the pan sizes are quite large
so this is what it looks like on the
inside like I said you are getting four
different matte shades here and one of
my favorite ones is the one right in the
middle it's that beautiful creamy color
this is gorgeous
all over the lid it's just absolutely
stunning I really like the formulation
on the mattes in this particular palette
but I will say every single eyeshadow in
here is very very consistent my biggest
problem with this particular eyeshadow
palette is that I find that the colors
start to get a little muddled together
on my eyes because as you can see
there's a lot of muted colors in here
you're not getting pops of color you're
getting more muted tones so even though
these are kind of like warmer and these
are kind of cooler they're not super
super in-your-face like here is that
blue shade it's not super super
in-your-face here is that burgundy shade
again not super super in-your-face
they're a little more muted so I do find
that they can get muddled together
quickly but the overall formulation on
these is very soft very smooth I'm not
gonna say they're buttery because
they're not buttery they're a lot softer
than the urban decay shadows but they're
not super super soft and they're not
buttery I mean they are super soft
they're just not buttery that's what I'm
trying to say but they do blend out very
very easily let me show you guys they
blend out very very easily on the eyes I
really do like the actual consistency of
them and I feel like they're just really
really stunning so you can see the one
right there that has a little bit of
Sheen isn't that pretty and then this
one down here has a slight amount of
Sheen so I would say overall if you are
into these kind of colors these sort of
fall pretty colors then yeah absolutely
you should pick this out for $19.50
I would pick another one of these up for
$39 to be completely honest and yeah I
think that this one is definitely worth
it so I would say the Urban Decay Advice
reloaded no I would not pick this up but
I would pick up this Olivia Palermo
IATI London the smoldering pallet let me
show you guys another swatch here look
at that slate gray color this is a matte
and I feel like the mattes are pretty
darn good as well they really blend out
easily on the actual skin so there it is
completely blended out and then there
are some of the shimmer shades again so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me let me know
down below if there are products that
you would like me to do quick little
snappy reviews on or let you know if
they are on sale if they are actually
worth it um let me know down below and I
