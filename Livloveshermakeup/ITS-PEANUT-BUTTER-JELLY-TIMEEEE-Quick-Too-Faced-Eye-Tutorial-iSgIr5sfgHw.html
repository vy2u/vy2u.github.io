today's video is going to be a Aitu
toriel which is something I normally
don't do on my channel but I have been
promising you guys a tutorial on the
toothpaste peanut butter and jelly
palette for quite some time now I was
gonna say for white for quite some time
for quite some time now so I thought I
would go ahead and show you guys how I
created this eye look today and yeah
let's just go ahead and get started I
will be posting look of the week
tomorrow so you guys are going to be
getting a tutorial and then it get ready
with me tomorrow I hope you guys don't
mind but yeah let's go ahead and get
started so the first thing that you need
obviously is the little tooth it being a
better day
alright so the first thing I am going to
do is take my Real Techniques setting
brush and I am taking the shade extra
creamy which is right here and I will be
putting that all over my lid and also
underneath my eye I'm bringing it all
the way up to my brow and I really like
using the setting brush for doing this
because I feel like it really covers a
lot of surface area and it also helps so
that when you start piling your shadows
on top of each other they really really
blend out easily and nicely alright next
we are going to go in with the shades
spread the love which is this one right
here and I am taking this BH Cosmetics
fluffy crease brush brush brush yes girl
yes it is early guys so please excuse me
excuse me
alright so I'm just seeking to spread
the love and I am just working that into
my crease this is going to be my
transition shade it does have a little
bit of glitter in it but it still works
as a transition so I like it I like it
alright next I am going to go in with
this pur cosmetics this is just a little
flat shader brush and I'm going in with
the shade of bananas and this is going
to be kind of like our base lid color
I'm going to Pat that on there and tap
off the excess and just put this on
lightly onto the eyelid and I'm not
trying to build it up too much if you
really just want that particular shade
on the lid you can go ahead and foil it
but we will be putting gel
on top of it later on so alright moving
on the next thing we are going to do is
take the Sigma tapered blending e35
brush and I'm going into the shade and
that's about you which is a beautiful
matte kind of reddish rusty ish orange
color I guess you could say tapping off
the excess and I'm putting this right
into my crease and it's okay if it kind
of goes down onto the lid as well
everything's going to blend out at the
end but I really enjoy the shade a lot
and if you do have blue eyes I really
think it makes your eyes pop alright so
just going back and forth back and forth
next I am going to be taking in at this
little brush right here this is the
Sonia Kashuk and number 116 brush and
I'm going into the shade peanut butter
cup which is this one right here and I'm
going to tap into that tap off the
excess and then I'm going to dot this
right onto my outer V so we can get a
little bit of dimension going add some
and deeper coloring and you give it a
little bit of fallout with these I
totally forgot to bring a big fluffy
brush so that I could pick up my little
makeup crumbs but there definitely is a
little bit of fallout so that's just
something to be aware of with this
particular palette all right after I
have done that I'm going to be going in
with my morphe let's see here Emma 511
brush and I'm just going to blend
everything in back and forth and doing
circular motions as well
I like this morphe brush because it is
very dense and it's actually kind of big
as you guys can see I feel like it
blends your eyeshadow out really really
quickly and you guys know I like that a
lot I don't like to spend too much time
blending alright next we are going to go
in with the morphe m200 brush and i'm
going to be taking the shade of peanut
butter which is right there and i am
just going to tap into that tap off the
excess and we are going to be working
this on the upper crease and we're just
going really really softly very close to
the actual brow but we're not going to
go too high so we're just going back and
forth kind of helping with some blending
and also it's giving a little bit more
warmth up there which I really really
like yeah sorry it's very early guys
when I'm filming this so I'm kind of
like right anyway even get a lot of
sleep last night which was too bad but
that's ok I'm going out of town this
weekend so I'm just kind of working that
above the crease like I said and then
with the same brush I'm going to go into
the extra creamy shade again and we're
going to tap right underneath the brow
just so that we have that lightness
there and then I'm going to go back into
that morphe and 5-11 brush and we're
just going to blend again
and doing circular motions as well
and then I'm going to go in to spread
the love with the same brush and I am
just going to tap into the era and make
sure that this little area right here is
nice and blended out there's no harsh
lines don't get me wrong I think it's
really nice when people put tape there
and it's like a nice you know exact line
but that is not what we are going for
today we are going for fully blended I
look alright next I'm going to go into
the jelly shade and I am just going to
go ahead and put that onto my finger and
I am going to tap this on to my eyelid
and again if you want it a little more
intense you can go ahead and foil it and
then going back in with that morphe m200
brush we are just lightly going in to
spread the love and then dusting over
again just making sure there are no
harsh lines I'm going to go back in with
down working
all right and now we are going to go in
with this little malli dual ended brush
and I am taking this side right here and
I am dipping into jelly and I'm going to
put that on the inner corner of my eye
and also on my lower lash line the first
third of my lower lash line
and then not going into peanut brittle
and I am going to put that on the outer
part of my lower lashline kind of blend
the two together alright and then I am
going in with let's see here these Sigma
I'm the e-40 brush just going right over
on the top to make sure we still don't
have any harsh lines and then underneath
as well just for a little extra blending
alright guys and now we are going to go
ahead and put our eyeliner on I will be
using it these Smashbox
I wish sharp a waterproof cold liner in
the shade Sumatra and I am just going to
put this onto my waterline
well that made my eye water quite a bit
it is very sharp just like it says all
right moving on
we are just going to go ahead and wrap
this up with some mascara I cannot speak
ring all right I will be using at the
L'Oreal miss mondo rock mascara and I am
going to apply a one layer of this onto
my lashes and then before it dries down
I'm going to put another layer on its
going to give you very very kind of
clumpy lashes so if you don't like that
then go ahead and grab you know a
different mascara but I really like that
look and I feel like it makes it look
even more dramatic which I'm really into
I really like that then again I'm just a
spider eyelash kind of girl what kind of
thing alright so like I said I've it is
dry and I'm going back in with another
coat this is what the wand looks like by
the way it's awesome and this time I'm
going on the backs of my lashes as well
just to give a little bit of extra
volume and as you can see they're really
gonna start clumping together so you
want to work quickly when you flip the
brush over and try and comb out as many
of the really big clumps as you can and
then again on the lower as well
that's like the new is that the
Maybelline is called anything it's
called like the clumpy lash the spider
lash I need to try that out you guys let
me just even it out on both sides and
then this is a very wet formula mascara
so if you do get little smudges
underneath your eye or when you blink I
do use like eyelash enhancing products
at nighttime so sometimes if I look up
my eye lashes do touch the actual like
this part right here so I do have some
q-tips but I'm just gonna let that dry
and that is the look you guys that this
is the peanut butter it's at a time this
is my take on some sort of look at nice
little tutorial I really really like
this look I enjoy peanut butter and
that's about you and jelly mixed
together I know a lot of people are
really crazy about that jelly shade when
this first released I actually think it
has the worst pigmentation out of all
the shades but I think those warmer
tones and there are really
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you tomorrow for luck of the week
