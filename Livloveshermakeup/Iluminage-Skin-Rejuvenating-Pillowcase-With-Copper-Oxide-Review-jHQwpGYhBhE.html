going to be doing a weird review today
because I have my pillow with me but
it's not about the pillow it's actually
about this pillow case I'm gonna take it
out of this quickly so you guys can see
this is a pillow case from the brand
iluminage and I found this on Sephora
this was a $60 pillow case and the
claims that it had on the actual website
were kind of ridiculous when I was first
reading them and I thought you know what
I'm gonna pick it up I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna see if I like it if I hate it
I can still do a review and return it it
was just one of those things I don't
hate it
I really like it so let me just talk to
you guys about what it is it is the skin
rejuvenating pillowcase with copper
oxide so it comes in a little container
like this and like I said it was $60 in
the support website I will leave a link
below if you are interested it says it
is clinically proven to change the look
of your skin in just three to four weeks
okay what does that mean it says it
reduces the appearance of fine lines and
wrinkles and improved skins overall
appearance results from for independent
double-blind placebo-controlled studies
so I was like oh it's been in studies
and things like that you know well if I
do hate it I guess I can return it but I
don't hate it
I really like it um it is super super
silky and I have noticed I've been using
this for probably two or three weeks now
I have noticed that um I tend to be one
of those people that really really likes
mush is my face up when I sleep like ice
push it into my pillow
either I'm like on my face sleeping or
I'm like this or it's just it's all over
the place right so I have noticed that
since I've been using this when I wake
up in the morning um I don't have puffy
face like my face is not puffy I don't
have sleep lines sometimes if you sleep
a certain way you can get a little like
false lines that go away during the day
but they just are they're like sleeping
creases that's what I call them and I
don't get any of those with this
pillowcase so I'm like oh that's kind of
interesting I do like not having to wake
up with like a puffy face you know what
I mean so I kind of like that I would
say the only thing that I don't really
notice is like you know I do have some
fine lines under
as I haven't noticed that that has like
completely reduced those but what I do
notice is that it's soft its slippery it
makes my hair also like you know
sometimes if you have like a cotton
pillowcase um and you have just washed
your hair and you go to bed and it's wet
and you wake up and it's super frizzy
I've noticed that when using this
pillowcase my hair has been really nice
and sleek even if it is wet when I go to
sleep so I like it for those reasons
because I think it has like slip to it
it's almost like it's like satin or yeah
like satin so it's really really I like
it for that reason do I think it's worth
sixty dollars
not really but I don't want to return
mine I do like mine it's beneficial for
someone who like sleeps on their face
and also if you want to keep your hair
all smooth and sleek so let me read for
you guys a few things that it says on
the the--sort website it says it is a
copper infused pillowcase to help meit
in skins youthful appearance and
minimize visible sides of aging as you
sleep
it says the scent our newest scent
there's no scent the secret of the skin
rejuvenating pillowcase is the power of
copper ions copper is an essential
mineral known to play an important role
in the healthy function of the skin when
the skin is in contact with the copper
oxide fibers in the pillowcase copper
ions are transferred into the moisture
of the upper epidermal layers to support
skins natural self renewal mccann
mechanism and help reduce the appearance
of fine lines and wrinkles
so those on is that the copper basically
pulls moisture to the top layers of your
skin basically what they're saying the
skin rejuvenating pillowcase is the only
textile beauty product that uses copper
ions for skin rejuvenation it was
developed by kaprun I have no idea it
was developed by copper on for use in
hospitals to treat wounds on diabetic
and burn patients they found the copper
embedded into fabric fibers promoted the
healing of sores ulcers and wounds and
that it provided antibacterial and
antifungal properties which help prevent
infection it says it's clinically proven
to reduce the appearance of fine lines
and wrinkles in as little as four weeks
with a continued effect over time so
interesting I mean it was one of those
things that I saw and I
I can't not pick that up like that just
sounds so weird that I have to pick it
up so um I am seriously happy with this
it's just it's weird but it's working it
makes my skin look better in the morning
I don't have puffiness in the morning I
don't have to worry about running an ice
cube over my face or putting cold water
on it my skin just wakes you know I wake
up and my skin just looks normal so I do
like that because sometimes when I am in
a hurry and I jump out of bed like that
puffiness doesn't go down for like an
hour I'm not kidding
so I'm really really happy with this I
like my little pillowcase it's so cute
so umm I obviously like you know if I
had you know I don't know like tons and
tons of pillows on my bed I wouldn't get
like one for every single pillow case
but this is just for me just for my
pillow case and my boyfriend used it
when he was visiting me this weekend he
actually liked it too so maybe we get
him one but other than that
$60 hmm you know I don't know but I'll
continue to use it again I have not been
using it for the full four weeks so
maybe it will diminish my fine lines and
wrinkles who knows but I will continue
to use it and I do like it I think it
has a nice slip and slip is good when it
comes to skin and hair so that is my
review I hope you guys enjoyed this I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
