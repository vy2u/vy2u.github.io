have a video for you guys tonight that I
think I have put together the words that
I want to say and I'm ready to talk
about it a couple of weeks ago maybe a
month ago I had a pre filmed video that
went live on my channel and in that
video I featured a canvas that said
gypsy soul on it now I want to state
that I was aware that gypsy wasn't a
great word and I know a lot of people
when they apologize they probably
wouldn't say I was aware and I knew it
and I'm being an asshole but yeah a
little bit of being an asshole now I
thought that gypsy here in the US a
gypsy is used very very loosely both of
my parents are immigrants my mom is
Italian and my dad is Swedish and not
even they knew that gypsy this this word
had so much meaning to it and I just
wanted to say right off the bat that it
was me
misunderstanding the information that I
was given and also me actively deciding
that I was still going to use that word
even though I knew it was semi bad I
thought it was slang there was somebody
who had discussed back on a post in my
Instagram when I had showed the canvas
first someone had mentioned it was a
slur and then I had a few people
commenting also saying it was just slang
for me a slang is different than slur
but there there is no excuse for this
and I just wanted to say really quickly
there's some stuff going on behind the
scenes and I know it's taking me a while
to film this video but I don't think
it's fair to just do a half-assed
apology and bite my tongue and say I'm
sorry even if I'm not now I actually
mean it and now I actually am sorry it
is very very difficult when there is a
large group of people that it feels like
they're witch-hunting you but they're
really not I want to go ahead and
express my gratitude to the people on
reddit as well as a few friends of mine
Georgia Harris as well as Angelica who
have
really really opened up my eyes to the
meaning of this word and I know that you
know being a beauty influencer you have
this on-and-off salty relationship with
Reddit but I want you guys over at
reddit to know that I did read
everything that you said I am no longer
following that board because I know I'm
not so much welcome there and I totally
understand but I want you guys to know
that I did do my research and I do
understand now what the word ban is very
very selfish of someone like me who
clearly is white I am privileged to just
for go and ignore other people when they
say that's a slur I strongly strongly
want to stand up for you know being
inclusive and I have very very strong
opinions I'm very very far left very
liberal I am all for everybody living
amongst each other happily but it was
more than selfish for me to not realize
how big of a deal this was at first so I
am NOT going to be taking down at that
video the collection video I want you
guys to be able to go back and see what
I said and it was kind of gross what I
said it was pretty gross and I
want to leave that video up I'm going to
D monetize it so I won't be making any
money off of it but I'm going to leave
it up so that this isn't something that
just goes under the rug you know a lot
of people make mistakes and a lot of
beauty influencers make mistakes and I
like I said was not ready to make this
video in almost you know it almost feels
like self self sabotage but at the end
of the day it's not about me it's not
about me and I think it's really really
important that I took that time so that
I clearly understood that the worry of
not addressing it is eating away at me I
could ignore it I could have my
moderator delete all the comments I
could do all of that but it is at the
end of the day
why don't I just learn from this why
don't I learn from it I know that this
is going to be a lesson that I learned
in a very very public way but I am very
public about a lot of things about my
life and some of you love that and some
of you don't so I am here to say that I
apologize for using the term gypsy soul
I know that you shouldn't even say the
word I just wanted to put it out there
that yes it is a slur even here in the
US so don't be confused by all of these
people naming their dog gypsy and naming
certain eyeshadow palettes or steal the
glitter and glows gypsy or the
television shows that are you know on
cable network just because it's featured
and it's kind of something that feels
mainstream does not necessarily mean it
is there is always deeper meaning to
certain words and I have done my
research when it comes to activism and
what racism and things like that and I
strongly strongly want to push those
borders away especially on my channel I
want to call out brands that are being
inappropriate I want to call out brands
that are not being inclusive and
yeah this this is this is me saying I I
really up guys the canvas has
been taken down to see you guys know I
have a lot of beautiful canvases that my
best friend Rochelle has made for me she
was not aware that gypsy was a slur and
again I know I'm saying it in this video
but I really want to get the message
across because I know it although there
were a lot of you that were very shocked
and just taken it back when I did that
video there were a lot of you that also
were fighting back in the comments
section with people you were standing up
from you saying oh it's not a slur here
in the US that's not that's not how the
world works you know it just can't be oh
it's you know it's okay because it's not
a slur here in the US or it's okay
because you get to do this in the u.s.
it shouldn't be like that I know better
and I want you guys to know better and I
want you guys the people who were
standing up for me I want you to know
that I was wrong and do not stand up for
me especially when this is a situation
that is as serious as it is a lot of
people were saying how can you talk
about tarte cosmetics and then blatantly
ignore this and i don't know what to say
like I said it took me a few days couple
weeks actually to sit down and fully do
with the research but the fact of the
matter is you know you can't just run
around living your life thinking you
know
oh I'm I know that this is racist and I
know this is racist and oh but nothing
else is or I don't care about that other
stuff racism it's horrible racism is
everywhere and it is in many many many
different forms I am going to have some
articles linked down below in the
description box so you guys can go read
up on this if you would like to but if
you don't just take my word for it let's
not say gypsy let's not write gypsy
let's not call our makeup to see let's
not call our baby gypsy our dog I know
that it has a different feeling here not
meaning a different feeling here in the
US but that doesn't mean that the
meaning is any less so that is pretty
much it hmm my voice is great
oh I'm not crying because it's like I'm
crying because I this is hard this is
hard it's really difficult to call
yourself out and I have a big ego guys
I've got a big ego okay I couldn't get
through all these roasting videos and
not give a what brands and other
people think about me if I didn't but
it's very important to step away from
that ego to step away and say you know
Liv there's a difference between someone
saying you talk really really fast which
right now I am trying really my best to
be very very slow so you guys can
understand everything I'm saying
but yeah anyway this is turning too much
into me it's not about me this is a
bigger picture and I apologize for my
place in what has turned into a little
bit of a shitstorm if I gave you the
impression that I don't give a I
apologize I didn't give a at first
that's because I didn't understand and I
didn't want to educate myself I'm all
for education I'm all for going and
researching things so the fact that I
was so close minded to that really
really disgusts me and makes me think
like if that's not such a good trait
live normally I am open to it but um it
was just hard it was just hard I felt
like I was definitely wrong and I wanted
to be right and I wasn't I wasn't right
thank you guys for joining me for this
video and
I don't know what else to say I'm sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
