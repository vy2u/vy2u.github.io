another inside of my collection video
and I am featuring my two-faced
liquefied long-wear lipsticks in here
and also my Stila lip glazes
I have swatches for you guys of the
colors that we show up on this Stila lip
glazes and I'm also going to go ahead
and tell you guys why I'm pretty much
like 99.9% sure that I am going to go
ahead and declutter all of these one of
the reasons why I am doing this little
kind of mini series thing right now with
all these different videos going up on
my channel that are kind of related to
my products what I have what's in my
collection is because I do have my
declutter series coming up in October
and I do like to like pull out the whole
collection so I can kind of play around
with it a little bit before I give my
opinions and completely decide if I want
to keep a product or not so anyway I am
going to tell you guys a little bit
about why I've decided to pretty much go
ahead and just let all of this go I just
don't think it's worth it I'm not I just
don't think that this particular
formulation is that comfortable and the
Stila lip glaze formulation is
definitely not comfortable and and they
sure did not sit well this year I mean I
barely touched these this year and I
just feel like they got so gunky and
gross and the packaging I I just can't
believe that I held on to those last
year's so anyway let me go ahead and
share with you guys the sheets that I
have so in the Too Faced melted
liquefied long-wear lipstick I had the
shade and melted candy which is a really
really in your face kind of bright pinky
almost like I don't even know it's like
a watermelon color there it is swatched
it's super super pretty I also have two
of the melted Chihuahua shades which I
just I do not understand that name but
this is probably the prettiest shade
it's like a your lips but better kind of
nude Mavi color and here it is swatched
I really really really like that I also
have a melted peony and I'm pretty sure
this one has gone bad because I did a
swatch and it's like super super greasy
and like there's no texture there so I'm
guessing that there is something wrong
with this one I'm gonna take a whiff of
it and see if it has gone bad but I'm
probably gonna toss this one the other
ones I will declutter to a friend and
I have the melted metal liquefied
metallic lipstick in Durham house I
would I always want to say dream horse
metallic dream house and this is a
beautiful beautiful color it's like a
lilac purple and I have it right there
swatch it has tons and tons and tons of
glitter it's super super pretty I also
have the melted peeny in the liquefied
or 8d metal version Dennis tongue-tied
you guys in the metal version so it's
just like beanie but it has a little
more Sheen to it and then I also have
melted berry which is a gorgeous
gorgeous shade as well and there is
melted berry swatch all right so I think
overall what's bugging me about these is
just the fact that I never ever reach
for them I'm pretty sure the reason why
that peony shade just kind of went bad
was because I wasn't touching it and
shaking them up and doing anything I
just kind of kept them in my collection
because I think they look really cute I
know that sounds horrible but honestly I
think they look really cute and I think
that's why I kept them so I'm going to
go ahead and let those go I don't find
them extremely comfortable to wear on
the lips they do transfer on to my flute
head joint so we're gonna say bye bye to
those in October all right now on to
these Cielo lip glazes
I only swatch the ones that will
actually show up because half of these
don't show up they're basically just
glazes for the lips I really really just
don't like these I do not like these I
do not know how or why I have so many of
them half of these just don't even show
up on me the shade is called glint it's
like a light a light pink it doesn't
show up this one here too which is a
light pink of this one is called a
glitter this one doesn't show up the
only ones that really show up are like
the metallo sized ones and also the ones
that have like a creamy finish so this
one right here which is called glamour
which is like a pinky red is actually
quite pretty
I have it swatched right there so I do
like that one but again it's just the
formula and look at the little
applicator like too messy - gross -
sticky can't deal with it this shade
right here is called glory and it is
quite pretty as well it's like a grape
jelly sort of shade and then more of the
same I feel like these are all just the
same and I never noticed it they
literally all just swatch the same and I
did swatch two of them just so you guys
could see how similar and I just feel
like I'm just watching and it was
they're just the same exact product
there's no difference they just have
glitter in them or they don't
this one is that apricot II shade this
is glimmer and then they have the
creamier version and this one is called
apricot same exact thing um this one
here is called glow which has a little
bit of a yellow glow to it and then this
one is called glean which has a pink
tone and glitter and then this one right
here is called orchard this is probably
the best out of all of them I may hold
on to this one
let me show you guys the actual swatch
there is orchard isn't that pretty it's
so so so so so pretty I really like the
way that looks again formulation don't
really like don't really like the
applicator and all that kind of stuff I
don't know how I didn't realize this
before but whatever I might hold on to
that one they're famous shade Stila
this like did not show up at all at all
so that's a fail and then we have banana
berry which is kind of pretty it's like
a nudie pinky color I do have it
swatched right they're kind of nice if
you were wearing like a nude lipstick
and you wanted to top it and then we
have hibiscus which again is kind of
similar to Orchard and it is right there
so I really like the ones that are quite
pigmented but the other ones I'm just
really not interested in they feel like
they're the same exact thing and they're
sticky they're tacky I don't like the
applicator I don't like that they get
all over the wand I'm not on the wand
but you know what it needs like it gets
so sticky and it gets crunchy and I hope
you guys know what I did it's just
really really messy even if I wipe it
down so I don't like these I just don't
think I'm in love with these there's no
point in holding on to them so yeah
anyway I just kind of wanted to give you
a little update on those and so that you
guys could see it my little collection
of liquefied lipsticks and also at my
Stila
lip glazes alright guys I will see it my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
