welcome back to a new series on my
channel I shouldn't say welcome back
welcome to a new series on my channel
called inside the collection where we
are taking a look inside of my
collection and instead of me just
showing you guys like my collection in
my drawers and what not I will be going
through certain things that I want to
share with you guys and today i'm
sharing my bite beauty lip products with
you guys so i did already film another
video i did these skillet lip places and
i did you swatches with those and i also
did a video on the prams and I just like
mixed and mingled a bunch of different
brands there but the bite beauty brand I
do have quite a bit of just this brand
so I did want to do just this video on
the brand and I'm going to share with
you guys my thoughts on these products
show you guys what they look like and I
won't be doing any swatches because
there's so much but like I said I did do
swatches in those videos so let's go
ahead and get started is the first four
items that are right here are part of a
holiday kits these are the bite Beauty
matte crème the first one is called
coolie cool eh I can't tell there's a
stamp over the name but anyway it's a
beautiful kind of reddish color I really
really like that and i love the
formulation on these retractable pencils
this one is opportune and is a beautiful
eggplant color very true to name this
one right here is called tort which is a
gorgeous kind of your lips but better
it's got a little more of a cool
undertone than this one as you guys can
see the two of them next to each other
and then we have a nice nude here and
this one is called cafe and this
definitely has a little bit of a PT
undertone and I feel like a lot of bite
beauty lip products when they do a nude
is usually peachy alright and then I
have a bunch of the fruit glosses I'm
pretty sure that's what they call them
yes they call them be fruit glosses so I
have this nice kind of red shade right
here some of these are part of a
watercolor collection that I purchased
last year and they're not actually named
they're just numbered so this one is
numbered as number 10 this one's number
9 so this one is like a nice red this
one has a peachy color we have a mint
green a nice warm toned pink a beautiful
deep purple a gorgeous kind of fuchsia
or no I would say medium tone pink with
a little more of a purple undertone a
peachy
color we have a really deep purple this
one right here is gorgeous this one is
called current I love this one I love it
and then we also have this shade which
is called strawberry which is like a
milkshake color I don't know our minds
we have a strawberry milkshake and then
I do have some other ones over here as
well this one right here is called
number one from the kids and this is
just a beautiful light pink we also have
a yellow these aren't super super
pigmented so don't worry it doesn't show
up yellow but it was supposed to be like
the watercolor painting thing so it was
kind of cute but yeah I have that one I
also have this nice kind of nude again a
little more on the peachy side this one
is called uh what doesn't say ramba tan
Ranma tan all right and then we have
another kind of pinky color here again I
feel like bite beauty with their news
they're very very peachy and then with
their pinks they tend to be very very
fuchsia and this one is called Bellini
it definitely has that blue undertone
going on there I love the shade right
here it's like a dusty rose e lilac
color absolutely gorgeous this one is
like a deep raspberry color yeah I was
gonna say a deep berry now a deep
raspberry and then we also just have
like a nice lilac color it's like a true
periwinkle all right I have some little
minis here that I have gotten in like I
don't know sephora play boxes in aus
100-point perks the first one is kimchi
and this is there a moose bouche
lipstick which is their newest formula
and kimchi is just a really really
beautiful cool toned pink shade this
little one right here is called blini
again I just showed you guys the gloss
and this one is also part of their nope
this is the luminous creme lipstick line
so that is what it looks like and then
this one right here is their luminous
creme lipstick incur Royale which is a
beautiful kind of very color but it also
has a little bit of like a nude in there
I like it it's a very pretty color all
right right here I have a full size of
the butter cream lipstick in the shade
Heather I love this beautiful again a
little more on the peachy side very very
similar to this amuse-bouche lipstick
this one is called sorbet this one has a
little more of a I don't even know this
one's more peachy this one's more pink
you guys are probably like they look
exactly the same but I swear they look
different on the lips this one's
definitely more pink and then like I
said the buttercream
is a little more peachy we have some lip
crayons here the first one here is
called rhubarb which is a beautiful
again just your lips are better with a
little bit of a brown tone we have this
one right here which is called
pomegranate which is a perfect red color
with a blue undertone this one right
here is called sable which is a gorgeous
nude oh my god it's like destroy look at
that but again it has a little bit of a
peachy undertone and then we have a
seeker winterberry which is a gorgeous
kind of berry shade all right moving on
into the duo is I really like these a
bite duo's so the first one that I have
up here is let's see here hristina and
also musk so here is musk which is like
I don't even know it's like a gray Newt
it's like a gray nude it makes me look
kind of dad and just this little duo
kind of makes me look dead this one is
russina again a little a little of a
dead color for me but I still like it
all right to the next time we have is
lingonberry and also tangerina this one
is tangerine and beautiful bright orange
and then we have a lingonberry on the
other side which is a beautiful vibrant
kind of purpley pink color really really
like that we have fig and date next this
is fig right here which is a beautiful
again kind of peachy nudie color and
then date on the other side has a little
more of a pink undertone reminds me a
lot of the sorbet shade in the
amuse-bouche lipstick line the next one
is my favorite it is mulberry and
scarlet here we have a mulberry which is
a beautiful deep kind of purple color
and then over here we have a scarlet no
wait this is mulberry that's scarlet
scarlet looks really dark but it comes
off a little more red and mulberry is
just a true purple and then the last one
we have here is violet and Palomino and
I turned it around here is Palomino
which is a beautiful fuchsia pink color
and then we have violet on the other
side so anybody thought to use my entire
a bite beauty lip collection I hope you
guys enjoyed this little video I just
thought it would be easier to kind of go
through things like this and do them in
small segments and i'll just post you
know i don't know i'll just throw these
in whenever the hell I want to i'm not
quite sure it's not going to have like a
posting schedule but i just thought
would be fun this way and i do get asked
a lot you know about my lip products
because in the
the limit video or in the makeup
collection video I really did kind of
breathe by them pretty quickly just
because I feel like I have a lot and I
was I was getting nervous having to go
through all them but anyway that is my
bike ed lip collection I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you for joining
me and i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
