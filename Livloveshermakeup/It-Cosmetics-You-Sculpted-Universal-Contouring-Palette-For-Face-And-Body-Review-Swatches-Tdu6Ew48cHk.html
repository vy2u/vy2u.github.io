channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a really
fantastic day in today's video I am
giving you guys a review and swatches on
the new it cosmetics you sculpted
Universal contouring palette for face
and body this is what the outer
packaging looks like and this is made
with hydrolyzed collagen silk hydrating
peptides and perfect lighting technology
it also is talc free paraben free and
cruelty free which is great I did
purchase this for $40 on the Ulta calm
website it will link below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
it up if you are interested or if you're
curious about the product and you can
read a little bit more about the actual
products on the website there anyway
this is the outer packaging it just
comes in a little silver box like this
and the actual packaging looks like this
I am NOT a fan and this is cardboard and
I don't know I feel like for $40 I
should get something a little more
sturdy than just like straight up
cardboard it just feels very very cheap
I wish this was a nice like hard acrylic
palette that's just me but I do feel
like this was priced relatively well I
normally find that it cosmetics products
are a little on the pricey side but I do
love their products and I don't mind
paying that extra money for you know
what is in there because I know that
Jamie Kern makes sure that it's not just
makeup it's also good for you she puts
in beneficial skincare ingredients and
things like that which i think is
fantastic but yeah this is $40 in
comparison I know the anastasi of
Beverly Hills contour kit is $40 I
believe the cap on d1 is about 42 and
then the Too Faced one which I have and
also the tortise are around 40 to 45 so
I feel like this was relatively well
priced like I said the outer packaging
is complete like cardboard and I just
feel like it's not that great it does
have a magnetic closure but I feel like
it just it could have a bigger mirror it
could have a lot more going on if that
makes sense but anyway when you open it
you see this and you have the little
mirror here and then you have the girl
with the sculpted face and then here are
the actual colors that you get in this
palette so this is what they look like
you are getting two highlights here you
are getting one matte highlight you are
getting a radiance highlight which has
but a shimmer in it kind of like a nice
sheen you are getting a deep contour
which is completely matte a light
contour which is completely matte a soft
contour which is completely matched any
medium contour which is completely
matched this has quickly become one of
my favorite contouring palaces is a
beautiful beautiful formulation I do not
have any other contouring palette that
has the silkiness the blend ability of
these kind of products right here
honestly to be completely honest I love
my Tarte T's contour palette I love my
Too Faced um cocoa contour chiseled
palette or whatever but this one has the
creamiest and easiest to blend
contouring shades in there I think if
you have fair skin you're going to love
this because it has such a beautiful
shade selection from a soft corn
tortilla light contour and then you do
get into these deeper contours if you
have very very dark skin I don't think
that this palette is really going to
cater to you I would say really only
pick it up if you have fair to light to
medium skin tones any anything deeper
than that you're really only going to be
able to use the deep contour and
probably the highlights in here the
medium contour the soft contour and the
light contour are probably not going to
show up on your skin but overall I think
this is a beautiful palette I really
really enjoyed the formulation on these
they are very creamy very buttery very
easy to use and I do like that you have
one two three four five matte shades in
here and then one highlight shade I like
that they give you a matte highlight for
setting up to make your eye area and
then they give you the radiance
highlight to kind of glow for your skin
today you may not even be able to tell
I'm wearing the soft contour in the
hollows of my cheeks and also around my
forehead it is very subtle it is very
beautiful I am NOT someone who likes to
straight-up carve out my cheekbones
every single day I do think a nice soft
contour is pretty but for the most part
I'm not someone that's gonna go in with
that deep contour and really like you
know carve out my cheekbones every day
it's just something that I don't
normally do so I really like that option
of having that really nice to light
contour in there and having just like
the different shade selections I think
it's really really fantastic so you do
get on the back here as you guys can
probably see there's like this little
pocket or pouch here and it does come
with a little like pamphlet and they are
amazing with their pamphlets
Maddox literally shows you how to
contour your whole entire body literally
your legs how to contour your ab area
like everything I have to contour your
breasts and decollete area they show you
everything in this pamphlet which I
think it's pretty awesome they are very
detailed and I feel like it cosmetics
always does that they tell you exactly
how to use their products and I think
it's really really fantastic so here it
will show you how to contour your bum
the back of your legs your thighs
literally everything if you want to
carve out like and sculpt your abs and
it's perfect for everything so I think
that's another reason why they have so
many different shades of the contour in
here because like if you want to do your
decollete you probably want to go with
the soft contour if you want to carve
out your abs you can go in with a deep
contour so I think that's what they were
going for but for the most part I think
it's also nice for a fair girl like me
who has very light skin tone to be able
to go in and use like a soft contour for
an everyday contour so overall really
really enjoying this I would say the
staying power on these it's really
really darn good at the lasting power
they they really stay on the skin all
day if i pair them with a really nice
primer and a good foundation that has a
little bit of like a tacky base they
stay on all day no problem I have been
setting in at my face with a setting
mist this week and I've been using the
what is that the Wet n Wild setting
spray they stay on all day I haven't had
any sort of issue I think they're
absolutely fantastic love that you get
the range of the soft contour all the
way to a really deep one and love that
you can use this on your body as well so
let's go ahead and start doing some
swatches I'm gonna start with the soft
contour and you guys these are like the
most buttery you know what these feel
like these feel like the what is it her
palate that she has a little pink one
this is that's what this is that's what
this feels like I cannot speak you know
like the matte shadows in there they're
super super creamy that's exactly what
these feel like so anyway here is the
soft contour swatched on my hand you can
see it goes on really really nicely I it
my hands are a little dry today but it
goes on so beautifully not patchy
whatsoever very silky very blendable I
have never touched a contouring powder
as soft as these so there is the soft
contour and like I said I'm wearing that
today in the hollows of my cheeks and
around the out
parameters of my face love it for a
really really nice subtle highlight and
I will say you do get a little bit
hopefully you guys can see that because
they are so soft you get a bit of kick
up and they do start to crumble a little
bit but I really don't mind because they
just blend away so nicely look if you
put too much on you can literally just
blend it away with like a fluffy brush
all right so the next shade we have in
here is a light contour and the
difference between the soft contour in
the light contour is that the soft
contour has more of a gray undertone
whereas a light contour has a little
more of a peachy undertone so here is
the light contour I'm sorry yes light
contour so here we have a soft contour
and then light contour and you can see
the difference so you have a little more
gray tones here and a little more pinky
or red tones there beautiful again if
you have different undertones in your
skin I think that's wonderful as well if
you tend to pull a little more of a cool
tone you might like the soft contour
more because it has a little more of a
cool tone or like a gray toned base if
you pull a little more of warm tones you
would probably like the light contour
more cuz it pulls a little more warmth
all right and then let's do the medium
contour which really has a strong kind
of reddish undertone in my opinion again
if you have warm tones in your skin you
would probably love this one so there is
medium contour so we have soft contour
light contour and medium contour you
guys can see how pigmented they are how
beautiful and blendable again a little
dusty but that's nothing I really don't
mind those nothing compared to some
other contouring palette that I have
dealt with and then we have deep contour
which is very very dark it is like a
dark chocolatey cool tone Brown there it
is so again we have soft contour light
contour medium contour and deep contour
so there are the contouring shades
really really gorgeous love the shade
selection like I feel like they just
nailed it with the shade selection I
feel like no matter what kind of
undertone you have in your skin you
could use this again I feel like this
would cater more to people who have like
fair to light to medium skin not too
much those with super super deep super
super deep skin tone but absolutely
beautiful love those and now let's go
ahead and swatch the two highlights so
we
the math highlight which is right here
and they met and the radiance highlights
have the same undertone they're a little
bit on the peachy side very very
beautiful and creamy but what I like
about them is that they just feel so
nice on the skin they don't take up this
particular matte highlight I am wearing
underneath my eyes today let me swatch
it on my other hand I am wearing it to
set of my under eye area today and I
feel like it doesn't start to like
crease anything it really sets in my
concealer and it has the slightest
amount of like Sheen to it
kind of like her eyeshadow palette the
little pink one again I feel like those
those shadows are mattes but they have a
little bit of like a sheen to them not a
sheen you guys know what I mean like
they're so soft they have like a subtle
a subtle amount of they're almost like a
demi Mac that's what I'm trying to say I
feel like this is the same sort of
concept it's very very beautiful but
there is like the smallest amount of
Sheen there and then we have the
radiance highlight which is absolutely
stunning like really really glowy and
beautiful this one pulls a little more
of a yellow undertone the matte one
pulls a little more of a pink tone there
it is and then the radiance pulls a
little more of a yellow undertone so
really really beautiful there are all
the swatches I am absolutely adoring
this contouring palette I cannot talk
about it enough I am definitely going to
be keeping this little pamphlet I think
it's very helpful if I want to I don't
know sculpt up my arms or my legs or my
butt I feel like this is very helpful I
really enjoy it and this has quickly
become a one of my favorite contouring
kits so I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and swatches on the new it
cosmetics you sculpted palette thank you
so much for joining me and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
