my channel today's video is going to be
all about OG pallets that are
irreplaceable so let's go ahead and
start with one from the drugstore this
is the wet and wild comfort zone palette
and this is one of their old-school 8
pan pallets it is absolutely phenomenal
this is the third one that I have
actually gone through I find that when I
start to pan these unfortunately it gets
really really messy especially with the
darker definer shades over here so I
just go ahead and repurchase a new one
now if you guys didn't know they did
recently repackage of these pallets but
honestly I haven't tried the new one so
I have no idea if the formula is still
there or not a lot of people are saying
they're very similar a lot of people are
saying they are not unfortunately the
shades are not identical but if this is
definitely one of those old-school
pallets I think a lot of people love
this is what really brought wet-and-wild
into like the whole beauty world once
people discovered that the color icon
shadow formula was so smooth and so
creamy and so buttery they immediately
jumped on the bandwagon and that is when
I feel like wet-and-wild really got a
huge following
alright the next palette I want to talk
about is one of my all-time favorites
and neutral palettes this is from Sonia
Kashuk it is called the ion neutral
palette now these are all just
completely matte finishes in here and
one of my favorite things I used to do
with not this identical palette but the
one I had before it was I actually used
to fill in my eyebrows with this when I
was in high school I think I used this
shade right here and as you guys can see
this one does have a little dip as well
this was the fourth one of these
palettes that I've gone through like I
said I discovered this in high school
but I love this as a transition I love
using these in my crease the smoky color
down here is beautiful on the lower lash
line and the top three shades are
absolutely perfect for going ahead and
setting in your eye base or your
concealer these are smooth they're
creamy they're buttery and this palette
is a cheaper than say the Urban Decay
Naked basics one and two I do have both
of those palettes but I think I'm going
to declutter them because honestly the
only thing I reach for when I want an
all matte palette or if I'm reaching for
a shimmery palette and I need to pull in
some mats is this guy right here let's
move on to lorac I recently had a really
good conversation with one of the reps
from lorac about their cruelty-free
status and I feel much more comfortable
showing you guys lorac products now this
is the lorac
padlet now I have a lot of the pro
palettes I have decluttered a few of
them I've decluttered the pro 3 as well
as the mega pro 1 I believe it was no
was it the mega pro 1 I can't remember
but I do have quite a few of them
I love the pro formula if there is any
kind of palette that I would recommend
you have in your collection that you can
use for everyday use it is something
like this now as you can see on the top
you have mattes and on the bottom you
have shimmers one of the most phenomenal
things about the lorac Pro formula is
that you cannot tell the difference if I
were to close my eyes right now and
swatch these out or touch the pans you
cannot tell the difference between the
shivers and the mattes they are so
blendable they are so beautiful
you do tend to get a little bit of kick
up with these because they are so soft
and you also will get a little bit of
fallout but as you can see from the
close-up here this is a very well-loved
palette of mine I have hit pan on let's
see here white cream mauve sable cuter
garnet and deep purple so that is a lot
of different shades there I don't tend
to reach as much for the cool tone
shades in here mostly because I have
different cool tone palettes that I
reach for like the lorac mega pro 2 but
this is beautiful highly highly
recommend you guys look into it and then
here is a palette that I feel like the
first edition is the best the second one
that came out just wasn't that great it
is the lorac unzipped palette I actually
tried these out for the first time about
two years ago so I was a little late on
the bandwagon but this is a beautiful
mafia sort of dusty pink rose kind of
palette these are not the same formula
as the lorac Pro they definitely feel a
little grittier and they are pressed a
little differently maybe a little more
firmly but a lot of people seem to like
that because you don't get as much
fallout and you won't you know get as
much kick up when you put your brush in
there the shades really do tend to kind
of muddle together especially with these
second edition that came out which was
the lorac unzipped gold but I feel like
if you're looking for a really really
decent pink tone palette and you don't
want to go for the Urban Decay Naked 3
and this is something I would absolutely
recommend the burgundy shades over here
like unconditional and unbrided are
gorgeous worked into the outer V as well
as the lower lash line did you tend to
get a lot of similar eye looks when you
use this palette however the eye looks
are always always beautiful so that is a
palette I definitely recommend you guys
look into as well the first edition is
much better than the second
and finally I have to go ahead and talk
about the Too Faced natural eye palette
now I believe it has been reformulated a
total of three times now if this was one
of the originals as you guys can see it
and I have hit pan on heaven silk teddy
and nude beach
as well as I am making a dent in
honeypot push-up and Velvet Revolver
although I've had this forever and this
little fan pops out as you guys can see
they don't stink they don't seem to
blend unevenly onto my eye this was
honestly the best formula that I think
Too Faced ever came up with I'm a big
fan of the 9 pan palettes from Too Faced
I know most people tend to kind of go
for the chocolate bar palettes but I
always say if you can find a good a 9
pan palette go for that this palette
right here I'm not quite sure about the
new reformulations I will check it out
and let you guys know I also love the
Too Faced peanut butter and jelly that
was a great one if you can still get
that highly recommend and also the
totally cute eyeshadow palette
very very similar to the old school
palette like this now unfortunately they
have gone and changed around the colors
I am interested in going ahead and
digging in and seeing what the new new
formulation is like but this was
definitely an OG palette that I could
not put down when I was in college
absolutely loved it always used to go on
with heaven I would take Velvet Revolver
in my crease and then silk teddy all
over my lid they really should come out
with another palette that features silk
teddy because it's a gorgeous shade so
anyway guys those are some old-school
palettes that I think are
phenomenal please let me know down below
if you agree with me if you disagree and
also if you would like to add any
palettes to this list and I guess I will
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
