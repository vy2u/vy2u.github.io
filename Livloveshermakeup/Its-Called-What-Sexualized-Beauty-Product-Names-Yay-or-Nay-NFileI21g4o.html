today I finally have my promise video
for you guys all about 62 product names
I thought this would be an interesting
topic because some of you feel very very
strongly about this some of you don't
that's totally fine but either way I do
hope you guys enjoyed this video let's
talk about a little bit of the
over-sexualization of beauty products as
well as makeup products in the industry
obviously sex sells and everybody seems
to know that including at the makeup
community but I do feel like sometimes
if these brands take it a little too far
now when I first talked about this I
think maybe I gave you guys the idea
that I'm totally not okay with this and
I want to say really quickly I lay right
in the middle some of these names are
really really out there and I'm not into
it and some of them I really just don't
care it is just makeup it is something
that you wash off at the end of the day
even if it does have a stamped on sexy
sort of name and it is your choice
whether or not you want to purchase
products like this so let's go ahead and
talk about the pros and cons of having a
sexy of product names but the first Pro
is definitely the fact that your product
is going to stand out on the shelf
say you have a blush over here called
peachy pink and a blush over here called
super orgasm which one really really
catches your eye probably super orgasm I
remember when NARS first released their
orgasm line they had the lip gloss they
also had the blush and then I believe
they had a liquid blush or a liquid
eliminate or highlighter so many people
were outraged you guys so many people
were outraged but they didn't
care do you want to know why because
people were outraged and people were
talking about it and they just sold a
bajillion of those blushes a brands are
going to get attention no matter what
it's kind of like what happened with
tart shaped a foundation yes they got a
lot a lot of bad press okay however it
really really made a lot of people go
look at tart whether it be good whether
it be bad yes obviously some people are
going to be outraged and some people are
not but still you're talking about the
product and still they are going to
continue to sell the product the final
pro in my opinion to having sexy product
names is that it's going to be relatable
to a certain audience obviously a blush
called orgasm might not be relatable to
someone who's 13 years old eight years
old six years old whatever
however if you are a little older if you
are sexually active you might find it
hashtag relatable you might find it kind
of amusing or you might even kind of
find it funny so those are definitely
the pros to having sexy of product names
now let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about the cons some of these do overlap
which is kind of interesting the first
con is some people are not going to take
your brand as seriously and this is
definitely one that comes up over and
over and over again I see a lot of you
guys in my comment section saying well
I'm not gonna purchase that product
because that name is just a
ridiculous think of to face new glitter
job a glow mask or whatever it's called
I mean it's it's gross well I
think that that is where I draw my line
and I honestly can't take two-face
seriously when I see something like that
now in general I can't really take to
face too seriously because a lot of
their stuff is cutesy but when they do
something so over-the-top and overboard
like that it really makes you think do I
have a lot of respect for this brand
probably not another con is that you are
definitely going to lose customers if
you are going to take that leap and
you're gonna say hey we're naming this
product super orgasm or deep throat or
whatever there are going to be people
out there that are never ever ever going
to pick up those products I'm not gonna
buy it for Mom for Christmas they're not
gonna buy it for their grandma for their
birthday they are not gonna buy it for
themselves because it makes them
uncomfortable and yes there is a chance
that you could lose a customer or two
however like I said when it comes to the
pros the uproar and the whole like the
chaos over oh my god that's such a crazy
product name that also is going to get a
new influx of people who are obviously
I'm going to come in and purchase your
product as well so it's kind of like a
50-50 the last con is that you are only
catering to a certain demographic and
now some people may say this isn't true
but like I said I find that more people
who are of a certain age are probably
going to be buying blushes called deep
throat or a mask all the glow job things
like that alright guys he's not going to
go ahead and list off a few beauty
products here and I'm going to put a 1
to 5 scale one being it doesn't bother
me to 5 being I think it's inappropriate
because like I told you I'm right in the
middle when it comes to sexy product
names and I would love to know what you
think of 1 to 5 scale on these products
down below in the comments section as
well so for the first one is the sexy
mother pucker lip gloss from soap &amp;amp;
Glory
I'm givin that a one that does not
bother me at all in fact it kind of
intrigues me sexy mother pucker kinda
like sexy ass mother I think it's
cute I think it's catchy but yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and say that's a 1 and
next up we have to face glow job mass
I'm gonna give this a 5 I think it's
gross I think it's gross and if
this is not coming from someone I really
not approved you guys but there's
something about the way that it looks
the consistency of it the fact that
they're calling it glow job it really is
 gross okay and I think we all
know what that jelly consistency reminds
us of and I would not want my 12 13 14
15 year old putting that on their face
okay up next we have narses deep throat
and orgasm blushes I would give that a -
when I was in high school I did not want
to buy or get some blush and because I
actually was very intimidated by the
name and again this is coming from
someone who I had sex at a very early
age you know I lost my virginity when I
was 14 but there was something about
going to the nars section and finding
like the NARS orgasm blush that kind of
made me feel freaked out going up and
ringing it out at the cash register so
I'm gonna give it a - I wouldn't say
it's too inappropriate but like deep
throat nurse's orgasm super orgasm
things like that definitely don't bother
me anymore but when I was younger yes
they kind of bothered me just a little
bit and finally guys we have Kat Von D
underage red lipstick I'm gonna give
this a 4 I find this quite inappropriate
and maybe it's because I'm a teacher
I've been a nanny I'm around kids a lot
but I don't like anything that has to do
with thinking of children in a sexy way
like that now I know that Kat Von D has
explained that this was just a red
lipstick that she used to wear when she
was like 16 or 17 but it's the name
underage red that just sounds really
really inappropriate especially in this
point at this time in the world right
now we're we deal with a ton of sex
trafficking of young children and things
like that I do find that one a little
inappropriate so I'm going to go ahead
and give that a four so overall guys I
really don't mind too many you know sexy
of product names however I feel like
there is a line and some brands do kind
of go over that line I understand if
they are doing it to try and reel you in
but at the same time glitter job
underage red or glow job attorneys read
things like
that do kind of like oh it kind of
grosses me out to be completely honest
and I know gross is some of you guys are
as well other things like sexy mother
pucker and narcissus orgasm blush deep
sorrow none of that stuff bothers me
anymore maybe it made me feel a little
intimidated when I was a little younger
but nowadays that really doesn't bother
me this is their way of promoting and
this is what they want to do again it is
going to cause people to want to buy
their products and again this is makeup
it is something we wash off at the end
of the day so let me know what you think
of this video topic down below like I
said I am right in the middle you guys
so I'm not trying to push one way or the
other I still want to know your thoughts
and I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow
