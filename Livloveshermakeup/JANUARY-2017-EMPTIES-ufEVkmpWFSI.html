my channel today's video is going to be
my January 2017 empties so if you're
interested in seeing the products that
Tom and I used up this month and please
keep on watching I don't know if I have
a lot but I have a lot of new makeup way
so the first year I used up with from
the Ulta brand these are the makeup
remover of facial tablets it says gentle
cleansing made with 100% plant-based
fiber you do get 25 pre-moistened
towelettes into your I love these you
guys very very very comparable to the
Neutrogena ones that come in the blue
pack but these are not as expensive and
they are not as greasy so this is what
they look like thank you also have a I
think it's a sensitive skin version yet
they have a sensitive skin version as
well that does not have any sort of
fragrance but they do smell good I feel
like they remove my makeup nicely if I'm
really really pulling around my eye area
it can make it kind of sting a little
bit but from face makeup it's great
alright the next item that I will
repurchase by the way alright the next
item that I did use up is from a Mario
Badescu and this is the facial spray
with aloe herbs and rosewater this is a
really really beautiful facial spray you
guys I will definitely repurchase it's
not my personal favorite I still do like
my shirt leaked rose water balancing
this just a little more but this is
absolutely fantastic
it's only like seven dollars and fifty
cents a bottle and you do get four fluid
ounces of product in here so very very
nice I feel like it calms down the skin
it just makes it look nicer and it just
smells really good okay it smells really
good you guys know I like good smelling
products alright I did this up another
pack of those Ulta and makeup removing
wipes you guys can tell I am a fan I did
also use up this egg white pour foam
from skin-food so skin-food had sent me
some of their products to test out for
an honest review probably about what
like three or four months ago I did not
really like this and I kind of stand by
that I felt like it just wasn't really
good for cleansing my skin now I do have
more combination oily skin and when I
was using this I felt like I was very
very oily so I would recommend this more
if you have dry skin I don't know why
it's just cuz it's a cream cleanser but
I still think it's okay would I go out
and purchase it with my own money no not
necessarily
it was nice as the second cleanse for
removing um makeup but it's not
something that I would just like
straight-up cleanse my face with I don't
feel like it really helps with breakouts
it doesn't really completely moisturize
the skin either so yeah it's just kind
of one of those cleansers rules like
doesn't do anything I don't think so so
yeah would not repurchase that or I
wouldn't purchase it we did use up a
little
wallflower G will pack here in the
evergreen scent I have this in the
beauty room right now and it just smells
like an air freshener it's just not it's
not that lovely I may have to go ahead
and toss those because they don't smell
good
so I would not repurchase let's see here
we did use up to a deep cleansing hand
soaps in twisted at peppermint and a
Christmas morning from Bath and Body
Works so twisted peppermint is sweet
peppermint sugared snow and vanilla
buttercream it really does smell quite
good I either love or I hate the scent
sometimes I'm like it makes me nauseous
but sometimes I'm like you know what it
smells great and then Christmas morning
is a blend of crisp a Christmas fir with
a touch of cranberry and this smelled
really weird in the bottle it just
didn't smell like anything special but
it was like magical when you put it on
your hands it really just smell like
Christmas Day like it obviously smelled
really good so I did enjoy that we would
probably go ahead and repurchase that
next year during the Christmas time
let's see here I did use up a pack of
these simple at my cellar makeup remover
wipes as well I feel like I went through
a lot of wipes it was because I was kind
of doing some traveling this month so
these are pretty darn good I have I just
like they kind of changed up the actual
cloth the consistency feels like a
little more I was going to say ribbed it
feels a little more textured and I feel
like it does actually make your skin
more sensitive the more you rub so I
don't know if I would repurchase lis
they're good for removing swatches
though so we'll see I still do prefer
these ones and the Ulta ones oh so these
are these support and uses cleansing
wipes you guys know I love these and
these are just awesome they are
revitalizing and toning I love these
ones and I love the Rose Wong's Lee
Sephora cleansing wipes are just really
good in general and I do feel like these
are nice for quick cleansing the face
you can actually use them for makeup
removal if you are very very sensitive
to fragrance I would be careful but
overall I really like them alright
something that I really hated this is
the Catherine Malandrino cm
homage to do poles so this is like a
really disgusting smelling perfume it
just up no it is so overpowering you
guys I know that seems like I'm being
dramatic but it really just smells
horrible I don't know what is going on
here guys smells like Jessica Simpson's
fancy perfume which I actually have in a
full-size but I hate that the more I use
it I'm gonna have to go ahead and
declutter that it's just too
overpowering it smells kind of like baby
powder and just very musky not my kind
of fragrance so I'm gonna have to just
go ahead and toss that I cannot
I just didn't do it alright let's see
here I did used up a litmus this is from
Spa life I like these once in a while
before I go on stage they're like this
little jelly you literally put it over
your lips you leave it on for like 5-10
minutes and supposedly it helps them to
be more like moisturize and things like
that I don't notice a huge difference
but before a show I will take whatever I
can get
alright let's see here I did it uh no I
did not use this up this was the
Clinique all about eyes this is the
reducing circles puffing eye cream
whatever I did not use this up because
it went bad sitting in my collection I
really need to get a handle on my
skincare you guys because there are so
many products just sitting there that I
didn't get to so unfortunately this
reeks and I can tell that it's gone bad
so I'm going to toss that I did however
use up the Mario Badescu dermo nekton
eye cream this took forever to go
through um and it lasted a very very
long time it had a nice blue kind of
light color to it so it was actually
nice like in the morning because it
really helped with like redness on your
face but yeah this was pretty darn good
I think that Mario Badescu is a really
really solid brand if you're looking for
some good skincare I've used them
exclusively when I was in college but I
just feel like I don't reach for his
products as often anymore but that's
because I'm obsessed with Sunday Riley
now but I would go ahead and purchase
probably the hyaluronic I cream or the
glycolic one is pretty darn good as well
as more of like a thicker bomb but his
eye creams are quite good so I would
possibly repurchase I did use up these
Sephora rose sleeping masks this is
ultra moisturizing and brightening I
would repurchase this little guy I love
these little masks you can get like
seven days worth of product out of here
you can literally use this as like a
nighttime gel moisturizer there's a lot
in one little monopod so really really
like that I did use up a little package
of the up-and-up premium cotton ovals I
love these for applying toner they're
just really good very very thick and
like it doesn't get a little white
particles all over your face sometimes I
feel like my Shiseido's facial cotton
just starts to like disintegrate when I
put toner on it so these are awesome
really really enjoyed those would
repurchase I also did use up the yes to
cotton this is the protects and
minimizes irritation ultra sensitive
allergy prone skin at comforting facial
wipes these are probably the best makeup
removing wipes I could tried from this
brand so they do have quite a few that
you can pick up I tried the grapefruit
ones the tomato one goals were really
harsh I like the cucumber ones for
removing swatches because they smell
good but this one
really really gentle I feel like for the
most part that yes to brand doesn't tend
to be as gentle when it comes to their
makeup removing ways that these are
beautiful they do smell like fresh
cotton they smell like laundry or
something so I would actually repurchase
those I did like that I also did use up
the Ulta brands of micellar water makeup
removing cleansing pads it says
hydrating no-rinse formula with aloe and
cucumber these are basically just little
travel disks that you can take if you
don't want to take your micellar water
and have it go all over your luggage so
these are just easier to travel with
they are filled with alcohol yes they
are
did it say no alcohol notice is
hydrating no brands they are filled with
alcohol you can smell it and it
definitely doesn't leave your skin
feeling nice and balanced like the
Garnier one or like the simple micellar
cleansing water but they do work so I do
purchase them when I am going on a trip
I did also use up that these simple
sensitive skin experts cleansing facial
wipes so again same thing with the
micellar water at once I feel like they
change the acts actual on consistency of
the cloth and it's just a little more
harsh now so I don't know if I would
repurchase I loved the old version that
they had it was so nice on the skin I
feel like those are really good for
sensitive skin people but I don't know
it's a whole like extra now it's weird I
did use up the Neutrogena hydro boost a
water gel I love this but I will not
repurchase because now I know that
Neutrogena is not cruelty free but this
is a beautiful beautiful lightweight gel
moisturizer this was the water gel one
so it had hyaluronic acid in it they
also do have a gel prem version but i'm
gonna see if i can find something that
is comparable but i'm so cruelty free
let's see here I did use up the origins
ginseng energy boosting treatment notion
miss I did not think this was anything
special you guys if you're gonna pick
something up from the ginseng line I'd
be like the oh yes the ginseng
refreshing eye cream that's amazing and
also the moisturizer is pretty good this
and the cleanser I don't think we're
that great so I would not repurchase
that I did use up this little Peter
Thomas Roth unwrinkle night cream I've
gone through two full sizes of this like
a hundred and $15 cream it claims to
have retinol in it but I don't notice as
good like I don't notice my skin looks
as good when I use that versus like my
Sunday Riley Luna sleeping at night to
retinol oil so I would just go ahead and
repurchase this a Sunday Riley one I did
also use up this little SD edit what is
this
pink peony overnight water pack this is
like the stupidest gel moisturizer or
mask I guess you could say it smelled
because it's peonies those are my
favorite flowers hence the banner on my
actual YouTube page but yeah it smelled
really good I don't feel like it did
anything and this is outrageous the
price is absolutely outrageous so I did
not like that would not repurchase and
then I did kind of use up this little
guy right here it dried out so this is
the beat in it this is the BH Cosmetics
flawless a brow pencil in the shade
blonde I really love this I really think
this is a good brow pencil I will
repurchase but it's just too dry now so
anyway it does they're all the products
I do stuff this month I definitely let
me know down below they top 5 items
things are falling they top 5 5 items
that you guys used up this month and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
