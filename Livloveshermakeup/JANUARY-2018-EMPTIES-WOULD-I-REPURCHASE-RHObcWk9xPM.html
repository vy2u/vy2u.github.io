my channel today I have my January 2018
empties video to share with you guys so
if you're interested in seen of what I
used up this month and please keep on
watching alright so the first item I
have here is the rapid brow eyebrow
enhancing serum this is not something I
would repurchase I don't believe that
this a brand is cruelty free however it
did work a little bit I do have a lot of
thinness in my eyebrows towards the arch
of my eyebrow and I did feel like this
helped to kind of thicken it up and fill
it in a little more it's not anything
that's absolutely amazing but like I
said I wouldn't repurchase I have been
using oils on my eyelashes and so well
as my eyebrows lately and it's basically
doing the same thing I've been using
avocado oil as well as castor oil if you
guys are curious for my lashes and my
eyebrows but yeah that is a rapid brow
eyebrow enhancing serum like I said
would not repurchase I did burn through
the witch City wicks hearth I'm a
beautiful little Campbell right here
this smells amazing this is a nice
woodsy kind of stem so if you like those
smokey kind of sense you would probably
enjoy that I also did a burden it threw
a lemon of verbena which is also from
which City wicks
I love these beautiful little jars here
I like to decant them and use them to
put makeup brushes in or like little lip
balms and stuff like that so this is a
nice scent as well if you do like that
more fresh scent and you love the scent
of lemon you would probably really enjoy
this alright guys moving on it's it use
up quite a bit of skincare this month so
why don't we start with this guy right
here which is the pixie skin treats glow
tonic and this is a five percent
glycolic acid exfoliating toner this is
one of the smaller sizes I recently got
the pixie skin treats to go which is
basically this and it's some sort of
like a little pad version I really do
like the convenience of those however
I've heard that they're not as good for
the environment so I would probably
repurchase at this one before I
repurchase it that one but yeah both of
these are really really good I like the
path I like this one these are great for
making your skin look really healthy and
beautiful and glowy and you really do
help with breakouts as well I also used
up this little deluxe size and the Ola
Henriksen transforming walnut scrub I
need to purchase this in a full-size I
love this scrub it smells like
blueberries it is a physical sort of
exfoliant so you definitely get that
kind of gritty feeling going on it
exfoliates my skin just as well as a
luscious ocean salt so I do enjoy this
and I would repurchase
I have another little deluxe size of a
scrub here this is actually from origins
origins does test on animals so I would
not repurchase this but it is the
refreshing scrub a cleanser and nothing
special and I do believe it that the
microbeads in here were plastic which is
not good for the environment so
definitely would not purchase that guy
right there here we have the pharmacy
green clean and makeup melt away
cleansing a balm this has quickly become
my go-to cleansing balm for removing on
my makeup I still do double cleanse
after using this but this is absolutely
fantastic you get a nice amount of
product here 3.2 fluid ounces or 90 ml
for only $32 on the Sephora comm website
you can see I cleans this baby out
absolutely a hundred percent will go
ahead and repurchase that alright I did
use up with these super bounce serum
from a glossier
this is basically to ease and soften
tight rough skin it says to apply all
over clean face and follow up with a
moisturizer it's beautiful it has
hyaluronic acid and b5 in it so I would
repurchase this however I have to say I
feel like I went through this very very
quickly I have a serum that's very
similar from skin diva that has
hyaluronic acid and b5 in it so maybe I
were to purchase that one first just
because if this one like I said is a
really small amounts but I did get three
serums on sale during their Black Friday
event but yeah this is a beautiful
beautiful serum I do enjoy it so
possibly would repurchase up next we
have one of the makeup products I think
this may be the only one I'm not showing
everything that I used up in my project
pan video in my empties because I want
to do a separate video on that but if
this is a steal of aqua glow perfecting
a primer I did enjoy this a lot when I
had more combo skin it reminds me a
little bit of the milk makeup water
stick cooling water stick but this one
is a lot better it really does prolong
the wear of your foundation throughout
the day it is cooling it's very nice if
you have sensitive skin or combo skin
probably would not repurchase now that I
have dry skin is just not moisturizing
enough for me personally but it was
quite good that is the Stila aqua glow
perfecting a primer up next I did finish
off this Murad essential C cleanser it
was nothing special and this is
incredibly expensive for a full size so
I probably would not purchase a
full-size of that here is my all-time
favorite perfume it's gone and
unfortunately Versace does tests on
animals so not going to be repurchasing
this but this is a Versace a bright
crystal it's a really really bubbly
bubbly bubbly it's a really really
bubbly sort of
if you love the scent of flowers as well
as sweetness you would really really
enjoy this but like I said unfortunately
they do test on animals so I will not be
repurchasing at that I did go through
two packs of these premium cotton rounds
from up and up I'm not really sure if
the up and up brand is cruelty for you
or not but these are pretty nice they're
very very large kind of like oval-shaped
disks I also did use up the youth to the
people spin ages fear Alena microalgae
kale mask this was really really nice I
would love to get a full-size of this
I've been incredibly incredibly
impressed with the youth to the people
line so and that is the micro algae max
like I said I will be purchasing a
full-size of that I love that it doesn't
dry down too harshly on the skin but it
is kind of like a clay mask that does
draw out and pull out impurities up next
we have another product that I
definitely would repurchase this is from
Pacifica it's called the seafoam
complete face wash it removes makeup
cleanses and tones I use it as my double
cleanse it's beautiful it smells really
good but it is all natural fragrances
you don't have to worry about it
irritating your skin too much
it's 100% vegan cruelty-free you get
five fluid ounces of product in here and
like I said it does a great job at
double cleansing so I would repurchase
that all right here's the Lucetta
coconut milk shampoo this was a little
deluxe size that I think I got into
boxycharm years ago or ages ago years
ago probably like six months ago this is
really really nice um however it did
cause irritation on the back of my scalp
if you guys didn't know I do have lupus
and I do have scarring on the back of my
scalp hence why I wear my hair up all
the time to kind of cover it and this do
to make my scalp very very itchy so it
smelled nice and it did and moisturize
my hair a little bit but unfortunately
it's just not anything too special
because it did cause irritation so would
not purchase a full size of that up next
we have the it cosmetics miracle water
its anti-aging three one glow tonic skin
brightening radiance booster anti-aging
treatment essence and skin softening
micellar cleanser I love this I will be
purchasing a full size of this I like it
a little more than my Burt's Bees
cleansing water which I have been
getting a lot of use out of lately but
this is just really nice because it does
actually put hydration back into your
skin if you're looking for a micellar
water that will do that this is a great
one so yes I would go ahead and
repurchase this however I do want to say
as a radiance booster and a treatment
essence I don't really think it's that
great it's a little too sticky to be
like a true essence
I don't feel like it you know it since
it does kind of cleanse the face it just
makes it makes sense to use it as a
cleansing water so I know that this has
a lot of claims I feel like a lot of it
cosmetics products have a lot of claims
especially their skincare products I
really would just use this as a
cleansing water I am very careful around
my eye area because sometimes it can
sting a little bit but it's great for
all over the face in the morning if I
want a quick cleanser and I don't want
to wash my face at the sink
speaking of washing my face at the sink
I did finish off the Ola Herricks in the
clean truth foaming cleanser I love this
it's beautiful great for a double
cleanse or great in the morning with my
Luna freo many as well as a really
really nice parrot together with my
sonic cleanser plus from a Michael Todd
Beauty so I'm thinking of going ahead
and purchasing a full-size of that I've
also heard really good things about the
truth melting cleanser which helps to
remove makeup so I'll look into that up
next I did use up the blender cleanser
from Beauty Blender this is the only
thing that I will purchase from Beauty
Blender and not a fan of their sponge
it's just a way over price but right
here you get ten fluid ounces of product
and this is great for cleaning your
brushes I love the scent of it it's like
tea tree and something else mixed
together it's kind of like a smells like
chlorine and like a little bit of
muskiness I don't know why but I have
Piko which you guys don't know that's
like a nutrient deficiency where I love
the smell of really really strange
things and I like want to eat them I
don't eat them anymore I did as a child
by don't anymore but I love the smell of
chlorine and like gasoline and we're
weird thanks okay so anyway this smells
really really good to me I know the
biggest complaint about this is the
smell but to me it smells great I love
the way my brush is clean when I use
this I love the way they smell so I
would repurchase that and finally guys
we have these whispers 100% cotton
rounds these are a little abrasive on
the skin
I don't believe us whispers is a
cruelty-free brand so it definitely
would not repurchase those so anyway
that is it so basically one makeup
product although you guys will see at my
current project pan when I do my final
on my finale for my what was it 12 pins
a Christmas project pan you'll see I
used up a lot more makeup I just didn't
want to include it in this video because
I want to do that one separately but
yeah that's pretty much it thanks for
joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
