doing an unboxing so anyway here is what
the little pamphlet looks like for the
month it has little pieces of grapefruit
on it and if you guys didn't know
popsugar must have box is one of my
all-time favorite subscription boxes I
like it because it's very whimsical and
they do different things that give you
some food item some you know just like
whimsical goodies like little agendas
and things like that they also gave you
just like random stuff you guys will see
but it's really cute I like the box a
lot it's probably right up there with my
glossybox which is my all-time favorite
subscription service but anyways let's
go ahead and just get started so with
the first item that I see here up here
to be little I think these are these are
cocktail napkins they are emoji cocktail
napkins do you see this oh my god
there's a way to view it okay so i will
leave a link down below where you guys
can sign up so popsugar must have box if
you guys would like to it's not an
affiliate link or anything like that um
it will just take you directly to the
website but these are a little like
cocktail like to put your little glass
on so here we have this one this one
right here is a little bumblebee you
know so people don't like mess up your
wood or your furniture we have a little
flower here that reminds me of a
snapchat filter we have a palm tree we
have the cute little smiley face the
cool dude and then we have the winky one
which is definitely my favorite so these
are cute i love that i think that's
awesome to have like if you're having a
little get-together or a party or
something like that those are nice to
have so let's read about them what do
they say in here it says here in the Sun
no that's not it emoji cocktail napkins
it from house of palm the suggested
retail is twenty-five dollars for that
little pack and it says our exclusive
cocktail napkins designed by house of
palm capture the summer experience in a
language everyone can speak emoji if the
serving of icy cold drinks has never
been so Instagram about all right
moving on in the next item that I see
here is the inflatable drink holder of
what oh my god this is so cute do you
see this it's a little Swan and it
literally is a like drink holder so I'm
gonna bring this up to the cabin because
we're right on a lake and my brother and
I like to hang out we like to hang out
on the boat and have like beers and
stuff but this is so cute you literally
can put this in the water and float
around with it it says sunny light
guarantees that your summer won't suck
it'll blow it says no need to stop
recycling let the beverages float on
over for cruzi drinks in the pool that
is way too cute and just different and
kind of strange so I love that um if the
sea on here let's see here sunny life
Swan drink holder we can't have a butler
delivered chill drinks by the pool but
we can have the next best thing i Swan
float up to four beverages with this
playful blow-up toy so you never have to
lead the water no pool no problem just
want is just as much fun and functional
on any sort of table and it does retail
for eighty dollars I mean $18 chases
eighty dollars maybe tails for eighteen
dollars that's really really cute you
guys alright the next item I see here
appears to be a little um let's see
Michael star skinny scarves so this is
what it looks like it's a really pretty
little detail print um I feel like I
always get a little scarf every single
month with popsugar must have box which
I don't mind that is so cute oh my god
this is adorable scarf so let's go ahead
and read about this it says michael
stars porcelain skinny scarf in white it
says say goodbye to the statement
necklace and hello to your latest it
accessory the skinny-scarf dress it up
or down by wrapping nodding or simply
draping it atop your favorite summer
ensembles or stepping up your headband
game because no I've been into headband
so this is so cute i love it all right
in the next item that i see it here is
from oh my brow it says this is eyebrow
highlighter if you she'd pearl it looks
like this and we'll see what's this
looks like oh that's definitely a
full-size so this goes right underneath
your brow i'm guessing to highlight and
oh my gosh I like that it's
really really creamy because I feel like
the one from benefit is like very very
chalky so there it is and it is like a
little retractable pencil so you just
put it right underneath your browser on
the inner corner of your eye to
highlight or really anywhere that you
want to highlight and then we have the
pin trill this is a little pin and it's
a pineapple it's so cute oh god it's
adorable all right let's read about that
it says pin trill pin up a pineapple
pepper to say pinnable pandas ice it's
been a long day pineapple pin this is
twelve dollars and it says what better
way to stand at your skinny scarf into
place them with a cute pan our editors
are obsessed with pins and pineapples
lately and this adorable bauble is the
perfect way to steal the trend for
yourself alright so moving on I think
this item that I see here is orange you
think I literally just started choking
on my own saliva lovely all right open
up open all right so this is like an
orange tube it says this is the shush
Wanda stockholm i should be able to read
this i am swedish anyway it says hair in
the sun professional haircare it says
here is that here in the sun with oceans
filled technology protects your hair and
hair color from the Sun with a UV filter
that stays in the hair even after a bath
or a shower so you apply this to damp
air and then you go in the Sun and is
supposed to help like the you know with
your hair like UV filters it will help
it if it's blonde from not turning green
oh oh yes girl smells like oranges and
it looks like an orange so that's cool
I'm excited for that nothing is huge
like definitely a full size and then the
final item that I see in here is a food
item and it is the classic sea salt and
can't speak you guys classic sea salt
Joe chips these are retro potato chips
potato that is what they look like so
anyway and that is everything that I got
in this month's popsugar must have box I
hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing
