my channel in this video I obviously
have my Sephora play box unboxing this
is a late night upload I have been you
know out all day so if I don't look as
fresh on my face of that is why am I
makeup is definitely starting to wear
off I had a long day anyway I got home
and I saw that my support play box for
july 2016 had showed up so i'm going to
unbox it with you guys alright so the
first thing that we have here is the
sephora play pass they get this to you
every single month if you take this
little card in store you get 50 extra
beauty insider points and then the
actual little bag that it comes in this
month is super cute can you guys see
that it's a popsicle with a little kitty
mark I think that's adorable so I really
really like these little bags the first
thing that I see here is the nest
fragrances citrine o de parfum and this
is what it looks like I have smelled
this before I believe I've gone through
a full size of this it's beautiful it's
got a mixture of robina lemon blossom
also I believe orange peel extract in it
so it smells really good and it says the
dewy softness of lotus flower freesia
and also lemon blossom are set against
sparkling notes of precious woods blah
blah blah so yeah I'm excited to try
that out again I do remember enjoying
that particular fragrance the next item
that I see here is the blotter rossi by
Beauty Blender and this is a blotting
sponge which I definitely could use
right about now great if you have combo
or oily skin I haven't heard great
things about this but I don't mind
trying it out it says you need to wash
it with the liquid blender cleanser and
it lasts approximately 30 to 45 days so
you basically just blot your skin
throughout the day this is what the
actual little sponge looks like it is
hot hot hot pink and it's very very cute
so we shall see how that works alright
so the next item I see here is the too
faced chocolate soleil this is a medium
/ deep matte bronzer the I didn't say
that right matte bronzer let me get it
out of its packaging I have gone through
I think two or three full sizes of this
I used to use this as my contouring
powder it makes a really nice contouring
powder if you do have fair skin and I
really do like the actual color I think
all of the so late bronzers are quite
nice but this one's really really good
if you do have fair skin and also if you
do have I would say medium skin tone so
let's see if we can open s please open
ooh ooh girls mouth like chocolate so
there it is
beautiful beautiful color it is
completely matte and these are very very
smooth and creamy and buttery so let me
go ahead and swatch it there it is and I
just like the way that this looks on
fair skin tones alright moving on the
next item that I seen here is a skincare
item and I'm so excited because I
recently went through a little hundred
point perk of this this is the first aid
beauty skin rescue deep cleanser with
red clay it says it removes excess oils
and unclog the pores and purifies the
skin it said that also is safe for
sensitive skin but honestly I remember
using this and I kind of think maybe not
safe for sensitive skin it really did
drop like draw out the impurities and
all of the oils so it kind of left my
skin feeling sorts of squeaky clean
sometimes I don't think you would like
that if you do have sensitive skin but
for the most part it's beautiful it's
like a red gel and I really feel like if
your combo oily skin you would love this
so I'm very excited to have that the
next item that I see in here is the way
away way I don't know how to say this
way I think it's the away haircare wave
spray and it basically looks like this
and I'm guessing that you spray this
into damp hair and it really kind of
helps you to hold your curl and also
your wave which you guys know my hair
does not freak and hold a curl or wave
for so anyway we will try this out
so let me go ahead and spray a little
bit cuz I want to smell it oh it's a
very like bubbly can you guys see that
oh my god oh girl it smells really
really good it smells like a high-end
perfume so I am quite interested in
trying that out i will keep you guys
updated on that and the final item that
is in my sephora play box for the month
is the smashbox photo finish foundation
primer in the pore minimizing version i
do not like this primer so i will go
ahead and declutter it to somebody but
it is nice if you have very large pores
you just have to be very very careful
with how you layer it with your skincare
every time i use this it starts to ball
up on my skin so it doesn't work for me
but i will hand it to someone else
alright guys so that is everything that
i got in this month's play box thank you
so much for joining me and i will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
