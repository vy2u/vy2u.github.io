channel today I am here to share my July
2017 anti ho with you guys talking a
little bit about some that I'm not
gonna buy so let's go ahead and jump
right into it I am going to start with a
product from Anastasia Beverly Hills I'm
a huge fan of Anna Sophia Beverly Hills
I love their glow kits I love a lot of
products that they have the eyes will be
skipping on their new liquid glow
illuminators there are four different
shades you can choose from the first one
being bronze the second one being Perla
the third one being peach feeds and the
fourth being oyster I don't feel like
these colors or anything special we've
seen all of these before you can take a
liquid illuminator and mix them into
your foundation or just like apply them
with a damp sponge I am someone who
doesn't love liquid illuminator which is
first of all the reason why I won't be
purchasing them I do feel like they move
around my foundation and my powder I am
someone who does heavily powder my face
so I have not really found a liquid
illuminator that just goes on top and
doesn't actually disturb my foundation
and second of all if you feel like you
can find really good quality liquid
illuminators at the drugstore the one I
have in mind is the hard candy a dull
face liquid illuminator they have a
bronze version they also do have a pink
version they're just as opaque and just
as shiny so I don't feel like you need
to spend the twenty to thirty dollars on
these guys right here so I'll be passing
let me know down below if you will be
passing on those next we do have the new
lorac unzipped palette so I want to say
really quickly I am really in between on
if I really think that LaRocca is
cruelty free or not they do not sell in
China they do say they are cruelty free
but unfortunately they cannot guarantee
that their suppliers are now a lot of
brands cannot guarantee that just kind
of like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works but the thing
about lorac and Bath and Body Works is
that when I reach out to them I get
mixed responses that really pisses me
off as a consumer it's either your
cruelty free or you're not I don't like
getting back and forth yes or no or
maybe it really has just kind of bugged
me and that is why I no longer consider
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works cruelty free because I
want a straight answer as a consumer and
that is no longer why I really consider
lorac to be cruelty free so I will not
be purchasing but also if you guys are
interested in these palettes I just want
to say something really quickly when
you're looking at these three pallets
side by side go ahead and cover two of
them at a time and really look at the
palette and say huh
do I have colors like that in my
collection because the mountains
when I look at it and I covered the
other to you and I think you know what
those colors in there look very similar
to my lorac mega pro 2 I covered the
other two and I look at the ocean sunset
and I think you know what that color
collection is a little on the strange
side actually of those are very much
like pastel colors well they work for
every single skin tone will they work
for your skin tone and then finally when
it comes to the desert sunrise the only
shade in there that I'm super super
drawn to you is that sunrise shade which
is that hot coral shade but I'm sure
that you have colors like that in your
collection
they could be in single form in duo form
and a trio form or even in other
palettes so just go through your
palettes and really think do I need
these colors because although the unzip
formula is very very good it's not as
good as a pro formula and honestly these
colors are not actually that special if
you look at them one by one if you look
at the palace in my opinion so I will be
skipping on at those next we do have the
newest real estate all they cover stick
as this is a foundation stick is
supposed to be full coverage it looks
like they have a great shade selection
which I'm very happy about this will
retail for $36 a piece 4.25 Q ounces of
product you never really get that much
foundation in stick foundations
unfortunately now this is more of a
personal thing up but I just can't
handle stick foundations anymore I feel
like there are very small amounts of
stick foundations on the market they
actually work for normal skin and dry
skin and right now I do have normal skin
I'm not oily anymore I don't have
combination skin anymore so for me
personally I just don't feel like this
is going to work for me I have heard
that the new chart foundation stick is
really great for dry skin I have also
heard that the Make Up For Ever one is
great for dry skin but make up forever
tests on animals I might go ahead and
try out see what's the other one I just
said lb charts one we'll see but I don't
know I just feel like six foundations in
general tend to be a little more on the
drying side if you do have more oily or
combination skin a few is cruelty free
I'm sure would be a good one to try out
but for me I just get the feeling that
I'm not going to need this in my
collection next we do have the Too Faced
clover palette so you guys I have to say
these colors are really really drawing
at me and I recently talked about how
I'm not going to be getting that the
white chocolate bar palette the shades
in there just look so sloppy
like they just toss them together and
they were like life is so real these
days in you know like a two-year-old put
the palette together really not
interested in that but this one really
does have some beautiful colors now I
have
specific reason for not wanting to
purchase this and some people are not
going to agree with me but I just have
to say it so a lot of the proceeds or
there's claiming a lot of the proceeds
are going into an animal charity
I would rather choose my own money and
put it to an animal charity or just to a
animal fundraising whatever in general
because then I know where my money is
actually going if you didn't know
two-face was recently bought out within
the last year by Estee Lauder Estee
Lauder is their parent company they do
tests on animals and when you are
purchasing from these brands sometimes
the money goes up to the parent company
I do not trust that these proceeds are
going to go to a charity and I also kind
of disgust me again very very personal
but it kind of is strange to me that
they would talk about donating when
their parent company tests on animals so
that is why I'm not going to purchase
this at Allis I know that that is very
nitpicky but it's just how I feel so
yeah I'm going to be passing on the
clover pellet I think it looks beautiful
and if the formula is the same as a
chocolate bar palette I mean I would say
go for us but for me I'm going to be
passing alright next we do have the
violet sauce Nicole Concilio a pallet so
this looks just like pretty much every
other violet box palette out there I do
like Nicole concealer I think she's very
good at makeup I haven't watched too
many of her videos but I do follow her
on Instagram the shades in here are just
so incredibly basic they remind me a lot
of the Laura Lee palette I own the Laura
Lee palette I own the Holy Grail I own
the dredge metal and I also do have a
ride-or-die the ride or die is basically
the epitome of all of the what is it
called Vilas Palace combined in one so I
don't feel like I need shades like this
also you know those two top rows right
there with the really really oranjee
warm tones not really feeling that I
recently got the yes please palette from
colour-pop occult or row is just
completely I don't know it's like out of
character so this palette it just seems
like there's a lot of like cooler tones
there a lot of topi colors which again
we've seen that in so many different
palettes and then the bottom row you
have those kind of Goldy yellow shades
which are very interesting a bright blue
and then a black and is just not calling
to me I feel like I have towels like
this in my collection I'm sure you do as
well
alright guys and finally we have
anastasia beverly hills new matha
lipstick like I said I'm huge fan of
Anasazi of Beverly Hills but I feel like
a matte lipstick in the bullet form are
not really in right now and you guys
know what I mean I feel like metallic
lips are kind of in there's more like
literary stuff going on liquid lipsticks
are kind of facing out in my opinion but
yeah I'm not a huge fan of matte
lipsticks I am someone who likes a very
very comfortable lip product so I always
go for statins the only like matte
lipsticks I really enjoy are the
colour-pop lippie stix in the matte
formula I'm sure that these are
beautiful the color selection does not
want like Milani has products like this
I feel like you know what's the other
drugstore brand I'm thinking of as a
covergirl my covergirl Maybelline
Maybelline has a huge selection of mass
nude lipsticks that are like this as
well so for me I'm just going to go
ahead and pass on these they really
aren't calling my name like I said I'm
not much of a lip kind of person but a
lot of people were asking about those so
anyway guys not a vision for my July
2017 anti haul and hope you enjoyed this
video thank you for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
