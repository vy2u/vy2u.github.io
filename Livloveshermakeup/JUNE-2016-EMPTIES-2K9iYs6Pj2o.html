thank you so much for joining me in
today's video I have my June 2016
empties to share with you guys so if you
are interested in seeing the products
that I used up this month and else have
some of the products that Tom used up
then please keep on watching alright so
the first three items I used up a war a
makeup removing wipes so the first one
was deeper to these peach and willow
bark exfoliating facial cleansing
towelettes these are ninety nine point
two percent natural and this is what
they look like they smell really really
good like real peach oh well so good I
really did like these a lot they have
willow bark extract in them so that's
just a fancy term for sell Cilic acid I
thought that they really remove swatches
nicely and I didn't try using them on my
face I'm not really using makeup
removing wipes anymore for my face but
they did remove squatches nicely and I
would repurchase all right Venus a
little path of but what are these games
oh yeah clothing wise I'm already out of
it the best little pack of cleansing
wipes that I went through where the yes
to blueberries age refresh cleansing
facial wipes these are ninety-six
percent in natural and I did not like
these i would not repurchase i tried
them on my face they left my face very
very greasy and they left my hands crazy
after using them for swatches so would
not repurchase those these I would
repurchase for sure these are the
Garnier skin acted clean plus purifying
oil-free cleansing towelettes with
charcoal it removes oil and mattifies
the skin and instantly draws out dirt
oil and makeup but these were nice for
removing makeup but I usually just use
them for cleansing my face really
quickly in the morning they are very
very comparable to the oly henriksen
grease relief cleansing cloth so I
really really like these a lot and I
definitely will repurchase alright we
burned through some candles so first is
the three wit Campbell from Bath and
Body Works in the jobs of page sent
honey so there is the georgia peach sent
it smells really really good a very very
like artificial like artificial peach
scent but kind of like those little what
are they called um you know those little
like peach rings the candies that's what
this smells like it says there's nothing
sweeter than a blend of jobs peaches
Dewey pedals and a hint of creamy
vanilla so I did like this I purchased
that every spring I won't push it again
during the summer
because after a while the scent does
start to give me a little bit of a
headache but I do barges that every
spring and I will get it next year all
right so we also worked through the
Waikiki Beach coconut through a candle I
did not like the first of all the color
of this candle it's like a bright like
vomit green color haha I did not like
the color and I did not really like the
scent at all it did smell better once he
started burning in and it kind of like
warmed up a little bit but it says dream
up a Hawaiian beach escape with the
fragrance of fresh coconut saltwater
breezes and Sun bleached woods Sun
bleached ya some bleach woods didn't
really like this probably would not
repurchase we also went through another
job ship each candle I can't say it just
a normal way okay fine georgia peach
candle and then we also went through
another one of those green candles but
we'll get to it in a second alright so
the next item IQ step was the carne scan
active micellar cleansing water this is
the waterproof version I would not be
purchased this for my combo to oily skin
if you do have combo or oily skin get
the pink cat version this one will just
leave residue on your face it's not nice
if you do have dry skin however or aging
skin you probably would like the blue
cat version so yeah I would not
personally repurchase alright an item i
also would not be purchased is thee what
is this oh yeah so the glory the
award-winning smoothie star oat sugar
and shape breakfast scrubs so the reason
i would not be purchased this is not
because of the scent because it smelled
really really good it was the
formulation it was nothing like the
normal formulation like their flake away
scrub it was really really kind of weird
it had like a gel consistency but every
time i would start rubbing it on my body
most of the product would just fall off
and just to go right down the drain so i
felt like i was wasting product and yeah
i would just purchase the flake away
scrub next time so well not repurchase
that we went through some deep cleansing
hand soaps as always watermelon lemonade
which is a juicy blend of watermelon and
sweet Meyer lemon these are all from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works we would repurchase
this scent for the kitchen we would also
repurchase the island margarita this is
the blend of a mandarin line and white
nectarine again these are all from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works this one smells amazing
love that scent
and we would also repurchase sun-ripened
raspberry but probably not until next
year if they do release this particular
scent this just brought me back but this
was a blend of sun-ripened raspberries
strawberries and sugar crystals so yes
we did like that but we would definitely
repurchase the watermelon lemonade and
Island margarita right away these were
really really nice kitchen sent and they
kept these things smelling really really
fresh and clean all right another bath
and body works products that I used up
was the japanese cherry blossom bubble
bath i don't think i will repurchase
this i find that these bubble baths
don't really do much for my skin they
just make bubbles which is what they
claim to do but i really like the
aromatherapy line from Bath and Body
Works it smells really really good like
if you like a very perfumey scent and
not so much like sweet or fresh scents I
think you would like this one from Bath
and Body Works but i'm trying to get
through these particular bubble bath
because i'm just not really a fan of
them i just love those aromatherapy boys
so I probably wouldn't repurchase
alright i used up in this little first
aid beauty skin rescue deep cleanser
with red clay it says it removes excess
oils on clogs the pores and purifies the
skin and it is safe for sensitive skin
goodness that is a mouthful I really
like to just a lot it was beautiful it
was like a red gel and I feel like if
you do have oily or combo skin you would
love this it really really clears up and
can just decongest your pores are very
very nicely so I enjoyed that a lot I
have a face mask here that I used up all
my brothers like hair all over those
disgusting this is the Olay henriksen
truth sugar glow polishing mask it
deeply cleanses smooth and brightens the
skin with sugar honey and vitamin C i
would definitely repurchase this i'm a
huge fan of the truth line I love this
particular product from oly henriksen
and also the truth serum it smells
really good like orange creamsicle I did
feel like it brightened my skin it
definitely exfoliated had nice big
chunks of sugar in there I don't feel
like it fell off my face that although
which was nice because it did have honey
in there which kind of held everything
together but really really beautiful
products and I definitely would
repurchase alright we also burned
through the Tiki Bengal might I three
wood candle from Bath and Body Works
this smelled orgasmic we would
definitely repurchase this oh my god it
smells so good it says drink in a
tropical blend of May
nectar jasmine flower and Sunkist
grapefruit now who wants to Hoonah so
yeah really really like this scent where
do we have this I think we had this in
the guest bathroom it's just smells so
freakin good i ended up bringing it into
the beauty room at some point because i
was like ah it's not so good all right
another about the Bodyworks product if
you couldn't know i love bath and body
works I used of the bath and body works
aromatherapy stress relief eucalyptus
tangerine body wash and film bath so
these are the bubble baths that I like
these ones or the luxury bath so this
was a really nice blend of eucalyptus
and tangerine you would think that that
scent would be kind of strange and off
but it actually smelled really really
good and I did like it I wouldn't it
wouldn't be like the first sense that I
would repurchase from the aromatherapy
line I really prefer like the sandalwood
rose or the milk and honey bath but this
one is quite nice and energizing so I do
like it and i would consider be
purchasing i also used up another pack
of makeup removing wipes for swatches
these are the yes to cucumbers soothing
hypoallergenic facial wipes these burn
if i use them on my face but again i'm
trying to get away from using facial
wipes on my face because I pull so
freaking hard at my face and my skin so
it's just a no-no for me I'm better I'm
using oil to remove my makeup but I did
like these for removing swatches they
smell really good they're kind of
cooling and also they are nice to carry
in your purse during the summer time
just to wipe your body down quickly if
you're on you know an oily beast like I
am alright moving on Tom used up the
bath and body works aromatherapy stress
relief eucalyptus spearmint hand soap he
loves this particular hand soap say yes
we would repurchase I used up with the
origins by all greens foaming deep
cleansing mask with great tea spirulina
and spinach I love to this a lot this
was beautiful it is a two in one product
so you can actually use it to deeply
cleanse your face like as an actual
cleanser or you can use it as a foaming
mask leave it on for a few minutes let
it kind of eat away at the top layer of
your skin and then you wash it off I
really really enjoyed using it as a
cleanser I would say I've used it like
the first half of it I used it as a mask
and then the second half I used it as a
cleanser for like those days where I
really needed an extra cleanse like to
get my makeup off so this was really
lovely and I definitely would repurchase
alright i used up these sephora dry
clean instant dry brush cleaner spray i
did not like this it has way too
overpowering of a scent and i'm a girl
who can handle a lot of
and so that was kind of like shocking
huh that was kind of shocking how
horrible this smell it was just super
overpowering but it does clean your
brushes very very well very very quickly
but really only I brushes not so much
face brushes or like foundation brushes
but yeah it was pretty good but I would
not repurchase because of the scent all
right I've used up these simple micellar
cleansing water this is my all-time
favorite micellar water I would
definitely definitely repurchase i love
that i also used up the soap and glory
hand food hat hydrating hand cream this
was just the little one I carried this
in my purse it's a lovely lovely scent
this is the original pink scent from
bath and body works I'm sorry from soap
&amp;amp; Glory I really really love this scent
it's like a little bit of citrus and
bergamot it smells so damn good and it's
the same scent as clean on me if you
guys are curious so I would repurchase I
used up the herbivore Rose hibiscus
coconut water hydrating face mist I
would not repurchase this I whipped up
the ingredients list this thing is can
click filled with alcohol I cannot
believe the first of all herbivores
supposed to be a very like natural brand
but second of all the fact that this is
supposed to be a hydrating facial mist
and they fill it with alcohol which will
dehydrate your skin I think that's so
stupid so anyway I would not repurchase
this it was ok it smelled okay I did
feel like it gave a little bit of
moisture to my skin but over time if
you're using something that has alcohol
in it it's not going to hydrate your
skin so I would personally not
repurchase this and it was quite
expensive it was like almost forty
dollars so not worth it in my opinion i
also used up these spritz breathe deeply
spray now this one I really really liked
I don't know if I would repurchase it I
love really invigorating sort of
feelings on my skin and on my scalp and
everywhere on my body anything tingly
and minty I love however peppermint oil
especially when you're spraying it on
your face is technically a skin irritant
so I know that this is not the best for
my skin but I loved the way it felt on
my skin so I did use this like the ER
before 12 set in my skin care I probably
would repurchase if I got the chance I
don't know I got this in my popsugar
must have box so i don't know where i
can actually purchase it but it was
really nice and invigorating all right
speaking of invigorating i used up the
two and nioxin cleansers and scalp
therapy conditioners this is the normal
too thin looking chemically treated
shampoo and conditioner this is the
number three I got these and I believe
my glossybox last month I love these
again it's just like the tingly thing i
really like eucalyptus and mint and
rosemary mint and all that kind of stuff
that's what these feel like they tingle
on your scalp if you do have really kind
of oily scalp like I do and he just
can't be bothered to really really like
wash your hair like every single day and
then I think you would absolutely love
these and they just feel really really
nice on the scalp really really
cleansing I don't know if I would
purchase the conditioner but I would
definitely get a full size of the
cleanser or the shampoo alright moving
on I brunch through the rainforest
gardenia three wit candle this burn
really like shittily Cheveley that's a
new work we're creating it this really
did burn well as you can see there's
soot everywhere this was in the back of
the beauty room right there where I now
have that little candle on the pedestal
because I'm waiting for my 3 wood
Campbell's to get here but anyway
rainforest gardenia was a blend of let's
see here fresh bamboo sweet apple water
and gardenia it smells really good it's
starting to give me a little bit of a
headache after a while I'm in a very
kind of tightly closed small room and I
do film with the door closed so that you
guys don't see Tom walking back and
forth um so yeah I don't think I would
repurchase this just because after a
while it just got a little overpowering
in this particular room and I'll so this
Campbell really did not burn well and
sometimes that happens with three with
candles from Bath and Body Works it's
quite annoying because sometimes they're
really good and sometimes they really
don't burn well but yeah that one I
don't know if I would not just me
alright we used up a bath and Bodyworks
little G whoa this is the wallflower
refills this does the beautiful day sent
this scent is amazing I had this in the
beauty room I still do have it in the
beauty room it smells like freshness and
apples and happy day and beautiful day
and yay I just wanted I don't believe in
purchase we also used up this little
wildflower do this is the vanilla
coconut wallflower home fragrance
refills coconut vanilla is just a
beautiful scent especially during the
summertime if you want something that's
like warm like we had this in the living
room you want something warm and
inviting but a little bit tropical
the coconut and there is really nice so
we would repurchase these as well I
haste up this little foot therapy mask
this is awesome i love this i can't
remember where I got this I actually
think it was my popsugar must have box
from last month as well you leave this
on for one and a half hours or two hours
on your feet it is a little weird
because it's like these strange little
boobies that you put on and you kind of
slip and slide around so I highly
recommend putting on your slippers or
something like over these so that you're
not slipping and sliding all over the
floor but it was really nice I believe
that they had chemical and it's like
exfoliating properties in there yeah it
says an intense soothing treatment of
botanical extracts to exfoliate and
repair stressed feet it really made my
feet that were sore field really really
nice and also it helped with like a skin
peeling on my feet like it made it my
feet shed basically which sounds gross
but it was good in long run alright so
the next item I used up with the tony
moly a brightening hand cream this is
the tangerine one I love this I'm
probably going to keep this packaging so
I should put it there my only complaint
with that is that you no longer can get
that in the US or on the sephora.com
website they tony moly hand creams are
my all time favorite hand creams beep
each one the apple one and that one so
I'm like where the hell can I get the
 not because that's just upsetting
alright here's the other Waikiki Beach
coconut tree wit candles that we burnt
through it just kind of smells like poo
I don't recommend I don't like that not
at all it was just a very nauseating
kind of to coconutty of a cent all right
we did burn through a mahogany coconut
candle oh my god this one oh my god this
smells so good you guys so this is
mahogany coconut if you like the scent
of what is it just be a regular like
mahogany teak that sent you would love
this if you find mahogany teak wood
slightly overpowering you would love
this because it's a little more neutral
and laid back so it is a sophisticated
blend of rare mahogany and creamy
coconut milk layered over soft sand the
wood it just smells amazing we had this
in the bedroom because i wanted a unisex
scent in there and it just smelled great
Tom really liked it a lot too so yes
we're all about that life alright so the
next item we used up where these
snuggles scent boosters or i should say
i juiced up i love these Tom cannot use
these he's very sensitive so I don't use
these for his laundry but these only
lavender joy there were 20 little packs
in here you just toss them in to make
your laundry smell good
the smell oh so good to I want a candle
in this sense seriously so good love
that all right I used up a few pocket
backs here let's see here these are just
the little ham shells from Bath and Body
Works I can never get out that tiny
little bit at the bottom it's just so
irritating can't open this thing up so I
don't know but this is the Hawaiian pink
hibiscus which looks like that and then
this one will be golden pineapple luau I
would not purchase the golden pineapple
luau again I didn't like the scent I
don't really like to send a pineapple I
like the taste but not the scent I would
repurchase the Hawaiian pink hibiscus
though that one smelled really good all
right I gives up a pack of these just 80
facial Cotton's i love these these are
amazing for removing i make up and just
like around the eye area there are a
hundred percent pure cotton so soft you
will not you will not find anything
softer honestly alright I've used up the
pixie skin treats glow tonic exfoliating
toner with five percent glycolic acid
aloe vera and ginseng I love this toner
I just wish you got more product for the
price this is let's say your 3.4 fluid
ounces and it's like twenty dollars at
target so I would repurchase but maybe
if I could get like buy one get one
fifty percent off all right I used up a
tiny little clinic happy perfume it was
all gunked up yo I think one of them one
of the hand soaps exploded but this
smells amazing it does make me happy the
scent reminds me of my grandmother I
love it alright i used up an elf tone
correcting powder and cool these are my
go-to ride or dies love those i also
used up in essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder this does another ride or
die powder of mine just love the two of
those I burned through Fiji white sands

mccampbell from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works the
smelt so good i have already repurchase
it just smells amazing and this is let's
see here a blend of fresh-cut sugarcane
white nectarine and sundridge samba
would so really really like that sent if
you are into be more like warm sense
during the summertime you would love
that all right tada used up Dakota Levi
no source creme sorbet moisturizing
sorbet for the face I got this in a
little coat Elise at I did not
get on my skin at all I didn't feel like

weird funky smell I was not into it but

liked it and he really really loves the
Kota Leibrandt like he has so many
products from that mAb that he's been
collecting which is so cute so where he

right I used up in the dr brandt poor
dermabrasion poor perfecting exfoliator
i did not like this at all I included
this in my fails and holy grails i
believe last week i really liked the
consistency i felt like a really
microderm to my face but it had just the
weirdest um like residues left a residue
on my face and I don't think that's cool
so I did not like that would not
repurchase I've used upbeat buck sinful
and fabulous mascara this was just okay
not my favorite let me show you guys the
wand I can't get it I can't open it
anyway it has a rubber bristle brush and
it's kind of like really really spiky

little fatter I don't know it didn't do
much for my lashes would not repurchase
I've used up two lip balms from the
josie maran line these are the argon
palms and i like to use them as lip
balms if you guys are curious as to how
i go through lip balm so quickly i'm a
flutist so i'm applying lip balm all the
time so this was the sweet citrus scent

last empties video as well it's just a
little too much for my skin during the
