to my channel and welcome to you of my
second ever anti home I'm so excited to
share with you guys today some shit I'm
just not going to buy and some stuff
that I really feel as if you probably
don't need to buy it you have an
extensive of the collection as a makeup
collection or skincare or whatever
collection as I do I really feel like a
lot of the stuff you're probably not
going to need so let me go ahead and
talk you out of it so the first couple
items I want to talk about are and new
eyeshadow palettes that are on the
market the first three specifically all
kind of tying in to the same warm toned
category or family the first one is the
Natasha to Nona sunset palette this is a
hundred and twenty nine fucking dollars
no no okay I don't think I've ever spent
over a hundred dollars on an eyeshadow
palette in fact I don't think I've ever
spent over seventy dollars on an
eyeshadow palette I refuse I absolutely
refuse to spend 129 dollars on an
eyeshadow palette it cannot be that good
okay and I am The Queen okay I'm the
Queen to find my full collections
recently I just bought B does a light
chaser highlighter is about all six of
them it came up with a few hundred nine
dollars but that was for six fucking
products okay one palette for $129 if
you can justify that that is absolutely
fantastic
just because you want it or you're going
to get at does not mean I'm saying I
fucking hate you I'm saying I fucking
hate the price on this I think that's
ridiculous $129 no way I recently saw
two videos this morning in my feed that
came up a lot you are recommending that
I start checking out casting life videos
a little more so I subscribe to her as
well as J kisses they both do
comparisons against the new color
palette reverses the sunset palette I
would highly recommend you guys go check
out those videos because I really don't
think it is necessary to spend $129 on a
palette so that is why I will not be
purchasing the Natasha Genoa sunset
palette alright next we have the urban
decay and naked heat palette falls into
the same sort of category of those nice
of warm toned beautiful rich almost
berry colors now the reason why I'm not
getting this even though it's been so
hyped up is first of all I am NOT a fan
of it be naked formula I did not like my
naked one I did not like my naked - you
in mind 83 or my smoked palette whatever
it was called
I do want like the Naked basics palette
I like the formula on been matte shadows
the urban decay does create but there
shimmer shades the ones that have a
little more like a litter and then I'm
so not into it so I knew immediately I'm
not just going to buy this palette just
to review it or throw up a first
impression for you guys I already knew I
wasn't going to like the formula on a
lot of these shades and honestly when
you look at these particular colors go
ahead and pick out your you know Julia's
placed palettes and masquerade palette
looks like that lower right-hand
quadrant with all those nice warm tone
colors go ahead and look at the nubian
palette even have that nice kind of
berry color in there
you know you're picking butter
Renaissance palette you guys we already
have colors like this in our collection
there's absolutely no need for you to go
and pick up the naked heat palette if
you already have the modern Renaissance
you absolutely don't need it in my
opinion so that is why I will not be
picking it up I just feel like this warm
tone trend is already something is that
the makeup world has experienced and I
honestly just don't think it's necessary
in my collection and honestly if you
have a big collection like I do it's
probably not necessary indoors either
alright moving on we have the new to
beach palette from the balm cosmetics
again those warm toned colors again to
face coming up with the peaches and
cream a warm toned matte palette I'm
like we've already seen this before it's
not anything new it's not anything
special if you don't have any sort of
berry toned eyeshadows in your
collection go into your blush drawer jig
add some blushes take a look at some of
the blushes you have and guess what you
did on your eyes it's really not that
difficult you already probably have
colors like that in your collection I
understand that this one does have a
little more topi colors as well but come
on any kind of palette that you probably
have in your collection has topi colors
I don't think this is necessary and on
top of that I'm not a huge fan of the
balms eyeshadows there Tallis I find are
very firmly pressed some of them are a
little more on the chalky side and
they're a little harder to work with so
that is why I'm not going to purchase it
if you are that's totally wonderful
again nothing I hate you I'm just saying
I don't want apply I don't want to buy
the shit you know what I mean so that is
why I won't be buying those first three
pallets just because I feel like they
look really similar I already have
colors like that in my collection I
don't need them alright next we have B
cap on the shade and light glimmer
shimmer and fucking glitter palette okay
when I look at this and you guys can see
the squashes right here by the way all
the photos I'm showing are from Sophie
or trendy mood ones Instagram I could
get permission to go ahead and use these
photos in this particular video but I'm
looking at this palette and I'm like
okay it's a neutral palette that's great
I love Kat Von D I like her ethics I
like the way that her brand works but I
have to say there are way too many
colors in here looking on my phone by
the way way too many colors that look
like they have chunky glitter in there I
fucking hate glitter in my eyeshadows I
am NOT a fan I don't think it works very
well they're very very difficult to
blend out I don't care if it's from Too
Faced a therapist from Kat Von D cap on
D is notorious for having a little more
firmly pressed shadows in the first
place unless they are for what is it
that really is smooth creamy can't
remember the thunderstruck formula
that's an actual state okay remember
what they're called but she has this
really nice foil formula but her mass
and her kind of glitter shades are kind
of notorious for being a little more
firmly press I have tried enough Kat Von
D eyeshadow palettes to know that and
I'm just looking at this and I'm
thinking there's way too much glitter I
already see probably three or four
shades that are straight-up glitter and
I know I'm not going to use those so I'm
going to pass on this one I think the
colors do look really nice it looks like
every other neutral palette out there I
think if you have the original shade +
light um you probably don't need this
unless you really really want something
that's a little more foiled or something
that has a little more glitter in it but
for me personally I got rid of my shade
and light palette I felt like those were
very chalky not easy to work with I'm
better matte pellets in my collection so
yeah it's going to go ahead and pass on
that alright and finally we have these
new at Sephora Pro eyeshadow palette
these are outrageously expensive I can
be there at like in the 60 or $70 range
which is kind of fucking crazy for
Sephora collection like come on now now
to be completely honest I'm really
interested in this
I'm really interested in these but
unfortunately the Sephora collection
does test on animals if they didn't I
probably would scoop one of these up
even though they're outrageously pricey
that really warm toned one with like the
yellows in there you guys can see I feel
like that looks so similar to again
those first three palettes that I talked
about probably not necessary in your
particular collection or mine if you
have a large one like IQ the colorful
palette again I feel like I have one
going to be applies palettes on I'll
need that and then those cool tone
shades those are the ones that are
calling to me so although you know the
support collection does test on animals
if they didn't this would probably be
something that I would pick up at that
cool tone palette because I think it
looks really pretty I actually really
like the Sephora collection they have
some wonderful on skincare products so
not going
here and kind of wrote that because
honestly that was something I was
interested in but unfortunately thank
you tests on animals all right next we
have the new an ARS massive foundation
sticks so I would get these but NARS now
just one animal again they're going to
be settling it back in China or there's
some sort of thing I'm going to go ahead
and link down below the whole article
from logical harmony so you guys can go
ahead and read on it but they are no
longer cruelty free is so disappointing
it is so fucking disappointing for a
high-end brand like that especially one
that has promoted before hey we're
cruelty free we love animals blah blah
blah and then they go and they start
doing that I think that is incredibly
disappointing and I know a lot of people
sit there and they say don't fight fire
with fire I think Jake kids have said
that and she is much sweeter than I am
because of sucked then I went and do I
wrote on guards of frickin Instagram I
said shame on you okay I'm not going to
go and say please become cruelty-free
again I just said fuck you in a shame on
you that is disgusting I just think it's
really really horrible that they did
that and I cannot believe that they are
going to be testing on animals and I
just think that's fucking disgusting and
hideous it's wet and wild which is a
small drugstore brand is they don't have
to test on animals why do you why do you
you got greedy and it's disgusting and
I'm sorry I just think that's a really
really horrible horrible behavior but
anyway these foundations stick I would
have probably picked this up but then
the culture that I look at it I don't if
you guys can tell but the other dual
size you have this foundation and then
on the other side you actually have a
little sponge I don't like that I don't
like that I usually don't like when
there are sponges attached to my makeup
unless I put it there you don't have it
or like I'm using a CEO beauty blender
that I can clean I feel like that's a
very messy the only time that I have
ever liked that is when I've used the
age rewind that make me an H or wine
instant aged concealer or whatever is
called but yet oh we're all not really
interested in that I don't think it
looks that great and like i said nards
we're going to be testing on antelope
again so that's just disgusting alright
moving on we have the two mate hangover
RX three-in-one replenishing a primer
and setting spray I will be doing a
makeup ropes yes they make up a roast on
the two phase sweet peaches not fucking
sweet peaches punch of peach okay on the
peaches and cream collection I'm not
going to be buying any
that I'm going to roast it and we're
going to talk about why you probably
don't need it as well but this was just
something that initially kind of called
out to me and then I realized it's
probably just like a fad you know what I
mean I'm just looking at it I'm like I
don't need this I feel like a lot of
settings phrase do actually work but
there are a lot out there that also just
don't work and this just being totally
gimmicky to me like they're just trying
to push me hangover RX line I love the
primer I'm not going to sit here and say
Jones because it's fantastic it's a very
good primer a lot of people say it's
nothing more than a lightweight
moisturizer I really like it is
something I would continue to purchase
but this just looks stupid to me and
honestly I feel like there are better
setting sprays out there alright next we
have the Smashbox photo finish primer a
riser primer eyes I would say that rate
it sounds like Weber rhymer or Weimer
remar you know those little silver
beautiful dogs Weimaraners yeah that's
what this reminds me of so anyway this
is the photo finish primer riser
it is a primer plus moisturizer in one
seriously there's no sweet spots like
they are trying so hard to be like we
started primers and they kind of fucking
did okay but at the same time like how
far you have to milk that shit the photo
finish line like I'm so over it a primer
plus moisturizer in one two sucking put
moisturizer on and then go in with the
primer you don't need this I think it's
so stupid they're just trying to be like
hey we have skincare plus primer in one
that's just so silly just use your
moisturizer edge actual primer if you
don't want to use two separate products
just go in use your voice riser use it
as your primer you do not need this I do
not need this this is just stupid and I
did like their Smashbox primer I love
their photo finish what is it not photo
photos finish yeah photo finish studying
spray I really like that I actually do
think it works but like their primer oil
all those kind of stuff I was kind of
like is that necessary is that necessary
I kind of feel like it's not and this
just seems really stupid to me so yes
not going to be purchasing that this we
have the towards rainforest of the
Syrians to drops these are $32 you get
one ounce of product here and I actually
really wanted these at first because I
was like only Nestle they're so
beautiful look at that beautiful little
packaging just wondering it okay so cute
I'm not going to be getting these it
because I saw foods to watch it and it
literally just looks like oil with
little tiny glitters infused in it and I
was look
fuck at that time what so fug is that
I've been trying to be better with tart
lately um just because I feel like you
know I kind of hate on them sometimes
which I feel like the hate is dessert
okay sometimes they don't come out with
good products but this I was like oh
should I get it should I get it and then
I saw the swatches and I was like what
you said just use an oil and drop it
into your foundation
I guess doesn't have to be the freaking
photo finish Smashbox oil for 65
whatever amount of money it is you just
need to get some sort of an oil you can
go and put a little coconut oil in you
can drop some rosehip seed oil and you
can get oils like cold press wonderful
oils for like six dollars you don't need
something like this for 36 or 32 when
you don't we don't need the photo finish
primer oil you guys know what I mean it
just seems so silly like they're really
trying to milk anything that they kind
of I also saw Urban Decay release like
that oral liquid whatever else it kind
of such bullshit okay just if you want
to be a little more glowy at an actual
oil and cure foundation we are going to
be skipping on masks and finally guys we
have the kkw beauty contour sticks the
busted-ass contour sticks that fall
apart on fucking camera yeah I'm not
getting these I talked about it in my
last anti haul I do not support the
Kardashians I will not give them money I
know that this particular set or kit or
whatever sold out and I want to say 30
seconds and they made like 14 million
dollars it's bullshit and no not she
wants they're not sitting here like oh
my god how dare they have all that money
um I just I just can't support their
family I don't like what they do I don't
like their thing and I don't want to get
too much into that it's not about that
what I want to talk about is the actual
makeup it looks like his makeup it looks
like child makeup it looks stupid the
double-ended
sponge and brush it looks super super
cheap but that brush looks extremely
scratchy to me some double and a sponge
on the other side again I don't like
when those little sponges are attached
to something and you can't really wash
it well but that's no and then I've seen
that three different videos where the
fucking stick broke off on their face
and I was like are you fucking kidding
me
are you kidding me Kim Kardashian so
yeah I'll know won't people are testing
that would not recommend you guys
purchase that if you love the
Kardashians
support them a different way like this
is just not the way to do it putting
more money in their pockets is not the
way to do it and I
I just this really doesn't look good so
the color selection looks a little
strange like some of the contouring
shade looks nice like they wanted to
really deep skin tones which i think is
fantastic but some of the highlighting
shades looks very strange like a silvery
color when was I almost like a mustard
color but I have like a weird shift to
it I don't know some of those just
looked a little weird to me and I'm
definitely not going to be purchasing so
I hope you guys enjoyed this anti haul
making so much for joining me I'm sorry
I'm running out of breath it's so
freaking hot here it's like a hundred
and thirteen degrees today but I hope
you enjoyed this video as always I guess
I'm looking good too bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
