thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be my November 2016
unboxings part 2 so this is going to be
unboxing by a boxy charm for November
2016 and also my Sephora play box so i
did already a peek inside my sephora
play sephora play is probably my third
favorite subscription bag or box that i
get every single month i will go ahead
in link part 1 of my unboxings that i
did a week ago down below in the
description bar I did if see also
GlossyBox and popsugar must have galazi
box is definitely my top favorite
subscription box i would say right below
that is pop sugar and then sephora play
so the first item that we did get that i
already put on my wrist is the replica
perfume this is what it looks like this
is a very very interesting sent you guys
I don't know if I really like it I think
that it kind of changes when you first
spray it on it spells it smells more it
smells like it smells more spicy but now
that I'm smelling it it smells just very
powdery not really my kind of perfume so
that is the first item the second item
that we got is the coda Levi no source
creme sorbet so I have tried this before
I actually had a full size I did not
really like this I was not the biggest
fan so I probably will just go ahead and
declutter that we also have the glam
glow a thirsty med hydrating treatment
which you guys know I'm a huge fan of
glam glow and I love all of their masks
so I'm very happy to have gotten that
and then also this little Sephora
collection lip gloss this looks actually
really interesting it is the ultra shine
lip gel I'm super excited to try it out
it is a beautiful beautiful kind of
fuchsia pink color and I really like
these two for a collection products so I
am excited to try that out and then we
also have this little cover FX
illuminating primer I feel like I got
the dry skin box which would make sense
because my combo skin gets very dry
during the wintertime but i think that i
saw a few people on box and they've got
more of like an oily skin box i'm glad
that i so far actively listen to my
little profile when I said that I get
very dry during the wintertime so yeah
this is an illuminating primer from
cover FX and i have heard really good
things about that and the final item
that we have is the laura mercier caviar
stick I color in the shade rose gold and
I have heard that these I caviar sticks
are fantastic so let's go ahead and do a
little so watch your ooh oh my god it's
like butter it's like butter you guys
look at that isn't that a beautiful
beautiful color
looks like it's more of like a soft gold
than a rose gold but I am excited to try
it out so anyway that is everything that
I got in my Sephora play for the month
and this was the little bag and this
month I think it's really cute i do like
these all right now let's go ahead and
jump into boxy charm I have not even
peeked in this one yet so let's go ahead
and do it alright so here is the little
card that we get and it says guru b-town
let's take us to groovy town I don't
really like that theme but that's okay
so the first item we have here is in a
plastic a bubble wrap let's see here
this appears to be a vintage Jessica
Leiper skin illuminating face high layer
I've never heard of this brand but very
cute packaging as you guys can see let's
take a peek I will say there's something
about boxy charm that's just kind of
like I get very nitpicky about I'm not
quite sure if it's just like the overall
like the way the boxy charm is presented
like the black packaging with all the
black confetti on the inside I don't
know what it is it kind of makes me feel
down like oh sad like I feel like
Sephora play has all the stripes on the
packaging gets me really excited glossy
boxes in a pink box I don't know it's
just boxy charm is not very colorful I
don't know I don't know guys so this is
what the packaging looks like this is
really really beautiful you open it up
and you do have a mirror and this looks
gorgeous holy crap this is like a true
rose gold sort of highlight so and that
is what it looks like hopefully you guys
can see that that totally kind of
changes and now this is a very
interesting texture do you guys see that
so right when I dug my finger in there
it's like a very thick kind of texture
kind of reminds me of like the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills glow kids except a lot
chunkier so let's see how that actually
goes on to the skin I feel like this is
going to emphasize a lot of texture but
that's okay we will still try it out so
there is the highlight very beautiful
probably will use it more as a blush
topper but you have very very pretty
color the next item that I see in here
is from the brand skyn Iceland this is
the solutions for stressed skin this is
the relief I cream so I love when
subscription boxes do give me skincare
products i love skincare pretty much as
much as i love makeup so this is very
exciting so this is what the actual eye
cream looks like do you love a skincare
a lot and it does come with like a
little twist up applicator so you click
it and then it come
up like that at the top so i will have
to try that out and then i also got a
little brush from crown of brushes this
is like a little pencil brush on like a
liner brush so this is what it looks
like i love crown brushes they are
really really great so that is what the
little brush looks like and then i also
have a let's see here develop here kids
proof lip cream so i'm going to go ahead
and declutter this right away I'm not
someone who wears a lot of lip creams or
drying lip products but the shade is
called antique pink it is beautiful like
a perfect your lips of a better mavi
color I'm going to go ahead and
declutter that to my friend of Rochelle
Rochelle Rochelle and the final item we
have here is the studio makeup on the go
eyeshadow palette so I didn't know that
this was coming in the box because I did
see someone unbox it I try not to watch
the unboxing videos but I saw one and
this is basically like the purple e
pinky version of the palette that we got
I think two or three months ago we got
one from the same brand and I had a lot
of neutral shades in it I did hold on to
it throughout my whole declutter series
just because I hadn't tried it yet and a
lot of people were saying it's great
quality so I'm actually quite excited to
try this one out a lot of these feel
really buttery and creamy and like
foiled so I do need to go ahead and
maybe I'll use this in shot my stash
next week so I can really try it out but
there are a few swatches really really
pretty color so anyway that is
everything that I got in my box key
charm I would say for me personally
sephora play got i would say three out
of five stars this month boxy charm
definitely 4 out of 5 stars i normally
am not the biggest fan of boxy term
again I don't know if I'm just being
nitpicky and it's something about the
packaging or just the fact that a lot of
the brand's I haven't heard of I don't
know really what it is I would always
you know say go get glossybox before you
get boxee term but i think they did
really well this month so anyway that is
it i hope you guys enjoyed this video
and i will see you guys later for
another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
