welcome to a January sample spotlight
this is a new series that I am putting
together with my friend Meg Bernardo
here on YouTube
I love Meg we'd have collab before I
will link her channel below and I will
also link her instagram below so you
guys can follow her and of course I will
link her video on her sample that she
used up this month as well below so
definitely go check out her video tell
her I say hello
I love Meg I watched every single one of
her videos literally like right when it
releases she if she lives in Vietnam so
she is about 12 hours ahead of me and so
when she post her videos it's usually at
like 12 a.m. and I literally am always
the first person to watch she probably
thinks I'm a crazy stalker but I'm
constantly watching her videos I love
her personality she's very calm she's
got a wonderful demeanor and I just
really really like that I'm not one of
those people that can watch someone
that's super hyped up and bubbly like I
am because it makes me feel like out of
my skin and it's just too over-the-top
for me I just can't do it so I really
really love her personality I'm sure you
guys would love her as well and like I
said her channel and her video will be
linked below so basically the thought of
this sample spotlight is basically where
we are going to be using up five to
eight samples every single month skin
care hair care you know all that kind of
stuff fragrances whatever samples that
we have which we have a lot of but we're
just going to be using them up and
showing you guys which ones we used up
the focus is not to go and purchase a
full size of the product just to use the
samples up meg is really into using up
products this year and I am -
unfortunately I'm kind of feeling
miserably at this I really have gone and
done a lot of shopping in the past two
months but I am trying to use up certain
products this year and I also want to
use up a lot of samples so when I did my
weekly sample I did this thing called
sample week on my channel I'll list the
playlist below if you would like to see
it but basically I used up two samples
for a whole week
meg reached out to me and was like why
don't we make this into a monthly collab
we have different skin types different
skin tones different hair types it would
be fun it would be different maybe one
product that works for me doesn't work
for her or vice-versa so we thought this
would just be a really really fun thing
to do it's kind of like empties but for
samples so I'm going to show you guys
the products that I used up or the
samples that I used up for this month
now we each picked out eight for this
month however there was one that I did
not get to you I will get to this next
month
this is the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter this is the liquid form in the
shade opal I will get to that next month
but let's just get started with the ones
that I did use up so the first one I
used up was from Olay Hendrickson this
is the foaming milk cleanser it's just
the a very very gentle foaming cleanser
and I think it's quite nice I can give
you a sensitive skin you would probably
like this more than I did it just didn't
really lather up and like clear out my
t-zone the way I was like I do have
combination skin so that may be why but
it did feel nice and moisturizing on my
cheek area so that is the first sample I
used up the second one I didn't really
like this is the phyto specific this is
the thermal perfect 8 this is a sublime
smoothing care heat protecting serum I
have very very fine flat hair and this
just made my hair feel greasy and kind
of tacky I didn't like it whatsoever I
think maybe if you have thicker hair or
it may be a little more coarse hair than
I do you would like it more but it just
did not work very well for me all right
the third sample I used up I could not
help myself I did put this on my loves
list at Sephora this is the boscia
Tsubaki deep hydration sleeping mask it
is an amazing you guys it's so thick and
moisturizing it feels so beautiful
putting it on it's kind of lovely lovely
kind of whipped consistency to it it is
absolutely beautiful and my skin looked
amazing when I woke up after using this
so I did put it on my love's list I know
that we're really just trying to use
samples up not find like you know
full-size products that we want to
purchase but I could not help but this
was so amazing so I highly highly
recommend it says that it is a deeply
hydrating overnight sleeping mask that
intensely moisturizes and protects to
deliver smoother softer skin and it
definitely definitely does that so that
is the third product the fourth one I
actually used last night this is the
Olay Henriksen pure truth youth
activating oil it's got vitamin C and
omega-3 six and nine in it it is a
reparative anti-aging oil I did like
this quite a bit it definitely smells
like vitamin C like alright so citrusy
but then it also smelled a little fishy
because of the omega 3 6 &amp;amp; 9
it kind of smells like oil like if you
take fish oil capsules it kind of
smelled like that so I wasn't a huge fan
of that but I thought it was really
beautiful it smooths over my scanner
really really nicely and it did leave my
skin very soft and supple this morning
so I did enjoy that quite a bit the next
sample that I used up was from Perricone
md this is the photo plasma
broad-spectrum SPF 30 basically this is
just a sunscreen it has titanium dioxide
4.2% in it and I was a little worried at
first because any kind of natural
sunscreen is going to leave you with a
white cast even if you are espares me
it's going to leave you with a white
cast so I was a little worried but it
was tinted to a peachy kind of color so
it actually went on really really nicely
it did not leave me with a white cast
and on top of that I had a really lovely
consistency it was not greasy whatsoever
I thought it was really really lovely
the only thing I didn't like was the
scent it smelled very very chemically
chemical Lee is not a word it's not like
chemicals I did not like it it was not
that great um like as far as the scent
is concerned but I really like the
texture and also I felt like it wasn't
greasy so this is a nice one from
perricone md alright the next sample I
used up was from YSL this is their
little too chic lot pen and I used up
all three shades they had it's basically
concealer like for your under eye they
have the deep shade the medium shade and
the light shade medium and deep did not
work for me I tried using it as like a
cream contour it was just like a no-go
but the light shade was quite nice it
had a bit of a pink undertone which is
something that I like and look for when
I am using a corrector or a concealer
underneath my eyes if you guys have been
watching my channel for a while you know
that I love my Maybelline instant darker
Reysol every search circle I don't know
it was kind of all mumbled up but yeah
it's like the dark eraser like little
pen thing that you basically I put like
in the what is this called this is like
the upside down triangle area of my face
I put it like all the way down to my
nose and then up what is it called the
instant dirt eraser circle treatment
that's what it is
and I get it in the pink shade which is
the brightening version so I was really
really happy with this one I thought it
was nice but I
it was so similar to my Maybelline one
so I don't think I would ever purchase a
full-size of this but it was nice
because it did have that pink undertone
the medium shade definitely had a little
more of a yellow undertone and the deep
shade had more of an orange undertone so
I used it that up and then the last
sample that I used up was from Olli
Henriksen this is the ultimate lift eye
creme so this is the daytime eye creme I
actually wore it at night I actually
have a small level a deluxe a sample of
excuse me of the Olli Henderson ultimate
lift I'd gel and that stuff lifts my
eyes so much that like literally my top
eyelashes will get stuck up here by my
eyebrow so it really really does lift a
lot I thought this had a luxurious
beautiful beautiful formula to it I
think this one's much nicer than the eye
gel if you can get a sample of this one
definitely try it out over the eye gel
or if you get a full size I would get
this one versus the eye gel but I
thought it was really fantastic and it
says yeah just Pat around the orbital
bone I was really really nice it has
like aloe vera in it hyaluronic acid
just some really really good ingredients
and it was a very very lovely so those
are all the samples that I used up
before January sample spotlight with Meg
