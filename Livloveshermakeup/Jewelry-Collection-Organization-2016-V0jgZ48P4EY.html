hope you are all having a fantastic day
I'm super excited for today's video I
won't be on camera obviously because I'm
showing you guys another part of my
collection so if you saw my Beauty room
tour video slash reveal for 2016 you
would have seen my jewelry collection I
love this area in my beauty room it is
one of my favorites it is basically the
backdrop of my videos along with of
course my three little princesses I just
want to touch on those really really
quickly because one of the most
frequently asked questions that I get is
where did I get those so I got these at
Target for $30 you can also get them at
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond for $20 or you can get
them at t.j.maxx for like $15.99 apiece
so anyway um like I said this is one of
my favorite areas just because it is the
backdrop for my videos I love it and I
just think jewelry is so pretty so let's
go ahead and get into it I'm going to
kind of show you guys around so if you
saw the Beauty room tour you probably
saw that this is a little desk drawer
and it does open up like this I will
leave links for everything down below
anything that's featured on this table
that I can find of course I will link
down below but in here is just some
stuff I mean I don't know if people
would like this kind of stuff but I
collect a little mask like this I
believe this one was from Venice this
one's from Florence and then I got that
one in Rome um I can't remember I got
that one was somewhere in Italy as well
and my kitty had her little paw print
taken before she passed away and then I
just have some random little bits of
like jewelry pieces like this little
haired piece and my grandmother gave me
this beautiful beautiful gold brooch
before she died and just some of those
tiny things like that that I just store
in there that didn't really fit
elsewhere this is super cute too it's
like a little terrarium Tora Rome
terrariums terrarium you guys carry on
you know what I'm trying to say alright
so it's starting over here again if you
watched my Beauty room tour you would
know that this is my urn for my cat yes
some people might find this creepy but I
loved her a lot my cat Lily died in
September so this is her little earned
her
are in here and then over here I just
have this little thing of earrings I got
this from my pop sugar must-have box and
I just left a little glass bottle and
everything was so cute that I didn't
want to put it on the earring stand yet
I just think it's so so cute little EXO
kiss it's from kiss nations little
earrings this little guy here this is a
little bunny rabbit and his ears
obviously hold rings which i think is
adorable all of these rings are from
forever 21 if you are curious every
single one of them I get most of my
jewelry from forever 21 I don't spend a
lot of money on my jewelry I really like
costume jewelry and I'll kind of talk
about where I got things certain pieces
but every single ring I'm here is from
forever 21 but this little guy actually
got him at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and he's
really cute I think he's like sterling
silver and he holds my rings beautifully
so I love him this little thing right
here I really enjoy a lot as well let me
move this you guys can see I think it's
so beautiful it's more elastic acrylic
containers but it's super pretty because
it stores like your little tiny
necklaces that can get really really
tangled up easily and I love it because
it keeps them nice and neat and I love
that you can open it from the top I
think that that is like so pretty of
course I can't see what I'm doing anyway
I think it's really really pretty and
most of the necklaces in here um that
purple one I got from Etsy but most the
other ones are all from forever 21
actually now that I think about it yep
all of them are from forever 21 but
those are just for little tiny delicate
necklaces and I thought they were so so
cute and of course I don't think like
all of these pieces of jewelry are still
available they could be but I'm not
gonna really do direct links for the
actual jewelry but I will try and link
below if I can find something similar to
this like the little acrylic piece and
then this I got from the Container Store
I got this five years ago before I even
move to Manhattan and then before I even
moved here to Wisconsin so I really love
it it holds some of like my medium-sized
necklaces again most of these are from
forever 21 I think the only one that
isn't is this one right here and I get
asked a lot about this necklace when I
wear it it is from Charlotte Russe I got
it for $12.99 of West at 12:19 it might
have even been cheaper last season when
they were having their 50% off buy one
get one 50% off jewelry thing and then
this one right here I actually got a
Duane Reade which is like a drugstore
that's kind of cool everything else is
from forever 21 but I'd like to store on
my little medium-sized necklaces there
and then these little tea lights are
these little fairy lights I got from
Target I will link them below if I can
find them they're super cute they were I
think like maybe $15.99 for the little
set of them and they've lasted forever
none of the lights have blown out and I
think that they're just so so pretty
they're like little like lantern lights
you know so really really cute I love
those and then right here I just have a
little picture frame and I actually
spray-painted it I really wanted this
beauty room to be silver and white and
of course now there's a whole lot of
color in here but at the beginning I
wanted just silver and white and this
was actually a picture frame that has
been in my family for years and years
and years and I took it with me when I
moved to New York and it was gold and so
I left a little bit of the gold on there
but I basically spray-painted it's
silver and instead of having a picture
in there I have some earrings so these
are from forever 21 and then these ones
I got a little boutique in Soho so that
was in Manhattan obviously but anyway I
just think this is a great way like if
you don't have earring racks or things
like that or if you don't have a lot of
earrings doing something like this with
a picture frame is really really
adorable and I just think it's cute
especially for your statement earrings
the ones that you love or you reach for
the most it's nice to do that and then I
have my little three wick candle here
this is winter oh my gosh you guys I got
this like last what not even a week ago
I think I've called this like five days
ago not even maybe three days ago I love
it I remember seeing in the video I
wasn't sure about the scent but I am
totally obsessed now I'm pretty much
have already burned it through I don't
have it on right now but I always have
this lint during my videos of course any
time I'm in here but I didn't want to
for this video because when I reach back
for the earrings to show you guys I'm
scared I'll light myself on fire but
anyway on this little pedestal that I
got here this is from Bed Bath oh my
gosh I almost said Bed Bath and Beyond
Bath and Body Works and this is
beautiful it's basically like a little
so mercury glass thing and it's just a
little three wood candle stand and this
one was the shorter one they had a tall
one as well so this was actually the
short one I was debating between the big
one and the smaller one I got this on
sale during Black Friday for a great
deal you should constantly check
especially when they have
sails because all of their little
pedestals especially like this is one of
their winter ones and then it went on
sale and that's when I snatched it up so
definitely when you know the seasons are
done go and check out like their little
candle holders and their soap holders
are always on sale because then they
start coming out with like spring stuff
or whatnot so they think that nobody
would want something like this because
it's kind of wintery themed but I'm like
oh it's perfect for my baby room all
right and then over here I have this
little tree I love this I think it's so
cute I got this at Bed Bath and Beyond
and I hang kind of like I don't want to
say flimsy pieces but you know what I
mean like pieces of jewelry that are
just kind of like wispy but not really
so much so that they're like really
really small and they get tangled easily
like the ones in that little case these
ones are just kind of wispy and they
look pretty across the branches like
this I get asked a lot about this
necklace I wear this quite often it is
from forever 21 everything on here is
from forever 21 this is from Tiffany &amp;amp;
Co and then this is from forever 21 this
is has been in my family for years I
love it this little green one and my cat
used to wear this around her neck
sometimes oh my gosh it was so cute Lily
bad I miss you little sweet baby but
anyway she yeah she would sometimes wear
this it's little emerald it's just I
can't remember exactly what it is but it
is quite precious my mom always told me
to keep an eye on that one so I do love
it I think it's beautiful and I kind of
like it tangled up in that little tree
this was black and then I spray-painted
it of course that kind of mirrored
finish and if you guys are wondering um
what like spray I use to kind of
decorate this kind of stuff and how I
got it to be silver I will link that
below it's from Kryolan I believe yeah
krylon but I'll link that below but
anyway so this was black and I spray
painted it silver and I think it's super
pretty and then over here I have my
little bracelets and you can't see all
of them because some of them are heavy
and they like to tip over but these are
a little cute like I don't even know
they're like little bows
I love these a lot so the little white
one and a black one those are from
forever 21 it got those for a few
dollars apiece
this one was in a subscription box this
is from forever 21 subscription box
subscription box and that is a
just little delicate item that my mom
gave me but anyway I got this again from
the Container Store it's great it just
holds my bracelets nicely I have very
small wrists and a lot of bracelets
don't work for me so these are actually
an awesome bracelets that I own so I'm
not a huge place like bracelet girl
alright and then right here this is also
from Bath and Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond I'm
sorry they spin it up now Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond it's actually like a little like
bodice if that makes sense so it's super
super cute but I have big chunky chunky
necklaces I'm here at chunky big chunky
chunky necklaces on here I cannot say it
anyway this is from Charlotte Russe this
one's from forever 21 and then I got
this in a subscription box and then the
other two are from forever 21 as well
these are just really nice like
statement pieces they're very big
they're very chunky but they're cute and
I think they look nice when you're
wearing like an all-black top or you
know all like just a plain colored shirt
these look great so I love that and then
we are coming up on my little earring
stand so originally I was gonna put all
my big chunky ones back here and then
medium sized ones and small ones but now
I just kind of hooked them on wherever I
want to but all of these are from
forever 21 in the front these are also
all from forever 21 these are all from
forever 21 as well except for these um I
can't remember where I got these I think
it was like Brooke Brooke or something
like that I got them Black Friday
shopping and then all of these are from
forever 21 except that it has ice cream
cause those are from Claire's alright
and then I have a second rack back here
all forever 21 as well and I love these
like these ones are actually Betsey
Johnson I got those in a subscription
box let me actually move this quickly so
you guys can see this one is like a
two-part so it's kind of nice you can
move it like that but anyway I just have
some here these are all from forever 21
except for these ones these ones these
are actually emerald - these are from my
boyfriend's mom they're a good luck
they're their Jade I'm sorry they're not
emerald they are Jade and Jade is good
luck and like Chinese culture and my
boyfriend is Chinese alright and then
here we have four over 21
tassels and then these
also from forever 21 and then let's move
this a little bit as well so that we can
take a peek back here these are both
from forever 21 forever 21 421 and
forever 21 you guys can see I have a
clear obsession with forever 21
especially their earrings just their
like jewelry in general but especially
their earrings there's something about
their earrings that I just find like
work for me really really well if you
are very very sensitive sensitive so I'm
trying to put these back like with one
hand it's kind of difficult but if you
have very very sensitive ears like I
don't know a forever 21 jewelry would
work for you definitely try them out
first and don't like buy something super
pricey although honestly all of them are
not even pricey but anyway that is it
this is my jewelry collection I will
link below where you guys can find
hopefully something similar or at least
the same thing if I can't find the same
thing something simpler
too little like acrylic racks like this
the lights the desk you know things like
this I'll just link below as much as I
can again I did not purchase all of them
like this year some of these have been
with me for years these earring stands
have been with me for five plus years
that one too and that one so I may not
be able to find everything but just give
you guys an idea on how you can kind of
organize your jewelry collection area
