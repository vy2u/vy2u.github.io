last review I'm going to be doing for
you guys today is the Arkin
enlightenment luminizing veil from josie
maran it looks like this I purchased
mine for 30 dollars on the sephora
website the packaging is beautiful it's
like rose gold has her name there comes
with a nice big mirror it says shine the
light you were born to shine from Josie
which is really cute and then you get
the product that looks like this so
basically um Josie Maran is really known
for having this amazing
um liquid highlight I could never get my
hands on it it was always sold out at
Sephora and finally a few weeks ago I
found it on HauteLook
for $16 and I was like wow why is this
on HauteLook
you know that's kind of weird I found
out that it had been discontinued and
that they had put in new highlighting
products so they have a new like stick
form they have the new powder form and
then they also have a new like cream one
that I think you can just like paint on
kind of like the other one so I did
actually order the one that now is
discontinued I'm really excited to get
it like I said it will take forever to
get here because it's from hautelook but
um I did find it on there you know was
like really really cheap so um I did get
that one I guess
I'll you know take a look and see what
the comparison is because everybody is
obsessed with the old one and I just
thought well I might as well try the new
kind of highlighting products that she's
come out with so the one that really
drew me in was the aluminized veil and
it's because it's in a powder format I
really really like and prefer powder
highlighters compared to cream or you
know yeah just compared to cream or like
actual liquid products I just find that
these look more like satisfying for me
like on the skin I don't know what it is
it just sometimes if you use a cream
product it can move you know it can move
your foundation around and everything
else that you have already set on your
face so I just kind of prefer powder so
when I saw that she came out with the
powder I definitely wanted to get it
like I said I purchased this for $30 on
the sephora website it's really really
beautiful it has kind of like a golden
undertone and there's just the smallest
amount of shimmer the actual texture is
buttery buttery smooth and creamy and
that's the color and it's really
beautiful
you know it's deeper than my skin tone
which is kind of funny but it's
beautiful because it's not too golden
it's not too out there it really almost
like if you use this lightly and you
have that skin tone like around that
skin color you could probably use this
as a finishing powder I want to say so
kind of interesting I'm gonna apply a
little bit right now so you guys can see
I'm just gonna be taking up this BH
Cosmetics stippling brush I'm just
hitting it on my chin my nose and my
cheekbones and you can immediately see
the glow that it is giving to my skin
and what I really like about this glow
is that it's not like white or pink you
know it's like golden I don't want to
say golden because it's not even golden
it's just neutral it's like a neutral
golden highlight and I just think it's
so beautiful and really really natural I
really like it even on my pale skin it
still shows up just as like a sheen and
I really like it so um as you guys could
see I was blowing off my brush and
blowing off the product on here because
this does get a little bit of tick up
when you mix your brush in let me show
you guys you can see that it kind of
gets a little how do you describe that
like you know little pieces are coming
out you know like fall out basically
okay um so I do blow off on my brush of
course and then I do blow off on the
product just because it is so powdery
and I think the only reason it does that
is because it's so soft
and it's just you know how the powder is
made um the actual shimmer in here and
the sheen is so small it's not like
chunks of glitter
it doesn't feel chunky on the skin it's
easy to blend it doesn't emphasize your
pores it's like the really nice
micro-fine shimmers if that makes sense
which are my favorite hope you guys can
see that so it's really really beautiful
I would say it has silver sparkles and
then this nice just neutral gold you
know
to it and I actually think it's really
beautiful on what my skintone which is
really really fair and I think it'd be
beautiful on deeper skin tones medium
skin tones just all over like a really
really nice color to choose like like I
said I like that it's not too gold like
the mary lou manizer i like that it's
not too pink like a lot of highlighters
it's just a beautiful natural color
so anyway I'm gonna read a little bit
about what it says on the Sephora
website for you guys it says josie maran
argan enlightenment aluminized veil $30
it says a creamy highlighting powder for
the face with high-performance crystal
crystal is infused with a multicolored
luster pigments that capture and reflect
light it says sweep on a glowing look
with the silky powder formulated to
create a lit from within
radiance enriched with argan oil which
provides nourishment to the skin it's
champagne hue mirrors the natural
radiance of healthy skin the ultra
creamy powder is infused with a madonna
lily and poets narcissus Marquesas to
help brighten and sit slightly on the
skin leaving a warmth of radiance argan
enlightenment and luminizing veil is
inspired by the idea of enlightenment
it's overwhelming beauty that radiance
radiates from a person after achieving
self-acceptance and spreading the light
of compassion to others well that's a
really beautiful message but I mean I
just think it's so beautiful
um I have not tried the ambient lit
powders or whatever from uh what's it
called I'm sorry I have an itch from
hourglass however I feel like they
probably perform similar to this however
this is more of a highlight than an
all-over powder but like I said if you
do have like a skin tone that's not as
light as mine you probably could get
away with just like sweeping this over
your face at the end of your makeup
routine but anyway for me it's a great
highlight I think it's beautiful and
yeah so that was my review of the Josie
Maran Argan enlightenment illuminating
veil by the way is a Josie Maran or
Josie Maran I can never decide anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I'll
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
