thank you so much for joining me I am
here to review for you guys
a new face butter or face moisturizer
that I recently found on the sephora.com
website it is from josie maran this is
the Josie Maran whipped argan oil a face
butter this retails for $40 on the
sephora.com website it is relatively new
and I will link below where you guys can
pick it up if you are interested but I
was really really excited to see this
product to come out because it's
supposed to be very very rich and
buttery on the skin but I also like to
wait so this is what the outer box looks
like typical josie maran just kind of
like this light to beijing pink color
you can see that it is organic and it
has organic ingredients natural
ingredients its recyclable of cruelty
free vegan no synthetic favorite
fragrances it's gluten free and also
paraben free so basically she just
writes here a luxury with a conscience
so she really really does a lot of
natural products which i think is
fantastic but let me read a little bit
about what it says on these sort of
cobwebs say for you guys quickly so you
can understand what the product is about
so it says josie maran whipped argan oil
face butter $40 it is a lightweight yet
luxuriously rich and buttery face cream
for instant and abundant hydration it
says this fast absorbing face butter is
designed to sink deeply into skin
leaving it juicy glowing and hydrated
100% pure argan oil intensely nourishes
and protects skin with essential fatty
acids and vitamin E with a blend of
watermelon seed oils weight watermelon
seed oil and even no oil in it but I
guess the seed does watermelon seed oil
shea butter and fresh cucumber extract
work together to leave skin in a soft
smooth and glowing condition soothing
aloe nectar acids in helps in reducing
the appearance of redness and
inflammation which helps retain optimal
moisture levels in the skin the safe and
effective for all skin types its
unscented nutrient-rich it hydrates and
it meets the skins need needs for
deliciously smooth buttery texture every
day at night lots of words in there like
I said it
prepare ovens sulfates fatal AIDS it's
gluten-free vegan cruelty-free
dermatologist tested clinically tested
the package is completely recyclable and
then it has some research results so in
a clinical study on testers in four
weeks 100% of users showed a significant
increase increase in firmness and
hydration after just one application of
this product and 100% of users showed a
significant increase in skin barrier
function after 24 hours they also
experienced a significant improvement in
the appearance of crows feet after two
weeks and 97% of users experienced a
significant improvement in the
appearance of forehead fine lines and
facial wrinkles wrinkles wrinkles
wrinkles after two weeks so I was just a
very very excited to try this product
out I do have a lot of moisturizers from
you know josie maran in general I do
have just her regular old I don't want
to say old but you know her regular
argan oil I also have the argan oil
light and I do also have this Josie
Maran Argan infinity intensive creamy
oil and you know this and the Argan oils
in general tend to be a little greasy on
the skin even the argan oil light so I
was really really excited to try this
product out and even more excited when I
found out that the you know the way that
they describe it as being like a really
luxurious but lightweight sort of facial
moisturizer it's completely completely
true this doesn't have like any oils in
it whatsoever
I mean it doesn't have her argan oil in
it but you can't tell when you put it on
your skin so let me show you guys what
it looks like in here you guys can see
I've used quite a bit of it and it just
has this really really luxurious buttery
sort of texture to it but it's very very
blendable and it leaves absolutely no
oily residue on the skin I have
combination skin and during the winter
time my skin gets very very very dry on
like on my cheek areas and so I really
really really try and moisturize and
just be really conscious of what I'm
putting on my skin and I'm even gonna
rub this into my hands right now because
it is that lightweight that you know you
can really use it anywhere but it's just
a fantastic product you get
in here on let's see how much do you get
in here you get one point seven two
fluid ounces which is a lot I guess the
only thing that people might not like
about it is the fact that you know you
have to dip your fingers in there and
you know it doesn't come with a little
spatula or anything like that but I
actually don't mind it that's never
really bothered me as long as I'm making
sure that I wash my hands in between
uses I'm not worried about contaminating
the actual jar or just like passing on
germs if that makes sense so it is super
super hydrating literally it just
hydrated my hands really really
beautifully but you guys can see there's
a nice sheen to it but there's no oily
residue when I use the Josie Maran Argan
infinity intensive cream oil or just
whore her argan oil in general there is
definitely like an oily sheen on the
skin and it doesn't completely sink into
my skin I feel like my skin will take in
the moisture that it needs but it won't
take it all in because it doesn't need
that much however this product I feel
like it sinks in immediately I've been
using it for about a week and a half
every single morning and every single
night and it's just amazing and it says
applied to face day and night after
cleansing for intense hydration follow
with a hundred percent pure argan oil or
argan oil light so if you need even more
moisturization after this product which
if you have combination skin oily skin
you're definitely not going to but if
you have dry skin or very very mature
skin very very dry skin you probably
could follow up with the argan oil but I
feel like I personally don't need to and
I do sometimes in the morning I will add
in 3.3 a little about three drops of my
what is it Paula's Choice moisture
renewal oil booster is just because I do
up add those into my moisturizer in the
morning and I feel like that gives even
more moisture but it's really really
insane how much moisture this product
gives to your skin without making it
greasy and feeling like it's way down
I'm really really enjoying it and I'm
just I'm really really I'm just really
really into it it is definitely
unscented it does not cause any sort of
breakouts or irritation on my skin
whatsoever I do have sort of sensitive
skin that will it's definitely like
breakout
proun if that makes sense so I'm really
really happy to say that this hasn't
caught cause any sort of irritation or
breakouts and I'm really just loving it
so let me see if I can read any more
stuff on the back of here
there's not much to say you know it
really is just a fabulous fabulous
moisturizer that has argan oil built
into it but it's not too oily on the
skin let's see here they also had it a
little more of a consumer study where
they said a hundred percent felt their
skin was instantly hydrated I definitely
feel that way as well they said 93
percent felt that the skin's health and
vitality was restored I do feel that way
sometimes you know those winter nights
where you just feel like your face is
like really raw and chapped you can put
like a moisturizer on and instantly feel
better I kind of get that feeling from
this product as well and then 90 percent
said that they agreed their their skin
felt smoother and redness and irritation
was reduced and I definitely agree with
that you know if you're having psoriasis
or rashes on your face things like that
I have been in a lupus flare up this
past week so this was a really really
good product to be using because it
really really showed me that it was
helping to calm down the redness in my
skin it was helping to calm down
irritation and I think that the reason
he works like that is because there's
really not a lot of harsh chemicals in
here you are getting a little bit of
argan oil in there but it's not too
heavy on the skin so anyway I'm really
really happy with this product I will
definitely be repurchasing when I run
out which I don't think will take me I'm
gonna feel like it will take me a very
very long time to get through the actual
tub but I highly recommend I'm looking
at the Sephora calm website right now
and it has 12 reviews and it's all like
five stars so everybody seems to be
getting a really really great review on
this product like I said I'll link below
where you guys can pick it up not an
affiliate link or anything like that but
yeah just a really really fantastic
moisturizer perfect time of year to come
out with something like this since we
all seem to deal with some sort of dry
skin during the winter so I hope that
you guys go and pick this up if you
liked this review let me know what you
think of it and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
