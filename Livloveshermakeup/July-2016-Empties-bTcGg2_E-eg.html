this video I have my July 2016 empties
for you guys my bin is overflowing I
even have extra garbage over here just
floating around I know I kind of look
like a mass my hairs all frizzy from the
humidity but I really wanted to still
film this video for you guys even though
it is very late because I had so much
that I went through this month so let's
go ahead and get started the first
couple of items that I used up we're
from Pacifica these are Pacifica wipes
and if you guys saw my alcohol you
probably saw that I got a set with all
of these for travel so we have the
Pacifica purify coconut water wipes we
also have the moisturised energized
serum wipes we have the enzymatic
exfoliating wipe so we have these super
detox deep purification wipes and also
the makeup removing wipes so I would not
repurchase the makeup removing wipes I
would purchase this kit again it was
like 15 or 17 dollars for all of these
but it was great for travel but I would
not purchase a full size of the makeup
removing wipes I did not think savor
anything special and my complaint with
all of these wipes in general was the
fact that the actual consistency of the
cloth was super super thin not
consistency if you guys know what I mean
it was very thin and I kind of actually
found it a little difficult to get all
my makeup off so that's just like an
overall complaint with all of them but
yeah I did not think that these were
that great they did smell really good
and I do like the Pacifica is an
all-natural brand but I do have a little
set here that I would definitely get a
full size of and I want to and this is
the Pacific on natural skincare super
detox these are the deep purification
wipes they have kale cucumber and mango
steen infused in them and you guys these
are amazing if you have really really
like oily or combo skin during the
summertime like I do those really wipe
away the impurities I loved those the
enzymatic ones these are with peach and
willow bark and like apricot to these
were just okay wouldn't get a full size
of those I also wouldn't get a full size
of the moisturize energized serum wipes
they are quite moisturizing but i just
don't really need those but i would
purchase a full size of the purifying
coconut water wipe so out of all of them
I liked the deep purification wipes and
the coconut ones the best alright the
next item that Tom and I used up was the
bath and bodyworks mango Mandarin deep
cleansing hand soap this is a mixture of
juicy mango sparkling mandarin orange
and nectarine blossom it smelled really
be good and we definitely would
repurchase i also used up one of these
little sponge ology or sponge something
this is one of those little things that
i got to in my popsugar must have box a
few months ago and this was extremely
scratchy what it is is basically a body
buffer that has body wash already
infused in it and sponge ology did
recently reach out to me i think it was
them or maybe it was a different sponge
brand but anyway i think that all these
are super super harsh on the body so I
do like it for travel because they do
have the actual body wash infused in
there which i think is awesome but
they're super scratchy so i personally i
told them i don't want anything from
them just because i think it is really
abrasive on the skin but the actual body
wash smells really good and i do like
the thought of having a sponge already
filled with body wash i think that's
cool alright i used up beeps dry shampoo
in the fruity floral flavor i really
really enjoyed this I love the dry
shampoo they are one of my favorites i
also used up the bosha makeup break up
cool cleansing oil which is my all time
holy grail favorite a makeup removing
product as you guys probably know i used
up the lemon gentle clarifying treatment
rinse this is a shampoo that's supposed
to purify your hair and not purify it
that sounds weird it's supposed to kind
of help like with buildup in your hair I
liked it it definitely wasn't my
favorite clarifying shampoo I do prefer
the swab one but it was nice I used up
the cargo lash activator night serum you
guys know I love this I had already
purchased an item i will definitely
purchase as well is the bare mineral
skin longevity vital power infusion one
of my all-time favorite serums it is
beautiful i had the wonderful
consistency i will be purchasing the oly
henriksen true serum next and that's I
like to like switch them off switch them
off I like to trade them off so I'll use
a full one of this and then i'll use the
only henriksen one and then i'll go back
to that so i will go back to God I enjoy
it a lot i also used up or we used up
the glade spray in the apple tree picnic
sent we had this in our guest bathroom
in this lasted forever this lasted
almost a year it's crazy but it smelled
really good just like apples and yeah we
licked it alright so the next item we
used up was the coconut lime verbena
deep cleansing canceled from bath and
body works really really likes this it
was one of those sense that they brought
back for the summer so it took me back
and I really did enjoy it I used up the
watermelon lemonade wallflower do in
the beauty room really like this has a
really nice sweet scent i also used up
the Clinique acne solutions clinical
clearing gel this has 1% salicylic acid
in it I like it a lot because you can
actually wear the strain the daytime it
goes on really really nicely and as long
as you follow up with sunscreen you
should be ok so I did enjoy that would
repurchase i also would repurchase these
Pacifica underarm deodorant wipes these
aren't some bomb they're awesome they
have no aluminum nothing horrible and
then their cruelty free just really
really nice they smell amazing like
coconut milk and I just really ensure
copies smell like these are like coconut
frosting you know what they smell like
they smell exactly like the trader joes
coconut body butter that's what they
smell like they smell so good um they
don't work like throughout the day that
amazingly you do have to keep rewinding
your actual armpit area but they're
really nice for like wiping up your body
if you get sweaty throughout the day
alright i used up a pack of the
up-and-up premium cotton ovals these are
my favorite for applying my toner would
repurchase I love those I obviously went
through another one as well um we have a
big item here you guys know I love in
wash scent boosters for basically by
laundry these are these snuggle in wash
scent boosters these are in the cherry
blossom charm sent there were 56 little
packs in here I love oh my god smells
orgasmic I love the snuggle in wash
scent boosters or just my favorite I
think they smelled the best and the
cherry blossom charm sent was really
good so I would repurchase we would
definitely repurchase poopourri we use
this all the time you just spray before
you go and no one else will ever know it
smells really good this is an element we
burned through some candles of course
like always we went through a lemon mint
leaf three lit candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works would repurchase love that scent
very like therapeutic I just I really
enjoyed that scent I burned through Fiji
white sands in the beauty room
definitely premarket as well i will be
doing a video called like summer scent
wrap up where I talked about my favorite
scents for the summer and just like my
favorite candles and that was definitely
one of them I used up the karez Wild
Rose advanced brightening sleeping
facial and a little mini love this i
will be purchasing a full size of that i
have the little cat for my dry shampoo
that fell off i used up the rituals been
stationed organic rice milk and cherry
blossom filming body wash i liked this a
lot it's an all natural blend but it's
an all natural bland
guys no brand it's an all-natural brand
it smells really good i actually used it
to shave my legs really smelled good
really enjoyed that another item i
really enjoy i like to use this when i
am in lupus flare ups this is my Mario
Badescu seaweed bubble bath and shower
gel you guys know I'm obsessed with
taking baths even when i'm going to
lupus flare-up and this is the only
bubble back that does not irritate my
skin when i do that so i really like
this it is a very very nice very gentle
i used up the philosophy three-in-one
shampoo shower gel and bubble bath in
the pink frosted animal crackers and
with it pink frosted animal crackers
sent this is amazing i use it to clean
my brushes i love philosophy 3in1
products what is that must a little
thing for the hanger i guess that came
off anyway i really really love those
products i think they're great and i do
use them to clean my makeup brushes
another one of the lemon mint leaf
through the candles like i said such
beautiful scent lemon and mint together
are amazing I have two little face masks
over here that I did he's up while I was
on at this particular trick and these
are the pharmacy hydrating coconut gel
mask they have echinacea in them they're
brightening activated by anti enzyme no
aunt eyes I'm rich purple broccoli
extract they are so cool really enjoy
those would definitely definitely
repurchase another pack of the premium
cotton ovals obviously I will repurchase
those c12 cedarwood oh my god this tree
would handle oh my god this is a mixture
of I would say New York black tie mixed
with mahogany teak wood it smells
absolutely incredible that will be
envious summer candle wrap-up video as
well Paris lavender macaroon did not
like this that much you know what it
smells like it smells exactly like when
it's burning when it's cold it doesn't
really smell that good in my opinion
it's got a really cute little label
which is why I think everybody wanted it
but in general I think personally that
um oh by the way if I'm like looking
straight for it it's cuz i'm looking at
that in fact in the camera sorry i'm
filming on my laptop so it's a little
different but anyway you know this
smells exactly like marshmallow fireside
when it's burning and when the actual
like wax is pulling up at the bottom i
don't know i just i don't like since
like that during the summertime so i
would not repurchase i used up the body
shops vineyard peach cream body scrub
would not repurchase those this was on
sale for ten dollars you get half the
amount that you would normally get from
like Age sugar scrub so I
wouldn't repurchase it you guys know I
love my shake sugar scrub so I'm not
gonna not going to purchase that it did
smell really good though all right did
the essence all about match-fixing
compact powder I go through what like
two or three of these every month love
those so much at the glam glow youth
cleanse a daily exfoliating cleanser was
not a fan of this I don't think if I
don't think it exfoliates very well at
all you guys know I'm a big fan of glam
glow but this is just not a good product
in my opinion all right I would
definitely repurchase Tiki mango might I
this is a antibacterial hand gel descent
is off the charts amazing from bath and
body works really really enjoyed that I
used up another one of those cream body
scrubs form bit from the body shop like
I said I just didn't feel like they
scrub my body very well very pricey for
what you actually get would not
repurchase I'd like to be the locks
these are actually the Ulta brand makeup
remover facial towelettes so this is
part of their house brand I will be
doing a video on Sephora house brand
products versus alta house brand product
I feel like also really is good when it
comes to like their skincare house
brands products and then Sephora is
really good with the makeup stuff so I
really really like those um we burned
through the sun-drenched mangoes
three-week handle the smelled really
good and I am going to take this home so
I candy pot um not teapot it but you
know d pot it I'm gonna burn the wax but
I can keep this actual little container
here because it's a beautiful little one
um it smelled good it smells better cold
which is weird because normally candles
smell better when they are actually
warmed up and heating up but that one
smelled better cold I've used up the
crystal essence a mineral deodorant
roll-on in lavender and white tee it
says it has no aluminum chlorohydrate in
it but it does still have aluminum in it
so i will not repurchase this i did end
up getting the LA vanilla I'm lemon
blossom and vanilla perfume i think it's
called and i love that won't be
switching from that anytime soon alright
i used up the peter thomas roth on
wrinkle peel pads you guys know i use
these in the morning and at night time i
absolutely absolutely adore those would
repurchase i also would repurchase this
oh my god next summer i need a big size
of this this is the fresh umbrian clay
purifying facial toner it does it matter
faiz the skin and it also minimizes the
appearance of pores it's amazing if this
stuff is absolutely amazing really
really does leave you completely matte
and oil
all day long love it I would definitely
repurchase the only Hendrix increased
relief Cleansing Cloths you guys know I
love these I like to use them in the
morning when I am in a hurry when I
don't have time to actually wash my damn
face so a life of those a lot to would
repurchase I used up the Laura Mercier
body and bath creme brulee honey bath
now this is another little thing I'm
going to deke ants and just kind of keep
it's a beautiful glass bottle oh you
guys it smells so good it smells exactly
like creme brulee you put it in your
bath it's so luxurious it's a very very
pricey item but very much worth it in my
opinion if you are someone who loves
bubble baths which you could know I do I
bathe pretty much every other day that I
got a lot of use out of that and I
enjoyed it so I would repurchase mango
dragon fruit might I know mango dragon
fruit that's what about the body works
as well antibacterial hand gel smelled
really really good not as good as the
mango my tied but still good probably
would repurchase the clarins shaping a
facial lift total the contouring serum
love this I want a full size of this it
does have a little bit of a strong scent
going on there but if you like it I used
up the kate somerville derma crunch
liquid lift this has retinol and
advanced resurfacing treatments and its
really really nice got a little bit of
AJ's in there got a little bit of
retinol it sinks in freakishly fast
would highly recommend checking that out
I used up a little spongebob he was
great love it I used up another one of
the pharmacy brightening purple broccoli
extract mass so these are basically just
that gel nasty you put on they are one
of those sheet masks but it's not a
sheet mass where it's going to start
falling off your face because it's
actually gel so really sticks on nicely
like I said would definitely repurchase
those um let's say you're digging
towards the bottom I have the drunk
elephants beat Hydra intensive hydration
gel I do you like this and I would
purchase a full-size for next summer
it's not amazing there is a product
that's pretty bunch I feel like that is
due pible by the Dr Lin hydrating gel if
you guys I've ever heard of that very
very similar product but I do like that
one better because the Dr Lin does have
peppermint in it which although it
smells really good and it feels really
good when it goes on your face
peppermint is actually a skin irritant
and you shouldn't put it on your skin so
I would probably purchase a BB hydra
intensive hydration gel next summer
really really nice if your combo oily
skin during the summertime I used to be
totally punya
ooh this is the I clean this is a
beautiful eye cream I do like it a lot
it is very reminiscent of one of my
all-time favorite eye creams which is
the UM what's it called yes to
grapefruit brightening eye cream that is
like my all-time favorite ride or die
okay we're gonna start reaching over
here now so i would probably repurchase
that I thought it was really nice sunken
very quickly if you have very oily
eyelids you would like that a lot um
I've used up the bath and body works
aromatherapy sandalwood Rose stress
relief body wash and foam bath this is
one of the best sense the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works has ever released why on earth
they discontinued it oh it's in my mouth
no it doesn't taste good but it smells
good why on earth they discontinued the
scent I've absolutely no idea you guys
this smells so amazing and I talked
about this before as much as I love
really girly cute like fun tropical
smelling stuff this was a beautiful very
much her scent and I wish that they
would bring back some of the more mature
sense about the body works because they
really did like that top used up the
josie maran whipped argon oil face
butter so I used about a third of this
and then I ended up passing it on to him
he loved this he thought it really
hydrated his skin very very nicely it's
beautiful it has the argan oil in there
Josie Maran is known for having really
natural products so he would probably
repurchase um during the wintertime he
told me he would love to have another
tub of that because he has severe combo
skin so he gets a very dry during the
wintertime very oily during the summer
so this is only really good if you have
severely dry skin or combo skin and you
do get dried during the wintertime
alright I used up the pixi by Petra make
up fixing miss this has rose water and
green tea in it I really liked it I used
it as a primer spray and then also to
set in my makeup would repurchase we
used up the cucumber melon deep
cleansing hand soap it is an uplifting
combination of crisp cucumber and fresh
honeydew smells amazing if you are a
longtime lover of Bath and Body Works
you have probably like had a whiff of
this before it smells amazing so so so
good if they do bring that sent back we
will repurchase also ocean citrus this
was the deep cleansing hand soap that
was very very nice as well I had smelled
really good it smelled like bergamot and
like crispiness and christina's you know
what I mean um it says it's clean water
lemon zest and bergamot really nice
smell tongue
so we would repurchase the new and
purify Tony water I did enjoy this a lot
it had cinnamon cardamom Annette it was
very nice for anti inflam i untied put
anti-inflammatory it's a very nice
anti-inflammatory sort of toner I liked
that had a pump it was correct quick it
was quite pricey I've been talking too
long now it was quite pricey it was
around i believe twenty-six dollars
which is incredibly bryci for a toner I
am all about that drugstore toner life
but I still think it was good and if I
see it again I might purchase it I used
up the pharmacy sleep tight forming
night balm I used probably half of it
and then Tom finished it off this is his
all-time favorite night cream so he
really likes that a lot I personally
wouldn't purchase a full-size for myself
I do like that it's like a gel into an
oil it's a very cool thing but I do
prefer the Lancome gel to oil finish so
i probably purchased that one alright
the dr brandt needles no more and this
is just one of those products that's
nice to put on after your primer to kind
of plump up your skin what in participa
lies i'm with your three full sizes at
one point and i used it at night time at
the night cream it doesn't help over
time it just instantly gives you instant
gratification sort of results all right
to the only henriksen sheer
transformation oil-free perfecting cream
I don't think of anything special it's a
very very lightweight and I do think I
talked about it in my fails and holy
grails at one point because it's very
nice and lightweight on the skin I liked
that but I would not purchase a
full-size they turn to lights camera
lashes mascara piece of horrible
mascara made my lashes fallout would not
recommend I did not like this no no no
alright moving on the philosophy no
reason to hide multi imperfection
transforming serum I did not think this
was anything special the only philosophy
products that I seemed to really really
enjoy our their bath products I'm not
that into their skin care products so I
would not purchase a full size of that I
would however purchase a full size of
this this is the Kevin Murphy hydrate me
wash it's a beautiful shampoo smells
amazing I love the little bottles on the
kevin murphy products and this is
actually the like I was gonna say the
house brand no this is actually the
brands that they sell at my personal
still on so when I get my hair done next
time it probably will pull a pole and
purchase oh god I love our design both
eyes alright moving on we're almost done
I have the clear Easter retexturizing
gel the was so
cool this was like so interesting and
bubbly on the face I had really really
tiny micro beads which I really really
enjoyed however they are the micro beads
that do not dissolve on your face and
eventually people are going to be
getting rid of that so we won't have
deep cleansing hand soaps anymore or
anything like that like it's going to be
against a lot from points because
unfortunately it is bad for the
environment because what happens is it
goes down into the water systems and the
fish and you know animals they start to
ingest these little beads so I know it's
not good for the environment which kind
of makes me sad but at the same time it
was a really good product alright moving
on I used up the formula 1006 deep down
detox ultra cleansing mud mats with
orange and bergamot it's not completely
hot date let me tell you what happens I
had this forever this is one of my top
five mass of all times it's amazing
absolutely beautiful if you have
congested skin if you have oily skin
combo skin this went bad so I had it
open for about a year and a half and I
put it on my face about two weeks ago
and started burning it smelled bad and I
was like went bad you know
sometimes you really can tell the
skincare and makeup when it's gone bad
don't try putting that stuff on your
face if it has gone bad alright so this
is the Lancome no it's not this is not
the gel and oil product I was talking
about but this is a beautiful face mask
this is the Lancome the melt in sleeping
mask it smells ridiculously good really
nice for oily or compost can I think I
want to put that on my love slip at
Sephora not that I need another mass but
I want it alright and the last item that
we used up with a little dual pack of
the Tiki Beach wallflowers we had these
in the living room they smell great Tom
really like the scent as well and that
is it guys those are all of my empties
for july twenty sixteen i hope you
enjoyed this video let me know down
below I was gonna say let me know all of
the items that you youth but that would
probably take a while so let me know
what was the favorite item that you guys
used up this month alright guys and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
