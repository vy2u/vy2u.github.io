today's video I have my July 2016 it see
I'm begging to share with you guys so if
you're curious to see what I got in my
etsy glam bag for the month of July 2016
then please keep on watching alright so
the first thing that I got when I pulled
my little pouch out was the hot summer
nights postcard so this is what it looks
like or it's just like the little card
that they put in each month bag it says
the heat is on and if you go to the Ipsy
com website you can get products you can
purchase products you can get tips and
tricks on makeup application and also
you can get lookbook inspiration so
anyway that's a little card that came in
the bag and then the actual little bag
looks like this it's super super cute
it's like this light reflective gorgeous
gorgeous I don't know like kaleidoscope
sort of effect you have some little
umbrellas on the front it says it C and
then you have a little um zipper up here
and this little drawstring thing says
it's beyond it so super super cute my
only complaint is that the products that
were in here started to kind of like
crunch up some of the fabric it's one of
those fabrics that gets wrinkled really
easily but besides that I love this
month little bag so let's take a peek at
what I got alright the first thing that
I see in here is the Too Faced hangover
RX replenishing face primer I have a
full size of this and I love this if
this is what it looks like and this
basically has coconut water in it it's
supposed to help your skin from
looking's fatigue especially if you've
been drinking a little bit so this is a
really really nice little face primer I
personally like it and this is the
perfect size for travel I may take this
up to the cabin with me when I leave in
a few weeks because this is honestly
such a great little travel-size I really
like this it has coconut water in it it
has a probiotic based ingredient list
and also some skin revivers and it is
silicone free really really nice if you
do have dry skin and even if you do have
combo or oily like I do I still feel
like it's really nice and it does like
really really help to keep your
foundation on your face all day alright
they said an item that I see in here is
the vasanti I'm guessing this is eat
there an eye brush or a concealer brush
it says the eyeshadow to brush so this
is what it looks like and this isn't
synthetic hair too
brush it feels super super soft and it
looks like you can just Pat some lid
color on with this it would be nice to
kind of spray down if you want to foil
your eyeshadows I like the length of it
and it looks quite nice so I'm excited
to try that out the next item that I
have in my bag appears to be a felt tip
liner I always feel like I get felt-tip
eyeliners in my tipsy guys I swear to
you I feel like I always get an eyeliner
every month and i usually don't mind but
I personally don't know how to do winged
eyeliner or even just upper liner in
general so I don't really use pens like
this i will go ahead and swatch it to
you guys but i probably will end up
decluttering this so it's a beautiful
kind of blue color can you guys see that
and it seems like the tip is very very
flexible you can make like small lines
or big lines looks like i'm drawing on
my hand but you know what i mean it
seems like you really can make little
precision marks and things like that so
it looks like it's a good product if you
do like to use products like this but i
personally don't like felt tip liner is
just because i don't use them all right
the next item that I see here is from
the meet Matt matrimony I was in same
Act remedy they may meet matrimony
pallets from the bomb and this appears
to be some sort of single shadow oh my
god it's so cute so it looks like a
little booklet and this is so adorable I
know a lot of people that got their
hands on this particular palette I did
not purchase it but look at the shade
this is called matt kumar and it looks
beautiful it's like a gorgeous gorgeous
red color very very soft and creamy
there it is it's a beautiful kind of
wine color i would say perfect for the
fall so that is what the meat matrimony
shade looks like or the palette the
shade is called matt kumar so I'm
excited for that that's the cutest
eyeshadow single I've ever had in my
life alright and then the last item that
I got in my Ipsy bag this month is hold
on let me get these swatches off quickly
alright the last item that I got in my
bag this month is the Palmetto
rejuvenating antioxidant mask it helps
to brighten and soften the skin and I'm
so excited because you guys I have been
waiting to get some sort of skincare
item from the Ipsy line or just empty
bags in general I've been getting it see
bags for about five to six
now and I've never been a skincare item
and if you are you know a subscriber of
my channel you probably know that I love
like skin care so I've been waiting and
I'm so excited to finally have something
so yeah this is the Palmetto
rejuvenating antioxidant mask and that
is what it looks like perfect for travel
again they have to take this up to the
cabin and I am very very excited to use
this so that is everything that I've got
in my July 2016 FC bag I hope you guys
