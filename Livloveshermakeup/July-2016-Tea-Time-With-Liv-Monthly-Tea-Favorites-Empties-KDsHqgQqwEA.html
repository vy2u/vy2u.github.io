my channel in this video I have tea time
with live for July 2016 I know this is
quite late but you guys know I've been
traveling so basically what I do in tea
time with lid is I share with you guys
my monthly tea favourites and then I
share any empties that I went through
like during the month so let's go ahead
and get started it's really funny this
month I've been loving black tea and I
talked about it before like in order of
how I like teas I like rooibos or red
tea and then I usually like white tea
then green tea then black tea but I have
been obsessed with black tea this month
so let's go ahead and get started and
the first favorite is this little K Cup
right here this is the Tazo a weak
English breakfast black tea I really
really have been enjoying this
particular tea this is what the actual
cake couple looks like I just love this
it's so so so darn good it does have
just as much caffeine as like a regular
cup of coffee so if you're one of those
people I was talking with my friend
Rochelle about this if you're one of
those people that you get used to the
caffeine in coffee or you just want a
different kind of pick-me-up and this is
a really really nice one I also have
really been enjoying the Twinings chai
latte black tea this is already pre
sweetened and it's really really good
you guys it tastes really nice and
frothy and it doesn't have any I don't
think it has dairy in it but it has like
you can add in your own like almond milk
or whatever you want to add in coconut
milk milk regular milk almond milk
whatever you can add in anything else to
kind of make it a little creamier but it
does have a little bit of a creamy
consistency again I don't think there is
actual dairy in here but it really does
taste kind of like a black tea latte
like a chai latte really really good and
it just has that wonderful black tea
base so I've been enjoying that a lot
and then I also have been enjoying of
course at Ivana too you guys know I'm
obsessed with Ivana this is the loose
leaf gingerbread flavored black tea
blend and this is amazing it says
classic gingerbread flavor and cinnamon
Speights notes gather around a smooth
black tea base with a sweet caramel
apple finish and you guys oh my god do
you see that there are literally pieces
of clove and popcorn and black tea and
just delicious spices in here just as
Tom's favorite one of his favorite
holiday teas from Teavana and you guys
know we've been enjoying drinking our
holiday teas during the summer time for
whatever reason so we really have been
enjoying that and then my final tea
favorite for it
is actually a Lipton green tea so last
month I showed you guys the dragon fruit
1 or the super fruit 1 this one is
called the green tea cranberry
pomegranate and I talked about this last
month a little bit as well it wasn't a
favorite but I just mentioned that I had
this one I have I really wasn't able to
find a way that I like to drink this
plane without any sweetener so what I do
is I like to drink this ice and I put in
a little bit of rock sugar and it tastes
so so so so good you guys and this does
come in a teabag form as you can
probably see you can pick this up at
Walmart I really like these super fruit
teas just because if you're not a huge
fan of regular green tea on its own I
think that those kind of flavorings are
really really nice and the dragon fruit
one has a little bit of melon in it and
a little bit of jasmine I just taste so
good
so those are my monthly tea favorites
you can get to these little K Cups and I
believe tea bag form as well not this
one but this one you can get in teabag
form and loose-leaf version and then the
Twinings tri latte i think is only
available in k cup version alright now
let's go ahead excuse me
let's go ahead and talk about my tea
empties for the bun so the first empty
for the month is the celestial
Seasonings fruits tea sampler so this is
a caffeine-free fruit tea sampler it was
really really nice you had three
raspberry singer teas for country peach
passions for wild berry zingers 3 true
blueberries and 5 black cherry berries
and these do come in tea bag form they
were really really good you guys I liked
them ice during the summer time I loved
having like fruit tea ice and I thought
these were really really good my
favorite was definitely the country
peach passion ice love the taste of
peach so with all about that one and I
also thought that the raspberry singer
was really good so I enjoyed that a lot
and I would definitely repurchase next
summer I also used up the Republic of
tea acai green tea this is a China green
tea base with an acai flavoring really
really good if you do like green tea and
you like a little bit of sweetness I
like to put this in what do I usually do
with this I think I use rock sugar with
this or a little bit of honey tastes
really really good with a lot of honey
not a little honey a lot of honey or a
little bit of sugar and I just really
really enjoy it and the Republic of tea
is a really really nice
and just you guys know next month I will
be showing you some appliances on how I
kind of like to use these products
obviously I can't because I'm on
vacation right now I didn't bring back
here again my little Teavana
tea maker and all that kind of stuff but
it will be doing that next month because
my friend amber was curious about that
so I will show you guys next month and
then the last tea empty that I have for
the month is the Teavana white chocolate
peppermint flavored rooibos tea and I
showed this as one of my favorites last
month it's so good it's a beautiful
beautiful holiday blend it tastes
amazing really really enjoy that and
then I wanted to show you guys you may
see this in next month excuse my dad
gave me it looks like a little bag of
drugs it's not a little bag of
loose-leaf rooibos tea and I believe
this comes like straight from Africa
it's imported so I'm super super excited
to try this out and I will let you guys
know if I like that for next month so
anyway those were my tea favorites and
my tea empties for the month let me know
down below what you have been loving tea
wise this month and I will see you guys
next month bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
