channel today's video is going to be my
July 2017 empties so if you are curious
as to what I used up in the first 15
days of the month and please keep on
watching so the first item I have here
is of course an essence all about Matt
fixing contact powder I adore these
powders really really nice even though
my skin has gone completely normal I can
still use this to set in my t-zone and
pretty much all over my face it really
does increase the longevity of my
foundation throughout the day and I
absolutely adore it so would repurchase
next I would also repurchase the drunk
elephant becky jelly cleanser this is in
the cantaloupe version I actually have
already repurchase this you guys will be
seen a Sephora haul from me soon
probably next week this is really nice
for removing residual skincare in the
morning as well as double cleansing at
nighttime so I really enjoy this I know
it is quite pricy for these 5 fluid
ounces but it is worth it to me alright
next we have the Dove Hair Therapy
refreshed took care of volumizing dry
shampoo it says it absorbs oil to
refresh hair gently leaving it clean
nourish and soft between washes I do not
feel like it really nourish my scalp it
definitely did not leave my hair feeling
soft in fact I feel like it leaves it
feeling very kind of like waxy and
disgusting like there's a lump buildup
in your hair and also does leave a
horrendous white cap so I do not like
this and alkyd of Dez done dub does
tests on animals I would not repurchase
are you moving on we have these jump
here on micellar cleansing water did not
like this it's very very cheap only 3
dollars and 49 cents on the Ulta comm
website but it really acts like a $3 and
forty nine cent product which is really
unfortunate it stings my eyes like crazy
and also does dry out the skin on my
face so would not repurchase alright
next I have my Clarisonic that
Clarisonic is not a cruelty-free company
so I can't purchase any more of the
brush head so I'm going to go ahead and
send this to my boyfriend's mom or give
it to my mom
alright moving on I have a perfume here
that has gone bad it is the Paris Hilton
/ Theo my fathers took like four years
you guys you remember this when Paris
altar was like super popular it smelled
really good but now it smells like
rubbing alcohol and syrups mixed
together so not really liking that any
we're going to go ahead and let go of it
next we have a powder here from
Maybelline that this is the better skin
skin transforming powder a new shade of
china porcelain it does have salicylic
acid in it and it is not
comedogenic this was actually a really a
beautiful powder I really did like it I
did lead a little more on the warm tone
side which I feel like a lot of
Maybelline face products to do but
unfortunately Maybelline does tests on
animals so I will not be repurchasing
that alright next I used up be Mario
Badescu ginkgo golden Engel biloba
mask because this is what it looks like
it does have shea butter macadamia and
jojoba oils in it as well as soap and
plants and glycerin so it really will
make your skin immediately feel supple
and soft and it will it comfort it so if
you do have more dry skin or normal skin
especially really really beautiful I've
had it in my collection for quite a
while I definitely started to go back
towards the end the actual texture and
the scent but there's only a little bit
left in here but yeah this is beautiful
and Mario Badescu does not just some
animal so I'm pretty sure I would
repurchase next we have a little sample
of the touch of water cream it says
refreshing an anti-aging pore perfecting
Japanese wild rose this look quite nice
but I do feel like maybe it's not enough
moisture for my skin I did to try to
little samples out the first night I was
absolutely amazed I thought it was
amazing I literally had the texture of
water but then the second night I
noticed that maybe it didn't give me
quite enough moisture so I didn't
actually put it on my love list at
Sephora but it does seem like a really
nice product if you do have combination
or oily skin alright next year are
beasts whispered cotton around these
there'd be 100% cotton round I have no
idea on their cruelty free satisfying no
I wouldn't repurchase these just because
I did feel like they were very abrasive
around my eye area they were not um
smooth they had like a texture on them
so I did not really like those next they
did use up the origins drink up
intensive overnight mask so this is what
it looks like and on the back here it
says overnight master quench skin's
thirst twice a week or as desire gently
massaged on to clean skin at bedtime
tissue off excess so you can actually
wear this during the daytime or you can
wear it overnight it's a beautiful
beautiful overnight mask but
unfortunately guys origins does test on
animals they definitely seem like a
brand set wouldn't but this is a very
good product but you like I would not
repurchase alright next I did use up the
Maybelline a dream a cushion fresh face
liquid foundation on the go indie shade
a ton of porcelain so just like the
vaguely better skin powder this was
actually really beautiful I feel like it
performs like a high-end foundation
unfortunately would not repurchase like
I said it may believe does tests on
animals
but this was very very beautiful on this
game one of the best finishes as far as
the drugstore foundation is concerned on
the skin in my opinion all right here is
the Garnier skin renew anti dark circle
roller it has a little cooling a bulb
tip and basically you rub it underneath
your eyes to get a little bit of
concealer and coverage there and also to
reduce any sort of dark circles or
puppies I really really did like this
and I thought it was fantastic but
unfortunately again a Garn day does test
on animals so I would not repurchase all
right next I do have the it cosmetics or
I guess last I have the in cosmetics
confidence in a cream transport this
transforming moisturizing super cream
that says anti-aging armor for the skin
and I have gone through quite a few
little deluxe sizes of this they all
seems to be the same so the sample isn't
different than the full-size I have
tried out the full size as well when I
was overnight at my friend's house but
at first I thought I really really
wanted to get this and then I realized
it's not really a great nighttime
moisturizer I believe there is a little
bit of silicone in here it's really nice
underneath the makeup if you just want
to put this on and kind of use it as
your primer is fantastic but I would
really like it for a nighttime
moisturizer so I don't think I'm going
to get a full-size of this but it
definitely has caught my eyes so that is
the if cosmetics confidence any cream of
moisturizer so anyway guys those are all
the cups I have used up this month so
far let me know down below which
products you have used up and I will see
you guys tomorrow
