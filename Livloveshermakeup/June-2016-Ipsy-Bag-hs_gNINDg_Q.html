this video I have my June 2016 it's bag
to open up with you guys and unbox or
unbag so let's go ahead and get right
into it shall we
alright I'm gonna open up the little
pigs pouch and I guess we shall see what
kind of bag we get in here this month
the last month's bag was really cute and
this is actually pretty cute too so it
looks like it's kind of like graffiti I
really like the bright colors I think it
would have been cuter if they were like
flowers or hearts or something but I'm a
girly girl so that's why I would say
something like that but I still think
this is adorable
and of course it said it see here and
then we are just gonna open this up
alright so the first item that I've seen
here is a three tone browser from a
three-tone browser a three-tone bronzer
from the brand crown cosmetics this is
what the outer packaging looks like and
I did get a sneak peek of what is in my
bag and I know I got one really really
awesome item so anyway we're starting
with this one this is a three tone
bronzer kind of reminds me of Sun bunny
from Too Faced here's what it looks like
let's go ahead and swatch it feels
pretty soft and buttery definitely has a
little bit of kick up but when you put
them all together it does not look like
a bronzer at all this actually looks
like a pink highlight so those are the
three shades mixed together that's
definitely more of a highlight right I'm
not crazy right
I definitely picked up some of that
brown color so yeah looks like a
highlight to me or a blush top or at
least I'm still pretty I'll still wear
it and yeah it's kind of nice the
luminescent it kind of Sheen to it
alright
the second item that I'm so excited
about and I did get a sneak peek of this
this is the Urban Decay fireball
eyeshadow I have wanted this shadow
forever and I'm so excited that I got it
so anyway this is what it looks like let
me show you guys it's not a full size
obviously because those full size full
size eyeshadows are super super
expensive but this is what the size is
and I still think this is a nice amount
so here is the Urban Decay fireball
eyeshadow let me go ahead and swatch it
for you guys it was either gonna be this
one or the shade lounge and I know that
lounge is very similar to a few
eyeshadows that I already have it's kind
of like the
a blue brown pigment but I'm kind of
excited that I got fireball so here is
fireball so I'm very excited to have
that in my collection I think the Urban
Decay single shadows are really really
good
all right the next like I might have
here is the formula X nail color and the
shade that I got is let's see here
here's the outer packaging just a little
mini mini polish perfect for travel the
shape that I got here is we woman so
it's a beautiful kind of I would
classify it as a fluorescent bread if
that makes sense
did I say bread a fluorescent red it's
kind of like a dark pink or a bright
kind of pinky red shade I actually like
that I'm very very pretty the next item
that I got - it's from the brand lo I
must dropped it this is delectable it is
called bottled brilliance everything
bomb it says it plums pounce glosses the
lips and makes it pop with color the
shade that I have is called sweet cream
this is what it looks like and I don't
know if this is just like a lip balm or
if it actually have color to it let's
open it up and take a peek I think it's
just a clear balm yeah it's just a clear
balm so I guess I will try that out you
guys know I'm a flutist so I'm crazy
about lip balms and then the last item
that I have in my bag for the month is
this v8 bombshell and I have gotten this
brand before in other subscription
services never in 50 before but this is
the be a bombshell let's see here be a
bombshell how to potion I think this is
actually either a gloss or a matte lip
color and this is a beautiful shade like
right up my alley I love these kind of
shades so it is a gloss but it looks
like it might dry down a little bit
satiny so there is right there alright
guys so that is everything that I got in
this month if seabag I'm really excited
about the single eye shadow from Urban
Decay
I do think the bag is quite cute it's
not my all-time favorite box but it
still is a good one so thank you so much
for joining me let me know down below
what you got in your tipsy bag and I
will see you guys in my next video but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
