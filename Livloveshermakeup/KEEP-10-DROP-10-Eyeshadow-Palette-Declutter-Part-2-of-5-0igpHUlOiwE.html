another keep ten drop ten eyes shadow
palette declutter today I am going
through high-end as well as middle range
and also drugstore eyeshadow palette so
without further ado I think we should
just jump into it but before I do I do
want to say really quickly I have a
little bit of a disclaimer for this
video I've been getting a ton of
questions especially in my last keep ten
drop 10 shadow palette declutter about
if I am selling at my palettes at this
time I am not selling my palettes you
guys I never throw my palettes away I
actually declutter them and I also
donate now I am still looking for a good
place to donate in Phoenix so if you
have any idea of where I can do so
please let me know down below in the
comments section but thank you so much
for taking interest in buying my
palettes but at this time I am NOT doing
that alright guys now that we have all
the disclaimers out of the way we're
gonna start with the color pop golden
state of mind eyeshadow palette I
actually have you guys set up in the
kitchen today I hope you don't mind I
feel like the lighting in here is a
little better than what I was using last
time so anyway here is what the color
pop golden state of mind eyeshadow
palette looks like on the inside I am
NOT a fan of this formula I actually
talked about this as one of the worst
makeup releases of 2017 so this is
definitely going to go bye-bye you can
see that middle shade there the pan is
actually starting to leak oil which is
something that happened with my Nicole
Guerrero glow kit as well I actually
prefer the Nicole Guerrero glow kit over
this but the formulas are kind of
similar so if you can't imagine wearing
the inacol guerrero glow kit on your
eyes and then this is not gonna be a
palette that you want to pick up so that
one's gonna go bye-bye next up we have a
beautiful little palette here from ciate
this is the Olivia Palermo the
smoldering eye palette oh my goodness if
you guys had the chance to pick this up
I'm sure you also really love it I do
not think I can let go of this palette
it is absolutely beautiful as you guys
can see I love these really grungy kind
of tones going on here so yes this is
something that I will be going ahead and
folding on to moving on guys we have
another little troublemaker here but
this is something that I will be holding
on to you it is the anastacio Beverly
Hills subculture a palette I know a lot
of people don't like this palette but I
am NOT one of them I actually really do
enjoy this palette I think it's
beautiful and paired together with the
Anastacio Beverly Hills prism palette
it's really really nice this one has a
lot of mattes and the prism has a lot of
shimmers which hold on let me see here
yeah it does look like I picked out the
prism
palate for this particular video so I
will also be going ahead and holding on
to that one but I do enjoy this so yeah
get a hold on to the subculture palate
up next we have two different tart
palates right here let's start with this
guy because I think it's time to let go
of the tart rainforest of the sea of
volume three eye shadow palette I feel
like I just have a hard time working
with this on my eyes I loved the formula
that they did for the first edition as
well as the second edition but the third
one is just very very chunky they are
foiled eyeshadows but I just really have
a hard time with this so I'm gonna go
ahead and let go of this baby and then
it's this guy right here I don't know
this one is also kind of hard this is
the young wild and free eye shadow
palette and I really do enjoy this for
travel but as you guys can see these are
like the most basic of basic colors ever
I mean yeah they're just incredibly
basic and I feel like I kind of don't
need it so I'm also actually gonna go
ahead and let go of the young wild and
free palette from Tarte as well all
right moving on we have a steal up
perfect knee perfect hue palette do you
guys know I love these palettes but let
me check out what shade this one is this
one appears to be the light / medium
version and I'm actually also gonna let
this one go this is something that I've
been talking about form I want to say a
couple years ever since I picked these
up or at least a year my last eye shadow
palette declutter I kept all four of
these because I really do like them I
love that there's five eyeshadows in two
blushes I love the formula yesterday in
my past and how to growls I talked about
to be medium / tan version these are
really really nice palettes but I feel
like this is the most basic and the
least unique out of all of them so color
selection wise it's just not something I
need in my life so I'm also gonna go
ahead and let go of the Stila
perfectly perfect hue palette in light /
medium moving on we have to at different
Too Faced palettes here the first one is
the two faiths peanut butter and jelly
palette and the second is the Too Faced
gingerbread cookie palette
this guy right here was from the holiday
2016 collection it has six different
eyeshadows in it as well as a bronzer I
love the bronzer which is why I've been
holding on to this palette the
eyeshadows are just okay and obviously I
have a lot of shades that are similar to
this but I'm not just gonna deep hop
this color and then put it in some sort
of random ballad I'm really weird you
guys I don't actually like deep potting
products all that often because I don't
like putting
together my own palates I know that
might sound very strange but I like
something that's already preset so I am
gonna go ahead and actually let go of a
gingerbread cookie palette and then when
it comes to the peanut butter and jelly
I love this and I really do think this
is a great 9 pan palette from Too Faced
so I'm gonna go ahead and hold on to
this one you have some nice warm tone
shades in here the only one that's like
a huge mess is the shade of jelly this
was much better than the peanut butter
and honey palette which I also mentioned
in my video the other day but I really
do love the peanut butter and jelly so
I'm gonna hold on to that one alright
guys moving on we have two different
color pop palettes here the first one is
the yesplease palette and the second is
the I think I love you palette so the I
think they love you pilot has a lot of
neutrals in it you have a ton of
shimmers and then a couple of maps in
here this is what I wish the shimmer
formula would have been like in the
Golden State of Mind palette but I get a
lot of use out of this I know it's
incredibly basic but I am gonna go ahead
and hold on to that one I already know
that for a fact and then when it comes
to the yes please you guys will be able
to see this is a well well-loved palette
in my collection I and I also I'm gonna
go ahead and hold on it to this one all
right up next we have sorry I hope next
we have a Julius placed pilot here this
is called the masquerade palette from
Julius place and this is probably my
all-time favorite Julius place palette
you have a bunch of leg really really oh
my God look it I've got my nail in there
over two beautiful bright pops of color
on the top and then you go down and you
have more neutrals I love the Julius
place formula and although I did go
ahead and declutter it the Nubian 2
palette I love the Nubian one and I love
this one so I am gonna go ahead and hold
on to this baby right here and actually
let me show you guys some swatches just
so you can see because these are
absolutely amazing I mean there's
nothing quite like these shadows look at
those look how foiled and gorgeous so
yeah gonna be holding on to that one
here we have something from pur
cosmetics this is called the buff
collection eyeshadow palette it reminds
me a lot of the Naked 3 palette and
although I really love the tones in here
I already have a pinky purple e palette
from the drugstore it's the covergirl
blushed
roses palette that I prefer over this
one so I think I'm gonna go ahead and
let this one go I love the shade Mojave
like the Mojave Desert I love this shade
I love this shade very reminiscent of
the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette but like
I said I just don't get enough use out
of it so I'm going to let that one
go and then here we have something that
I actually really enjoy from pretty
vulgar cosmetics this is the Nightingale
palette this is like a cool tone lover's
dream if it's not obvious already I love
cool toned eyeshadows so this is
something I get a lot of use out of it's
not the easiest palette to work with
however I love all the color selection
in here so I am going to go ahead and
hold on it to the Nightingale of palette
and I love that name nightingale so
pretty alright guys up next we have two
different pilots here from the studio on
the goal line
one of them is called warm up and one of
them is called cooled down I'm a lover
of cool toned eyeshadows so hold on one
second okay I'm looking over at my pile
I still have some others to go we're
gonna go ahead and take a double check
in a couple of minutes here to see where
I met with the pallets I don't love this
formula to the point where I would I
don't know it's hard to say I I do like
the formula but if I had to choose over
another formula like I'm looking right
now and seeing the Sonia Kashuk eye on
neutral palette as well as like the
prism palette I would choose those over
these however I really do like the color
selection in this one so I'm definitely
gonna let go of this one this one is
called warm up and I just have so many
colors like this in my collection I
don't need it I believe I got both of
these in a boxycharm last year and like
I said they're really good quality but
compared to my other palettes like they
don't really stand a chance but then
this guy right here I really do like
this cooled down version you guys can
see this is definitely a well-loved
palette so you know I didn't go ahead
and hold on to it I like it I'll enjoy
it a lot and because I did declutter
that pur cosmetics ones with the cooler
tone eyeshadows I'm gonna hold on to
this one so yeah all right guys let's go
ahead and take a look now just to make
sure I'm counting these out right and to
make sure that I haven't gone over an
either category let's double checks okay
sorry to abruptly stop like that I just
wanted to make sure that I am still okay
here so over here is my little buy buy
pile we have one two three four five six
seven so I want three more eyeshadow
palettes to declutter and then over here
we have my keep pile look at the
difference between my keep pile and the
go pile I feel like all the shades over
in the go pile are very very neutral and
then over here
very colorful and cool town here we have
one two three four five six seven eight
so I get to keep two more and then I
need to let go of three more so anyway
just going to do a little double check
here but let's go ahead and continue
along we have five different palates
left here I get to keep two more and
then I will declutter the rest so the
first one that we have here is also from
two-faced this is the eggnog latte
palette this also came in the same set
as the gingerbread latte and again the
reason why I had been holding on to this
for so long was because of the blush so
you know what compared to some of the
others in the pile right now this is
gonna go it's just not worth it
so yes I'm gonna let go of the eggnog
latte palette now this is one that is
catching my eye that I definitely want
to hold on to it is the Sonia Kashuk eye
on neutral palette I'm in love with this
palette it's my go-to for my eyebrows as
well as my eye shadow it has all the
mats and the liner shades that you could
want in it I prefer this over my Urban
Decay Naked basics palette so yes I'm
gonna go ahead and hold on to the Sonia
Kashuk eye on neutral okay that means I
get to keep one more and I can already
see which one I want to keep so I am
gonna let go of the revealed matte
palette from Coastal Scents they did
send this over for PR and although I
love my revealed palettes if you saw my
review on this particular one I did say
that I feel like a lot of the shades in
here are very very similar and if this
had to go up against my Sonia Kashuk eye
on neutral palette it wouldn't stand a
chance so I am gonna let go of the
revealed matte palette and here is the
one that I want to keep and have it be
at my last little goodie it is the
Anasazi of beverly hills prison I told
you guys I love pairing this together
with these subculture palette it has a
lot of shimmers in it some of my
favorite shades are sphere as well as
dimension and I just really enjoyed this
palette um it's very similar to the Kat
Von D st. and Center which I'm also
keeping maybe eventually I'll let go of
this one but I'm just not ready to part
with it yet so I'm gonna be holding on
to that and that means that this little
guy the Sephora palette right here is
going to also go into the bye bye pal
bye bye drawer or into the bye bye pile
and this is what it looks like on the
inside not anything too fun going on
here the shadows are just okay nothing
phenomenal so yeah that's pretty much it
guys let's go ahead and take a look
what I am keeping and what I am letting
go of for high-end eyeshadow palettes I
am keeping one two three four five and I
am decluttering one two three four five
so keeping five high-end and
decluttering five high end as far as
middle range is concerned I am keeping
one two three four five and then I am
decluttering one two three and then I am
also decluttering a to a different
drugstore palettes so those are all 20
palettes I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me focus this camera again you
can do it camera you can do it
alright that's it for this video you
guys I hope you enjoyed it the next
declutter video I'm going to be doing is
actually on face palettes it's not going
to be a keep 10 drop 10 but I promise to
do another one of these eyeshadow
palette addi cutters for you guys very
soon but yeah I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
