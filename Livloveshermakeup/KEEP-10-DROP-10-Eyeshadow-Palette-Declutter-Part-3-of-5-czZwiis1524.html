you at my channel so today I have
another keep ten it dropped in eyeshadow
a pile of declutter to share it with you
guys I will go ahead and link at the
other two eyes shadow palettes and
declutter Zin this series up above in
the cards if you would like to check it
out but yeah let's go ahead and get
through these palettes and I'll let you
know if I'm gonna keep them or if I will
be donating them or giving to friends
gonna start with this palette right here
this is called the berries palette from
B YS Beauty this is a drugstore brand in
Australia my friend Meg recently sent
this to me it looks like it's going to
be a dupe for the modern at renaissance
palette now i have not tested this one
out yet so for now i am gonna go ahead
and hold on to that guy i also have to a
little kind of mini color pop palettes
here this first one was sent for PR it's
the weekend warrior palettes the amanda
steal a collection this is what it looks
like on the inside you have some nice
kind of smoky toned colors however i
found these really really difficult to
blend and they do not remind me of the
usual kind of powder eyeshadow formula
from colour-pop so i'm gonna let that
one go however this one right here is
super super beautiful this one is called
the belle of the ball palette and i
absolutely loved it you have four
different colors here one is shimmer
the rest are matte you have a peachy
matthew have a darker peachy and then
you have a beautiful kind of fuchsia
color and I really like these on the
eyes so I'm gonna keep that color pop
one as well as the berries palette and
then I also have this ice cream palette
right here this is from a dose of colors
again I have not actually jumped into
this palette so this is going to be a
palette that I use in an upcoming a
video so for now I will also be going
ahead and holding on it to that one I
cannot wait to jump into this palette if
this shade berries in cream cone and
lavender honey look absolutely amazing
of this little neutrals palette here
from a brand called a savvy naturals
this is a from Australia as well and my
friend Meg did send me this one as well
and you know these are really difficult
to work with especially these darker
shades right here they're incredibly
incredibly hard to blend so I'm sorry
this did not work out for me Meg but I
will go ahead and give it to someone who
will give it a very good home now right
here I have my buxom customizable
palette ooh this was also sent to me a
for @pr and these are the colors that I
put inside so basically they sent over I
believe twelve different eyeshadows and
I got to kind of customize my own
palette if this is the kind of warmer
neutral one that I currently have and I
love these I think that these are buxom
customizable eyeshadow palettes are
really really one of those palettes or
one of those products where a lot of
people don't talk about them but they
should because these are some excellent
shadows so I will definitely be going
ahead and holding on to that one up next
we have the Kat Von D mini metal matte
palette I am gonna be going ahead and
definitely holding on to this I do have
the original metal matte palette which I
also showed in a I shadow palette
declutter and I am holding on to that
one as well you know I'm getting so much
use out of this I love a thunderstruck
and flash especially and then I really
like these shades oak and suede down
here and I know that there are
overlapping shades with the original Kat
Von D metal matte palette but I'm just
getting a lot of use out of this so I
cannot see myself parting with that so I
will definitely be holding on to that
one Driss Cosmetics a blossom eyeshadow
palette this was also sent to me for PR
and I hate it okay this is such a bad
eye shadow palette incredibly incredibly
hard to blend they're very very chalky
and I don't even want to give this to a
friend that's how bad it is so I will
probably end up tossing this I don't
usually toss my makeup I always
declutter or donate but this is just an
eyeshadow palette I can't really see
anybody getting this to work to be
completely honest so and that is the
blossom palette sorry Catrice that just
did not work for me now right here we
have the butter LONDON a Pantone
universe palette now I think this is
from possibly last year and this is what
it looks like on the inside and you have
some beautiful kind of topi shades with
a bright green I love the bright green
but you guys these deeper shades right
here very very difficult to blend and
then when you do get to these kind of
neutral shades right here all of them
blend into one another so again I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of that one
here is the bone of your hand volume a
twoa palette again this was sent for PR
I'm sorry I'm kind of going through a
pile of PR palettes right here but you
guys know the majority of my products I
do purchase myself so if you want to
check in to some other of these
declutter our videos I have a ton of
where obviously I've purchased the
majority of the palettes but if this is
what it looks like on the inside and I
will be actually going ahead and
decluttering this palette as well you do
have four different blushes what I'm
sorry you have a bronzer and three
different blushes on the bottom
obviously frat boy frat boy had a little
bit of a tumble then you do have mary
lou manizer on top and four eyeshadows
these are just not similar to the
original full-size
I know that my friend Britney wants to
try this palette out so I'm gonna go
ahead and send it to her but this is not
one that I would recommend honestly just
go ahead and purchase these at full size
when you can find them on HauteLook or
something like that because these are
pressed super super firmly and are not
identical to the original ones and then
here we have the Rose metals palette -
this is from Velvet 59 I've actually
been getting a lot of use out of this
this is a gorgeous gorgeous palette I
really like this coppery shade down here
I like the bluish shade I like the
lavender I like a lot of things about
this palette so I will be going ahead
and holding onto that one up next I have
the NYX butt naked underneath it all
palette
I love these palettes for travel I have
two of them this one definitely has some
darker and more warm tone colors in it
so I will be keeping it that one as well
as the button Naked palette - this is
the original one and in this one you
guys can see you have some more neutral
colors I just love these for travel
because they do also open up and you
have blushes and highlighters on the
inside as well which is why they are so
thick so yeah I will be keeping both of
those here we have a bare minerals
palette I know that I decluttered the
sister one to this which was called the
posh neutrals this one is called the
power neutrals and I'm also gonna go
ahead and let go of it I used to love
this and I used to get so much use out
of it hold on let me refocus here there
we go I used to get so much use out of
this palette but I have not been
reaching for it recently and I do feel
like a lot of these colors do muddy
together you can get a very simplistic
pretty neutral eye but I just don't see
myself reaching for this as often as I
used to so I'm gonna let that one go as
well alright here is the Chi Chi diva
eyeshadow palette and this is a super
super warm tone palette again this is
something I have not even dug into so
for now I will be going ahead and
holding on to it look how warm toned
this is isn't that crazy it almost
reminds me of like the Tarte toasted
palette or something and this again was
sent to me by my friend Meg from
Australia we did a swap so yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and give this one a go so
I will be holding onto that for now and
then here we have a bare minerals this
is called the magic act palette I really
really do enjoy this I get a lot of use
out of it at the bottom you have some
blushes as you guys can see and then
here you have some really really neutral
eyeshadows I get a lot of use out of a
Shazam and also a ha which is that
beautiful taupey color so yes I will be
going ahead and holding on it to it the
magic act
Hallet alright here we have the lorac
what is this called dance tell dawn at
palette this took quite the tumble so
I'm gonna go ahead and repress it if you
guys want me to do a video on how I
repress my makeup I'd be more than happy
to do that but I'm gonna repress some of
this and just kind of put it back
together and then I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter it I just don't reach for it
enough but the blushes in here are
gorgeous actually the eyeshadows are
very silky as well and very pretty but
like I said I just don't get enough use
out of it so I'm gonna let go of that
one Fila palette right here and I am
going to go ahead and fill this up with
the rest of these Stila eyeshadows that
I have so we have 1 2 3 4 more then I'm
gonna pop in here and the colors are all
pretty darn it and neutral but as you
can see these are Stila singles and
they're quite powdery and quite chalky
they don't go into the eyes and
beautifully but I feel like someone
could get use out of this palette so I'm
also gonna go ahead and declutter that
one alright just to double-check the
pile it looks like we're good to go so
far but we do have to what more palettes
left this is the Urban Decay full
spectrum palette if I can open it this
is what the full spectrum a palette
looks like absolutely beautiful super
super colorful but you guys I don't
reach for it again and I know a lot of
people were telling me even if you don't
reach for it that's not a good enough
reason to declutter to me oh girl it is
if I'm not reaching for it that means it
becomes a dust collector and that it's
not doing anything in my collection
rather than just sitting around so I
would love to go ahead and give you
someone who will give it a good home and
then finally we have this crown a
brushes palette that was recently sent
in a boxy charm
now the boxy term was sent to me for a
PR but I did try out this palette the
other day and I was not a fan and they
swatch beautifully especially rock out
heavy metals and Punk they go on really
beautifully when you swatch them however
when you actually get them onto your
eyes they were super super hard to blend
it just kind of a pain in the ass so I'm
also gonna go ahead and let go of that
palette so let me go ahead and show you
guys all of the palettes that I'll be
keeping and of course all the palettes
that I will be decluttering alright guys
so here are the 10 at palettes that I
will be a decluttering hopefully you can
see them we have the Sun kind of coming
through right now but the Stila palette
I will be going ahead and filling in
with the other singles that I have and
then I will be - cluttering that one and
then the lorac I'm going to repress but
yeah I've got some colorful palettes
over here and then over to my right we
have the
that I will be keeping so we have
high-end as well as drugstore we've got
some NYX palette so we have a color pop
palette we have at the Kat Von D metal
Maps the ice cream palette a few pellets
that I haven't even tried yet so I
obviously don't want to go ahead and
just butter those quite yet but yeah
those are the 10 pallets I will be
keeping and then over here we have the
10 that I will be decluttering so I hope
you guys enjoyed this declutter video
