channel happy Wednesday today I have
another keep ten a drop 10 at palette
declutter to share with you guys but
today we are going through face palettes
so same sort of format I will be 2
coloring 10 and I will be keeping 10 I'm
thinking there will be a two-part series
for this I definitely don't have as many
face palettes as I do eyeshadow palettes
if you are curious part 3 of the
eyeshadow palette declutter will be
going up the first week of February
anyway without further ado let's go
ahead and jump right into it we are
starting with the Becca Jaclyn hill
champagne collection face palette one of
my all-time favorite face palettes you
have Prosecco pop as well as champagne
pop which are shimmering skin perfecter
press you at Pomplamoose which is a
mineral blush as well as the shade
amaretto which is also a mineral blush
and also rosy spritz it down here I love
this I get so much use out of it so I
absolutely it will not be decluttering
that baby move on to an elf palette here
this is called the total face palette
and I'm actually really addicted to this
it kind of reminds me a little bit I'll
be Jacqueline at champagne collection
face palette I know some people don't
see the comparison they don't see the
difference for me I just feel like a lot
of the blushes and the highlight in here
it does kinda remind me a little bit of
the palette so I'm also actually going
to go ahead and hold on to this one it
looks amazing if you do have a fear to
light complexion so yes I will be going
ahead and holding on to them
oh no okay here we have the lorac
unzipped cheek palette this is an item
that they said was gonna come back in
stock but it never actually did this is
a gorgeous blush palette you guys
unapologetic and unimaginable are
fucking gorgeous okay and I just cannot
let go of this I reach for this all the
time it only retails for $25 or it used
to retail for $25 if you ever see this
make sure you snatch it up I know I've
been having a hard time with lorac
recently but this is definitely
something I just cannot let go of and I
will not let out of my collection moving
on we have the anasazi of Beverly Hills
Sun dipped Guillou kit this is what it
looks like and again I'm gonna have to
go ahead and hold on to this I really
really love my own Nastasia Beverly
Hills the glow kids so I'm gonna hold on
to all of them
my favorite shades in here are
definitely summer as well as moonstone
two different tarts of blush palettes
I'm gonna hold on to one Tarte to blush
palette but it's not going to be either
of these the first one is from the 2016
holiday collection this was called it
the a book of blushes now
it's not what the fuck is this called
color wheel Amazonian clay color wheel
as you guys can see on the inside you
have some cool toned blushes over here
warm tone blushes over here in two
different highlights the highlights in
here suck and the blushes we're pretty
darn good I'm not gonna lie okay no I'm
pissed off at art right now but they
were pretty good however I just don't
want to support this anymore I'm gonna
go ahead and let go of that one and then
when it comes to the big blush book too
this was a piece of shit it absolutely
has to go you have a highlight in the
middle and then a bunch of different
blushes if you saw my review on this in
2016 you know I cannot even get this on
camera you know that this was just not
good quality they were trying to sell it
for $60 but this is not the true
Amazonian clay blush formula very very
powdery they don't go on very pigmented
so yeah I'm gonna say bye-bye to the big
blush book - we do have the Turk toast
contour palette I have recently fallen
in love with the Anastacio Beverly Hills
contour palette so I'm also gonna say
goodbye to this one there were some good
of formulas in here like this creamy
highlight here was nice as well as the
blush but the middle shade was a piece
of shed it wouldn't be a Tarte palette
without a piece of shit in it am i right
M alright so anyway I am gonna actually
go ahead and like this one go as well I
just haven't been reaching for it and
again I'm not supporting Tarte cosmetics
anymore so we're decluttering that and
then here I have the cover FX perfect
highlighting palette for holiday 2017
you guys know I'm not letting go of this
I know it looks so similar to my Nicole
Guerrero glow kit but you guys I'm in
love it's fucking gorgeous I love
everything about this palette especially
the shade right here which is called
blossom so I will not be letting go of
this one I will be keeping it moving on
to a contour a palette that I feel like
comes in a very very close second to the
anastacio Beverly Hills contour palette
and this is the use sculpted palette
from it cosmetics and this is actually
very very nice for a lot of different
skin tones it's very reflective
hopefully you can see here you have a
matte highlight you have a little more
of a shimmery highlight you have a light
contour and soft contour honestly I
reach for this a lot so yes I'm gonna go
ahead and hold on to that one and then
when it comes to violet vos so this is
their highlighting powder trio I talked
about this recently it's a dust
collector it just kind of sits in my
collection I'm gonna declutter this too
and my friend Brittany I think she would
get a lot of use out of it unfortunately
with my really really dry skin this
looks like fucking shit on my skin I
mean it just looks really really chunky
and glitter
so I'm gonna go ahead and let go of that
one actually have the Kat Von D
Alchemist palette I absolutely love this
I love it i do prefer my own associate
beverly hills moon child glow kit over
this one i feel like it's a better bang
for your buck and you basically get the
same sort of shades but I still do reach
for this especially for travel it does
have a mirror in it it's a little better
packaging than the UH Nastasia Beverly
Hills moon child in my opinion so yes I
do like this you can also use it on your
lips and your eyes so I will be holding
on to the cap on Dee Alchemist palette I
saw that they're coming out with a mini
one probably not gonna purchase that but
this one has to stay here we have the
hourglass 2015 holiday palette was this
2015 though I'm sorry this was the 2016
holiday palette now this is really
something that works for fair and light
skin tones I feel like when I am self
tanned it doesn't work as beautifully
but I don't always self tan so I'm gonna
hold on to this you guys know I'm
incredibly partial to hourglass and I
really do love these holiday palettes so
I will be holding on to that one and now
when it comes to the Too Faced cocoa
contour chiseled to perfection kit again
I have a lot of contouring palettes are
for a girl who doesn't really like to
contour so I'm gonna let go of this one
there's a couple shades in here that
really just don't get me excited like
that dark cocoa shade is a little too
warm tone and then also pop of light is
glitter infused so I have had this for
years in my collection I'm gonna have to
see I don't think these have gone bad
but I just want to double-check and kind
of swatch them out see what they look
like so if they have gone bad I will
toss the palette if not I will go ahead
and declutter to a friend here is the
elf illuminating palette I love this I
find this very comparable to hourglass
powders in my opinion so I will be
definitely going ahead and holding on to
that if you want to try out something
similar to our glass like the ambient
lighting powders would highly recommend
looking into this now when it comes to
the urban decay afterglow palette this
is rather new to me but I'm getting a
lot of use out of it and I've been very
happy with it and this is called the ONS
palette which is the one-night-stand
palette I really like the pinky shade in
here as well as cliche which is the
golden color so this is something I will
again be holding on to now here we have
a visa fora blush Bronson ready to glow
face palette I love the packaging I love
the way this looks it's totally my
aesthetic but I've had this well over
probably a year and a half now I just
don't get enough use out of it the
highlight isn't the greatest but the
bronzer and the blushes are gorgeous you
have a cool tone
a warm tone blush obviously purchased
this before going cruelty free I want to
give someone this and they would love
this okay somebody who doesn't have as
large of a collection as me would
probably get a lot of use out of this
palette so I'm gonna go ahead and again
declutter it to a friend if my friends
don't want it then I will be donating it
to charity this is the mega Glo
highlighting a palette now I hate to do
this because I love this formula but
I've been reaching for my singles more
than this and I just feel like I'm not
getting enough use out of it I gave this
an excellent review this is a good
palette okay but I feel like like I said
I'm just reaching for my singles more
than this so I am actually gonna go
ahead and let this one go as well here
is the color pop give me more
highlighting a palette I love to this
when I first got it my friend Brittany
sent this to me and you know I really
used it a lot okay but I have to say I
have developed hard pan on practically
every single shade in here I don't know
if you guys can see when I kind of
tilted it's hard to work with it's not
picking up properly with a brush I've
tried doing the duct tape method where
you kind of take it so that you can get
rid of the hard pan and that's still not
working so I'm gonna go ahead and let
this want to go it's a shame because I
thought this was a nice face palette but
I don't want to work with powders that
get hard pan and then here we have the
lorac take me to tant ego palettes oh
this one is hard this is a beautiful
formula very very similar to the
unzipped cheek palette however I just
feel like I don't bronze all that often
you know and I have my Becca single
bronzers I use those more than this so
again you know yeah I'm gonna let this
go it's a beautiful palette okay if
you're like a bronzer holic you would
probably really enjoy this and look how
deep it goes to like tan to cruise that
shade right there such cute names but
this is a really nice a deep shade with
a little bit of shimmer two of them have
shimmer two of them are matte it's a
beautiful bronzer palette but you know I
just don't get enough use out of it so
I'm gonna let go of that one and finally
we have a Coastal Scents a blush and
bronzer at palette these are actually
pretty good quality you guys but
compared to other palettes in my
collection they just don't stand a
chance they really don't they're silky
they're finely milled they have a decent
amount of pigmentation that blush shade
right there is beautiful but you know I
like I said they just don't compare to
other blushes in my collection the color
selection besides that guy right there
is not that special the bronzer the
highlighter it's just not something that
I am willing to hold on to so again I'm
going to go ahead and like
of that one alright guys looks like I'm
good I have ten a different pallets over
here that I will be holding on to they
include a drugstore high-end and luxury
and then over here I have a ten
different palettes that I will be
decluttering it they do include a
drugstore and high-end so I'm very happy
I was trying to keep count as I went
through some of you were saying last
time that you didn't like when I did the
count out in the middle of the video so
I let that out this time but I tried to
keep track of everything so here are the
ten pallets I will be keeping and over
here we have the ten at pallets that I
will be a decluttering like I said i
declutter to friends as well as donate
to my makeup I do not sell any of it
just so you guys know so anyway that's
it for this video I hope you enjoyed it
the next declutter video will be part 3
in my eye shadow palette declutter so I
hope you guys are excited and I will see
you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
