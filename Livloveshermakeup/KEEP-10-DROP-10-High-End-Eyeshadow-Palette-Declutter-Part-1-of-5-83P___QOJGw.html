and sit down and I'm gonna open these
pallets up for you guys we're gonna take
a look at 20 different high-end
eyeshadow palettes and I want to go
ahead and declutter ten of them I like
to do a very brief list D clutters and I
just feel like my eyeshadow palette
collection has gotten a little out of
hand
recently so I will go ahead and insert a
photo here so you guys can see the
remaining palettes we still need to go
ahead and talk about as well as
declutter but for this video we're gonna
go ahead and declutter ten of them and
keep ten of them I chose them randomly I
really just want to keep the ones that I
truly absolutely love so let's go ahead
and jump right into it alright guys
let's go ahead and start with the
adjuvant nubian 2 palette and this is a
gorgeous palette I love the packaging I
really do enjoy Julius play shadows
however I have to say I don't get a lot
of use out of this I do enjoy quite a
few shades in here like Cleopatra and
Egypt as well as a Sheba and they're
really really beautiful as you guys can
see gorgeous gorgeous colors but like I
said I really just don't get a lot of
use out of this so I think I'm gonna go
ahead and let that one go moving on it
to the autumn anastacio but if I'm an
Anasazi of Beverly Hills a modern a
renaissance palette I adore this palette
there is no way in hell that I am
decluttering it it's gorgeous if you
want a nice a very toned palette with
lots of shimmers as well as mats this is
the one to go with so love this we'll be
keeping it alright moving on to the
lorac unzipped gold palette I have kind
of a weird relationship with this
palette I love the original unzipped
palette and this one definitely has some
beautiful colors in it like this one
right here which is just this gorgeous
kind of like a duochrome sort of gold
like peachy shade it's called
unpredictable Unleashed is also really
really beautiful as you guys can see
and so it's uninhibited uninhibited but
I really don't reach for this very often
because the formula is not to the same
as the original unzipped palette so I
think I'm also going to go ahead and let
that one go moving on to the Kat Von D
is serpentina palette I want to love
this palette I want to keep it but when
I saw that I was pulling this into the
pile when I randomly chose 20 palettes I
kind of knew this one had to go I think
that these shadows are starting to go
bad they go on very very patchy even the
metal crush formula which is
not very normal for the Kat Von D metal
crush formula so I'm going to go ahead
and let this one go it's interesting I
find that my Kat Von D shadows go bad a
little quicker than my other eyeshadow
palettes so I wanted to go ahead and let
you guys know that I don't know if it's
because they're a lot of them are vegan
or just because I have no idea but the
shelf life obviously is 12 months
however this one like literally it's
been what 13 or 14 months and it's bad
normally this doesn't happen with
eyeshadow palettes but it did with this
one so I'm going to go ahead and let it
go moving on to the original lorac
unzipped like I said I really enjoy this
one it's a completely different formula
beautiful rose gold kind of colors going
on here
I'll go ahead and swatch a few see you
can see they're just really really
really stunning they're pigmented
they're blendable definitely a palette
that I want to go ahead and keep in my
collection so I will be keeping that one
alright guys let's move on it to a
palette right here this is actually from
Make Up For Ever this is the artist
shadow palette volume 2 it's called the
artistic aversion I really enjoy the
first volume a little more than this one
so I think I'm gonna go ahead and let go
of this one and I will keep the first
edition up next we have something that I
will definitely be keeping this is the
Kat Von D a saint and sinner palette you
guys know I have been loving this for
the holiday season it is absolutely
beautiful at love the packaging love
pretty much everything about this let me
go ahead and tilt it so you can see all
the different colors it's gorgeous
the layout in here is a little different
but I really do enjoy this so I will be
going ahead and holding on to that up
next we have the tartlets in bloom
palette and this is my all-time favorite
or I guess I should say my second
all-time favorite palette from a chart
I'm not a huge fan of a lot of charts
eyeshadow palettes so this kind of says
a lot so I will be going ahead and
holding on to this guy up next we have
the Anastacio Beverly Hills a self-made
palette I recently talked about how I
never got my hands on this and actually
one of my friends ended up sending it to
me so thank you so much it's a beautiful
but as you guys can see I haven't even
touched anything in here yet so I need
to use it so I will go ahead and hold on
to this one so I can try it out if it's
not any good
and then I will absolutely declutter up
next I have the Urban Decay heavy-metal
palette right here I really have been
enjoying this I love the colors in here
the Blues as well as the Purple's
everything is just absolutely gorgeous
so I will be going ahead and holding
onto this palette let me do some
swatches for you guys of the neutrals as
well as the pops of color
these are just absolutely beautiful
beautiful kind of lid toppers so if
you're looking for a good palette and
that is very very shimmery a few shades
have a few kind of like glitter infused
particles in there but you just want to
put them on your litter on your lower
lash line this is definitely a palette I
would recommend moving on to the Too
Faced a sugar pop palette so this is the
cute little colorful palette but
unfortunately you know is it unfortunate
I don't know I don't know what to say I
love at the 9pn palettes from Too Faced
but I kind of feel like this needs to go
my biggest issue is that I love one of
the shades in here called strawberry ice
it's so beautiful and so unique it's
kind of like a lavender hue with a
little bit of like a blueshift to it I
don't know you guys but I feel like this
needs to go because I rarely reach for
it I do love the shade blackberry too
though no no no I'm gonna go ahead and
let go of it I have better colorful
palettes in my collection so this one's
gonna go alright moving on to my very
very very very messy but well-loved
lorac Pro 3 palette so this is actually
the mega Pro if this is what it looks
like on the inside I hate the white
packaging but as you guys can probably
see this is a very well-loved palette I
love this
I do enjoy this one because I like the
tones in here a lot of the eye looks
that I get are very very similar but
it's beautiful so I will be going ahead
and holding on to that alright moving
right along it to the viola foss Pro
eyeshadow palette this is called the
ride-or-die palette I really enjoy this
this is the best formula that viola Voss
has ever released I don't think it's
worth the 60 70 $80 price tag I mean I
shouldn't say that it is worth it but
only if you can get this at a discounted
price if you can get this for 40 that's
perfect but for 60 dollars it is very
very expensive but you are getting all
sorts of colors in here as you guys can
see beautiful beautiful warm tones as
well as cool tones you're getting
neutrals you're getting yellows you're
getting duo chrome finishes you're
getting shimmers you're
so much in here so I'm going to go ahead
and hold on to of that all right so
moving it right along here we have my
all-time favorite Tarte palette
currently this is the tarte let toasted
palette I actually enjoyed this more
than the in bloom even though I am a
huge lover of cool tone shadows and this
just speaks to me it's absolutely
gorgeous let me do some swatches for you
guys so you can see I feel like the
shimmers in here are a little more
firmly pressed however the Matteson here
are super blendable and beautiful so and
that is the Tarte toasted palette and I
will be going ahead and holding on to it
okay I feel like I need to do a little
bit of a check-in here so I can keep
track of what I'm keeping and what I am
not keeping so these are the products
that I will not be keeping we have let's
see here one two three four five so I
want another five pallets declutter
let's see if we can do it and then over
here are any pallets that I will be
keeping we have one two three four five
six seven eight nine so one more I'm
gonna let myself have one more a lot of
these colors are looking very similar to
me so I want to make sure that I choose
something maybe a little different but
yeah let's continue right along alright
guys moving on into a little quaint here
that I have from Estee Lauder this is
called the provocative petal Quint and I
do enjoy it but there's a shade in here
that I just don't like and I have so
many you know palettes that have similar
colors to this and this is the shade I
don't like it's really really useless
and not special at all so I know this is
beautiful and very luxurious I'm gonna
go ahead and let it go up and next ooh
this is gonna be hard this is the Urban
Decay Naked on the Run palette I used to
get so much use out of this when I
traveled but nowadays I really traveled
with my Stila perfect to me perfect hue
palette so I think I'm gonna let this go
I don't know how I'm going to declutter
it because as you guys can see I already
used up the lip gloss as well as the
mascara and eyeliner in here but
basically you have a bronzer you have a
highlights and a blush and then you have
five different eyeshadows this shade
right here is gorgeous but you know I
have stuff like this in my collection so
I'm going to go ahead and let that
go uh-oh Oh God you guys I'm looking at
these pallets right now and I'm thinking
oh my god what am I gonna keep and what
I'm not going to keep all right here we
have the lorac pro 3 so I showed you
guys the mega Pro this is the regular
Pro and this one is beautiful it's a
very very neutral but I feel like if I
keep the mega Pro I don't need this one
it's kind of a dust collector in my
collection a lot of these shades blend
together so I'm gonna go ahead and let
go of this one but if you are a taupe
lover and you need this eyeshadow
palette in your collection for sure here
we have a beautiful color for a little
bit a colorful eyeshadow palette from
Urban Decay I kind of want to keep this
but I'm looking over and seeing that I
have my Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette which I absolutely refuse to
declutter and I only get to pick one
more so I'm gonna go ahead and let go of
this a lot of these are actually not
even ice safe which a lot of people
don't know beautiful beautiful bright
colors but you know what I have
something similar from NYX so yeah I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of the Urban
Decay electric palette I don't sound so
sure it myself but I'm gonna do it
alright speaking of the semi-sweet
palette I have to keep this so this is
my last pick that I will be keeping it
is the semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
my all-time favorite chocolate bar
palette a lot of people look past this
one but if you want warm tones and cool
tones and this is the one for you the
chocolate bonbons palette has all cool
tones the original one has all warm
tones which i decluttered and this guy
right here is the best I don't like that
pink sugar shade but everything else in
here is beautiful so I'll be going ahead
and holding on to that and finally we
have the lorac nude necessities palette
oh I kind of want to hold on to this but
at the same time I'm like why though I
feel like I have so many shades like
this in my collection it's kind of like
my go-to transition palette but you know
I don't need it I just don't need it I
have plenty of shades like this so I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of that
alright guys so let's go ahead and check
the pile alright guys I made it happen
