today's video is going to be my nail
polish declutter for 2017 I have a lot
of nail polishes here that I never use
if you didn't know I'm a professional
classical flutist so I really I can't
wear acrylics I can't do anything fancy
with my nails why the hell I have all of
this I don't really know but I am gonna
be a tough on myself this time kind of
like I always am with my declutter I'll
go ahead and throw up in the cards like
my whole declutter playlist if you want
to see all of that from like skincare I
think I did a perfume one last year I've
done the nail polish one and then
obviously makeup as well but yeah I like
to be tough on myself because I do
believe if I'm going to be buying as
much as I do I need to be able to get
through so anyway I can't do that
if I have way too many nail polishes so
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
am going to be keeping four of these and
a glitter as well as a like base coat or
top coat
I guess I'll pick a top coat so I want
to keep one for spring one for summer
one for fall and one for winter and I
know that sounds kind of like insane if
you're like a huge nail person I'm sure
that that's gonna just kill you inside
but for me I'm just not an again I just
I don't need all this so let's go ahead
and jump right into it over here is
going to be my key pin and then over
there is going to be the little bit that
we put you know like the bad stuff in
the stuff that is not going but the
stuff that has gone bad and then here is
the declutter pile and I don't think I
can donate these nail polishes you guys
know that I'm donating to a women's
shelter in my area as far as makeup is
concerned or most of my makeup but I
think I'll just go ahead and declutter
these two friends so anyway let's jump
right into it the first one I have here
is a very very dark kind of like I don't
even know it's like a really really
reddish kind of shade and it is called
feverish it's from color what is this
called color club I feel like I got this
in like an Ipsy bag or something I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go here I
have a nicole by OPI this is a really
pretty shade it's called lavender a
marquise I believe wait now this one's
called lavender Marquis this one is
called to do miss independence super
super beautiful but I'm gonna go ahead
and let it go because I want to keep
this one as my spring polish this is the
Sally Hansen diamond strengthen me
lacquer
in lavender marquees so I'm gonna keep
that as my spring polish this is a
beautiful beautiful kind of like greener
shade I'm really tempted to keep this as
my fall polish however I'm not gonna do
it because I feel like I would rather
have a red shade but this is from
prevail and the shade is called dirty
moss so I'm gonna let go of that I have
a glitter here in the shade copper this
is from Sally Hansen gonna let go of
that this is the sinful colors nail
polish in the shade lavender and it's
gone bad so we're gonna go ahead and let
that go I have an Essie nail polish

really pretty kind of turquoise shade
this one is called venom I'm gonna let
that go
this is the machiya this is like a red
kind of pretty really really pretty
shade kind of want to keep it for like
the holidays and also for fall but I
have my eye on something else from Wet n
Wild it's like my all-time favorite
formula so I'm gonna let go of that
here is another SEO polish this one is
in a let's say your a really really
bright color this is called let's see
risky business it looks like it's
getting a little liquidy but I think
it's okay it's like a really bright red
orange so I'm gonna let go of that I
have two of the galaxy nails from what
is this nails ink I'm gonna keep the
silver one as my glitter it's called a
buckingham place and then Knightsbridge

alright so here is a butter London nail
polish in the shade shag I'm gonna go
ahead and let that go and this is
disturbia from wet and wild I love this
formula the fall nail polish I want to
keep is in this formula but this
particular shade doesn't exactly get me
too excited so I'm gonna let go of that
I have a CIT glitter right here super
pretty but gonna let go of that
another NYC glitter this is in a baby
pink can let go of that I have an elf
nail polish in the shade midnight super
super beautiful should I keep this as my
