have another review for you guys today
at this time I'm really excited I get
really excited anytime there's like a
lip product out and I end up loving it
and that's what happened with this one
this is the carry grand whip whip and it
says be kind to your skin so basically
this is some little box it comes in um
these are liquids that are basically new
to Sephora they go for $15 a piece and
they have a tinted one they have one
that's naked which means there's no tint
to it no color and then they have a
radiant tinted one that is for twenty
dollars and it's a little more but it
has a little more of a tint anyway so
the tinted one just the regular tinted
one and the naked one go for $15 on the
Sephora website and I have already gone
back on ordered one of the naked ones
and ordered the radiant tinted one
because I love it that much I've been
using this only for probably like a week
but it's amazing so this is what the
actual product looks like like I said it
goes for $15 on the Support website
it comes in two different sense you can
get peppermint or cinnamon
I got cinnamon I love cinnamon so umm I
definitely thought that would be a good
choice for me
and like I said it's definitely like a
lip balm but it's like this wonderful
whipped formula and I think one of the
best things about this is that
immediately when you think that it's
like you know kind of like a jelly
because it looks like it's a jelly like
on the skin too it looks like it's a
jelly it actually is free of petroleum
it's free of petroleum jelly so you know
it's not gonna be sitting on top of the
skin and it's also formulated without
gluten and all these kind of things and
it's just it's amazing so anyway I got
the one in cinnamon and as you guys can
see it has a really really light tint to
it like barely anything but still
something that's there I like to wear
this on days where I have some really
bad dry chapped lips or days where I'm
like performing or something you guys
know I'm a flute player and I can't deal
with like a long wearing lipstick or
something drying on my lips this gives
me literally just the right amount of
moisture and just a little bit of a tint
so that like I don't know
so we put a little on right now as we
speak it's just so easy
it's so nice it smells so good as smells
look really lightly of cinnamon it does
not make my lips tingle or anything but
they also have a pepper in one if you do
not like cinnamon really nice and glossy
it's just so good I know that there's
not like tons I can say about a lip balm
it's like okay it's a lip balm but you
guys I have to say this is up there with
my bite Beauty agave lip mask like this
is on the same level okay so good so I
mean I'm just really really impressed
I'm so happy that I picked this up um on
the website I was looking at it I was
like $15 you know like come on it's like
the bite agave lip mask which is almost
30 it's like come on you know like
really for a lip balm but this one is so
incredibly worth it I can't tell you
enough go into Sephora you know try a
little on see if you like it I guarantee
you will the texture is just so amazing
and it's so different to you know
thinking of like a whip it does have a
little bit of a like I don't want
to say a shimmer in it but like a shine
to it as you can see on the lips but
it's just it's so good you guys okay I'm
gonna read a little bit about what it
says on the actual Sephora website it
says Cary Grant tinted lip quick it says
you can pick cinnamon or peppermint and
they are $15 each it is an eco luxe lip
balm with organic non-gmo and wild
harvested ingredients for ultra hydrated
lips with a subtle slightly pink color
what it is formulated to do radiant
tinted lip it gives a subtle slightly
pink hue to your lips it moisturizes for
hours without feeling heavy oily or
sticky this is an all natural
multitasking formula and can be used
alone as a lip treatment or over a
lipstick or lip Sheen for a glossy boost
it is free of parabens sulfates and
fettle aids and it is cruel it is a
cruelty free product formulated without
gluten and without petroleum and I do
want to mention here is the ingredient
list on the back and I'm just gonna read
like a few for you guys the first thing
in there is castor seed oil the second
thing is organic some
our oil then you have organic um
camellia oil organic olive oil you know
you have all these wonderful wonderful
oils vitamin E oil you of organic
cinnamon extract just wonderful
wonderful ingredients and I think that's
so cool because
it's it really works and I love that it
doesn't have petroleum jelly in it I
have gotten so many products lately that
are filled with petroleum jelly and
sometimes I feel that yes it really does
protect my lips and make sure that I
don't have any incoming like
environmental damage coming at my lips
however it also doesn't completely sink
into the lips petroleum jelly is
something that stays on top of the lips
to seal in other you know things from
coming in so it's like a barrier but
this one doesn't
it feels like it's petroleum jelly but
it's free of petroleum jelly so you know
it's not so it's really just all these
great oils um pimento berry oil organic
you know cinnamon oil peppermint oil
really really good ingredient list and
just a really really great product so
like I said I think it is worth it for
$15 I already have gotten the naked one
which is the clear color I'm gonna use
that at nighttime I use this one during
the day and then I also giving the
radiant tinted one and I'm gonna use
that one during the day I guess I have a
little more color so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this review I love this
product I will link below where you guys
can pick it up and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
