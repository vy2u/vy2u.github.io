video is going to be a quick review
swatches or hopefully a quick review
swatches in comparison on the new Kat
Von D Alchemist holographic palette I
have to get going pretty soon so I do
want to kind of get through this quickly
but we are going to be comparing this to
the Anastasi of Beverly Hills moon child
glow kit if you guys didn't know the
stood released today for vib and vib
Rouge members this was not sent to me I
was able to get my hands on it a few
days ago when Sephora actually made a
mistake and basically open this up to
the public so about a hundred people got
their pallets I just didn't want to
review it until everybody could get it
so anyway this is $32 like I said it is
exclusive it is new and I believe it is
limited edition it is an eye lip and
face transformer palette that does have
four different holographic shades in
here each each pan size is 0.05 ounces
or 1.5 3 grams and the shades are
emerald sapphire amethyst opal and yeah
this is a formulated without parabens
sulfates battle AIDS and it is cruelty
free since it is cap on D so here is
what the outer packaging looks like it
is really really cute I love this little
it looks like the Illuminati or
something it's like a beautiful little
white triangle it does show the
ingredients on the back which i think is
awesome Kat Von D is really really good
with her ingredients usually and then
this is what the actual palette looks
like again love this I don't know if the
light is catching it right but when you
put this in direct sunlight it actually
starts changing colors and basically the
light bounces off of it like a
holographic pellet so that is what it
looks like you do open it up and it is a
little triangle you do have a little bit
of a mirror here you can flip the spine
back all the way which I do like and
here are the four shades that you are
getting so when you first look at this
you may think wow those look very very
similar I'm actually wearing one of them
on my cheekbones today I have a few on
my eyes I feel like this palette really
really really changes when you actually
do put it on your skin it is very
different in that sense you know
compared to the honest hacia moonshell
glow kit because I feel like when you
open this one up the colors that you're
seeing are the colors you're going to
get on your actual face but with the
alchemist I feel like they really do
start to change once you put them onto
your skin and I do feel like they have
more of a holographic effect to them
this is more of like a duo chrome effect
so I do notice there are definitely some
shade similarities in here if you guys
didn't know the honest hacia Beverly
Hills moonchild glow kit is
minute now and this is only $40 you are
getting huge pan sizes in here you can
use this on your eyes on your face I
primarily use it on for highlighting
and I really really do enjoy it I will
say I think the alchemists eyeshadow
palette or I mean just the alchemist
palette in general is better for
eyeshadow I feel like it really shows up
very very nicely the MU child glow kid
you know it's kind of meant for your
actual skin so this has the sort of
formulation where you can use it on your
eyes or on your cheekbones so the moon
child sometimes I notice that I do get a
lot of kick up and it gets a little
powdery around my eye area so if you
want a holographic palette that not only
you can wear on your cheekbones but also
you want something you can wear on your
eyes I would highly recommend checking
this out so as far as price point is
concerned you definitely get way more
product with the Anastasia Beverly Hills
you are getting more shades in here and
for the price you really just can't beat
it if you already do own this one I
don't think that you need this but if
you do want like a little pocket sized
version of basically the moon child glow
kit I think you would like this a lot so
like I said the shades definitely become
a lot more reflective once you actually
put them onto your face I do have this
one right here a blue sapphire on the
inner corner of my eye I do have pink
opal on as my actual highlight and then
I have ultra violet amethyst on kind of
on my lid and I just really love the way
they go on they are very very thick but
for some reason they go onto the eyes
really nicely like finely milled the one
thing about the anastacio Beverly Hills
moonchild that I noticed was that some
of these do get a little chunky around
the eye area like I said and you really
do have to build them you do not have to
do that with the Alchemist palette so if
you already have the moonshell glow kit
I do not think you need these I will
show or this particular palette I will
show you guys side-by-side swatches they
are very very similar to each other but
if you do want a little pocket size
version with a really nice formulation
that you can use everywhere on your face
I would recommend this so let's go ahead
and do some swatches the first shade we
are going to swatch is green and world
so I will see the formulation when you
put your brush in here it really really
does kick up a lot of product now I
don't notice that the Anastacio Beverly
Hills moonshell glow kit does that as
much it is a different formulation than
their other glow kids but this one kick
us up a lot of powder now I don't notice
that I actually get a lot of Fallout
which is weird because it really picks
up a lot but if you tap off your brush
and put it on your eyes it actually goes
on very beautiful
so here is the shade green emerald and
you can also wear this on your lips I
have a little bout of cold sores right
now so I'm not wearing this on my lips
but I do want to try it out that way so
here is the for shade green emerald
really really really gorgeous as you
guys can see the second shade that we
have here is called a blue sapphire and
it is that one right there I feel like
it just looks so similar in the actual
um you know palettes but when you swatch
them you can really see the difference
so let me show you guys you can see when
I'm putting this on there is a little
bit of chunkiness that's kind of falling
out but for some reason it just doesn't
apply to the face like that which is
kind of interesting
the moonchild palette is also kind of
like that so kind of funny I don't know
if it's like a holographic formulation
thing or just like duo Chrome's that
seem to feel a little grittier but they
do apply very nicely to the skin so that
is the shade blue sapphire next we have
altra violent amethyst and this is
gorgeous
has lots and lots of like blue and
purple undertones I'm not going to talk
too much about like what the color is
because it's pretty much the whole
rainbow but there is the swatch as you
guys can see super super pretty and then
the last one that we have here is called
pink opal and that's again what I have
on as my highlight this reminds me a lot
of the pink hearts shade from the moon
shell glow kit so here is pink opal so
here they are little powdery like I said
also watched on the back of my hand very
beautiful very very pigmented I do think
these have a little more pigment than
the moon shell glow kit the moon shadow
blow kit like I said when you look at
them that is the color that you're going
to get but you do kind of build them up
on the skin if you want something that's
just like wham bam in your face
holographic I would highly recommend
checking this one out so let's go ahead
and I'm going to show you guys these
swatches that are very very similar from
this palette so the first one that we
have on top like I said was green
emerald I feel like Lucky Clover is very
very similar from the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills moonshell the glow kits so I'm
going to go ahead and swatch that you'll
be able to see the formulation on these
are just a little more sheer than the
Kat Von D so there they are together
very very similar they do have that
green undertone which is so so so cool
and then the second one like I said we
have a blue sapphire and I feel like
this one is kind of similar to the star
shade from the moon child glow kit it's
hard to tell because the blue sapphire
shade when it's in the pan it doesn't
look like anything really but let me go
ahead and swatch that for you guys so
here is the star shade not an exact dupe
so there they are and then the next one
that we had swatch was ultra violet
amethyst and I do feel like blue moon
and purple horseshoe are very very
similar to that so let's go ahead and do
blue moon and I will show you guys what
that looks like
let's do purple horseshoe horseshoe
first I cannot say that because I feel
like this one's definitely a little more
purpley has a lot of kick up but I think
that that is the most similar shade and
then the last one we have a swatch was
pink opal like I said pink heart is very
very similar to that I actually love the
shade in the honesty of Beverly Hills so
we're going to put that on so these are
the shades that are very very similar
here is the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
Moon child and here is the cap on D like
almost exactly dupes
but I will say I feel like the
formulation on this little guy even
though when you put your brush in it
does have a lot of kick up I feel like I
do like the formulation just a little
bit better on the alchemists palette but
the moon child is great and you get a
lot of product in there so I don't think
it's necessary for you to pick it you
know pick the alchemist salad up if you
already have the moon child but if you
do want a little mini version I think
it's great to have so again let's go
ahead and do those close-ups swatches
here is the alchemists palette all four
shades and then here is the moon child
and of there they are side by side so I
really really like this holographic
trend I am so down for wearing like a
purple highlight or a pink highlight or
a green highlight so I really do enjoy
this I do want to give some brush
recommendations the first one I want to
recommend is the Alexi 5:22 tapered
highlighter if you are going to put this
on as an actual highlight or the
alchemist palette I just feel like
because they do kick up a lot of
products you really want to tap it off
and then just go really lightly on the
skin I don't feel like these emphasize a
lot of texture or anything like that
which is really interesting because like
I said when you swatch them and when you
put your
rush in there they do kick up a little
bit of product so they definitely apply
to the skin a lot better than they
swatch and I'm just really really
impressed with this guy the wear time
isn't super super super excuse me the
wear time is not super super super
strong but I do think it's better if
you're wearing a primer a sticky
foundation or you know even like a
setting spray I feel like they we're
about the same I noticed that if I put
on like the pink opal shade it will kind
of start to dissipate throughout the day
and I don't really have as much of like
the pink shade in there more just like a
white kind of highlight going on but
very very pretty it's not anything
noticeable when it does start to kind of
dissipate on the face and yeah super
super impressive both of these I
personally I'm going to keep both
because I think they are absolutely
amazing
but if you already have one you probably
don't need the other another brush
recommendation for is the alchemists
palette is definitely a fan brush I feel
like if you just go in there really
really lightly it looks great on the
skin however I will say a lot of the
brushes don't really fit in there very
well because these are super super tiny
pan sizes so yeah that is pretty much it
guys if you already have the moonchild
like I said you don't need this one but
if you love holographic stuff then you
should get it it is really good so that
is it thank you so much for joining me
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
