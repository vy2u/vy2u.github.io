thank you so much for joining me I
really hope you guys are having a
fantastic Friday so far in this video I
am giving you guys a quick little review
and swatches on this new Kat Von D
everlasting lip duo that I found for $19
on the sephora.com website and will of
course link in the description bar where
you guys can pick up this little kit if
you are interested but inside here you
get two point ten fluid ounces of Kat
Von D's liquid lipsticks in the shade I
believe it's melancholia or melancholia
and Suspiria so Suspiria is that what I
have on my lips right now it is an ultra
violet shade and then melancholia and
melancholia is a kind of like petal pink
color first of all let me know if I'm
saying those names right and second of
all what do they mean are they tattoo
terms I'm not quite sure I really don't
know what those names mean but very very
cool and unique names anyway this is
supposed to be a lip contouring kit so
basically kind of like the ombre lip
trend as you guys can see on the front
of the box the girl right here the
little model she has melancholia on the
inside of her lips and then on the
outside she has outlined with the shade
Suspiria so I obviously am NOT wearing
it like that today I'm not a huge fan of
this ombre lip trend that's just me
personally I don't think it looks good
on my lips I think you need to have like
fuller lips than me for it to look good
so I obviously do not have them on like
that today but I did try yesterday I did
try out a little bit of like a ombre
sort of thing last night and I did like
the way it looked I will say these don't
layer particularly well so what I
recommend doing if you do want to do the
ombre effect is to outline with the
Suspiria shade and don't fill in your
lips completely with the shape just go
on the outside and then fill it in with
melancholy or melancholia because if you
put down a full layer of Suspiria all
over your lips and then try and go in
with melancholia you're gonna have some
issues because I don't feel like liquid
lipsticks this formula or really any
formula layer very well or very nicely
on the lips because they just start to
get a little crumbly the overall you do
get a nice amount of product in here for
$19 these are both point 10 fluid ounces
the packaging is really cute
typical Kat Von D with a little like
rose thing going on here there's
Suspiria and here's melancholia and I
think the two together are very very
pretty
or if you just want to wear them alone
that like I have today I think they're
perfect for spring so for $19 I think
this kid is really really cute I will
say I am adoring this formula I think
the formula is absolutely beautiful the
liquid lipstick that I would compare it
to the formulation would probably be the
Stila um what are these called the Stila
stay all day liquid lipsticks I feel
like the formulation is very very
similar to these they go on and they
kind of have like a little bit of a I
don't want to say the formula is very
thick because it's not I feel like it's
almost a little more liquidy they're
kind of similar to the Lime Crime
cashmere lip creams they're sort of
similar to that but I would say the
formulation that I would compare it to
the most is probably the Stila stay all
day liquid lipsticks which are very
comfortable to wear on the lips and so
are these these stay on forever I'm not
even kidding you can pair them with like
a lip primer I personally have the Laura
Geller lip spackle and I do like the way
these those go on with that but for the
most part I think they're very very
comfortable to wear on the lips I am a
flute-player so I'm very very picky
about what I put on my lips I am able to
practice my flute without any of this
color rubbing off onto my head joint and
I just think that they Laster an
incredibly long time like I said if they
do start to wear off a little bit like
on the inside of the lip I would
recommend just going ahead and taking
off the whole product and then
reapplying because I do not find that
these go on like you can't really layer
them very well they start to get a
little crumbly and you know you'll start
to notice the little fine lines and
wrinkles in your lips so if you do want
to reapply them throughout the day I
highly recommend just taking the product
off and then putting it back on for the
most part I would say these definitely
last for me personally with eating and
drinking a good seven to nine hours
which is incredible for a lipstick even
when I'm teaching and practicing and all
that kind of stuff so love the wear time
on these I think they're extremely
comfortable I don't feel like I have
anything on my lips right now I
literally just looked in the viewfinder
to like check to see if I actually add
something on my lips like I can't even
remember that I put this on this morning
so it's very very comfortable I'm really
enjoying the formula and I think this
little duo is definitely worth it if you
are into the purpley and pinky colors
for spring so let me go ahead and swatch
them so you guys can see what they look
like
they smell a little bit on the sweets
I feel like a lot of liquid lipstick
smell like that but they're kind of
sweet-smelling and I will say one of the
things that I love about these just like
the Sela ones is that they go on really
really evenly I don't get any sort of
streaking with these I personally got a
lot of streaking with the Too Faced
liquid lipsticks
I'm the new ones that came out so I was
like oh I hope these aren't like that
but they're not they go on very very
nicely and yes if you are curious and
this is the first time I have tried this
formulation out I know what's that one
thing that everybody raves about Lolita
or something like that never tried it
never tried it out so yeah this is the
first my first time with this
formulation and I really really love it
so on the top there we have melancholia
or melancholia one little layer and then
we have Suspiria on the bottom again if
you want to do the ombre lip thing I do
think it's pretty for me personally I'm
just not really into it I don't think it
looks good on my lips but I think these
colors care very very beautifully
together and I'm really really happy
with this little duo highly recommend I
mean this is under $20 and they last a
long time there are very pretty colors
and they're very very comfortable to
wear on the lips so I hope you guys
enjoyed this quick little review and
swatches on the new cap on D everlasting
lip duo thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
