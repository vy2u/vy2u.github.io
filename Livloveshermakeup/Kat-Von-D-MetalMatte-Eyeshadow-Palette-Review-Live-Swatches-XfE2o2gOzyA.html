review and swatches for you today and we
are doing live swatches and also I'm
going to do a little bit of a comparison
we are talking about the new metal matte
eyeshadow palette from Kat Von D I'm
obsessed with this I'm absolutely
obsessed with this my purchase is for
$60 on the Sephora comm website this is
probably the most excited I have been
for a holiday eyeshadow palette so far
so like this season so anyway here is
what the outer packaging looks like I
will leave a link down below where you
guys can pick up the product if you are
interested a few of you were asking me
if those are affiliate links they are
not I don't use affiliate links on my
channel so don't worry it will just take
you directly to these sephora.com
websites but anyway this is what the
actual outer packaging looks like it
does show you all of the metallic shades
that you get on the top and then the
matte shades on the bottom I want to say
really quickly before we go into this I
normally don't watch reviews before I
review a product myself because I don't
want to feel like I'm being swayed a
certain direction now I'm not the kind
of personality that really gets swayed a
certain direction anyway but I usually
just try and you know keep to myself
a review a product and then I'll watch
other reviews but I've watched I think
three or four reviews on this product so
far and I just have to pick disagree
completely with what people are saying a
lot of people are saying the be foiled
sheets or the metallic sheets are
absolutely beautiful which I agree with
but they're also saying that the matte
shades are very chalky hard to blend not
easy to work with and I just have to
disagree with that you guys I think that
this particular eyeshadow palette is one
of the best cap on the eyeshadow palette
I have ever had in my life and I have
done a lot of decluttering of Kat Von D
eyeshadow palettes I decluttered her
shade and light palette there have been
plenty a palettes from her that I
thought were complete and that I
just you know went ahead and decluttered
but I have to say this one is just
amazing I'm very very impressed with it
and it's definitely my favorite holiday
eyeshadow palette so far so what I'm
going to compare it to today is the
serpentina palette this is what the
packaging looks like on the two of these
you can see the serpentina palette looks
absolutely mini compared to this this
thing is absolutely huge I do love that
it is a magnetic closure it feels nice
and sturdy
kind of like the serpentina but this
one's obviously heavier you are getting
a whole lot of product in here which I
appreciate and I do think it's worth the
$60 on the back it does show you
metallic shades or the foiled sheets on
top and then L at the matte shades on
the bottom and this is just such a cool
palette now the reason I am comparing it
to these serpentina palette is because I
did not pick up last year's holiday
palette so I know that a lot of people
in these reviews that I had watched they
were comparing it to last year's palette
because I can't compare it to that maybe
that's why I think that the masks in
here are so good but maybe last year's
palette had even better mattes I'm not
quite sure but all I know is that this
is one of the best Kat Von D pallets
I've ever personally picked up so right
here on the inside with a huge mirror
but you do appreciate we have a really
nice flexible spine as well on the
actual palette and here are all of the
shades so like I said the metallic or
kind of foiled eyeshadows are on top and
then you have the bats on the bottom
coolest color selection ever right so
right here we just have some basic
shades then we have some nice kind of
like hunter green shades some more
earthy tones right here we get into a
little bit of like pastels and then over
here this kind of reminds me of her
little coffin quads or quints that she
came out with this one is kind of like
that um plummy plummy Quint or quad
whatever it was I really like these
shades so the matte shades in general I
think are really cool I don't have a
whole lot of eye shadows to have like
peachy matte shades like that or like a
yellow shade like that again if you had
last year's palette which had so many
different colors in it you may not feel
the need to get this year's palette but
if you do not get last year's palette
you need this you really do and then the
actual foil sheets on top we have some
nice and neutral shades here of really
gorgeous kind of yellow color here we
have some nice little lid shades here
these have I don't know like little bits
of shimmer in them obviously their
foiled but they also have like I don't
know nice like purpley iridescent tones
in here some gray shades and then we
have some deeper bluish and greenish
colors so it's not like the most neutral
palette on the face of the earth but I
think it's so cool and I think it's
really awesome what I like about this is
that you don't have to pull in another
palette when I was talking about excuse
me sorry guys I know I'm starting to get
a little sick with a cold or something
but when I was talking about these
serpentina palette which I'll leave the
link for this review down below I was
saying that you do have to go ahead and
pull in another eyeshadow palette with
this you do have to find something that
will be act as a nice transition shade
you do have to find something that will
actively brow bone shade with this
particular
like you don't have to do that you can
literally put this um you know
underneath your brow and that's a great
like highlighting shade you have suede
right here and also Bona which are
perfect as well for transition shades
you know you just have so much in here
and I actually think that it can stand
on its own so if you are a color lover
and you do like tones like this I think
you would love this palette if last
year's palette was a little too much for
you and you do want something a little
more neutral I think this kind of takes
a step back from last year's palette
again I never got Lester's palette but
just I'm looking at videos and also
pictures it does seem like this one is a
little more muted but I think it's a
great way to play with color and I also
get some nice like pastel II shades I
think that's so cool so overall very
very impressed with this the formulation
is impeccable on all of these I really
think that these are some of the best
matte eyeshadows that I have ever gotten
from you know Kat Von D in general with
these serpentina palette I did feel like
the match sheets in here like blood milk
and also venom and venom is right there
and then blood milk is on the other side
I did feel like those were quite
Scratchy but it didn't matter at the end
of the day because the way that they
applied to the eye was beautiful they
blended really nicely and yes you did
have to spend maybe a little more time
but I felt like they were very pigmented
and I think sometimes we forget it's
more about how it goes on the eyes
rather than how it swatches out you know
we I can complain all day about
something that feels like sandpaper but
goes onto the skin beautifully because
that's like the same thing with the
Bobbi Brown highlighting palette that I
talked about recently it literally
sounds like sandpaper when you brush
against it it feels like sandpaper you
put it on your face it's like the most
gorgeous highlight ever so anyway I feel
like that's kind of what's happening
here with this particular palette a
little bit because I think people are
feeling these matte shades and thinking
that they're not like the most soft and
buttery like lorac pro kind of
formulation but I still think they're
actually very soft and buttery and
definitely a lot softer and more buttery
and then these serpentina mattes in here
so anyway overall I think this is a
wonderful palette I do think that the
foiled sheets or these shades at the top
which are the metallics to do crease a
little bit when I Pat them on my eye
which is what I usually do with like a
foiled eyeshadow I do think that they
creased slightly now if you do work them
into the crease they do take a little
more effort
I wouldn't recommend like you know I
know some people file their foil
eyeshadows
personally wouldn't do that because then
I feel like they're really hard to buff
into the crease but overall I think that
these are just really nice lid colors
and then you can go in with these and
work with those mats into the crease so
overall very very impressed with this I
really have nothing but good things to
say I think the wear time is really good
they're very easy to blend and overall
this is a really cool color selection so
let's go ahead and starts watching shall
we we are going to start up here with
nebula and work our way down for the
foiled shades so the first shade we have
here is nebula oh my god this feels like
a little baby spot okay it's so
beautiful there is a nebula it's
gorgeous
it is a very very metallic blue color
and here it is swatched and as you guys
can see since it is foiled there is no
skipping and there is no powdery kick up
it's just absolutely stunning the next
shade we have is called watt and this is
a gorgeous gorgeous kind of aquamarine
sort of greenish blue color I think it's
beautiful really really liked this a lot
so there it is is it wet or watch it's W
ATT wet watch something like that there
it is beautiful beautiful color they've
actually that we have here is called
ignite and ignite it's really really
soft light kind of I guess this one
would be more aquamarine but this one
has a little more baby blue to it with a
bit of a silvery undertone so there is
ignite and again you can imagine any of
these on the lid I think it's just
absolutely stunning then we have tinsel
and tinsel or tinsel yeah tinsel I swear
sometimes with Kat Von D I shut up Hulk
I'm like what is that name tinsel is
just a beautiful pure kind of silvery
color I did go ahead and swatch out the
lorac mega pro 3 palette today and I was
talking about how I didn't really love
these silvery shades and there this is
what I wish those had been so this one
does have a little more not grit to it
they're all very soft and buttery the
metallic shades are but I do feel like
this one has a little more fallout it
definitely has a little more sparkle to
it but it still goes on really really
beautifully as you guys can probably see
one thing I do want to say about these
shadows is that they sustain like a mofo
okay like they really really stain your
fingers so you have to be very careful
about that if you are passing this on to
your
with your fingers you will have stained
fingers alright moving on the next tip
we have is glitz and glitter stat
perfect champagne eeee pinky color to
put all over your lid really really
beautiful love this
there is glitz so hopefully you guys can
see all of those really really stunning
love these and then the next shade we
have is twinkle and twinkle is a perfect
periwinkle light purple I love this
shades so pretty all over the lid there
is the shade twinkle do you just see
like how high shine and beautiful these
are I think they're just they're
stunning I am so excited about this
ballot the next shade we have is a bolt
in both is a nice and deep kind of
purpley color it's got a little bit of a
maroon undertone but it's still
absolutely stunning and there it is if
you guys are curious about fallout with
these there is a little bit of fallout
but again I think it's because they are
so pigmented and very very buttery so
I'm not very surprised that there is a
lot of fallout I would just recommend
kind of you know putting something
underneath your eye when you pack these
on or like I said you can foil your foil
eyeshadows which to me is a bit
excessive but that's again you know I
don't like to spend tons of time I'm
gonna make up all right the next shape
we have is synergy and this one's
beautiful I actually worked this into
the crease the other day and I loved the
way it looked it's beautiful true kind
of coppery shade but it's got like a
nice like light brown and goldish
undertone there it is oh god these
shades I just love this palette I love
this palette I love it alright and then
the last one we have here is called
flash and flash is like yes girl it is
like the perfect yellowy greenish gold
color it's just it's wonderful it's
absolutely wonderful and there it is so
if those are all of the foiled shades
again I feel like these really are kind
of these standouts in the palette but
they pair so beautifully with the
massing here I'm just so excited about
this palette I think it's really really
stunning so really loved those very very
pigmented
again you can foil your foil shadows if
you want them to not have as much
fallout but I do think they're beautiful
my only really really big complaint is
that they definitely do stain so if you
do want to pack them on with your finger
and just you know be aware that that may
happen alright now let's go ahead and go
into the match
so we're gonna start right here with the
shade linen and work our way down to
that purpley color which is called
velvet so the first shade like I said is
called linen it is just a stark white
cool toned matte color and it's
beautiful and if literally feels like a
baby's ass like I don't know what people
are talking about when they're saying
that these are patchy and stuff I'm just
like I don't see it I don't see it so
there is a shade linen right there I
feel like it goes down very very nicely
it's very pigmented very beautiful the
next shape we have is called jet again
it feels like a little baby's ass there
it is and this is just a jet black color
and I like it because it does not have
any sort any sort of smoky undertone to
it I hate when a black has like a gray
undertone I'm like why can't it just be
jet black I feel like this one is so
there it is the next shape we have is
called velour and this is a beautiful
dark dark blue color and it's gorgeous
it actually is picking up super super
bright blue on the camera but this is
what it looks like again these are a
little more powdery but it is because
they are so pigmented so you definitely
do get a little bit of kick up but your
fingers are gonna stain with these
babies so there are the first three
shades and then we have these shades
stone and stone is really beautiful it's
like a dark charcoal gray color and I
love the way that this looks when it's
on the actual um I think I bought this
on my lid the other day which is kind of
weird like who would wear this color on
their lid but I liked the way it looked
it's just a dark smoky charcoal gray
color again really like the formulation
I feel like a lot of the times with like
a matte gray color or a matte black
color II and all those can get real
Ashley looking and I feel like they
start to get patchy I don't have that
problem with this maybe I just got a
really good palette I don't know the
next shade we have is moss and I love
this this beautiful kind of hunter green
color we also have ribbon which is a
nice kind of cool toned bluish purple a
color that's how I would explain it so
here is the shade ribbon and then this
one right here is that forest green
color so ribbon and moss there's ribbon
and there is moss those were not very
good swatches let me try again
here is moss in here his ribbon the
government have to move to my other hand
here because I'm starting to get stained
but there they are and then the next two
shades we have here are silk and fringe
and still goes
really cool this is like a nice cool
toned purpley color but it's like a
lilac so I really like that shade so
here is silk and then we have fringe
which is that beautiful matte peachy
shade I don't have anything like that in
my collection anything like that so I
really really like it so there they are
beautiful beautiful beautiful and then
we have feather and again nothing like
this in my collection this is just a
nice like beautiful yellow matte color
and I'm just like like what like I don't
have anything like this I don't know if
laster's palette I feel like last year's
palette maybe had a color like this and
you guys can even see how it's going
over this area where I am having some I
already started to get eczema on my
wrist again it always happens during the
cooler months but you can see like this
still glided over that really nicely in
my opinion and then we have the shade
oak which is a nice warm toned brown
color again a super super pigmented
really beautiful love this there is oak
gliding over my eczema beautifully again
and then in the last three shades we
have our suede bone and then also velvet
and we will go ahead and do suede first
which is that perfect perfect transition
shade it's this one right here which I
love I feel like it's kind of like a
skin tone shade but it's just perfect
for our transition if you are quite fair
like I am so they're suede then we have
bone which is a step down or a step kind
of warmer or more pinky toned than linen
and then the last one we have is velvet
which is a beautiful beautiful kind of
moody shade and it's got a little bit of
purple in it so there they are those
last three shades so this one right here
is called suede then we have bone and
then we have velvet the velvet is
probably the weakest shade out of this
whole entire palette but you can kind of
build it up and then it starts to look a
little better but if anything is patchy
in this palette it would be that
particular shape and everything else and
my opinion goes on really really nicely
and I do feel like they apply to the
eyes better than they apply in swatches
so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video definitely nothing wrong if you
feel like you know I don't know you
don't think that these are as good of
quality as last year's like I said I
didn't get last year's palette but all I
know is that I'm really in love with
this palette I think that this is
probably the best like matte formula
she's ever done in a pallet and I'm just
very very impressed so really really
love this I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
