back to my channel today I am sharing
with you guys a review swatches in
comparison on the new Kat Von D Saint
and sinner eyeshadow palettes now Before
we jump into this yes my thumbnail is
completely different than how I look
today because unfortunately this is the
third time I am filming in this review I
tried to get this review up yesterday I
lost the footage I tried to eat it up
the day before I lost the footage I
corrupted it myself by accident of
course but yeah I've been having some
issues getting this video up so fingers
across what this works out to but anyway
let's go ahead and jump right into the
review so the first thing I want to let
you guys know is that this is a 60 to a
dollar limited edition net palette it is
exclusive to Sephora so if you do want
to pick it up you have to pick it up on
the sephora comma website limited
edition my ass who knows if this is
going to come back in the future but I
would highly recommend you go ahead and
jump on it immediately instead of
waiting for the future I'm a big fan of
Kat Von D holiday palettes in general I
feel like they are some of the better
holiday pellets that you come out I
always regret not picking up in the vida
loca palette so I'm very happy that I
picked this baby out if this is what the
actual palette looks like it is super
weighted and gorgeous as you guys can
see if this looks like a Gothic
cathedral which I just think is so cool
you have the sinner side over here at
the same side over here on the back you
can see all twenty four shades listed
and like I said you have a same side you
have a sinner side which is really
really cool and these are supposed to
admit mix stained glass of windows that
you would see in all the Gothic
cathedrals which i think is wonderful
and now here you guys can see when you
open it up you do have two little flaps
of mirror I don't find those extremely
useful just because the slips are so
small but I'm also somebody who does
complain lot if there is no mirror so I
am happy that they went ahead and at
least popped a little something in there
so they 24 different eyeshadows that you
are receiving in this particular palette
do you have a variety of different
finishes you have some glitter and few
shades you also have maybe one or two
duo Crone's
you do have some mats in here as well as
some shippers and overall I really do
like the layout but that is something I
want to talk about really quickly color
selection and the way that they actually
put this palette together it's
definitely something that has been
bothering a lot of people now normally
when you look at cap on deep palettes if
you
really do have sort of a rainbow effect
here is last year's metal matte palette
from holiday 2016 you guys can see
you'll have some nice neutral shades
here some more pastel kind of colors and
then some deeper shades everything is
corresponding you up the max on the
bottom you have the metal crush formula
on the top and and the way that I look
at this I just feel like okay I know
exactly what I want to do with my eye
look and the same goes for these
serpentina palette now if there is one
palette that I would say is comparable
to the saint and sinner from Kat Von D I
would personally say it is the Saint and
Sarah because I feel like this one has a
lot of depth to it it has a lot of jewel
tones and that reminds me a lot of the
saints and sinners the mental map
palette from last year has a little more
pastel vibes in my opinion it's still my
favorite because I love the metal crush
formula but as far as color selection is
concerned I would say these serpentina
is very similar to the Von D Saint and
sinner but you guys can see here you
have some dusty kind of like darker
tones here you have the jewel tones and
then you have like the purple but kind
of like oddball colors in here but it's
not just thrown around in a very very
strange way so a lot of people are
saying hey when I look at this balance I
don't even know what I want to do with
my eye look it's definitely one of those
petals that you have to work a little
harder with because you have to decide
before you start digging in where you
want to put certain colors because
you're really looking around the whole
palette okay is there transitioning here
okay is there even a brow bone color
that I can use in here and you really
kind of have to think ahead of time
about how you want to create your eye
look before digging into the palette at
least that's what I have had to be doing
so I know a lot of people had questions
about the color selection I really like
the color selection but the layout is a
little funky
I will admit alright moving on to the
formula you guys so overall I would say
this is probably one of the better
formulas that I have seen from Kat Von D
if the metal matte palette from last
year with the mattes I feel like some of
these were definitely a little bit of a
mess there are if you miss misses in
here however I would say overall this is
a really really good at formula I even
feel like these presses the litter
shades up here the two shades called
absolution as well as rapture are
actually quite nice today I do have the
shade ashes as my transition a happy
bullet or infused into it you guys know
I'm not a huge glitter if you've kind of
okay so for me to say that there are
some damn good glitter and few shades in
here I feel like that says a lot
the formula is definitely a little more
firmly pressed but I feel like I can use
a lot of different brushes with this
particular palette so overall you guys I
would say this is pretty damn good I
would give this palette right here four
out of five stars I would give it last
year's palette five out of five but
again that's because I really love me
some foiled eyeshadows and I love at the
event will crush formula you are not
going to find the middle crush formula
in here but you're still gonna get some
really really nice soft and buttery mats
which normally I don't find a cap on D
palettes I feel like a lot of the time
they tend to be a little more firmly
press a little harder to blend but then
you are also getting some really really
beautiful soft buttery shades in here as
well kind of like Cathedral and also
heaven which I have all over my lid
today so speaking of the look that I
have on today if you guys are curious I
took in these shade at baptism which is
a baby's top cool tone pink and I put
that all over my lid and then I did go
in with ashes again that is kind of like
a misty gray color with a little bit of
gold glitter in it and I work that into
my outer V and to me out early into my
outer BM as my transition shade and then
I did go into the same shade of chalice
or was it sanctuary I can't remember I
used one of the two the shades over here
really really beautiful very nice kind
of foiled appearance they're not
straight up foiled they're not super
soft and buttery but they give a foiled
look so very high shine very metallic
eyes on the actual eye and then I went
ahead and I took heaven and I tap them
onto my lid and you really love that
heaven shade I really love that
Cathedral shade some other favorites of
mine in here are definitely stigmata
this beautiful reddish shade it down
here
I love Exodus this guy right here it's a
little more glitter in views but mostly
a matte in my opinion I wear that guy
the other day kind of on the inner
corner of my eyelid really enjoyed that
I love the shade of rosary which is it
really beautiful kind of wine color down
here there are just a lot of really good
shades in here a lot of good finishes in
here and overall I would say this is a
pretty darn good palette so now let me
go ahead and talk about the breasts and
best brushes to use I cannot speak today
the best brushes to use with this
goddamn palette so I found that I can
use synthetic bristle brushes as well as
natural of bristle brushes when it comes
to this particular palette which is kind
of interesting so the ones that I have
really been enjoying it using as far as
synthetic bristle brushes are concerned
are the Lexi 231 small tapered blending
this is really nice for smoking color
out on your lower lash line and then I
also really do enjoy using the wet and
wild crease brush so today I use the wet
and wild crease brush to go in with the
shade ashes as my transition I kind of
worked that into the outer V works
really really well and normally I
personally find that what I'm working
with Kat Von D and Matt's I have to go
in with a natural bristle brush or like
a goat hair brush just to really pick
the product up because they are a little
more firmly pressed but I have had no
issues whatsoever with any sort of
brushes I've been using so that is two
thumbs up right there other brushes I
have been enjoyed on my morphe and my
13/4 really working into the outer via
today I went into the shade I think it
was sanctuary that I used my work that
into the outer V really enjoyed back my
Sigma e35 is always a favorite of mine
for blending so I really have been
enjoying that one I also really like the
Sigma e30 for blending out on the lower
lash line I do notice I get a little bit
of fallout with some of these shades
especially when I go in on my lower lash
line so I recommend going ahead and foil
in your brush for foiling the shape
before going ahead and applying it and
then finally for all over blending I've
really been enjoying my morphe Emma 5:11
now really quickly let's talk about best
primers when it comes to this particular
palette I think you need something
that's kind of in-between super super
sticky and kind of silicon base so for
me personally I have been loving my
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion it
great dupe for this at the drugstore is
the Milani eyeshadow primer potion so if
you guys want to go ahead and pick that
up I feel like this really does let
these shadows adhere and it doesn't
really crease throughout the day maybe a
little bit of creasing after about 10
hours of wear with these shadows but
nothing to a bad when it comes to this
particular primer another really good
option is just using a nice kind of
sticky base like a concealer so this is
the LA girl Pro conceal I really been
enjoying this this particular shade is
called light ivory this works really
really well as well so anyway guys like
I started overall I think this is a
fantastic palette
we're out of five stars for sure which
is a lot for holiday pallets in my
opinion I definitely still do enjoy it
my metal mats a little more but that's
just because of this particular formula
you see in little round pans here but
overall I would say this is the damn
good palette and I would recommend you
guys go ahead and scoop it up especially
if you are a lover of color alright guys
so I thought I'm gonna go ahead and zoom
you guys in for the swatches we're gonna
go ahead and do five at a time starting
with the same side of the palette which
is over here so the first watch that I
want to do is absolution absolution is
that cool tone kind of white color with
a little bit of the golden ship to
running through it now this doesn't
swatch incredibly pigmented because it
is a glitter pressed shade and I want to
let you guys know right away I did put a
little bit of primer on my hand because
maybe you can see I have super super dry
hands right now so I have a little bit
of the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion in the anti-aging version but
that is what did the shade absolution
that looks like up next we're gonna go
ahead and swatch the shade of worship
who worship is a really really beautiful
kind of mid-tone to purple color with a
little bit of a sheen running through it
also incredibly gorgeous and who really
released swatches well in my opinion so
there is the shade of worship up next we
have the shade Immaculate Immaculate is
a really beautiful kind of MOX green
color with a little bit of a golden
shift running through it again it is
more of a satin to sort of finish in my
opinion it goes on really really nicely
to the eye area and I really like to go
ahead and and work that into the crease
for whatever reason it really works well
sometimes when these shimmers are a
little more firmly pressed like Kat Von
D shadows in general I find them
difficult to work into the crease that
those guys work into the grace for
really well alright up next we're gonna
take the shade chalice and Chellis is a
really really beautiful kind of olivey a
great tone shade with a little bit of a
gorgeous a gorgeous kind of gold shift
running through it and I think we'll
actually do four at a time here because
I'm starting to run out of hand space
but anyway those are the first of four
shades from a decent side of the palette
at the top we have absolution underneath
that we have the purple which is called
a worship the green a gold shade is
called Immaculate and then finally
have chalice which is that really
gorgeous gorgeous kind of Tokyo shape
okay up next on the same side of the
palette we have these shades Sacred
Heart - amen
sanctuary and heaven so Sacred Heart is
a really really beautiful kind of peachy
gold color it's got like a little bit of
a bold shift going on here and this is a
satin shade and it really really
swatches well in my opinion so right
there we have Sacred Heart next up we
have amen amen it's just a beautiful
beautiful brow bone shade I have a
little bit of a yellow tone to it and it
is completely matte I don't know how
well that will show up but it should
show up a little bit because I'm kind of
tan right now all right the next shade
that we have is called sanctuary
sanctuary is absolutely gorgeous I do
have this in my outer-v today or a
little bit of this in my outer-v it's
got a little bit of like a purpley
undertone but I would say it's a cool
toned brown shade and this one does have
a little bit of a sheen to it now when
you do swatch it you can see a little
bit of a powder kind of kicks up I just
want you guys to be able to see that
quickly but it's not super super messy
on the eyes that you get just the
tiniest bit of fall out but it's not
anything crazy and then finally we do
have the shade heaven and heaven is just
absolutely gorgeous it is there's a
beautiful beautiful kind of silver shade
with a little bit of a lavender hue to
it and this is what I have on my lid
today if you are curious so there are
the shades at the top we have Sacred
Heart - underneath that we have amen
then we have sanctuary and then we have
the shade of heaven now we are going to
go ahead and swatch out the last four
shades on the same side of the palette
the first shade is called crucifix the
next one is called Cathedral we have
rosary and finally baptism so crucifix
is a cool tone brown shaded is a matte
and this is what it looks like this is
definitely one of the better Maps in my
opinion when it comes to this particular
palette it really blends out beautifully
absolutely beautifully in the outer V as
well as on the crease or in the crease
so that is the first shade and that
particular one is called a crucifix up
next we have kind of a glitter infuse
shade I don't want to call it and
straight up a like press to glitter kind
of like absolution or rapture because it
definitely isn't it's got a little more
of like a satiny vibe running through it
but it's gorgeous it's called Cathedral
and this is just a stunning color it is
slate-gray with a blue tone running
through it and you guys can see it
swatches beautifully now this can go on
a little chunky so you want to make sure
you kind of rub back and forth if you're
gonna pop this on the lid but it looks
absolutely great on and the lid really
enjoy that shade up next we have Rosary
I really like this one it is definitely
very very firmly pressed but it's a
beautiful kind of plum shade with a
little bit of a baby pink running
through it
and if you look in the sunlight and you
look at this particular color you really
can see that baby pink kind of color
going through there it is really a
really a gorgeous so those are those
three and then finally the last shape
that we have on the siege side of the
palette is this one right here which is
called baptism baptism is a cool-toned
pinky white color it is absolutely
gorgeous it definitely can look a little
chalky when you just wash it out but
hopefully you guys will be able to see
it what I mean by that color really
really nice if you do pull a cool
undertone and you have a fair complexion
so at the top we have crucifix
underneath that we have Cathedral then
we have rosary and then baptism alright
now let's go ahead and move on to the
center side of the palette the first
four shades that we have over here are
rapture we have sabbath ashes and mater
or a mater
i think that's how you say it I'm not
sure all right so let's go ahead and
start with rapture rapture is a mid tone
pink shade it is a glitter infused a
very very similar in a formula to
absolution so this definitely doesn't
swatch particularly well but I really do
like the color of this and I feel like
if you do put on a nice and glitter glue
you can really get this to pop on your
lid up next we have Sabbath this is such
a silky silky and matte black you guys
and it is incredibly incredibly
pigmented so I may be out of this one
for sure
let me go ahead and swatch that for you
guys if you really can see the pigment
on there isn't that great all right up
next we have the shade ashes this is the
one that I have as my like transition
shade today it is kind of like a gray
color with a little bit of a green and
gold sparkle or glitter to it not my
favorite I don't feel like it's ultra
pigmented but it does make a nice
transition even though it does have
glitter infused chunks in here but let's
face it if you do have a more light or
like porcelain sort of complexion is
really hard to find a good transition
and the
palate so I go ahead and use this one
and then finally guys we appreciate a
matter or mater I think that's how you
say it I really don't reckon no and this
is just a beautiful a beautiful kind of
I'm gonna just a pumpernickel I have no
idea why do you guys ever eat
pumpernickel bagels I don't know why
that we're came to my head but this is a
really really nice kind of a muster to
color it have a little bit of a green at
tone going through it absolutely
gorgeous it is a matte and this just
blends beautifully as a transition as
well it is a little dark for those of
you who do have a light complexion but
if you have a medium or deep complexion
this will be the perfect transition for
you so on the top we have rapture then
we have Sabbath then we have ashes and
then matter or a major all right to the
next four shades that we have on the
sinner side of the Kat Von D sanctum
Center palette are a devil revelation
investment and ministry so let's go
ahead and start with the she-devil and
this is definitely one of my favorite
shades even the palette it is a
beautiful beautiful kind of true orange
shade with a little bit of depth to it
it is a matte and it is just absolutely
gorgeous I love this one blended into
the crazy button into the outer V it is
a great shade it is a great formula up
next we have revelation this is a nice
kind of chocolatey brown shade with a
little bit of gold Sheen running through
it I shouldn't even say gold chain I'm
sorry gold Sparkle it's straight-up
glitter running through it now I do like
this particular shade I feel like it
actually works into the outer V the
transition and lower lash line pretty
well so I don't have any complaints
normally I'm not a huge fan of glitter
and few shadows but this one's pretty
good
up next we do have vestment this is
absolutely gorgeous is almost like a
foiled kind of consistency and this one
is just a beautiful kind of aquamarine
it's like a blue brown pigment I don't
even know how to describe it it kinda
reminds me of being back a blue brown
pigment it's got a little bit of depth
but maybe a little more of a bluish tone
going on rather than brown but it really
kind of reminds me of a duochrome in
fact I might be listed as the duo crime
hopefully you guys can see that and
finally we have ministry and ministry is
just a really really gorgeous
abbulu shade and it does have a little
bit of a silver iridescent running
through it so there are those of four
shades from the center side of the
palette
we have devil than revelation the
investment and then ministry alright
guys and the last four shades that we
have to swatch out in the st. and Center
eyeshadow palette on the center side are
Exodus exorcism a relic and stigmata
so Exodus is a beautiful beautiful
bright kind of green it's like an acid
yellow greenish color and this is a
matte and it really is nice like on the
inner corner of the eye or in the inner
third of the lid I or a look using this
with the other day and I really enjoyed
it up next we have another mat this is
not my favorite it is called exorcism
and I just don't love the way that this
goes on I find it very very difficult to
blend it is another matte but because it
is this kind of bluish purple color I
just feel like it goes on slightly
slightly actually on my skin patchy you
don't know how else to describe it but
it's just kind of like there's spots
that are peeking through I'm not the
biggest fan up next we do have the
shader relic which is a beautiful
beautiful kind of satin color it's a
true gold with like a very very yellow
undertone to it really it really
gorgeous that is what it looks like and
then finally guys we have stigmata which
is a beautiful beautiful true kind of
wine red color with more red than wine
if that makes sense kind of reminds me a
little bit of rosary but rosary
definitely has more pink to it so again
the last four teeth we have our Exodus
we have exorcism a relic and then a
stigmata so that is that you guys for my
seat and Center eyeshadow appellate
review with live swatches I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you as
always for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
