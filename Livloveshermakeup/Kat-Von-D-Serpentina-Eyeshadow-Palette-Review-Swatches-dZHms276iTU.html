today's video I have a review and
swatches for you guys on the Neo Kat Von
D's serpentina
eyeshadow palette I did purchase this
for $45 on the sephora.com website and I
got mine two days ago so I've had plenty
of time to play with it this is an
eyeshadow palette that contains eight
different eyeshadows ranging from mattes
to shimmer to glitter finishes and it
also have a loose pigment in it as well
you do get eight of the regular
eyeshadows and then a loose pigment and
for $45 you are getting quite a bit of
product in here now this is limited
edition it obviously is new and it is
currently sold out on the sephora.com
website and also the Kat Von D website
so what I'm going to do is link down
below where you guys can sign up for
email notifications from Sephora so you
know when it is back in stock because
since it is limited edition you
definitely want to get your hands on
this ASAP as soon as it comes back in it
really is a beautiful eyeshadow palette
I don't have too many complaints about
it so let me show you guys what the
outer packaging looks like here is the
outer packaging as you can see it's just
this really really nice long box you
have a matte finish and then you do have
the gold on there that says serpentina
this eyeshadow palette is actually named
after the essence of like a woodland
named in here are named after the
essence of Egypt so the names that you
have our blood milk you have Medusa you
have UNK you have queen you have
hieroglyph nyle scarab venom and prophet
I think those are really really cool
names and this serpentina name is just
awesome
I feel like serpentina would be the name
of someone in like the sole authority if
you were at Hogwarts I feel like there
should be a girl named serpentina who
dates like Malfoy or something like that
that's truly what I think of when I
think of this particular name but the
box is really nice they do you have the
ingredients on the back here and I am
going to go ahead and link the
ingredients list down below for you guys
as well or I'm just gonna type it out in
the description bar so if you guys can
make sure that you are not going to have
any sort of issues with any of the
ingredients so the actual packaging that
looks like this very very similar to the
box you have the matte finish and then
it almost
like a little I don't even know what
this is I know that she does a lot of
interesting things with her particular
palate I do not think that they are very
travel friendly I did used to have the
shade and light eyeshadow palette and I
thought that was quite travel friendly
but for the most part I remember her
last palettes that came out were like
little coffins she's had ones that are
like supposed to be what was that the
holiday one is supposed to be like a you
could know what I'm talking about it's
supposed to be like a disc or something
like that I never thought that that was
to travel friendly either but for the
most part I feel like her packaging is
very artsy and very beautiful and she
puts a lot of time and effort into how
she wants to present her makeup and I
actually think that's really really
beautiful if someone was in the arts
world of myself I actually really really
do like that and I think it's wonderful
so on the back you guys can see she does
have the names of all of these shadows
and the loose pigment you open it up you
do have a nice little mirror here and
then you have some sort of like a cross
I love her stuff I think it's a really
really fun and dark and kind of vampy
and then here obviously we have the
loose pigment and here are your eight
shades so you are getting things ranging
from shimmer shades to a few glitter
shades to a few matte shades and I will
say overall I think that for $45 this is
a really good eye shadow palette if you
are someone who loves really really nice
jewel tone colors especially like during
the fall and winter month I think you
would absolutely adore this palette now
I did used to have the shade and light
eyeshadow palette I think I mentioned
that earlier I did return that or never
returned it and I'm sorry I declared it
to a friend or a neighbor and she
absolutely loves it let me tell you what
my issues with that were I felt like
they were very varied the shadows in
there were very very chalky I felt like
I couldn't really blend them out very
nicely on my eyes and I do feel like Kat
Von D has been reformulating a lot of
her products lately she has had a few
products that have recently come out
that have kind of been Miz's in my
opinion those dual sided blushes were no
good she did pull those on even from the
sephora website and from her personal
website i feel like she really has been
kind of revamping the formulation on
certain products and my friend Maui who
really really loves the Kat Von D brand
really kind of stated it perfectly so
when she used to have her
palates and her old blushes they were so
buttery and smooth and people would
complain about fall outs and now she's
trying to kind of you know pack things
in a little more firmly and now people
are saying oh well they're not buttery
and creamy and this and that I feel like
the formulation in this particular
eyeshadow palette is great the only
shades in here that I'm a little like
I'm about are the glitter shades which
is UNK which is this one right here and
also the shade niall which is that blue
one which is absolutely gorgeous I do
personally feel like nidal has a little
more grit and glitter to it and then the
two matte shades which are blood milk
and venom which are the red and the
purple I personally do feel like are a
little scratchy it's not like they feel
like sandpaper you guys but they're just
not as buttery as the foil or shimmer
shades in the eyeshadow palette now
something you have to understand is that
it's not all about how these shadows
feel and how they swatch its going to
swatch completely differently than
wouldn't you put it on your eye it's
okay like I'm sorry you could look at
swatches all day but you have to
understand it is going to translate onto
your eyes differently and I swear to you
every single shade in this eyeshadow
palette goes up to the eyes beautifully
absolutely beautifully because Pat Von D
eyeshadows are very very heavily
pigmented I do find that I have to blend
a little more today for work and I do
want to touch on something really
quickly somebody asked me if this is a
work friend Lee palette it depends on
where you work if you work like in a
cubicle all day or things like that or
more in like a business setting I would
say that this probably isn't going to be
a talented that maybe you want to wear
to work I personally am a musician I do
teach children but I'm in the classical
music world aka the arts world and a lot
of my co-workers have like bright green
and pink hair so it's okay for me to go
to work like this but I would say if you
have more of like a nine-to-five job and
you're more in a business setting I
don't think this is going to be like an
everyday friendly palette for you again
I'm in the arts world it's a little
different situation but I wanted to
touch on that really quickly the one
thing in this eyeshadow
not that I feel like they could have
done and I think she could have done
really well is pop in some sort of a
transition shade or even something
that's just like an ice cream color I
would have loved to see a cream color
here instead of the loose pigment not
that there's anything wrong with the
loose pigment I thought this was really
cool that she put that in there a very
different very very innovative and very
cool but for the most part I just feel
like they are missing like a matte brown
tone color or some sort of a transition
color today I went in with the shade of
blood milk and I worked that into my
crease and today personally I wanted to
see how quickly I could use as many
shadows in here and blend them out like
how quickly I don't feel like this I
look came out particularly amazingly I
gave myself exactly seven minutes to
blend both eyes because I am personally
one of those people I do not like to
spend a lot of time on my eye makeup and
I feel like with this particular palette
because the shadows are so pigmented you
need to spend a little more time
blending them out when you have a you
know shadow that is pigmented like that
like wham-bam in your face you can bet
your ass you're gonna be spending a
little more than five minutes blending
this out so today I do have on quite a
few of the shades I went in with blood
milk instantly into my crease I didn't
use a transition shade or any sort of
brow bone shade and again I feel like
that is what is missing from this
particular palette I would have loved to
be able to do some sort of a
highlighting shade or something like
that because these are very dark and
very jewel tones then I did go in with
hieroglyph and I took that on my lid and
then I went in with the shade nyle on my
lower lash line which is that blue one
of my favorite shades even though I'm
not obsessed with the formula like the
way that it feels I do love the way it
goes onto the eyes and then I took a
little bit of scarab into my outer V I
didn't really like mixing those warmer
tones with the cooler tones in my
opinion it turned out a little muddy but
the other day I mixed together just the
warm tones in here and I tried just the
cool tones together they look beautiful
when you do that it's when you start
mixing you know like the really orangie
red shades with the dark purples that it
starts to look a little weird and that's
just maybe for me personally because I
personally
want to spend tons and tons of time
blending out my eyeshadow but I did want
to touch on that quickly obviously
that's just kind of common sense but I
really wanted to try and put on as many
colors as I could today and see what
happened but for the most part I would
say the island that I came out with
today is definitely not my favorite but
I have come out with quite a few eye
looks that look absolutely gorgeous with
this palette blood milk and hieroglyph
look absolutely stunning together Venom
Nile and scarab the three cool tones
right here absolutely look amazing
together as well and I do like the way
that she put the overall palette
together as far as like where time is
concerned these where incredibly long
time you can use them with any sort of
eye primer I've tried them with
drugstore eye primers I tried them with
like the Too Faced glitter glue there
are a few shades in here if you really
want them to look super foiled you of
course can spray them with a setting
spray or you can literally take you know
a shade like this and you can pack that
on to your lid and now if you really
want it to be super super foiled looking
they already look quite foiled the
metallic shades in here but if you do
want it to look super super foil if you
can just take a little bit of glitter
glue put it on your lid and then pack
that on there I think they're very easy
to blend like I said because they are so
pigmented and they are those darker
jewel tones you do need to spend a
little more time but for the actual like
pigmentation and the formulation I would
say that it's very easy to blend this
for the most parts I think that like I
said the wear time is quite strong they
seem to last all day on my eyes I'm
gonna go to work today and when I get
home I expect that these eye shadows
will be in the same place I am wearing
the benefit stay don't stray eyeshadow
primer today I like the way that these
went on I don't feel like there's any
skipping I don't feel like there's any
like patchiness like I did with the
shade and light palette I just think
overall this is a really really
high-quality good palette and for $45 it
really think you can't beat it
so overall the only things that I'm kind
of skeptical about are definitely the
loose pigment I don't like loose
pigments they're very messy they take a
lot of time to use but is that very
innovative of her to pop one in here
absolutely I think that's really cool I
like that I wish that she could have put
like a matte cream color in there or a
transition color but I think it's
very different and very cool Kat Von D
is very different and very cool so you
have to expect that she would do
something outside of the you know normal
things so anyway I think it's a
beautiful eyeshadow palettes I
definitely recommend checking it out if
you are someone who loves jewel tones if
you are someone and you know that you're
gonna be using it all the time like if
you're an actress or you want to go on
stage or something like that I think
this is a really cool I shadow palette
to have this is one that I will be
packing in my bag when I am on stage and
you may think really you're gonna go all
smoky eye onstage but yeah I am and I
think that these are really light
reflected beautiful colors that show up
with high impact and high shine so let's
go ahead and start watching everything
the first thing I'm going to swatch is
the loose pigment this is profit and
profit is basically this dirty green
yellow gold color it's actually really
beautiful you guys but it's just
messy okay I'm sorry excuse my language
but it's messy it's a loose pigment I
mean what do you expect but overall I
think it is very very beautiful if you
do want to pack this onto your lid I
highly recommend using a glitter glue
but the actual color is really different
and really awesome so here is profit
isn't that pretty
it's like that dirty green gold color I
know some people don't like this
particular kind of color I actually
really do I love like mustardy green
dirty green murky colors I think they're
really cool but yeah that is the first
color the next sheet we are going to
swatch is a venom which is that purple
shade right there
right there and it is a matte color and
again although these don't feel super
buttery to the touch they still go on
really really pigmented and I want to
say really quickly I do have a few of
the Kat Von D single eyeshadows I do not
think that these particular eyeshadows
are as soft and buttery as those are I
find like I can blend those like the
eyeshadow singles I feel like I can
blend those out in five minutes these
definitely take a little more work but
they are still very very soft and I
think at the end of the day what matters
is how pigmented they are and check that
baby out very very pigmented so that is
the shade venom and let me go ahead and
blend it out so you guys can see how it
blends so there it is you can see
because it is pigmented
it's kind of like sitting in on the
areas where I help like bones coming
through here so you do have to work with
it a little more like I'm not going to
sit there and be like oh yeah blends
like a dream because the mats are a
little more crispy feeling then no exam
paper but just a little more crispy
feeling you do have to work with them a
little more the next sheet is scarab and
it is a beautiful kind of shimmery
foiled I don't even know like mermaid
green color that's how I would describe
it that is what it looks like you go
ahead and swatch it for you guys
oh this color is so beautiful I thought
that there was a color very similar to
this it almost reminds me of max like
blue brown pigment but this one is
definitely more turquoise do you guys
see that what like what oh my god it's
so beautiful super super beautiful and
let me show you how these ones blend out
because the foiled shades in there or
the shimmer shades really blend out
nicely do you guys see that so like I
said the matte ones you know it takes a
little more work but these ones it's
like oh yeah oh god I can put that out
all day again they're not as soft as the
Kat Von D eyeshadows Fingal's but I mean
they're still pretty soft if you can
blend it out like that they're still
pretty darn soft all right the next
shade that we are going to swatch is one
that has a little more glitter in it
although it appears to be kind of like a
shimmer or a foiled finish it definitely
has a little more grit and that is nyle
nyle is what I do have on my lower
lashline today and it's a beautiful
beautiful dark navy blue and it's got a
lot of like silver iridescent to it it's
it's stunning here's what I mean by
there's a little bit of grit there do
you guys see that and I don't know if I
touched on this yet but fall out there
it definitely is fall out with these eye
shadows I just wanted to touch on that
really really quickly but I think the
colors are just so unique and pretty so
there is the shade nyle beautiful
beautiful blue color and I swear these
are gonna stain my finger like a mofo
all right so the next shape we have is
hieroglyph and hieroglyph is the
beautiful beautiful foiled orange color
that I have a little bit on my lid today
again I mixed hieroglyph and scarab
today together kind of on
eyelid and I was like no I don't like
that I feel like they looked really
really muddy but if you just want to
wear this by itself on the lid I think
it's absolutely stunning like really
really beautiful so here is hieroglyph
again beautiful this is one of the more
foiled ones such a stunning color like
can we just come and talk about that yes
absolutely absolutely beautiful no
skipping goes on so so beautifully and
so evenly so high shine beautiful the
back I love it you guys you guys know
I'm all into that foiled look all right
and then the next shape we have is Queen
and Queen is a very very pretty kind of
muted sea cranberry color it's like a
muted mauve color and it definitely does
have that gorgeous gorgeous kind of
foiled appearance to it it has the kind
of shimmer to it
it's beautiful goes on really really
nicely and I think it's absolutely
stunning so here is Queen kind of like a
muted mulberry would you guys say that
muted wine color something like that
there is queen absolutely stunning again
those foil shades in there or the
shimmer shades or whatever you want to
call them I think they're really really
beautiful they're almost like a luster
yeah they're kind of like a luster all
right and then the next one we have is
UNK and Augie it's like one of those
shades where it's just like this could
be such a beautiful kind of foiled color
but instead they did put a little bit of
glitter in there it is a deep dark
chocolatey Brown with a little bit of an
olive undertone and gold shimmer it
still is extremely extremely pigmented
but there definitely is some grit going
on there what I like about it is that
it's not too smoky looking it is quite
rich and dark and brown anytime I have a
black eye shadow or a dark brown shadow
I want it to be warm tones I want it to
have a lot of like depth to it I don't
want it to look super Ashley on my eyes
because then I feel like it just looks
muddled and I think this one is still
beautiful it has a lot of depth to it
but you know I feel like they could have
done a little more like not having the
glitter in there that's just my own
personal opinion I would have preferred
it more if it didn't have the glitter
but I did pear UNK and profit which is
the loose pigment the other day oh my
god it looks so beautiful you guys need
to do a tutorial on that because it was
gorgeous
all right now we have Medusa and Medusa
is this gorgeous kind of like Goldy
green dirty color similar to Prophet but
this one definitely has a little more
grey and I would say grey and gold tones
to it it's hard to describe so here is
Medusa beautiful foiled as you can see
little more gold tones in there than
profit let's watch it next to profit so
you guys can see I'm sorry I know it's
gonna be a long video but here's profit
profits definitely a little more like
greenish this one's a little more
goldish so there is the shade Medusa and
here is profit beautiful and then the
last eight that we have is blood milk
and blood milk is just that beautiful
matte red color now there have been a
lot of pallets that have come out
recently with gorgeous matte and also
just really really beautiful matte berry
colors and I feel like this one doesn't
really stand with the crowd like the
ones in my violet Voss holy grail
palette are the ones in the new modern
renaissance palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills but it's still really
beautiful and I do have it in my crease
today took a little bit of work to blend
it out but this one feels quite softer
than the shade of venom so I don't know
what that's all about but it still is
really really beautiful and it is a
matte so here is blood milk so I think
you guys can probably see from the
swatches that these shades that have the
lustre finish or the foiled finish
obviously go on without skipping they
blend super super super easily they're
probably the easiest ones to work with
in the palette the overall I think for
$45 you're getting a nice amount of
product in here you're getting some
really beautiful colors if you are
someone who loves those pops of color
especially jewel tones I think you're
gonna love these and it is fun to have a
loose pigment although I'm not I need to
be on a loose pigment I still do think
it is fun to have this the wear time on
this particular little guy is quite good
as well like I said I did pair it with
onto the other day I put on con and then
I went
and tap this with a little bit of
glitter glue onto my lid and I thought I
looked really pretty I feel like the
wear time is quite consistent across the
board they wear you know all day pretty
much all day but yeah I just wish they
would have put a matte cream color in
there instead of the loose pigment so
anyway those are my overall thoughts I
think this is a beautiful palette for
$45 if you are someone who really likes
pops of color I think you're going to
love it if you are someone who really
wants like an everyday school palette or
something like that you might want to
look elsewhere Kat Von D does have some
nice eyes shadow palettes that are a
little more muted and a little more
neutral but I do love this and I think
it's a really really fun one to have so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me I'm sorry
this is almost 20 minutes long but I
wanted to go in depth with it and yeah I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
