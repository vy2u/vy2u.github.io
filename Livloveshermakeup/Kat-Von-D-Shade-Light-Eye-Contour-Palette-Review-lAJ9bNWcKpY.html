than my videos from earlier but that is
because it was like studying here this
morning and suddenly it's like super
super dark and I actually have the
shades open I am like everything open
right now and it's super super dark but
it's also very very hot and I'm like
sticky and I just get bothered and I
have both of my like actual lighting
like I've lamps that I put on um but
those are like making my makeup just
like come off today I don't know what is
going on I did wear kind of a hydrating
primer today maybe that's what's wrong
but also my eye makeup is like so I am
filming this in somewhat natural
lighting you will still be able to see
everything perfectly I promise and yeah
so I am going to be reviewing the Kat
Von D shade + light eye contour palette
this goes for let's see here's our
website 46 dollars on the sephora
website and it is right now I believe
only available for VIP at VIP Rouge
however it won't be like that for long
and everybody will be able to get it at
some point I think April 13th I don't
know why I keep thinking that day but
that's the day I think so just you know
stay up-to-date if you're not the ID
Rouge or VIP you know whatever just stay
on this floor website and watch till you
know you can pick it up so basically um
Kat Von D came out with like a shade and
shade and go I was gonna say shade and
contour no a shade + light contour like
product for your face like a palette and
I was gonna get that but then I was
drawn in to some other ones because of
packaging Kat Von D from me is like a
very heavy looking brand and even though
I do have a lot of things from her I
love the tattoo Locker tattoo foundation
I love some of her lipsticks I just find
that her packaging does not catch my eye
in any way if I'm in Sephora I barely
even noticed her stuff I know that
sounds bad and whatnot but you know
she's kind of known for being just a
little more heavy you know so with the
tattoos and just things like that she's
not a super girly girl so I like that
she does go and she packages everything
the way she wants it to be packaged but
also she really goes for like darker I
feel like
her line consists up a lot of dart
products really rich nice dark products
so this time of year I was kind of like
oh well you know I don't need to be
getting a bunch of dark products right
now but when I saw this pop up on the
Sephora website I was like you know what
that looks really interesting I'm I'm
curious as to what this is all about and
you know I can take this in to fall with
me you know this isn't gonna be like a
huge summer palette for me like I said
the colors are very very rich and deep
however this will be great for fall so
basically you get three big shadows on
the top no these are not face products I
think a few people have been mistaken
and they keep thinking that the top ones
up here are face products and these are
the shadows they are all shadows so
basically I think her concept was you
take one of the top shades basically I
think she kind of yeah I wanted to say
she like cut everything into three
different looks if that makes sense
so you've got kind of like a warmer look
here a cooler look I'm sorry I'm sorry
you have a neutral look a cooler look
and a warmer look so it's like one two
three so the corresponding shade at the
top really goes well with the three
underneath it and you'll notice each
time you have that color and then you
have a highlight in each section then
you have kind of two deeper colors and
this whole palette really does consist
of deep colors besides the highlight um
when I've been using these shadows up
here for is transition like transition
shade really really perfect I think she
recommends using it as a base and by
base I don't know if she means all over
her I let her all the way up to her brow
but I'll tell you right now these shades
will show up if I put it all the way up
to my brows so that's a no-go for me but
I guess if you are deeper you know in
skin tone that may work for you but for
me I like to use it as a transition
before I put one of these darker shades
into my crease it really really gives
some nice warmth and dimension without
looking muddy because you can see the
darker shades in here are very dark
these are very very dark colors so you
know you see the highlights but then I
think this and this and this is
you know crease color you could put this
on the outer fee you know you can do
whatever you want with it but you know
these are deep rich colors so um I like
to use these as transition I don't know
if that's what she recommends actually
let's take a look right now she has her
little box here and all the names on the
back which is great and also on the
pallet on the back and I you guys know
I'm picky like I would prefer the names
to be right there
however as long as she put them back
there I'm fine because if I'm doing a
tutorial I can just be like oh it's
succubus really really cute names too
Lazarus fabulous site tree so less but
anyway so um it's easier you know I like
I like to be able to do that and I do
prefer to have you know little names
etched in there I always think that
brands can do it this is really heavily
packaged it's heavy they've made a big
big big space for this mirror but it's
like you could have kind of downsized
the mirror and put the names on the
pallet but you know everybody's
different some people want a really big
mirror I prefer having the names right
there but I don't mind because they are
on the back so I don't have to keep that
little sheet so again like most
companies nowadays I think they all kind
of took after Too Faced they have the
pamphlet and it shows you how to get
different eye looks um let's see here
they have it in English and in Spanish
just nice on each side so um let's read
what she says about those top three big
chunky shades in this palette because
that's what my eye was drawn to when I
saw it on the website I was like what
are those you know like what what does
she want us to do with those so here
again she kind of um yeah she she did
what I thought she what I thought it was
so basically she categorizes these into
three different looks so it's like three
different eye looks in one palette of
course you can use whatever colors you
want you don't have to follow this but
it is nice like if you want to
a certain I look um you have these three
categories so it says for the neutral
quad so those she considers base colors
those big shadows at the top can you see
that she writes base so like I said I
don't know if she means by base all the
way up to the brow bone or just all over
the eyelid it says okay it's a sweet
base all over eyelid and blend okay good
all over Island because these colors too
dark to go all the way up to the brow
bone with and I don't think I really
didn't think she would you know do do
that kind of thing but um you know like
this kind of color this color that's
gonna show up you know if I put it all
the way up to my brow bone so basically
she says to use that as a base and then
go in with the deeper shades in each
little quadrants so you can take this
put that all over your eyelid and then
go in to the crease with this color go
into the outer be with this and then
highlight under the brow bone and it's
so important she puts those three
highlights in there because it's really
important when you're using really
heavily pigmented shadows like this you
need a highlight and you need that
transition color so awesome look at that
black so good um so yeah so basically I
think that I at first didn't want to get
it because I didn't like the packaging
and I thought it looked heavy and dark
and I thought I wouldn't like it um and
yeah which is stupid because I really
think Kat Von D makes really really good
products and honestly I can read these
without primer and they show up
amazingly they blend very well for what
they are which is very very dark shades
dark shades are difficult you just got
to spend your time blending that's just
something you have to do if you're gonna
do it like a smokey eye you gotta blend
it out um so basically like I was saying
I you know have been seeing all these
colorful palettes and neutral palettes
and I'm more likely to go for something
like that than for something heavy like
this especially this time of year so I
am happy I picked this up though because
it's amazing it's awesome and I'm going
to be using the heck out of this when
fall rolls around so really really
beautiful I do want to
right away I'm gonna read a few things
on the Sephora website and it will you
know correct me if I'm wrong but I was
looking at these under a really really
bright light last night and there was a
few shades with shimmer in them and the
only reason I bring that up it's not a
big deal at all I love shimmer but
everybody keeps saying that this is an
all matte palette like Matt Matt Matt
Matt Matt I swear to you I looked under
like a really really really bright light
and I saw the tiniest bit of shimmer now
that's just when you swatch it because
when you put it on your eye nothing
shows up they all look very very matte
on the eye so um just another thing to
think about
you know you might swatch it to be like
oh there's the smallest amount of
glitter in there I don't want that and
you know that black shade or something
like that it does not actually show up
on the eye so not to worry about that
it's so minimal so so minimal so um yeah
I'm gonna read for you guys a few things
on the Sephora website it says what it
is an eye contouring palette featuring
three color quads and neutral cool and
warm shades so you get neutral cool
which is pretty cool actually because
you know we all have different
undertones and the more you work with
makeup the more you kind of see like oh
I look better with you know ashy tones
or pull tones or I look better with warm
tones so I like that she gives you
options and if you don't know your
undertone it's like you can play with
this and kind of see what you look best
with because usually when you're wearing
something certain colors or if you are
like attracted to certain colors and
they look really good on you
that usually kind of has to do a little
bit with the undertone in your skin
we're just kind of sighting so hey Lenny
we can use came in but anyway um so I do
like that it's so versatile you know I I
can't believe I really really judged
this before I tried it I was not okay I
need to not do that it's because of the
packaging advice it's just not me I
can't you know put this out and be like
oh look how cute my room is know this
needs to be in a cabinet it's just not
cute enough for me however preference
personal preference lots of people love
this kind of thing and so
it is what it is anyway let me keep
reading on the Safari website it says an
eye contouring palette featuring three
color plots in neutral cool and warm
shades transform your eyes through the
art of contouring after tapping into
makeup Pro secrets Kat Von D created
this first of a kind eyes shadow palette
it's specially designed for eye
contouring a ground-breaking
technique once used only by beauty
experts to define and enhance the eyes
this palette features a gorgeous
versatile array of contouring shades
arranged into three different quads
neutral cool and form to flatter every
skin tone three large base shadows the
ones on the top are arranged above three
coordinating powders for contouring
defining and highlighting the palette
includes an easy-to-follow contouring
guide with step-by-step instruction for
creating the different I'm opening
techniques each velvety powder is
blendable and buildable and it features
tap on Dee's signature high pigment long
wear shadow formula and I totally have
to agree with that I wore these without
an eye primer one day and they stayed on
all day awesome um they are created to
deliver rich color that lasts all day
and all night
it is formulated without parabens
sulfates and fettle aids speedlights and
Kat Von D has a little quote here she
said the true inspiration behind the
shade plus I contour palette comes from
all these years of trying to understand
the usage of shadows and light within
the portraits I draw so that's really
cool because she's very artistic and
contouring and highlighting no matter if
you're you know painting or if you're
just drawing if you're doing on on your
face you know it really can make a
difference and shadowing and you know
brightening certain areas it's so cool I
love I think the technique is awesome so
anyway um that is the Kat Von D um shade
+ light eye contour palette I'm gonna
swatch a few more shades for you guys
just so you guys can see I have
absolutely no complaints when it comes
to the the formula the formula is
perfect do you see that you don't get
any kick up you know they're not powdery
they're perfect and that's just the one
little swipe of each may
beautiful I really can't wait to use
this like in the fall I will be using it
like of course I'm gonna use during the
summer too but um I feel like this with
my Kat Von D locket tattoo foundation ah
flawless girl flawless so that will be
that will be really fun um but yeah so
I'm actually I'm disappointed myself
that I kind of judged this before
getting it and then I don't seem super
super excited I am really excited about
this it's just the packaging doesn't
excite me I'm one of those people that
like if I see something shiny oh my god
so I'm happy you know this doesn't
really talk excuse me this doesn't
really draw my eye
however it's what she puts on the inside
and I think she's all about that you
know she just has this plain black
packaging and people start trying to pop
her products and they realized oh my god
it's amazing she has really really like
I said earlier heavy products but what I
mean by that is like just super richly
pigmented in her everything her powders
her let's see her lip sticks her
foundations these these are all like
built cover stuff you know what I mean
it's really really cool so I like that
concept anyway um I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
