this video I will be giving you guys my
thoughts my opinions and I'm also going
to be swatching for you the Kat Von D
shade + like two tone blush in the shade
Sid + Nancy that is the one that I
picked up these are supposed to be kind
of sculpting and highlighting blushes
that have two different sides you can
either go ahead and use the deeper side
to sculpt out your cheekbones and then
highlight with the lighter side or you
can go ahead and swirl both of these
colors together for a universally
flattering blush shade so I'm going to
read a little bit about what it says on
the support calm website for you guys
quickly I did purchase this Omni
sephora.com website for twenty-five
dollars and I will link below where you
guys can pick them up as well if you are
interested after watching this review it
is not an affiliate link so it says Kat
Von D shade + like two tone blush they
are twenty-five dollars a piece and
there are seven different shades I
thought the one that kind of is like a
apricot kind of tulip sort of color and
it have a lot that are deeper in tone
and also some that are nude so there are
seven different shades and they are
twenty-five dollars a piece they are in
an innovative two-in-one blush that
shape and define the cheeks or next
level contouring it says the shapeless
like two tone blush defines your cheeks
through the art of color Kat Von D's
two-in-one blush features a duo of
complementary mat tone so every single
one of them every single do well all
seven of them are completely matte and
it says with seven stunning shades that
platter all complexions and face shapes
is brothas blush stays vibrant for a
full 24 hours of where it says first
sculpt and define your face shape with
the deeper shade blush and then
highlights would be like blush to
enhance bone structure specifically
formulated to work with Kat Von D shade
+ light contour palette which is sold
separately these silky powders blend
effortlessly into skin for a flawless
buildable finish and they are formulated
without parabens sulfates and paddle
aids so this is what the outer packaging
looks like a very very typical Kat Von D
it's just a matte black box and then
they do have a little pamphlet in here
and it shows you different ways of how
you can use this blush you can use it to
define and
I liked or you can be stumped together
and get like I said eight universally
flattering shade so she could use some
options there and then she also
recommends that you try out this little
shade + light brush I did not pick that
up but anyway this is what the outer
packaging of the actual product looks
like it's not super super sleek I
wouldn't say that it looks like amazing
it's actually kind of cheap in my
opinion it is completely plastic but I
like that it has the snap closure so but
I know that everything in there is
staying in there I did watch a few
reviews and this little part the actual
pan of the palette was falling out so I
don't know maybe they're not super well
like super glued in there mine is not
really movable when I take my finger in
there it's not like it's moving but that
is something to be aware of so you do
get I believe seven grams is that true
no nine grams of product in here which
is really really a lot for a blush I'm
going to go ahead and compare it to the
milani rose powder blushes um they're
very similar in size I think that you
get actually more in the kat von d one
but it's very very similar in size to
the Rose Milani powder blushes if you
guys are curious so there have been a
lot of really great reviews about this
products and a lot of really kind of
poor ones I'm really happy that I only
picked up one shade because I'm a little
hesitant about this product I think
there's some really really great things
about it and then there's some
not-so-great things I'm going to go
ahead and get started with the
not-so-great things one of the first
things that I noticed when I started
putting my finger in there is that these
particular like pigments I guess you
could say are not pigments but the
powder is actually pressed super super
super firmly into the product so you're
getting a really really nice kind of
silky touch but it's not buttery it's
not going to kick up a bunch of products
it's just not what I think the beauty
community is used to right now we're
really used to seeing stuff like becca
shimmering skin Perfector zor like foil
I shadows from makeup geek those are
super buttery and soft whereas this one
is just pressed very very firmly into
the palette and it creates something
that is called hard pan or you also i
think people call it oil pan which when
you put your fingers in there you can
actually see any sort of oil or moisture
on your fingers is going to leave a
little bit of a mark which is really
gross and this is hard to remove in my
opinion i will link a video below on how
you can actually remove hard pan or oil
pan or whatever you want to call it i
will link below there's also an article
on google that's really good i'll link
that below as well but it's just not
something you want to have to do it's
like why can't I just stick my finger in
there and swatch the color out without
doing that so that is the first thing
that I'm going to say is kind of
annoying and I don't think that this
blush feels particularly buttery and now
I don't get any sort of kick up and I
know a lot of people were saying that
these are kind of chalky in their
opinion I don't really find that I think
because it is pressed so firmly you
really are getting a really nice amount
of even color when you put your fingers
in there and also when you put your
brush in there I will say this applies
the best with a very very dense brush
you don't want something that's super
super fluffy these are not the most
pigmented blushes in my opinion however
I do have very fair skin so these kind
of color this kind of color is going to
show up on my skin tone now I don't know
what to say about the other seven shades
I don't know if these are going to show
up on really really deep skin tones I
kind of have the feeling they may not
because if I squash these colors for you
guys quickly you can kind of see these
are very very light I mean these are
very very very light colors and this is
you know I have very very fair skin so
that just kind of gives you an idea of
what the color sort of look like like I
said I have the duo this is sid plus
nancy so you get a ballerina pink color
and then you get a tulip color there and
I prefer to mix them together that's how
I am wearing it to date on my cheeks I
think it gives a really really nice
color when you mix them together so
overall I think the color is beautiful
but definitely on my skin tone I can see
why this may be chalky on people who
have like darker skin tones or maybe it
doesn't even show up on people with
darker skin tone so there are the two
mixed together so it's hard for me
because I really really love the color
and I do think that the um I do think
the powder looks beautiful on the cheeks
like I said I'm wearing it today
when I look in the mirror it's not
sitting on top of my skin it really just
kind of seamlessly blends into my skin
and I think it's beautiful and one of
the things that we have to remember and
I think a lot of people forget is like
we're so used to opening a product up
now and swatching it and expecting it to
be super super pigmented super soft
super buttery but sometimes we have to
remember that it's more about how it
performs on the cheeks and in my opinion
this looks beautiful on the cheeks so I
am willing to kind of let go of some of
the other issues with it I don't like
the fact that it has hard pan and the
oil pan thing going on I don't like how
firmly pressed it is into the actual
little pallet however I think that the
colors are very very beautiful and I
think that it does look very very
skin-like on the skin that skin like but
you know what I mean it's not like you
can tell oh she's wearing blush it looks
beautiful and it blends in with your
skin so I do the best kind of how I feel
about this product as of right now um I
wouldn't say it's kind of like a first
impressions because I've had this for a
while I've been playing with it but I
don't have any of the other colors so I
can't really tell you if the formulation
is the same on every single one of them
i am going to link below my friend amy's
video and also my friendly auras video
Amy actually did a first impression on
four of these and my friend leora did a
review and swatches on 26 of them almost
every single one of them so I will link
their videos below if you would like to
see swatches they are similar in skin
tone to me just so you're aware none of
us are very very dark in skin tone we
don't really have tan skin or deep skin
tones but uh one of them really really
love these and the other one didn't so I
feel like everybody is kind of getting a
different opinion on these and I think a
lot of it has to do with the fact of how
it's watches but we have to remember
we're writing this on our cheeks we're
not just sitting around and swatching I
don't know about you guys the only time
I really swatch products is when i first
get them or if i'm doing a video i don't
just sit there all day and I'm watching
my product I'm really wearing it on my
cheek so I think it does wear
beautifully on the cheeks it's very fine
milled I do find that it wears for a
very long time especially if you are
wearing a primer and especially if
you're wearing is setting
spray on the top so I I'm just I'm kind
of torn I'm kind of torn I don't know if
I want to pick up another one I think
that the amount of product you get for
$25 is really really fantastic I don't
think the packaging is great but at the
same time like I love the way it looks
on the cheeks i love the colors but then
I don't like them it's a very hard pan
and I get oil pan and I'm really really
torn about these let me know what you
guys think about these particular
products below and we can talk about
them some more so thank you so much for
joining me for this review and I will
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
