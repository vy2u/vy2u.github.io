promised today I do have another room
tour video for you guys a lot of you
liked the Ritz Carlton Hotel that we
were staying at so I thought I would
share with you guys the one that we are
currently staying at now which is in
Hawaii so I will leave the actual name
of the hotel I can't remember it off the
top of my head since we literally just
walked in but I wanted to show you guys
how it looked before we basically ruin
it because you know me after a while I
just have all my beauty products all
over the place so anyway I will have the
name of it in the title we are not
affiliated or sponsored by this
particular company or brand or you know
resorts in any way shape or form we just
really wanted to stay here so we are in
Hawaii so over here we have this
beautiful beautiful mirror as you guys
can see within nice a little desk that
I'm sure will get cluttered up Tom likes
to put his stuff all over the desk and I
like to put my stuff all over the
bathroom and then over here we have the
window and the view and now I don't know
if this is going to show up amazingly
because the Sun is really coming down
right now but we have a few little
cushions here which is really really
huge a for sitting down obviously the
blinds and the shades you look out and
we have a little terrace here kind of
and then directly is the beach so
kawaiii is really really when we were
driving here will we flew here and then
we were driving when we got our car I
noticed that it is honestly just amazing
amazing amazingly lush like there's a
lot of trees going on and there's a lot
of green greenery greenery is not a word
it just seems really really beautiful so
we are super super excited look at those
mountains too so anyway we're going to
be waking up to that it is currently
kind of late here so I have no idea if
this is actually working right now let
me see if I can kind of fix the lens
hopefully it will do some autofocus but
yeah and that is the view of the ocean I
think it looks absolutely amazing super
super excited and like I said they do
have some blinds there and then over
here we just have a lamb but with a
little plant over here I am sure it is
fake but you know what it's not it is
real bamboo I am always very impressed
when a hotel like go ahead and give you
a real actual plant I can't speak you
guys I'm sorry I just got off of the
plane and I had a rum and coke so I'm
sorry if I sound a little drunk alright
going on here we have a little couch
here I think this looks beautiful I do
actually like the color theme in here
normally I'm not huge into like all of
the seashells and things like that but I
think this is actually really cute and
then over here we have the bed stand so
I usually sleep on the left side so this
will be my side and then Tom side over
there and then I don't know if you guys
can see that but this is going to be
amazing so this is a by the way I'm
wearing a big sweater so I'm sorry if my
arms look huge and this is actually a
area where you can see through the
shower so like I don't know it's like
one of those things where if you want to
just go ahead and have a view while you
take a shower or your boyfriend wants to
watch a shower or vice versa you can go
ahead and do that they also do have a
switch where you can go ahead and close
it but I think that's amazing and then
right here is the bed and I think the
bed looks really really comfy and
beautiful so there it is and yeah so
that is pretty much the room as you guys
can see there's Tom suitcase and then
there is obviously my suitcase and then
here we have some little drawers as well
as all of our electronics so yeah anyway
that is it so this is kind of the room
tour let me go ahead and take you guys
into the bathroom because it looks
completely completely different I really
really enjoy that they did something a
little more modern in there right here
we do have let's see here a Francis by
the way they gave us these little hula
beads Francis Francis I don't know what
this is a little coffee maker which is
great I believe we do also have a fridge
down here which I really appreciate and
then there is the icy bucket which is
like the prettiest ice bucket I have
ever seen and then here we do have some
closet space which i think is great and
then we do have a full-size mirror here
as well there is the front door and here
is the bathroom like what this is
literally bathroom goals you guys look
at this mirror do you see this oh my
gosh yes yes yes so you have the his and
her sink
I really really love and appreciate and
I love this kind of like marbled thing
going on right here with the black I
think that's beautiful obviously they
did set out a few little cosmetic kind
of
so this is from the ground remedy and I
guess I will let you guys know if any of
these are good I'm always really curious
about products that they do leave out
free you know their guests to see if
they are any good I like to test them
out and then here is obviously the
toilet and then I'm a I can't speak
obviously we have a little piece of
artwork here and I hope that this is
also real you know what it is it's also
real bamboo which is absolutely
beautiful I just love this like I really
really love the way that this looks so
anyway this is kind of like a dream
bathroom for me so there is two rolls of
toilet paper right there which is
awesome and then you have a little step
here and you can get right into the
shower as well as the bathtub and like I
said there is a little switch so if you
do want privacy you can go ahead and do
that let me show you guys if I can find
it I think it was somewhere over here oh
no that's the oh my gosh you guys that's
a housekeeping let's turn that off that
basically shows if you want do not
disturb our housekeeping I've never seen
anything like that at a hotel where you
can just like click that but yeah
basically this will close up if you want
it to so if you don't want your
boyfriend or your girlfriend or whoever
looking at you shower that doesn't have
to happen and then here we do have a row
which actually looks kind of it feels a
little feels a little scratchy but it
still looks really good and then there
are some towels so yeah this is the
bathroom I feel like the bathroom is
blowing me away I thought the other
bathroom was amazing in the ritz-carlton
but this is like yes this is everything
so yeah anyway guys that is the little
hotel a room tour we just got here so I
don't know when you guys are gonna see
this video but I do hope you enjoyed it
and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
