alright I am going to declutter both of
my Dior nude air glowing gardens
highlights so I have glowing pink as
well as nude air and these are like $54
highlights as you can see beautiful
packaging - the thumb prints on there
because I have hand cream on right now
but beautiful packaging they are a true
baked shell a formula but I feel like
the wet and wild highlighters are very
comparable to these so I'm going to go
ahead and let go of both of these here
is what the shade new - air looks like
and if you want a dupe for this precious
petals from wet and wild is a dupe and
here is glowing pink and this one right
here the dupe for this I believe is
called blossom glow also from what
violet cruelty-free and I think those
highlighters are vegan obviously a Dior
is not so yeah I'm going to go ahead and
get rid of both of those now as far as a
becca products are concerned you guys
know i love my little flying saucers so
here are four out of the six light
chaser highlighters that i have i'll go
ahead and open a couple of these up but
i will be keeping all six i don't
believe i have the other two in this
particular video because there will be a
part two to this video but here are four
of them this one right here which is
rose quartz Flash's seashell is gorgeous
again it kind of is like the Dior where
it has a nice kind of white base but a
pink undertone on the Left we have
amethyst flashes a geode which is more
of a blush topper if I am really really
tan I can use that as a highlight and
then here we have topaz a flashes guilt
which is kind of like opal mixed
together with a little bit of a green
undertone and finally the most unique
out of the bunch of this is opal flashes
Jade it's a beautiful beautiful color
and if you guys saw my Becca
flying-saucer collection video I did a
swatch all of these out so I'll go ahead
and throw that up in the carts I have
two of my Oprah highlighters here this
one is called blissful which is kind of
like a rose gold and then this one is
the ever glow trio which was sent to me
at 4pr
this is part of the nikkietutorials
collection I also do have Rodeo Drive
but I guess I did not pull that
particular shade in this video but yes I
love these they really glide on nicely
and I like the way I can buff them into
my skin so I will be keeping them both
here we have the new Too Faced chocolate
diamond highlighter by the way I still
have leftover swatches on my hand either
it's like a prismatic sort of
shade you have green purple blue all
sorts of different colors in there it
really is gorgeous you guys I cannot can
I do this can I do this can you see the
swatch can you see the swatch a
beautiful highlight I use it a lot so
yes I'm gonna go ahead and hold on to
that all right speaking of Beca
highlights it looks like I also pulled
out a couple of these guys I was just
randomly picking through my collection
even the little shelf that holds these
so here we have rose quartz this is
prismatic amethyst I will be going ahead
and holding on to both of these on the
left is prismatic amethyst and on the
right is rose quartz and rose quartz
looks very very similar to the new
Parisian highlighter that they're
releasing so I won't be picking that one
up if you guys are curious but yeah
gonna keep both of those love my Becca
highlighters here are the Tarte
Amazonian clay highlighters in a stunner
and exposed I will be going ahead and
decluttering both of these since I am
boycotting Tarte and there is only a
certain amount of products from Tarte I
will be keeping the rest I will be
decluttering so these are two guys that
are going bye-bye and here is the makeup
forever profusion highlight I believe in
the shade 0-1 very similar to the Dior
glowing gardens but again very similar
to also the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powders can you tell I love
those yeah I'm willing to get rid of my
$30 $50 highlighters to keep those so I
will be going ahead and also
decluttering this one these are the
Urban Decay afterglow 8 hour powder
highlighters I have these shades
fireball sin as well as aura very very
pretty shades however I really just
can't get this formula to work and I
don't really think it has to do with
just having dry skin I really have tried
this year I've really tried to get them
to work but they are not so I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter all three of these
all right some more full-sized Becca
highlights let's see what we got here of
course at the infamous champagne pop
absolutely beautiful we'll be keeping it
moonstone
very very beautiful probably at one of
my favorite shades because it does have
a little bit of a yellow undertone again
keeping it and Prosecco pop the reason I
got a full-size of this was because the
Jacqueline Hill champagne collection
face palette had this one as well as
champagne pave later in it and I love
mixing the two of them together I feel
like I get that perfect like golden
peachy vibe so yes keeping this one as
well
I will be keeping a lot of my backup
products pretty much all of them the
Bobbi Brown afternoon glow highlighter I
remember loving this when I first got it
I used it as a blush topper however I
never ever reach for it and I find a
Bobbi Brown to be a very very boring
basic brand again similar shades with
the Wet n Wild mega glow highlighters so
I'm gonna go ahead and let go of this
Laura Mercier matte radiance a baked
powder and never understood the name of
this it's beautiful it really is
gorgeous on the skin however I think
I've worn it maybe ten times and I've
had it for about two years
so that signals to me hey there's
something about this product that's off
and what I think it is is the packaging
it's very clunky it's very big I do like
that it has a mirror however I'm just
not drawn to this so also going to
declutter that alright guys I just
wanted to do a little bit of a check-in
here to make sure that I am still on
track so over here are the highlighters
that I'll be keeping I feel like there's
a lot more over here so we have one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve so far over here that I
will be keeping and then over here we
have the highlighters that I will be
decluttering so we have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten so
that is where we are at so far here I
have two different wet-and-wild
highlighters I am planning on keeping I
mean I want to keep both of them because
you guys know how much I love it they
wet and wild highlighter formula but I
think I'm just gonna keep a Goldilocks
oh this was the solid bar gold highlight
and this one right here was from the
midnight mermaid collection has a little
bit of like a strange blueish undertone
to it and sometimes it doesn't look
great on my cheek so I'm gonna keep this
one declutter this alright here are my
Laura Geller baked gelato swirl
illuminators in peach glow gilded honey
as well as charming pink I love these I
love the formula they are second best
when it comes to the Wet n Wild mega
glow highlighting powders so yes I'm
going to be going ahead and holding on
to all three of these here we have the
pretty vulgar cosmetics shimmering Swan
highlight this is really really a pretty
however I feel like I have a lot of
colors like this so I am going to go
ahead and actually let go of this one
and when it comes to the ill masks
oh my god beyond powder illuminator I'm
looking down and I'm seeing it at the
balm cosmetics mary-lou manizer which I
love is on the table I'm starting to
count things out in my head and I'm not
liking the outcome so I'm actually gonna
let go of this here is Mary Lou I always
felt like she was so basic when the
whole highlighter craze kind of happened
but I have to say I love her she was one
of my first kind of highlighters and
she'll probably be one of my last kind
of highlighters beautiful mid-tone and
champagnes sort of color you need
something like this in your collection
if you're gonna highlight so yeah I'm
gonna keep that alright although these
are a lot of fun I am going to let go of
all of three of the wet and wild
what are these rainbow highlighters very
very pretty colors as you guys can see
but they're not the typical baked chalet
formula and they are a true powder and
compared to the mega glows they really
don't stand a chance so we're gonna say
goodbye to these speaking of the mecca
glow formula here we have precious
petals and lilac to reality lilac to
reality is probably one of the nicest
sort of bluish colors they have made I
notice that like the calyx one and the
limited edition one that came out last
season was a little more chunky so I'm
definitely gonna go ahead and keep both
of these I especially love precious
petals so here is that royal calyx shade
it looks basically identical except this
one has a micro glitter in it so this is
one of the mega glows that I will
actually declutter I have a true
love-hate relationship with this product
right here this is the G way a rose
quartz highlighter I don't like the way
it picks up on a brush like it really
doesn't you really have to dig in there
as you guys can see the little pattern
here but at the same time it's so
beautiful on the skin and I like the
color so for now I'm gonna go ahead and
hold on to this now I know I said I
wasn't gonna declutter any backup
products however when I did at my flying
saucer collection video I told you guys
that if there was something I was gonna
let go of it it would be this
highlighter that Becca sent for PR this
is the gradient glow highlighter I just
don't think it's anything special you
can see you have a little slivers of
moonstone as well as opal and blush
copper but I mean I feel like I have the
others in full-size so I just don't
really need this I will go ahead and
declutter it to a friend but yeah I'm
actually gonna let go of this
and the final two we have a milk makeup
holographic highlight this isn't a
peachy kind of pinky iridescent color it
reminds me a lot of Urban Decay's a
fireball but I don't like the formula on
this it is just not that pigmented so
I'm gonna let go of that and then here
we have the makeup revolution vivid
baked highlighter in the shade golden
lights I used to love this because it is
a dupe of for the candlelight glow
highlight from Too Faced but I feel like
the shift in here the gold shift is just
a little too much if you can't handle
anasazi of Beverly Hills marshmallow you
will not be able to handle the gold
shift in here it's just really really
really strong it used to look really
nice on my skin but I don't know like I
said getting a little older here and I
just feel like this stuff does not look
as good as it used to
so yeah I'll be decluttering those I
think we're good let's check on
everything all right guys here are the
highlighters I'm decluttering all twenty
and you here are the highlighters but I
will be keeping 20 so let's go ahead and
count them out just to make sure let's
see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 and 19 at 20 all right so we've
got 2 20 that are being decluttered and
over here we've got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 at 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 all
right I did
so refocus that you guys can see yeah so
here are the highlighters that I am

highlights and then here are the
highlighters that I am decluttering so I
