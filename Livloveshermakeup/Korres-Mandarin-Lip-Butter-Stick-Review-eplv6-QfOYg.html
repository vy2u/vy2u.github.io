today I am reviewing for you guys the
new Korres or Korres mandarin lip butter
sticks so they come in five different
shades I purchased mine on the
sephora.com website and I know I've been
reviewing a lot of lip products lately
but honestly I've just been into really
taking care of my lips and things like
that so on the website they have a
untainted virgin which is just a you
know like clear gloss or clear lip
butter they have a peach color which is
kind of orange II they have a pink which
is a nice light pink they have purple
which is deeper and then they have this
one which is rose like I said this is
the shade Rose I think it's really
beautiful it's not so much a rose color
I think it's a lot more red as you guys
can see but it has a really nice formula
it smells really good it smells like
candy like sweet mandarin orange candy
it's really really lovely I love the
fragrance and I think that they do have
a nice color selection umm Korres or
Korres also has their lip butters that
come in like a little pot like this this
is the jasmine one I recently picked
this up and I liked it so much that I
thought oh I might as well try out their
new lip butter sticks so basically this
kind of reminds me of the texture and
formula of baby lips if you don't want
to spend the almost 17 dollars that this
little product is this is $16.50 if you
don't want to spend that amount of money
I highly recommend going out and trying
out the Baby Lips this one really
reminds me of the Baby Lips and cherry
me
so again weight cheaper you can get it
at the drugstore whereas this one is
$16.50 on the sephora website i think
it's really nice like i said i really
like the color it is quite pigmented it
has a nice level of moisturization to it
and it does not dry out my lips so it's
one of those you know quick throw on
kind of colors you can run out the door
in two minutes and yeah so i really do
like it
um i think it's nice it does have it's
not the most moisturizing lip butter
I've ever used however it just has that
nice kind of slippery texture almost
like like I said the baby lips it has
that similar kind of thinner texture
which i think is nice on the lips i'm
gonna review guys a little bit about
it says Omni Sephora website it says the
chorus our pores I think is chorus
hahaha Mandarin lip butter stick $16.50
like I said there are five different
shades it says what it is an all-in-one
instantly hydrating and softening lip
treatment repair and protect with this
deeply nourishing lip treatment
formulated with a luxurious blend of
softening oils butters and waxes
Mandarin oil refreshes and soothes dry
chapped lips while rich shea butter and
sunflower wax wax deeply nourished for
long lasting care and comfort each
healing stick also features vitamin E
known for its advanced antioxidant
properties this 88 to 90 percent natural
formula is available in four tints and
one colorless option all of which can be
worn or layered under or over a lip
gloss or lipstick so um I definitely
agree with that one of my favorite
things to do with the baby lips is I
have basically I have so many baby
websites like 10 or maybe 15 I don't
even know but what I like to do is if
I'm wearing a lipstick that day I kind
of color coordinate with the baby lips
and I will pack that in my purse and
when I find that um the lipstick it you
know is starting to kind of go off my
lips or it's drying them out a little
bit I just take the corresponding
matching shade of my baby lips and I pop
it on top and it really just boosts the
color back up it adds moisture and I
find that this does the same exact thing
so um obviously I'm not gonna get every
single shade of this because like I said
it is $16.50 I highly recommend I think
a dupe for this is definitely cheering
me in the Baby Lips collection from
Maybelline so anyway those are my
thoughts of my review on me Korres
Mandarin lip butter stick I hope you
guys enjoyed this I will link below
where you guys can pick it up and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
