today's video I have my May 2016 empties
for you guys there's a lot of them and I
feel like there's always a lot of them
honestly
I filled this container every single
month so I feel good that I go through
products cuz they do purchase a lot of
new stuff so anyway I am here to share
with you guys like I said my empties and
if you are serious I'm wearing Tom's
shirt right now and I have my hair and
this little Turbie twist headband thing
cuz it's all messy I just put on my
night time skincare routine it's like
11:30 at night on Tuesday you guys are
gonna see this on Wednesday and I filmed
this video earlier I don't know what
happened with the footage it just
disappeared it's like black magic so I
don't really know what happened so I am
just going ahead and refilling it and
obviously I'm not all cute and like
wearing makeups now so you know it's
okay anyway like I said in my little
Turbie twist Ulta haul before I mean
it's like if I want to film I'm gonna
film right so anyway please excuse me no
makeup and the dirty hair and the
boyfriend shirt let's go ahead and get
right into the empties for the month so
the first item I used up it was the
Herbal Essences smooth collection
conditioner this was like a really big
conditioner as you guys can see I
purchased this because of the scent it
smells so good I used this in high
school and it worked really well but now
I use deep conditioners to actually like
moisturize my hair I use them as my
conditioner basically so this really
didn't do enough for me it was not
moisturizing enough I felt like I had to
use a lot of product it is relatively
inexpensive I think this was like $6.99
at Target and you do get one later in
here I just really like the scent that's
honestly the only reason I got it and I
really want to try and get my hands on
the dry shampoo I heard that they have a
dry shampoo in this sense so if I can
get that I definitely will and if you
guys hear things being dropped into bins
I have a recycling bin here and then a
trash bin here so yeah yeah alright the
next item I used up was the soap big
lorry flake away scrub but this has shea
butter sugar and peach seed in it and I
love this I will definitely repurchase
this has quickly become a favorite scrub
of mine it has the signature pink soap &amp;amp;
Glory scent which
amazing smelling it's the same one as
clean on me and hand food it just smells
so good and fresh and I really liked the
consistency of this I don't like it as
much as might retouch a sugar scrub I
think that one scrubs a little better
but this one is still really nice it
doesn't leave the tub oily or your skin
oily and it does have a nice sort of
like scrubby lather to it if that makes
sense so I would repurchase that let's
see here I went through four of these
philosophy let's see if I can find all
of them I only can find it's pretty so
far okay well I went through four of
these philosophy three-in-one products
these are these shampoo shower gel and
bubble bath these were just a little set
that I got during the holidays so they
were all kind of like Christmasy
smelling or like pumpkiny smelling you
know so I wanted to get through these
before the summer so this one was
pumpkin icing that one was really nice
this one was fresh cream I also smelled
really good and then this one was
vanilla bean nutmeg and of course the
one I can't find is my favorite it is
the advice cinnamon stick that one
smells so good I really do like the
philosophy three-in-one products I do
use them as shampoo bubble bath and also
body wash when I am out of town because
they're just a great three-in-one
product also I am using the pink frosted
animal cracker any full-size right now
and I use that to clean my makeup
brushes so I don't get any sort of skin
irritations or anything like that from
using that so I really love those
three-in-one products and I will
repurchase alright we went through or we
used up at the mango dragon fruit a deep
cleansing hand soap from Bath and Body
Works this was a blend of golden Mangala
lush pink dragon fruit and sugar cane it
smelled really really good we had that
in the kitchen we would definitely
repurchase all right Tom and I also used
up at the Neutrogena anti residue
shampoo this is the best clarifying
sorry I have an oil on my face right now
I can feel it getting all like super
oily underneath my nose anyway this is
the best clarifying shampoo on the
market in my opinion I have tried a lot
I do like the suave daily clarifying one
as well however this is just the best if
you deal with like oily scalp or even
just having build up in your hair from
products this is amazing
it will completely rinse your hair clean
and leave it super super soft and silky
even Tom really likes that a lot so we
will definitely be repurchasing that I
tried the red kin like cleansing cream I
hated that this is way better definitely
pick that one up if you were looking
very good clarifying shampoo from the
drugstore all right I used up the Jun
Jacob spa collection new really
hydrating mist this is nice I got this
out of off of off of whole look um so I
don't know if I'll be able to find it
again but I used it to set in my
skincare in the morning and at nighttime
you guys know I love facial spray so it
was nice that's sort of a strange scent
it was a little too like spa ish for me
if that makes sense there was like a lot
of rosemary and like basil and normally
I like spraying a mist that smells like
I have no coconut or Rose so I don't
know I guess I would repurchase it it
was only like six dollars and fifty
cents
it was nice so yeah I think I would
repurchase it I just didn't love the
smell at first but I got used to it
alright so the next item I used up that
I would also repurchased is the Shiseido
Ibuki and multi solution jello this has
a salicylic acid acne treatment in it
and helps with roughness and visible
pore care this is an amazing level
product it's a really really nice little
thick jelly that just sinks into the
skin immediately I really really liked
it as my treatment at night time I will
repurchase but not yet because I am
using a retinol product as my treatment
currently so I like to just use some
sort of treatment on my face at night
whether it be telus like acid or benzoyl
peroxide our to scratch myself or
retinol and then I like to go in with
whatever moisturizer I'm using for the
week so yeah I would repurchase that
alright we burned through the Indigo sky
through the candle from Bath and Body
Works so this is a blend of deep blue
error whatever that means Sun dappled
orange blossoms and soft amber we had
this in the master bedroom and as you
guys can see it's not burned evenly on
or what happened here but I really
wanted this because I really like this
little container here Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
has been releasing new little like
containers for their 3 what candles if
you do pop them like I do then this is
so cute for organization but this
smelled a little too strong for Tom and
I uh it sounds very like Colonia CHH is
why I got it for the master bedroom
because I didn't want to put something
super super sweet-smelling in there
because he already has to smell all that
 all over the house anyway so I
thought this would be nice but it was
actually a little too strong like
stronger than mahogany teak wood like
very very strong so I don't think we
would repurchase that another item we
would not repurchase from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works is the golden pineapple luau deep
cleansing hand soap this has fresh
pineapple juicy mango and passion fruits
all I smelled was pineapple everybody
raves about this but honestly I don't
like the scent of pineapple I love the
taste
I love eating pineapple but the scent I
was not crazy about so we would not
repurchase that alright so the next item
I used up was these summer's eve
lavender nighttime cleansing wash for
sensitive skin a lot of you were
recommending that I go ahead and try
like a fragrance free bar soap next so
I'm probably going to do that but I
probably would repurchase this if I
don't see any sort of like results I
guess with the bar so but I did like
this a lot it had a really nice creamy
lather and it was cool no downstairs
area
so anyway I'm moving on we used up the
wallflower DLO in the lilac blossoms
scent we had these in the living room I
love the lilac blossoms scent especially
during the springtime I will repurchase
that next spring for sure alright I used
up a tree sweet hot state sugar scrub in
the lychee and plump scent this was a
new scent to me you guys see these every
single month Ian on my auntie's videos
I'm obsessed with this scrub but anyway
you can get usually get them like buy
one get one 50% off at Ulta they're all
amazing the best formulation on a body
scrub ever you guys seriously it
exfoliates so well but it does not leave
you only or greasy it actually leaves
your skin feeling quite moisturize so I
love this and I will definitely
repurchase in many different scents an
item I would not repurchase is the
garnier ultralift anti wrinkle firming
moisturizer it had broad-spectrum SPF 15
sunscreen and I thought it was a
physical sunblock because it was so
heavy and oily on the skin but it's
actually chemical sunblock so I was kind
of surprised but anyway this was reduced
down like on clearance at Walgreens I
thought I would pick it up and try it
out both Tom and I hated it
it really stings if you get it near your
eyes it was just it was horrible
this little Bare Minerals 5 and 1 BB
advanced performance cream eye shadow
with broad-spectrum SPF 15 was just too
dark for me so I'm just gonna
hold on to that and get back to a friend
who has a deeper complexion and I do all
right I used up let's see 16 of these
Vic Soleil color collection racers these
are disposable razors and they came in
just a variety of colors it really made
shaving my legs a whole new special
experience seriously you have like
really bright yellows and you like pink
colors and just like I don't know it
just made like you know shaving your
legs special because they were so bright
and happy looking so I like to eat a lot
I think I've got this at Sam's Club and
it was relatively inexpensive and on top
of that I mean everything at Sam's Club
and Costco you buy in bulk but it was
definitely worth it I got those in
October and I just ran out now all right
so I would definitely go Prentiss all
right let's see here I've used up a pack
of the up and up premium cotton ovals I
will definitely repurchase they are no
longer my holy grail cotton pad because
I have now tried out these shisei no
hundred percent cotton pads they're
amazing like ridiculous so I really do
like those for the eye area however I do
like those up and up
cotton ovals for applying toner because
I feel like it really distributes all
the products and you don't need to use
as much so I would definitely repurchase
all right I give stuffy Kevin Murphy
angel mask this is a strengthening and
thickening conditioner for fine color
treated hair like if you have limp thin
hair like I do they sell this at these
long that I go to you it smells so good
I really really do like it but I think
next time I see my stylist you know
we're gonna be chopping my hair to my
shoulders and going blonde or blonder I
guess you could say touching up my roots
I think I want to get the hydrate one I
want to try that one out next so yes I
would repurchase I do like the Kevin
Murphy grant quite a bit alright I used
up the downy UNSTOPABLES in wash scent
boosters in the shimmers and these are
nice these are the first in wash scent
boosters that I ever tried but honestly
these snuggle in wash Sun boosters
smells so much better I like these
because they're like these little
pebbles and they don't get stuck in the
little rubber area a lot of like the in
wash scent boosters come in pods and
then they get stuck and these do not so
I like the formulation but the sense is
not nearly as good as the Snuggle ones
like the blue iris bliss or the cherry
blossom charm or the lavender joy those
smell so
my favorite Dhoni unstoppable is the
lush scent if you guys are curious it's
the purl one alright so we used up the
Tiki Beach to wallflowers this was
another little pack to really have a
strong fragrance throw the candle
however smells amazing I highly
recommend that right yeah that was kind
of a weak Wallflower I don't think we
would repurchase I new stuff at the
rocket daily resurfacing this that these
are 28 spell foaming dual texture discs
you guys know that I use these to remove
my makeup so as the second part of my
makeup removal at nighttime I just run
one of these over my face one side is
textured I go over my t-zone with that
area with that side and then the soft
side I just go on the outer perimeters
of my face it removes makeup it helps
with breakouts it's amazing and they are
really really nice and travel friendly
so I highly recommend checking those
outs and they are relatively inexpensive
I usually get mine at Ulta buy one get
one 50% off and I think they're $7.99 or
$8.99 for 28 discs so that's pretty good
alright here's the other philosophy
shampoo shower gel and bubble bath this
was my favorite one this was the spice
cinnamon stick it smells so good alright
I'm moving on I've used up the Mario
Badescu temporary lifting mask if you
want to try out the glam glow gravity
mud but you don't want to pay the price
this gives you the same sort of result
it's not the same sort of format like or
send or anything like that but it does
give you a very very like identical
results so that is really nice I would
purchase another item I would repurchase
is the Garnier skin active micellar
cleansing water mmm so oily
this is these sensitive virgin I don't
like the blue cap I like the pink cap if
you were looking for a really nice just
pure cleansing water like just a
cleansing solution that's not gonna
leave you oily this is the one to get I
really enjoyed this and did you get a
lot more product in here than you do
with the simple one alright
I also used up these suave professionals
carotene infusion dry shampoo if you are
going to try out a dry shampoo from swab
let it be the professional keratin one
this one is the best the other one
seriously suck in my opinion so I love
this it doesn't leave a white cast in my
hair and it makes it feel super fresh
and clean and bouncing and amazing
so I would repurchase another item I
would definitely repurchase than I
already have this is the nectarine Sun
tea deep cleansing hand soap from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works it is a blend of sweet Sun
tea and ripe nectarine you guys oh my
god it smells so so good it just smells
like pure nectarine and like he is just
it's a great sense I highly recommend
we're definitely repurchase like I said
I already have alright I've used up the
Mario Badescu facial spray with aloe
herbs and rose water this is one of the
cheaper like in prices this is one of
the cheaper options for like facial mist
I'm really into buying high-end facial
mist for whatever reason you only get
like three ounces of product and it's
like 50 bucks don't ask me why I'm so
obsessed with it but I need to buy a few
of these because you can get these I
think for $7.99 when they're on sale
which is a great deal and they work just
as well so I would highly recommend
checking that out okay this is so weird
to see this thing it looks like it's
full there's like air in there okay I
did use this table this is the formula
1006 what is that it was just the air
the formula 1006 keep your cool skin
calling gel mask it has coconut and
cucumber it helps with rashes and
breakouts and I think it is nice
I love the formula 1006 brands you can
get their masks for I believe under $5
at Ulta you do get 100ml or 3.4 fluid
ounces of product in there really good
deal but what I highly recommend
checking out is the deep down detox oh
my god it's got bergamot and orange in
it is absolutely fantastic that one I
would repurchase this one I wouldn't
because I do prefer my Peter Thomas Roth
cucumber gel mask but it was nice I
don't know why it puffed up like that at
the end all right I used up this little
glam glow at thirsty mud hydrating
treatment I have since purchased in a
full-size my brother and I used up the
OGX weightless hydration coconut water
shampoo this was just a little deluxe
eyes I had it in the guest bathroom when
he was visiting I used it once or twice
and then he finished it off it made his
hair he is really coarse hair I was like
touching his hair I was like petting him
looks like let me feel your hair and it
made his hair feel a lot like silkier
and I just like the OGX brand in general
you guys hear me talk about them all the
time I feel like a GXE either works for
you or it doesn't and it just works for
me
all right the next item I would
repurchase but I really shouldn't so
this is the Olay oil minimizing clean
toner this has really really strong
fragrances in it it's filled with
alcohol but for some reason my skin
looks so dang good when I use it you
guys I swear to God so it's like 399 I
wouldn't recommend trying it out because
it just has so many artificial
fragrances and alcohol and things that
dry out your skin but it just makes the
skin look so good so I would repurchase
alright I used up this little bergamot
22 conditioner I couldn't get the rest
out but I think that Tom got that on
some sort of spot rate or something like
that it smelled really good and it was a
nice conditioner I also used up this
little belief Hungarian water essence
I've gone through quite a few of these
in the past couple of months I would not
purchase during the summertime just
because this is a product that you put
on after your toner before your serum
and honestly I tend to get very oily
during the summertime I don't need that
extra hydration but it is a nice during
the winter time so I would consider
purchasing that when the cooler months
roll around alright I used up the
covergirl the super sizer mascara this
is my all-time favorite drugstore
mascara I would definitely repurchase
another item I will repurchase is the
bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
aromatherapy stress relief eucalyptus
tea luxury bath I love the luxury bath
formulations are very similar to just
the regular body wash and film bath
however they have some really really
nice hydrating ingredients in them and
they're just very very luxurious so I
like to this scent a lot I have I think
all of them from the stress relief
stress relief line and I really do feel
like the aromatherapy does help it
really helps me to unwind at nighttime I
really enjoy those alright I need stuff
these sheets lavender plus sage natural
deodorants and this freaked me out
at first I got this in my allure sample
Society box and it was like this pace
thing basically you just put underneath
your armpits I liked it more and more
the more I used it I made a video called
like battle of the natural deodorants
and I totally was like this that means I
hit but honestly I liked it so I think I
will go ahead and pick up these
Schmidt's lavender and sage but I want
to get it in like the roll-on version or
not the roll-on but you know what I mean
the one where I don't have to dig my
finger in
and rub it on my armpits right now I'm
using the crystal I think it's the white
tea and lavender or something like that
however that still has aluminum in it
and my Lucas doctor recommended that I
really try and stay away from products
with aluminum so I know that the Schmidt
Swan is completely natural I just spit
did you guys see that that was gross
all right I used up a little spongebob
this is the Real Techniques sponge it
looks like I took little bites out of
him he is ready to go all right I used
up two perfumes this month don't you
hate when you use up like really
expensive perfumes the first one was the
Marc Jacobs mod waar this is a beautiful
perfume I would definitely repurchase it
smells like gardenia if you do want a
dupe for it definitely check out the
Pacifica Tahitian gardenia perfume it
smells pretty much identical and then I
also used up the DKNY be Delicious fresh
blossom perfume and both of these
there's like this small amount that I
can't get at the bottom I really want to
just like break these over and get it
out because these were expensive anyway
the bead delicious fresh blossom was
really really nice I personally really
like the bee delicious scents I love
anything apples so this was really
really nice and I would consider
repurchasing but I would probably get
just the regular one like the green
apple scent next time all right I used
to have two little packets of makeup
remover wipes and I didn't no longer
using makeup remover wipes on my face
unless I'm in a hurry or I really need
to use them I really just use these for
swatches now because I'm really pull and
tug at my face when I'm using these and
I just don't think it's good for my skin
so the first one I used up with the
Burt's Bees peach and willow bark
exfoliating facial cleansing towelettes
I have already repurchase love for
removing swatches smells like peach
really really nice and I also really
enjoyed it yes to cucumbers soothing
hypoallergenic facial wipes they
recently reformulated the actual
consistency of like the pad is so much
softer so I like this one a lot I did
pick up the yes to blueberries age
refresh ones I don't like them nearly as
much as the cucumber because they leave
an oily residue and when you're doing
swatches you just don't want that so I
would definitely repurchase both of
those all right I used up the Trader
Joe's spot 100% pure jojoba oil I like
to this a lot you can use it anywhere on
your skin you can use it to remove your
makeup it actually
mimics the skins like natural sebum so
it just has a great consistency to it
you can use it in your hair
I will not repurchase right now just
because I have so many oils to go
through but it is a good product all
right a three-way candle that drove me
crazy and I could not even get through
is the Noel Silver pine and cedar yes
this is a winter candle um it says
create a beautiful home for Christmas
with this aromatic blend of pine needles
feeder and juniper sprigs it smells like
 it doesn't smell like any of the
things that we just listed don't get it
all right the next item oh I would not
repurchase
every next item I used up was the
forever 21 strawberry hand cream I just
got this because I wanted this packaging
it's not nearly as good of a hand cream
as say the tony moly hand creams which
are really heavily fragranced and you
know hydrating this didn't really smell
like strawberry but that container is
super cute so yes all right the next
item we used up was the island margarita
three-way candle it says it is an
intoxicating scent of sunny lime sweet
mango and juicy plum with a freshly
salted rim this is one of my all-time
favorite mmm girl this is one of my
all-time favorite scents that um
bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks releases over the
summer it's beautiful it smells so good
and if you are one of those people you
like really really like fresh scents
during the summer time instead of like
they're really like creamy coconut ones
with sandalwood you would really enjoy
I was margarita all right I used up
another pack of the up enough premium
cotton elbows like I said I would
repurchase a few hand creams here that I
went through the talk or toka is it taka
this is the Cleopatra of grapefruit and
cucumber hand cream it was just okay I
wouldn't find my way to purchase it
the EOS one this was really really nice
I think it was called baby blossom I
would go out of my way to repurchase
that I used up the hiccups I used up the
little what is this hydrate Mir ins from
Kevin Murphy this was a wonderful
conditioner like I said I'm really into
Kevin Murphy products so I would get
something similar to this again I don't
use regular conditioners so I think I'm
gonna get the hydrating mask alright we
used up the stress relief
aromatherapy eucalyptus spearmint hand
soap we love this
Tom especially loves this so yeah we
would definitely repurchase I used up a
little mini Peter Thomas Roth Irish more
purifying black mask love this would
definitely purchase a full-size it's
really nice if you deal with acne and
breakouts but you don't want to put on a
clay mask that's going to make your face
feel like stone we don't just think dry
down so harshly this actually hydrates
your skin but it decongest your pores so
it's awesome I used up this little
sample of the pear phone
empty face finishing moisturizer it was
just okay absolutely nothing special
very very hefty price tag on that one as
well Tom and I used up the Marvis we
finally finished the little holiday pack
that I got these are just this is such a
hyped up item these are the Marvis
toothpastes they're basically just like
luxury toothpaste they really taste like
 this one is a Morelli licorice and
we would argue over who had to use that
one because I was always like no I want
a product mint because I mean who likes
to brush their teeth with black licorice
that's disgusting and then we used up
the aquatic mint these are nothing
special I think the only really good
tasting one is the Jackman one Jasmine
lavender or something like that that one
was good all right I get up this little
Aryan what is this water lily Suns
perfume I like this because I had a
little sprayer it smelled good not
really my kind of sense so I would not
purchase a full-size I used the Tarte
artist lash paint this made like all my
life is covered literally I use that and
I lost 12 lashes in one day would not
get that in a full-size all right I have
an antibacterial hand gel with an anti
are you an antibacterial hand gel from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works here and I just cannot
stand I don't even wants literally I
feel nauseated when I smell this this is
the Honolulu so I'm gonna puke this is
the Honolulu Sun scent and it's just
this overpowering a blend of oh my god
oh so gross it's this overpowering blend
of coconut and lime and it's just too
much there's like too much warmth in
there it's disgusting it's disgusting
don't get it all right
I would not repurchase I used up this
little
we micellar cleansing water this was
good it's nothing spectacular it has
quite a hefty price tag and you can get
better ones at the drugstore at like the
Garnier Glen's in the pink cap version
or the simple micellar water so I would
not repurchase I was silly kind of stuff
my eyes we also used up this little
glide Pro health comfort floss Tom
wanted to put this in here so yes we use
that and we liked it and then the last
item that I used up with this little
glam glow para module cleanse treatment
I have already purchased a bigger size
of this alright guys that those where am
I May 2016
empties I hope you enjoyed this video
