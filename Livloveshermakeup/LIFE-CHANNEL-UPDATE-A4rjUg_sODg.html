channel thank you so much for joining me
i hope you are all having a fantastic
day I feel somewhat okay today which is
what I'm on camera filming for you guys
so anyway this video is going to be a
channel and life update and I don't want
you guys to get scared for any second
thinking oh my god she's gonna announce
on our channel that she's no longer
gonna be posting or something like that
I've been gone for about five days off
of my channel which is a very very long
time for me personally I try and post
for you guys every day if not more than
once a day um so I know that it's been a
long time since I have been posting I
don't think i've posted since saturday
so anyways almost a week now that i have
been off my channel i'm here to explain
to you guys why i just want to say right
away if you're scared that I'm gonna be
like Oh guys I will only be posting once
a week or I'm not going to be posting
any more on my channel that's not the
case whatsoever I will actually be back
to posting a new Beauty blip a new
Beauty a video every single day starting
tomorrow again so if that's what you
were worried about don't be worried
about that I don't mean to come on here
and say oh you know channel update as in
i'm changing my channel nothing's
changing on my channel i just wanted to
kind of tell you guys where I be in so
that you guys can understand why I
basically been m.i.a for the past five
days so yeah so for five days I have
been m.i.a I've not been answering
anything on Instagram I have not been
I'm just really bad at answering things
on Instagram in the first life but I've
not been answering comments on YouTube I
have not been answering messages on
YouTube text messages phone calls like
you name it I just have not been there
and I have unfortunately been in and out
of the hospital in the past five days it
for two days pretty much so I was in the
first time for dehydration I came home I
felt much better everything was good i
was gonna go back to work and um i had
to go back in for liver swelling so i've
been having some pretty severe I don't
want to see severe because this is not
the worst lupus flare-up I've ever had
this is probably there's actually not is
not the worst one I've ever had but this
is one of the more intense lupus flare
ups I've had so yes if you were curious
the reason I have been gone is because I
have been in a lupus flare-up I plan on
doing a whole video dedicated to the
topic of lupus it's in
autoimmune disease that i was diagnosed
with about what was it three to four
years ago this is for 25 years ago it
was my freshman year of college so I've
had lupus for I mean it doesn't feel
like it's been that long but I guess
it's been about four to five years now
I've had lupus and I do plan on doing a
video dedicated to the subjects talking
about everything when I was diagnosed
because lupus awareness month is
actually in May so I think that's great
and i would love to post a video about
it but right now in this video I'm just
telling you guys I'm not going to go
into detail or anything but I'm just
kind of telling you guys where I've been
so I've been in and out of the hospital
I've been feeling like complete I
mean really really shitty um my
arthritis hasn't been acting up or
anything like that which is great
because you guys know I'm a flutist so
sometimes when I go into lupus flare ups
one of the hardest thing is things to
deal with is the fact that i already do
have ra so i have rheumatoid arthritis
which means that my joints just get
really really swollen and i pretty much
can't practice my flute i have not had
that issue i literally just cannot get
out of bed i have like muscle aches
absolutely everywhere I've been
depressed i've been crying almost every
single day I know that sound oh sorry I
know that sounds so so like silly um
because there could be so many like
worse things in the world than what I'm
dealing with um but I'm not going to cry
in this video um but anyway um yeah I've
been feeling extremely extremely
lethargic ain't depressed and that's so
not my style and so not my personality
and I can't help it but when I feel sick
I feel depressed and the last thing I
want to do is come on to my channel and
be like that you know because my channel
is the place for happiness and you know
it was a good thing like makeup and
beauty stuff and your hair care it's
good care and all the things that make
me happy so the last thing I want to do
is post when I am sick so anyway the
first thing I just want to say is the
channel update or the reason why I've
been gone you know my channel update
things thatís it's basically just
because i have been sick i have now
been feeling good whatsoever and I want
to thank you guys for all of the
messages and comments I have not been
answering to anything even some of my
closest friends were texting me and
they're like are you alive like what's
happening and I just haven't gotten back
to anybody i feel so not like myself
when i'm sick and i hope you guys can
understand i feel like i should have
handled it a little better and i'll have
to be completely honest because i have
over 8,000 people that you know are
subscribed to my channel now and a lot
of you work very concerned and I
apologize if I made any of you feel like
you were so concerned to the point where
you know you didn't want to watch my
channel anymore you wanted to
unsubscribe I got a message the other
day with someone who was really really
concerned and I'm so sorry that was like
in no way shape or form what I was not
trying to make you feel that way I
apologize i want to be able to handle
things better and also i feel like once
I make my lupus video you guys will have
a better understanding in case something
like this happened well I know will
happen again when I go into flare-ups
you guys can understand kind of what's
happening and why I'm so am ia and I'm
gonna try and open up more when i am in
flare-ups because it's just hard for me
to literally just like get out of bed I
mean it's hard for me to do anything but
I should be able to you know talk with
friends and things like that is just
very sad that I can't even I can't even
seem to do that so the second thing
regarding the channel update is that I
want to have like a nice amount of pre
filmed videos for you guys when this
kind of thing does happen because if
there's one thing that I noticed this
fast time I was just like Shay I have no
pre filmed videos and there have been
times where I have been m.i.a for five
days or seven days and you guys haven't
noticed because I had pre film videos
out I did not this time and it was
really bad because I'm like wow yet
another day where there's no video and
you guys are used to be posting so
frequently and I want to post so
frequently so I'm going to start
probably adding in one to two extra
videos every single week so that when
something like this happens again I have
pre filmed videos going up and for some
reason if you are in hearing back from
me in 24 to 48 hours you might know
something's wrong I really try and
answer you guys like you know I try and
answer you guys within 24 hours um I'm
again I'm really bad with instagram I'm
sorry
really hard for me with Instagram when I
see like people tagged me and stuff like
that because I feel like you have to
scroll way back and even when you answer
comments on Instagram I didn't know like
I would always type in the little name
like you would do the @ symbol and then
the name i would type it in I didn't
know you could just hold it down and
then it would like add the person I know
that sounds so weird but I'm not very
good with the Instagram and I'm bad at
getting back to people basically I
didn't even know there was like a DM or
private message like area is it called a
DM or PM or whatever I didn't know there
was a private message area in Instagram
until like a month ago when I saw that
there were like 72 messages there and I
was like oh my god I'm sorry so anyway I
just want to say I'm really sorry about
that if you don't hear back from me on
instagram please write to me on my
channel I think it's easier for me to
get back to you guys I'm here just
because I kind of know what I'm doing on
YouTube whereas with like other social
media outlets I'm completely like I
don't know what I'm doing so please
don't think is that I'm ignoring you or
anything like that I just really like
Instagram is still kind of new to meet
you guys know i started my instagram
what maybe three or four months ago so i
haven't had it for that one anyway um so
yeah that's kind of what i plan to do
with my channel like i said i'll be back
to filming normal videos tomorrow I'm
feeling better to the point where i can
get on camera today and hopefully
tomorrow I can kind of get myself I'll
kits eat up and shower and wash my hair
and do all that kind of stuff so that I
can start to feel a little better I have
taken the whole week off of work and it
was funny because I was in work the
first couple days of the weekend that I
got really sick and then I went back and
then I got sick again and then finally
um some people from work we're just like
please just take me comes like
blinged-out gown to work okay so anyway
that's kind of been what's been going on
with that so nothing's going to be
different with my channel I just wanted
to apologize I feel like I kind of
handled this poorly just kind of
dropping off the face of the earth I
just want to say it for some reason I
don't answer you guys in 24 to 48 hours
on YouTube but there probably is
something wrong with my health and I
will try and always let you guys know on
Instagram but again it's just one of
those things when I'm feeling sick the
last thing I want to do is tell people
I'm feeling sick
last thing I want to do because it
already is very irritating to me and I
already don't feel like myself when I'm
sick I look different I feel different
and um yeah that's just like a whole
other story and again I will be making a
lupus video this month in May so stay
tuned for that where I can go more in
detail about kind of a little more about
lupus and autoimmune diseases and stuff
like that um but yeah so that's kind of
the channel update now for the life
update I have been in the talks with a
flute company that wants to sign me as
like an emerging artist which is a huge
thing for me you guys know I'm 23 years
old I'll be 24 in August and a lot of
the time people don't really get signed
to like I don't want to say it like
flute labels but like flu companies
don't really sign someone unless there
may be like you know late 20s early 30s
a little more into their career than I
am and I feel like so blessed and lucky
that somebody has reached out to me and
wants me to do this um now if you guys
are unaware Tom will be taking his
medical boards in about three weeks now
and then he will be doing his fellowship
next year in Ohio so we are moving from
Milwaukee to ohio next year and I am
signed into a contract where I work
right now currently I am signed in for
the next year I'm locked in that's
what's going to be happening so this
kind of thing with the flute company
wouldn't be happening probably until
next year or the year after so I would
be around 24 or 25 years old which makes
like a little more sense but that's been
really really exciting because
ultimately what I do want with my career
is to be a solo artist so it's just kind
of shocking to me that that has started
to kind of happen already for me
personally because I just didn't really
see that coming and I've always been
really really honest with you guys on my
channel this is not something that my
channel my youtube channel is not
something I am interested in doing as a
profession right now maybe in the future
that will change but right now my
biggest focus is music and um that's
always been the case I know a lot of you
are like you put so much work and
dedication into your channel and I think
a lot of it is probably just the amount
of videos that I
you no spit out I think it's because I
don't edit my videos so the whole
YouTube thing is actually a lot easier
for me honestly it's a lot easier for me
than other people um for them to sit
down and edit and put a lot of time and
work into their videos I'm not saying I
don't put a lot of time I work into
though I just don't put even a fraction
of what they put in if that makes sense
and that doesn't mean that I don't care
about my channel or anything like that
I've just been very honest with you guys
saying that this is not something and I
feel like I am kind of the odd person
out I know a lot of people start their
channels because they're interested in
doing it in the long run I've been very
honest with you guys and I always said
at this time at this current time this
is not something that I am interested in
doing as a profession or as a career
right now so anyway that still is the
case really really big in on flute and
music right now like I always have been
on my channel and yeah so those are kind
of just like my channel updates my life
updates that's kind of what's going on
of course the whole stole artist thing
that wouldn't happen and tell like I
said I have to be done with this job
that I'm have right now and then also
sorry feelin it like snot hanging on my
novels let me check oh yeah there it is
anyway I have to finish up here in
Milwaukee and then of course we're
moving next year and that will be
exciting you guys know Tom as a
radiologist so he has done five years of
residency okay five years he has been so
much like medical school five years of
residency and then he has to do a
fellowship as well because he's an
overachiever and he also wants to do
specialty he's going to be working on
breast imaging to help women who have
you know cancer and things like that so
that's the specialty that he'll be going
into I don't know how I got into that
but anyway that's the specialty that
he'll be going into so he had we will be
in Cleveland where he will be at a
hospital there and he will be you know
continuing his education and then he
will be out I mean he's technically
already a doctor but then he'll be like
working and you know be like a working
doctor um and yeah so that's kind of
like what the next like six months or a
year kind of looks like for us and as
far as my channel nothing's going to be
changing i'll still be posting the same
content i'll still be throwing out
videos whenever the hell I want to
travel
up and there will be a video every
single day but what I really want to do
is make sure that next time I'm not
feeling well I'm a little more in touch
with you guys and I don't feel so
self-conscious about being on camera or
just being in contact with you guys I
feel very self-conscious when I'm in my
lupus flare ups you know my skin changes
my hair will fall out my you know
everything looks different I feel
different and I feel extremely depressed
and that is not who I am as a person I
am NOT a depressed person it's just not
who I am and I think you guys know from
watching my channel that that is not who
i am i am for the most part a happy
person i try and be a happy person not
be a happy person you can't just try and
be you don't need to try and be a happy
person but I live my life in an
optimistic and happy way and when I get
sick it's just like down the drain no
like the literal and I just feel so
incredibly horrible and it's not just
physically it's mentally so I just want
to say I apologize for not really being
there and um I will be after this after
I film this video I'm going to get this
out probably later today around five or
six pm but anyway I am going to go and
answer all the comments that I've missed
out on I have a lot of those to answer i
think i have for 450 but i am excited
because i have missed you guys a lot and
again i just feel bad the way that I
approach the situation so I just want to
say I apologize about that um it's hard
for me because I will go from literally
feeling fine one day to the next day not
being able to get off the couch and
that's just so scary and strange so
anyway that's kind of just my little
life update like the goods of our health
is not very good as you guys can
probably tell i am finally feeling
better health is not that great channel
should be doing fine still going to be
posting the same stuff that i'm always
posting and then life update things will
be getting exciting within the next year
to two years and yeah so anyway that's
my little life and channel update i will
be back tomorrow and are still deciding
between doing a review and swatches on
the new little makeup
forever I liner kit or maybe a follow-up
on let me guys let me go let me know you
guys want to see in the comments section
and I will see you guys tomorrow thank
you so much for being so loyal and so
sweet and caring and kind I really
appreciate it and I really do love you
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
