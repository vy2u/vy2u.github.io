to my channel today's video is going to
be a life update I will have a health
update going up for you guys
hopefully sometime soon there's a lot
going on right now I don't know if I've
been have time to film that if you're
curious like I'm filming on my laptop in
my kitchen yes I'm going to try and do
an apartment tour for you guys but it's
probably going to be an empty apartment
tour because Tom and I are already
started to pack everything up and
everything's just coming coming apart
okay we already took apart our couch
we're going to take apart like our
dining room table the beauty room is
already being packed up so definitely
not going to be a beauty room tour in
this apartment again if you would like
to see my original a beauty room tour in
this apartment the first one that I ever
filmed I'll go ahead and throw that up
in the cards for you guys which as you
know that's probably not going to happen
this year in this particular apartment
so when we do move it to Arizona which I
will talk about in a second I will go
ahead and do a beauty room update
revised or like a beauty room tour a new
one so yeah I'm going to try and film an
apartment tour for you guys but I'm not
promising anything at this point
honestly they should have gotten a
little chaotic like the past week
everything's happening so quickly and I
guess that's what we'll talk about first
so I do want to do a health update for
you guys as well in the next coming
weeks like I said there have been a big
change in how I'm going to be following
up with my health and my lupus and my
boyfriend who practices Western medicine
completely disagrees with the approach
that I want to go with and it's been
very difficult because we have been
fighting about that it's like we
normally really don't fight but he has
been very very persistent about me not
doing this but it feels right to me and
it's my body and I believe that I should
be able to do what I want to do what I
feel that is right and I really hope
that when I make that help update video
a lot of you will be sweet and
compassionate and not fry me in
the comments section so anyway let us
know how to jump right into this life
update first of all where the are
Tom and I moving you guys we're moving
to Eric I know I'm literally going to
fry my skin down there I know so many
people are like you're so pale you are
going to die down there in the heat but
I actually think it's going to be better
for my house because I tend to get a lot
of flare-ups when it's very cold and
when wintertime is happening so I think
this will be better for my house but the
summer months are going to be brutal we
do a move in the middle of June which is
in a month and a half the movers are
coming in in about 20 days to actually
move the stuff cause it takes them
apparently takes them 7 to 14 days
actually drive to Arizona
which is ridiculous but condos have a
grand graduation and stuff like that the
second week of June and he will be
working all the way through the second
week of June and then we move down he's
going to fly down I am driving with mr.
badger and my dad we are going ahead and
like you know bringing badger and all
that stuff as for anybody who was
confused or wondering what is going on
are we going to be gaining another
ferret absolutely yes we are I really
want to get a friend for mr. badger I
know a lot of people were saying get a
caster get a dog but I think a badger is
like is the perfect animal for us Tom
and I are so so so busy you know he
doesn't have to be blocked he's litter
box trained he's so frickin good and I
know that yes we may get another animal
that's not as good as that maybe we get
unlucky and get a really aggressive
ferret or something like that but I want
to adopt some sort of ferret or animal
definitely a ferret that it needs a home
someone that you know it wants to give
up their animal or they can't take care
of them anymore I want to be able to do
that and I want mr. badger to have a
companion so we are definitely going to
get a mrs. badger for the mr. badger or
another mr. badger either way it doesn't
matter whatever will fall into our hands
is what we are going to go ahead and
take and yes we are definitely
adopting this time I do not believe in
shopping for your animals I did shop for
mr. badger the reason for that was
because there were no ferrets available
at the shelter's here in Milwaukee which
is great I'm really happy that there
aren't a lot of Ferris running around
that need homes and things like that but
at the same time I do not feel good
about buying him from a pet store at my
family like we've never done that I've
never done that I am all about adopting
so that felt very weird for me I got
very lucky with him he is so sweet he
loved him he loves his life now I like
to think but if you were curious yes we
will be adopting and I shopping and yeah
I'm gonna get another animal so that
kind of takes care of it that situation
right there we don't know when but I'm
guessing probably a couple months after
moving down to Arizona we'll go ahead
and do so so yes Arizona guys Arizona
Arizona Arizona I will not be telling
you what area of your rizona we are
going to be living in because she called
me on snapchat you would know that I did
have some people to actually showed up
at Tom's place of work which is
completely inappropriate that's
our society that sounds really bitchy
but like I have said over and over and
over again Tom wants to remain anonymous
I don't see what the big deal is
I don't see why people are so freaking
in
activated or have to go and actually
like look him up and do stuff like that
you have to understand he's not in the
same kind of work environment that I am
you know I'm artsy fartsy I teach kids I
do all those kind of stuff I'm allowed
to share on the internet here not okay
he's a doctor he's very reserved be very
conservative and it really really breaks
my heart that someone went so far to
actually show up at a place of work and
if you're watching this please never
 do that ever again I'm sorry
that's not so bitchy but you know when
someone asks you to please respect their
privacy I expect you to please respect
their privacy please respect our privacy
so unfortunately I'm not going to be
able to tell you guys what city we're
going to be in because they found this
place of work which is absolutely insane
so that kind of ruins it for everybody
because I'm a very open person and I
would have been able to share that with
you guys I love taking pictures from our
apartment I love talking about my life
all that kind of stuff and it just kind
of breaks my heart that one person room
that for everyone but yes we are moving
to Arizona and we are very very excited
basically what happened was Tom started
to go ahead and apply for all of his
fellowships he currently a resident
which I have told you guys before he
started playing for his fellowships and
he only turned down by one place which
he didn't want me to tell you guys I was
very proud of them so I'm telling you
anyway I'm he applied in Florida he
applied in Louisiana California
everywhere you know everywhere and he
got into all the places except one and I
was so proud of him and he ended up
choosing Cleveland there's a wonderful
wonderful hospital in Cleveland and they
wanted him and he was like that's where
we're going to go sometime I pack up our
bags we went to Cleveland for a whole
 weekend and we found like an
apartment we found all this kind of
stuff we were like okay we're moving to
Cleveland like this is it it was really
funny because um you know Tom had the
opportunity to go ahead and sign like
the paperwork and the actual job
opportunity unifies know what I'm
talking about the contract he had an
opportunity to go ahead and sign that
when he was there and he chose not to
and I found that kind of weird I said
what does like why why won't you sign
the contract you know they were really
pushing for him to go ahead and do that
and you haven't done it yet and he just
said something just feels weird and the
thing is is that the place that had
turned Tom down the reason why we
thought that they had turned him down
was because they never got back and they
never got back to him he went and he
took this interview and
ever happen we thought that they just
were you know chose someone else well we
get back from Cleveland after putting
like a $500 deposit down on this
apartment you know even though we had a
hard time finding an apartment in
Cleveland that we were very interested
in we still could have seen ourselves
living there you know Cleveland Ohio is
very very similar to Milwaukee where we
live right now we live in Milwaukee
Wisconsin and it's so similar it seemed
literally like sister kind of cities you
know I was like we're not going to have
any issues living here so basically you
know oh we are do we get back after
building this like not as easy down data
but you know to me we put it down like
this this $500 deposit on this apartment
he gets the call from this place that
turned him down and they're like hey so
we want you and they're in Arizona and I
was like I'm sorry why it's like it's
just so hard you know this kind of thing
has happened to me too with auditions
before where they don't get back to you
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
they don't want you they just haven't
made up their mind yet and this was like
the latest ever because some of these
like places Thomas started hearing from
like back in January know and they had
waited this long and we were thinking
that maybe he was like second on the
waiting list or this or that but it's
like a fantastic fantastic Hospital down
in Arizona so they called him and they
were like we want you and Tom was like
holy you know it's just one of
those things when a better opportunity
comes up when it's a better hospital
when better things
come along you take it and he was like
we're moving Arizona I have promised how
many years ago like when we first
started dating we've been dating for
about three and a half years now I had
promised him that I would go ahead and
go with him as his a journey of like the
medical studies and all that kind of
stuff grows ago so you could say if you
do date someone in the medical field you
know that it is a never-ending process
and they are bounced around from
different hospitals different states and
I am I feel strong enough with my
abilities as a musician to be able to
pick up gigs and to be able to pick up
work anywhere that I live so I made this
promise to Tom a long time ago that I
would go where he wanted to go I never
feel like I'm following him I never feel
like I'm being like the weak one in the
relationship I mean like okay I'll just
follow you around like a little dog it's
never been like that I've always worked
and very proud of what I do and you know
nothing to get if anybody does just want
to go with their boyfriend and if they
aren't working or things like that
nothing about
I just wanted to let you guys know I've
always consistently worked anywhere that
I've been the Oh Mattel wasn't working
with when I was in college I'm going to
conservatory but you know tom has been
jumping around different places which is
what you do in the medical fields and I
have been I guess following him and I
knew from the Sun so bad following him
but that is kind of what you do you make
this promise to your significant other
and you say okay you know I will do that
with you I will be there to support you
and so basically I told Tom that I would
do this and we are heading down to
Arizona you guys so I am so
excited um now let's go ahead and get
into what's going on with me and my job
so when we had gotten the thing in
Cleveland I sent my resume to five
different schools they have a fantastic
conservatory there and I really wanted
to teach there and there were just like
I sent my resume to all these schools
all this kind of stuff even to ask you
like public schools private schools all
that stuff and basically they wanted to
interview every single place wanted to
interview with me which I felt really
good about I was like oh my god that's
great and then of course we get back in
a week later we hear that we're going to
Arizona and I was like oh god oh my god
you know is it so so last-minute I
didn't have anything prepared I don't
know what kind of schools are down there
I don't know what kind of work is down
there and I got a little nervous now
probably about four months ago I was
approached by a flutes company that
wanted to sign me and basically become
kind of like a solo artist with their
brand now I I am so torn on this they
are based out of LA and obviously now
that we're going to be in Arizona this
would be the perfect opportunity but
this would mean a not a lot a lot of
work like concerts every single weekend
and right now with my health and
everything that's happening I I didn't
really know what to say to this job
opportunity I still have until June to
decide on a most of the jobs that I'm
looking at currently
but this pays like so good like so good
and I'd hate to be that kind of person
that's like it's all about money because
it's really not it life is not
about money it's about what you enjoy
doing how you feel about your life
are you happy it's not about hey
money money money you know everybody's
obsessed with money and of course Tom
Tom kind of obsessed with money and he
was oh my god to take that job that
sounds great
but I kind of had to look at it from a
different way and say you know what I
still be happy going and teaching at a
private school which by the way
I'd say to find another job down in
Arizona that is more of like a teaching
job similar to what I have right now
it's taught at a private school same
sort of pay maybe just a little less and
what I'm getting paid here right now but
still I have a you know I'm very well
covered financially and I don't mean
that in a variety kind of way I just
saying it how it is I don't teach at
public school I'm just a private
conservatory kind of stuff and it is for
younger kids and older amateur musician
so it's very good pay but it was just
one of those things where I stuck at
this crossroads of deciding do I want to
perform perform perform because my my
degree has been performance flutes
performance not flute teaching flute
performance that's what I have my
password means again and it's very hard
for me right now to decide do I want to
go ahead and do this soloistic thing for
a year or two years when I go and I make
an album and I do all this kind of stuff
and I promote myself but I work my
 ass off I mean I am going to be
so busy this coming year if I do that do
I want to do that or do I want to do
what I'm still doing right now which I'm
still very busy I'll have my private
studio through my home I do gigs on the
side and then I do teach full-time this
is what I would be doing next year and I
yeah I kind of wanted to update you guys
on that because I have not decided yet I
literally have not decided what I want
to do I am a hundred percent unsure on
if I want to do the soloistic thing and
do more performing aspects or if I want
to continue teaching doing gigs where I
still perform and then also having a
private studio it will take a little
while to actually build up the private
studio and have the amount of students
that I want to but you know I charge 100
an hour I make good money literally just
teaching from home as well but I will
never just like do be you know I've
talked about it before I'm never just
going to do YouTube full-time that's not
anything that I'm interested in but you
know I could teach at home and then also
do the teaching through the private
school that I told you guys about down
in Ithaca we went down in Arizona and
then I could also do the gigs on the
side which is what I'm doing right now
making good money with that or do I take
the soloistic adventure do something
completely different make it double the
money but also be exhausted I'm
already exhausted with what I'm doing
and now and I work a lot you guys I know
some people were curious as to how often
I work on
I'm I'm doing that nine-to-five saying
you know I'm doing that on top of gigs
on top of having a private studio at
home and very very busy so I just kind
of F at a crossroads right now and I
thought it was a good idea for me to
maybe make this video as well I kind of
asked you guys what you think I should
do it I know I'm so silly but I feel
like you guys do know me you know you
know me and I want to know what you guys
think do you think that I should take
the soloistic opportunity do you think
that I should continue doing what I'm
doing which I'm very very happy with
it's just a very very interesting
situation because I have thought and
thought and thought and both of them
would make me absolutely the happiest
person in the world and I don't know
what to do is though I've talked to a
lot of people Tom thinks I should do the
soloistic saying that my parents think I
should do the foulest you think well my
mom thinks I could should continue to
teach my dad thinks I should do the
soloist they saying I would love to
share what you guys have to think but
yeah just so you know covered work-wise
no matter what tom has a new job that
he's super super excited about
everything is all good the only thing
that I'm stressed about right now is
just getting this whole
apartment together getting it packed up
within a month and a half and then
moving so yeah that's pretty much it for
the life update like I said I will go
ahead and do a help update for you guys
soon and please please have an open mind
when I tell you what I want to do with
my house because it's going to be more
of a homeopathic natural approach and I
know not everybody is instead especially
my doctor who practices Western medicine
is not into that but it's not his choice
if my body it's my health and I truly
believe that I should be able to do what
I want to do so anyway that is pretty
much it for the life update you guys I'm
moving to Arizona in about a month and a
half I'm very very excited like so
excited I know it's going to be
completely different climate and all
that kind of stuff become and I love to
travel I have lived in let's see here
Minneapolis now I have lived in
Manhattan I have lived in Milwaukee I
lived in basically four different places
or three different places and I'm going
to be 25 soon and I want to live in all
sorts of different places all sorts of
different climates and Tom has lived in
I think five different places now so
we're really happy moving around it's
just stressful it's stressful movie we
all know that but yeah that's pretty
much it so that is it for my life update
thanks for listening to me kind of
ramble around I know that I have been
wanting to meet this video for you guys
for quite a summer time now but that is
what is going on everything is all good
like literally I don't think anything
could be better in life right now it's
just
a matter of getting the apartment you
know all boxed up and everything back
together and then also you know getting
my house under control so I want to know
what you guys think down below
definitely let me know kind of you know
give me your insight I want you think I
should do next year as far as job stuff
is concerned I love you guys and I trust
you and I I feel like a lot of you know
me very well and what do you think I
should be do you think I should continue
with what I'm doing right now or should
I jump out of my comfort zone and do
something completely different if you're
curious about what's going to be
happening with my youtube channel same
posting schedule I know you have
something scheduled I'll be posting the
same I'll be doing the same kind of
videos it's not going to be anything
different this is just more of like a
life update so anyway that is it thanks
