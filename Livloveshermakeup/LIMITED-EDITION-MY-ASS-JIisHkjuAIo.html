my channel today we're going to be
talking about a limited edition my ass
limited is mine I am feeling very spunky
and very ADHD today so I hope that you
are prepared for these medium okay
anyway today we're going to be talking
about a limited edition of products in
the makeup and beauty community I do
personally feel as if this term is
thrown around retool loosely
every single brand has a limited edition
limited edition limited edition and you
know what ends up happening that product
usually comes back and it comes back and
everybody says because you told us it
wasn't good to come back now I want to
see really quickly I want to assure you
guys I understand both sides of limited
edition let me tell you right now if you
kept on the immediate local pilot came
back I'd be on that into above me second
okay I really really regret not
purchasing at that palette so I
understand wanting and liking the fact
that sometimes they do bring items back
what I don't like is when I stay up
until three eight in the money
okay trying to get a pallet then we'll
just come back in three months and guess
what is permanent now are def what its
back it's a little bit in addition to
that okay back to the day Wow
whoa okay yeah yeah no no no I feel like
these brands are just bending over and
bucking at okay that is literally how I
feel it is I just think it's absolutely
horrible if you are going to release
something and you know it's going to do
well or if you have a gut feeling like
the freaking sweet peach collection just
make it permanent okay so like I said I
agree and I understand each side of the
story I'm not taking a particular side
here I just want to be able to come on
here and vent about limited edition
because it's pissing me off and I
noticing some of you guys off so let's
go ahead and talk about six or seven
products here that are kind of the
bigger ones that were listed as a
limited edition they came back and we're
limited edition again or they were
limited edition and came back and now
they're permanent the first one is the
charge rate force of the CI photo pellet
not only volume one not only volume to
volume three as well so the
first one is only one was a limited
edition for nine to ten months that we
have volume 2 which was a limited
edition or listed as a limited edition
for 4 to 5 months
Mulligan 3 which is currently listed as
limited-edition on me sephora.com
website
 you tarts this is not limited
edition is this clearly permanent why
don't you just say that when you just
say that all right next we have the cap
on via metal Matt palace so I love this
palette this is something I would
definitely recommend to you guys and I
just absolutely loved this palette and I
felt like it should have been made
permanent with honestly one thing as
eyeshadow pellet she's ever released so
and this is just the sad part about two
weeks ago it came back and it was up for
two minutes just on the sephora.com
website now I don't know if this was it
Kat Von D thing or is this was a Sephora
thing and they just so happen to by
Marsha it in the back you know
don't bring it back if everybody can't
get their hands on it does that make
sense and I know that limited edition is
not permanent but that is so
unfair to bring it back and it's gone in
two minutes they didn't tell anybody
they were very shady about it nobody
could prepare themselves it just popped
out of nowhere and they were like mental
note and then it was gone I think that
is incredibly shady I don't know what
that was on cap on these parts or
sephora's parts but I did not like that
and I just thought that was really sad
it should have just been a permanent
pellet alright next we have the lorac
mega pro 3 so the rock recently wrote on
their Instagram guys we've listened to
what you said about everything and we're
bringing you back you've
probably just found some more Palace in
the back they said a small quantity is
available there should not just
be a small quantity of elbow okay
you should just bring back a big stomach
event like I don't understand this is
the thing if there's still some left
why were those put in these first little
shipment of pallets going out so that
more people could get them when they
actually work on a limited edition
I'm so confused if I'm like what is
going on I just don't understand and I
have to say something right now those
the rock mega pros are fantastic
they should be permanent those pallets
do so well they should be permanent the
first one sold out in 8 minutes I never
got my hands on that I would have loved
if they would bring that back but only
if its permanent good know what I mean
it's just absolutely unnecessary all
right next we have the chart artists
blush palette this one it's a special
special little snowflake here so firm it
started with limited edition it's a
limited edition guys oh my god
I reviewed on my channel I'm like this
limited-edition and then it was made
permanent for two weeks two
weeks and then it went back to
limited-edition how though how unless
that was actually an accident on the
website where it said permanent I do not
understand liked ArtPrize went to get
your together
that is so beyond up to get
people all excited about something like
that and I'd be like oh wait it's
actually limited edition we couldn't
find enough pilots in the back so two
limited edition now you
so cuter I feel like I say that a lot
but lucky I'm still lucky yeah alrighty
next we have some better products so the
Jaclyn heal champagne pop shimmering
skin perfecter you can remember with
this little bit in addition what two
years ago anybody else remember I
remember this simmering skin Perfector
press being a limited edition I swear I
swear it is now a permanent I Tom which
congratulations that is awesome for
Jacqueline now I'm very very happy for
her but I don't understand why so listed
as one minted edition why wasn't listed
with a tradition and then it became
permanent probably because it did so
well that's great but now let's go ahead
and talk about her special little
champagne collection that she released
because that's the products in there
we're really good half the products were
really not good and guess what some of
them came back as well the other day
happens on QVC and I saw the
Becca jacqueline Hills book pants I
couldn't tell the difference between
that and the new chart ones because they
took less time to each other but that
was it those are the Becca slim pants
those were really awesome from the
collection but why are they back why are
they back I also have to add in and that
is drum a channel here but it seems like
Jacqueline Hale as well as Becca have
had a little bit of a falling out so why
bring back some of her champagne
collection stuff it just seems kind of
odd to me very very odd to me and
finally we're going to talk about the
two-faced sweet peach collection I
waited up for the eyeshadow palette
until 6 a.m. I had to work the next day
at 7 so I just I just stayed up
all night for that did get my hands on
it which was awesome tons of people were
left without the sweet peach palette to
the original eyeshadow palette I didn't
even like it that much when I got it
ended up decluttering it color scheme
wasn't really for me that's fine come
forward a year later they start to do
with milk sketches and they're like okay
here we have the whole sweet peach
collection we need in line for that for
about three and a half hours
there was enough for everyone and then
they made everything permanent
could have told us that before we got 9
so you know what I mean this is so
 silly like you're really really
making something limited-edition then
you're going to make it permanent I feel
like two things know by now that their
little stinky smelly palates do so
 will just make them permanent
people seem to buy your no matter
what two-faced okay seriously anything
that have to do with a chocolate palette
I didn't have to do with peaches and
cream peaches everything's going
to sell out so just make it permanent
it's stupid I won't be buying anything
from the sweet peaches and cream or
peaches and cream collection I'm
actually going to do a roast video on
them mmm
I'm going to roast them yeah yeah that
is pretty much if that is all I really
want to talk about in this video you're
done being a little bit of a shade queen
but at the same time I feel like this is
something that should be discussed and
this is me venting to you guys I really
get frustrated when stuff like this
happens because I feel like that term
limited edition is just used way too
loosely I get irritated I know you guys
get urinated let me know your thoughts
down below let me know you would like to
add any of these products into the list
down below let me know if you have found
limited edition items that became
permanent or a limited edition that came
back from the dead and there was a
limited edition limited edition again
for 250 minutes so that was it for
today's video thanks so much for joining
me guys and I'll see you smile bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
