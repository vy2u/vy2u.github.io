time because this is annoying um let me
see here I have to find the chat now so
hold on one second
okay all right let me see if this is
working sorry
I am literally the worst at live
streaming the worst of doing this
of bunk Anatomy okay anyway hi guys so
today I have a little announcement about
the channel and also I have some cheeses
and some Chips Ahoy because I just got
home from work I go home girls
hungry and I thought I would also go
ahead and share with you guys my empties
I have a queued up and empties here so I
want to do this is a first of all hi
guys I see you all on the chat so what I
want to do is just talk about quickly
what I want to talk about I'm not gonna
look at the chat and by the way Samantha
March is here and she is the one who is
patrolling and reviewing the video and
all that kind of stuff so say hi to Sam
because she's moderating but I'm gonna
look away from the chat for a minute and
just kind of talk to you guys one-on-one
about what is going on with the channel
and what's going on with me because I've
been having a hard time posting in the
past couple of weeks and a lot of it
just has to do with boredom and
I always kind of knew this day would
come with this channel and I'm not
saying I'm leaving okay I'm not going
anywhere I'm not leaving just yet but I
want to switch up some content on this
channel and those the changes are going
to be happening immediately this week
okay so I'm going to take a look away
from the little chat right here and I
will get back to you guys in a second
but let me explain exactly what's going
on so a month ago I started feeling
really really bored and stale
with the beauty community just really
bored I feel like a lot of people post
the same sort of things and at one point
I feel like there was a lot of unique
content going around and a lot of unique
content that was being surfaced and I
was so into it I was feeling you
know but you know every creator has
their
we all have our 15 minutes of fame we
all have that small amount of time what
where we all come up with unique content
and then there's a new audience and
there's a new youtuber you know crew
that comes in and you know you have to
know that about YouTube if you're gonna
come on YouTube you have to know at some
point you're gonna get stale and I'm not
saying that I'm stale and I don't feel
stale I don't feel like my content is
steel I know that a lot of you guys
still really really enjoy my content but
I personally feel like there could be
more and I'm just bored I'm really
really bored and I see these girls that
post you know once a week and they say
it's so hard and I'm having such a hard
time and I'm struggling I'm over here
like posted five times a week working
full-time I'm doing just fine and again
everybody is different so it's not about
comparing and it's not about saying I'm
better than this person or you're not as
good as this person it's not about that
link it's not like that we're all
different but at the end of the day it
just kind of comes down to what do you
feel good with posting and right now I'm
not feeling 100% about what I'm posting
and the kind of content that I've really
gotten into has been more controversial
content and if I'm gonna be completely
honest it is my favorite content to film
for you guys it is my favorite content
to film for you guys it makes me happy I
like doing it however there are certain
Beauty things that I feel like have got
very stale like hauls you know reviews
things I'm just no longer as interested
in posting right now so I have decided
to go ahead and post five beauty videos
a week which still live a lot and I even
said this the other day a few people had
said you know I'm not gonna be watching
your channel anymore I'm not interested
like five beauty videos is not enough
and girl it's not enough for you
and that is totally not enough for you
and I don't mind I'm giving you full
permission to go ahead and unsubscribe
because this channel had Elly's always
been about hobby it has never once been
about money been about saying but about
I want to be the biggest youtuber out
there no have never ever been like that
and if you have been on my channel for
the past two and a half years when I
started give up and know that okay so I
am going to
beauty videos a week and then I'm going
to have to and I'm at beauty videos a
week one of them is going to be called
miscellaneous Monday and that's going to
do where I talk about whatever the
I want to talk about if I wanted to a
cooking video it's going up if I want to
talk about my bisexuality it's going up
I'm gonna talk about polyamorous
relationships I'm going to talk about a
whole lot of that and it's gonna give
you guys a better glimpse into my life
and who I am as a person and I think
that's something that's lacking and
something that's really really missing
when it comes to my videos is I don't
know what goes on behind the camera and
I've never been the kind of person that
straight-up wants to vlog my life
because my boyfriend my family a lot of
my friends do not want to be on camera
I'm amazed that I'm going to get to of
Tom's best friends from med school on
camera this week Jen and Monica had
volunteered as tribute to come on the
channel I'm amazed because none of my
friends have interesting doing that and
I told me a hundred percent understand
so I'm really really excited because I
think miscellaneous Monday is going to
give you both a different feel for
different kind of content and again
they're still gonna be five
beauty videos a week and I'm not trying
to say you have to stay subscribed
because it's five beauty videos a week
do whatever your heart desires if it's
gonna piss you off then on Mondays
there's not going to be beauty related
content on this channel I'm giving you a
like I said 100% full permission go
ahead and unsubscribe because I always
did kind of promise you guys that it
would be Beauty content but I've changed
my mind I'm just not happy and I know a
lot of people have been asking about
what happened with the other channels so
the other channels first of all the
midweek I'm sorry the mystery Channel
did get completely monetized which I
kind of thought was because
there were all these small channels and
there's a lot of going on right now
with YouTube monetization rules that are
not getting monetized yet because I
attached you to my main channel which
has over 70,000 subscribers and they
monetize that within like a week which I
kind of thought was in the
first place so and the History Channel
is up and running the music channel
again I was feeling really good about
the two of those channels I wanted to
have separate content in separate places
but I've changed my mind that I find a
little overwhelming having three
different channels checking three
different channels I can't do it with
the work I'm doing right now with
teaching with doing gigs with doing you
know working in 9 to 5 I don't
the time to check three different
channels however I definitely have
enough time to check one so yes all the
content is going to be on this channel
let me tell you about the other video
that I will be filming which will be on
Wednesdays it's gonna be called midweek
mysteries so if you guys were really a
really into my History Channel it's
coming to this channel that will be
about true crime that will be about
social phenomenon series you know things
like that so I think you guys would
really really enjoy that if you like the
mystery channel but yeah I think I have
to get that out myself 0v jump in so let
me go ahead and take a look at the chat
here so you're not gonna do Beauty at
all that's not what I said people don't
understand I'm going to be doing five
beauty videos a week and two non Beauty
videos a week okay so let me just make
that very clear here someone said that's
a crap time yeah like a week is still a
crap-ton to you but some people don't
feel that way that's fine
someone said who would unsubscribe from
live I love her regardless you're so
cute thank you I'm a damn I wanted the
mystery one you're gonna get it we're
gonna do midweek mysteries so that will
be every single Wednesday as someone
said that's weird
I mean girl I don't know it's fine it's
died
alright here I would never subscribe
unsubscribe ever it is about you and not
the beauty videos that is so sweet I
love that you guys come to watch me come
to watch my personality so like I said
and miscellaneous Monday's gonna be a
little more about me um and then midweek
mysteries will be around to crime to
crime trend videos and things like that
every other video it's going to be
beauty related and yeah there's gonna be
a lot of ranting because I'm really into
both videos there's anything that I have
discovered from being on this channel
the past year and completely beed myself
if you guys go back and watch some of my
earlier videos it's like a
cringefest it is so bad it's so bad I
was uncomfortable with myself I was so
unhappy with the content I was filming
in this past year I have absolutely
loved what I have been filming so I am
incredibly excited so hello to everybody
I'm Erin says my Deeley watch is always
included live Samantha March and Jen
loves reviews well I love those girls
you guys know that life is a blessing
thank you for helping keeping the
real Thank You Debra do you appreciate
that all right let's see here someone
says live but would you watch you I
would watch you bake cupcakes you know
we could do that with the basement
cupcakes like I love cupcakes
someone said I love watching your videos
while I'm doing my nighttime skincare
routine it's funny a lot of people
usually tell me that they prefer
watching in the morning because of my
energy level you know I'm not really
that calm but that's cool I mean I
usually do post at nighttime so I
usually film in the morning I get a lot
of questions about that
so I film in the morning and then later
in the day is when I like toast my
personal favorite let's see what did
someone say did you say bisexual and
poly relationships I sure did
so we're gonna be talking about that the
first miscellaneous Monday is going to
be the bisexuality Q&amp;amp;A I actually asked
you guys on Instagram
a while back probably about a week ago
what you guys had as far as questions
were concerned before at the bisexuality
Q&amp;amp;A so that's gonna be interesting and
then yeah if you want me to talk about
the polyamorous relationship girl I will
do it because I think that's really
interesting there's not a lot of people
out there that have been in full-on 3r8
of relationships I've been in a
relationship with two men at once I've
been in a relationship with two women at
once and I thought we could talk about
it a little bit where do you get your
energy my THC girl my ADHD when is
polyamorous scheduled so I haven't
scheduled it yet but I'm thinking if I
do this Monday is going to be all about
the what is it the bisexuality Q&amp;amp;A I
think it'd be smart to do the
polyamorous relationship videos a week
after what do you guys think of that I
think that would be good I'm excited for
it I can't wait to watch the video Thank
You Alexandria you guys are so sweet hi
Lucia oh my god you guys if you have not
seen this girl Lucy at upper beauty
 go watch her too yeah oh good
she's so good she's like 18 years old
totally on top of the YouTube game I
love it go watch her videos wonderful
wow that's so interesting that you've
done that I would love to hear about
that yes so the polyamorous relationship
thing I think that will be an
interesting video that will definitely
be an interesting video so anyway let me
scroll down a little more um whatever
you want
girl just please don't stop yeah I'm not
stopping you guys when I want to stop
you'll know we could not stop again this
video has never been about anything
other than like two hockey words to be
completely honest it's really just I
want to be on here so I'm gonna be on
here the second I don't want to be on
here anymore I'm not gonna be on I've
always told you guys that
so the mr. t you watch your videos those
guys don't know what my boyfriend I
called him mr. t his name is Tom Thomas
not actually watching my videos but he
knows all about the bisexuality the
polyamorous relationships all that kind
of stuff so you know he doesn't really
meet you know everything about there
sometimes I can't stop you're so pretty
like a little fairy oh girl after
working as long a shift today I have
been at work since 9:00 No
6 a.m. I am should I wish I feel so
puffy and just tired overall but sugar
either not smoking so anyway I think we
should probably jump into some empties
now what do you guys think or do you
have any questions wave away before
because you know great heroes oh man all
we saw anything for do you guys have any
questions about the new content please
let me know how do you stay so positive
and energetic like I said probably my
ADHD girls would you start pre-filming
you'll accommodate all of this new
content well because I already do
technically film every single day and I
usually post five to seven videos a day
I don't really feel the need to pre film
because like I said originally when I
was thinking about this idea I was
thinking you know you have to make sure
that you're posting Beauty content when
you're posting other or not maybe
related content but I'm just not going
to do that there's going to be five
beauty videos a week and then to an on a
beauty related videos that's just what I
want to do that's what feels good and
that's what's gonna happen and that's
gonna be fine but to accommodate it I
have kind of gotten into free film I was
never a pre filmin girl I just don't I
lack the attention span for that so I
was never really that into pre filming
but I'm thinking that yes I'll do a
little pre filming here in there I think
it'd be smart especially for the mystery
ones because those are big big videos um
we used to have Ferriss they are enjoy I
know the ferrets
right now you guys I wish they were out
but again this lady is Monday I have to
do a video regarding ferrets because I
get so many questions about badgering
Khaleesi they're like what the hell are
those one is up with a little bad dress
all right yes empties and I just got
diagnosed with ADHD and I'm scared for
starting meds of a seen you flourish I'm
feeling calmer girl the meds work they
really do work it's unfortunate because
a lot of these are light so if you do
have real ADHD an upper is actually
going to calm you down so something that
has like amphetamine in it like adderall
is actually going to calm you down
overall I think the side effects are
kind of shitty but I've been on you know
adderall since I was 7 years old you
guys I've been taken the same medication
for years and years and years and it's
been very helpful for me I cannot focus
I cannot do anything without it to be
completely honest I'm just like crawling
all over the wall like hanging on the
wall like running around like a maniac
Tom's like live thoughts on talkies
product I'm not buying it girl I'm not
buying it I don't give a like but
it's okay I could not understand I mean
I kind of understand I get it she's got
beautiful hair skin and nails the honey
honey we all know that you get Botox we
all know that you get facials that you
get your hair done at like a
great salon you wear extensions like the
majority of it feels like false
advertising to me I hate sound like a
bitch $60 vitamins okay no no thank you
biotin ten dollars exactly exactly
could you do a time management video on
how you accommodate your work in a day I
need help absolutely you guys want me to
do that I can do that maybe I should
call it like managing my time with ADHD
because specifically I need certain
distractions to be able to get my day
done with but yeah alright my reaction I
know no taki no alright so let's go
ahead and get into the emptiest let me
kind of pull this back a little bit by
the way I'm in the Beauty room bathroom
so if you're wondering yes that's a
toilet right next to me this is where I
have all my beauty related staff
let's go ahead and do empties guys so
number one first item I used up
aromatherapy eucalyptus spearmint luxury
bath this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works you
guys know that when I wrote to found the
body works a kind of like only have a
cruelty free then they were like well
we're not really cruelty free and then I
was like shady just so I haven't been
purchasing from them lately but I did
use this up it was beautiful smelled
great I did enjoy it so would not
repurchase that I would not repurchase
the dark green force of the sea deep
dive cleansing gel it is very I'm very
nice for double cleansing so if you're
somebody who goes in with like an oil
and then you want to go in with a
cleanser after this definitely not my
cookie give me a moment
alright yeah
and this definitely will take all that
junk in Mongkok your skin okay it's
gonna take it all off but you guys know
I'm boycotting charts so not going to
repurchase that alright so I did get my
hair done recently as you guys know I
and I look back to my collection found
the Shea Moisture raw shea butter extra
moisture transitioning milk and it is
two years past date that's how long I
wasn't able to do my hair because my
stuff was so up you guys so it
says no sulfates no parabens phthalates
fun sigil ate no paraffin no gluten
propylene glycol mineral oil synthetic
fragrance you guys know what I
mean it's a good brand
I do enjoy their products I believe they
are cruelty free but I don't think I
would repurchase this it says with seek
help and argan oil to help strengthen
and grow in the hair it is color safe
which is great I'm going to be coloring
my hair as you guys know yes for dry
damaged hair
unfortunately completely went bad this
is why it's not good to have a huge
 collection sometimes okay people
comment all the time on my videos like
oh I wish my collection was as big as
you are as honey and you get through all
this ngratulations is our talk at
all right Oh gix renewing argan oil of
Morocco shampoo I actually like this a
lot but I know that oh gee ex has had
some issue do it that overall being not
so much a shady brand okay because they
claim to have like 99.9% of organic
ingredients and that's why I had to
change their name because they were not
so I'm not quite sure if I would
repurchase that
this is a PR product that was sent to me
like ages ago it's from Davao it's it's
equal lifestyle davao hydro collagen
moisturizing toner it was just so kate
didn't do much for me would not
recognize alright i did you something
kyoto rings this is the crystal essence
what is it a mineral deodorant roll-on
it's chamomile and green tea it is
basically just paraben free it doesn't
have any sort of mineral oil in it and
it doesn't have aluminum in it so I
really need that for it my people like
to compete and my lupus all that kind of
stuff I didn't also used up a comforter
bubble art from lush smells so
good I love lush would absolutely
understand repurchase oh this was so
scary you guys this clear Pore Cleanser
slash mask when you to Jeana I had to
use this stuff because it was sitting in
in the collection and this is a 3.5%
pencil peroxide cleanser I used to use
this as a mask as well as a facial
cleanser when my acne was horrendous
when I was like a college and things
like that this is not from college okay
it's not from college I've had this for
a while but I put it on my skin my dry
skin oh my god I'm crying to the shower
it was crying in the shower okay it
burned like a mother that is
going bye-bye I did gonna shock the
Elizabeth in jeans Nirvana bourbon a
perfume a beautiful bottle smells
orgasmic sometimes I don't wear it to
work because just kind of smell like I
just had like you know I don't
wear it too often but they are vegan
they are 23 so if you want any sort of
fragrances from Elizabeth and James
would recommend nirvana weight and
Nirvana black as well as this one nd
rose one alright let's continue on I
balázs bath balm here and this one's the
V networks is that fun and Samantha sent
this to me thanks girls so this smelled
amazing it's really really nice if you
like a spicy sexy sort of bath
experience you're gonna love this so I
would definitely repurchase that with my
own money
alright I did use up some settings
phrase I kiss was the month of
setting sprays it got wet wild
photo focus absolutely amazing Milani
and make it last settings right also
amazing but I feel like there's
absolutely no product in the two of
these and I don't like that I does
though like
I use a lot of sites if you've ever seen
you set my fav like home real sets or
face alright I did use up in the
ordinary is a hundred percent organic
cold-pressed rosehip seed oil by the way
I probably would repurchase these but if
you know of anything that kind of
performs the same way but you get a lot
more product in it please let me know
but it's not as expensive like I'm not
something from the drugstore because I
use it up quickly I'm asking for a lot
but I will be checking the comments and
you guys stop man
alright organic cold-pressed rose hip
seed oil great beautiful from the
ordinary so many good products
from the ordinary would repurchase 9% I
did use up a foot cream it is from bliss
it is the Emily peppermint foot patrol
AJ slowly adding and stopped making
folks often eating yeah girl softening
it softening cream it was really good
it's not like tea tree oil and paper so
if you like that years ago alright here
is the 100% cured blood orange cleansing
balm so and this is one of those
products I do not like it first at all
okay it leaves an oily residue on the
skin and when they first sent this to me
for PR by the way this was sent for PR
so when they first sent it to me for PR
I'm my only skin I was like no however
now now that I do have it and I do have
dry skin I love it and I probably would
purchase a full-size it kind of smells
like an orange creamsicle goes a long
way and they do enjoy so yeah there's a
product I've changed my mind about
alright my mom said to me this I told
you guys I returned one of these and my
mom sent me one and I just have to let
it go I can't use this okay this is the
bare minerals oil obsessed total
cleansing oil it's got something in
there that really irritates my skin a
whole lot of fragrance I mean like a
whole lot of Records
yeah it almost smells like a spa like
not a cute spot like a dirty a spa you
know like mineral oil
obsessed total cleansing oil you know
what I can do with this why don't I just
use it for swatches I can use it for
swatches it makes my hands a little red
but I can use it for something okay
we're gonna put that to the side let's
not be wasteful let's use that huh umm
here's the old movie yeah this is the
Budapest queen of Hungary mess
such a waste of money full size of this
is 130 dollars on the sephora.com
website now thank you girl no thank you
I'm so no I would not purchase a
full-size I much prefer my Mario Badescu
um cleansing facial sprays you know I
haven't tried the new one the lavender
one lavender can sometimes be a little
irritating on my skin personally but let
me know if you tried it out tree hives
beer moisturizing shave oil one of the
best shading oils I've ever tried as
well as their scrubs are
fantastic you can usually get them by
one and get two free or buy one get one
50% off at Ulta would HIGHLY highly
recommend at the tree much Shaitan
scrubs of course in essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder like hello
this is an empties video girl this is an
empties video all right so there is my
essence by obviously will be purchasing
you guys know I love that and finally oh
we have a knee nip plus fab a glycolic
fix overnight purifying shell I love
this this is so similar to the drunk
elephant a glycolic acid treatment so if
you want something a for a similar price
you know I'm still waiting to hear back
on their cruelty free status I'll keep
you guys updated updated but really
really good and I love the scrub as well
so anyway those are empty you guys big
all right let me see $130 what the
I know not okay nobody's okay yeah okay
nobody is okay with that thank you let
yourself live I love your attitude never
change thank you I will not I'm trying
to I'm having a lot of hair follow-up
from Lucas at the moment any suggestions
castor oil and as well as cactus oil now
a lot of you have been telling me you
can't find cactus oil I don't know if
it's justice I'm in the desert
like in straight-up Arizona or what but
I find cactus oil from Whole Foods I use
the 365 brand so that is what I would
recommend to you guys why don't use the
bareMinerals cleanser for cleaning your
beauty fund I use a makeup remover and
it works great might might be handy for
that is a very smart idea the only thing
I worry about is this is a cleansing oil
don't you think that would kind of like
wait on my sponge a little bit I could
try it though I'll look into it I will
try it on the lid see here
we scroll up a little bit Oh Katie I
love Katie Marie made it thanks for the
reminder Sam I saw your snap story I
can't he has a great camel definitely go
check her out as well you guys I love to
hear you love the lavender one Melissa
okay I'm gonna have to look because I
feel like it just lavender makes my skin
a little irritated funny enough with the
chart um deep dive Clements cleansing
gel I have three more of these to use up
this sometimes does irritate my skin in
fact the whole entire rainforest of the
sea collection sometimes irritates my
skin because of the lavender oil so kind
of interesting let me scroll up just a
little further make sure I answered some
comments here it takes a while to get
used to being on live you know like so
you have to scroll up and read through
different comments that are just
constantly reading you what's at the
bottom I'm learning I'm learning all
right let's see here I don't like
fragrance and skincare I know it's not
good for you I love personally for me I
love it because it smells good and it
gives it's uplifting using it in the
morning especially something smells like
citrus but at the end of the day is it
good for your skin no probably not
that's why I've really gotten into the
not so um scented skincare lately for
sure alright let me scroll down flower
beauty scent spray girl from Elizabeth
Garland okay I will look into that
I do have it the I saw someone else talk
about the over 113 dollars I got that
scent for PR it's so good but it was
like this big I could definitely
put a little bit into these for travel
or something like that I think that
would be great what is you're going to
face exfoliator currently my go to face
exfoliator is definitely at the lush
ocean salt I've just been loving it I
really get really slice off that top
layer of dead skin and it really just
makes my skin look nice and if we do
have a few pimples it's also really nice
does have some alcohol never seem to be
careful don't leave it on your skin too
long but it's a great physical physical
exfoliant
where you're over 21 my grandpa actually
sent these for me my dress is also from
know this is from JustFab and then it is
little scarf right here at my one of my
coming us from a Juilliard sent to me so
I
really enjoy that smells like vodka does
smell like vodka be left scrubbed holy
smells like vodka coke you're into that
girl yes alright let's see here Melissa
can you live what have you tried from
Germany I tried it there moisturizing
night cream that's not like bubblegum
very drawn to it because it smells like
bubblegum but at the end of the day I
didn't feel like they did much it's a
very simplistic and basic kind of eye
cream I'm sorry face cream so if you're
into that that's something to look into
it's not horrible it's just not great
you got lots of stuff from forever 21 I
love it yeah I've recently stopped
shopping there myself a lot of the
clothes that you see are older because I
really want to be making sure that I'm
shopping cruelty free also when it comes
to you know my lifestyle things as well
because you know having kids work on
your things and you know a little 12
year olds knit your shirts together I
would also say that's not so much
cruelty free so I've been trying my best
not to be shopping in places like
forever 21 and stuff like that I'm your
grandmother the best really really
doesn't get the personal shopper so I'm
pretty sure you went out with the
personal shopper exactly there's no way
and how he bought me some of these
dresses they're way too revealing he
would never do that alright let's see
here did you already talk about the
talking pill my shirt is helping I'm not
getting those don't understand you know
I think especially because she was
building the high but everybody
everybody thought she was a hundred
percent gonna go ahead and be like oh
yeah so I'm releasing some makeup and
some beauty products the pills almost
feel like an MLM you guys know what I
mean kind of like lip sense or something
like that it almost feels like like what
she was talking about oh she's like I
guarantee results I'm like okay I just
felt weird the whole thing felt super
super weird someone said it Nicole said
I just subscribe to Beauty heroes and I
love the skincare box had never heard of
that are they a cruelty free
subscription don't have to look into
that Christine said the vitamins
will have my ass off I know I know
Kimberly said are you going to discuss
world events and thoughts school
shootings from U of a teacher etc Inger
and miscellaneous Monday's I absolutely
could because let me tell you as a
teacher myself I will not be bringing a
gun to school okay I'm not gonna be
caring as a teacher it's not
happening that's just disgusting and I'm
not okay
or a Katy Mary said she had so much hype
going on and then vitamins
okay I know I think we all felt the same
way beauty by Angela hold on let me
scroll up I just lost her in the
comments before you went cruelty-free do
you like L Janice really wasn't l genis
I felt like L Jenna's as well as a few
other of those super high-end skin care
brands never really been never got me
excited especially when I was working at
Sephora - they were never something that
I recommended most people wanted to come
in and try out oh sure they wanted to
come in and they wanted to try out
Clarisonic you know brands like that but
L Genest look really really high up
there
not really alright let's see here I feel
like to hear your views as a teacher
about the special ed system absolutely I
could talk about that as well um my
favorite is watching will you still be
trying the fancy foundation this is
 embarrassing I bought the venti
foundation you guys I don't know we're
way like I straight-up don't know where
when it's going in the Beauty grab my
food Missy for like the past four months

a person I am NOT supportive of Trump I
am NOT conservative in any way shape or
form I I feel like we need a hundred
percent gun control I'm not happy with
what's going on here I'm not trying to
start a big conversation of the comments
here I'm going to be logging off in a
minute but yes I will absolutely do a
dedicated video it's in fact I think
it's very important and I think even if
you're in the beauty community you
should raise your voice and you could
you should speak up about what you need
to speak up about okay all right let's
see here what's your opinion on Tasha's
ueg line like I said if you go back and
watch from the beginning vitamin no eyes

put it

never actually tried it out in my life
