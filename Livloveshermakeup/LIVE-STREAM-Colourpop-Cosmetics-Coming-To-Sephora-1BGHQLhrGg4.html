I'm really behind on Instagram messages
live stream is the best I agree are you
going to do a declutter video soon hell
yeah I want to do foundations everything
I'm from London hello all right yeah
let's talk color copy guys so I have a
few things let me let me pull it up
right here so let's go ahead and talk
about color pop if you guys didn't know
they are going to be sold at Sephora I
believe in the middle of November 2017
and it's going to be like a small
limited edition which other they're
showing a little collection of products
for the holidays I feel like if they do
well then they're really gonna pull
color pop in and they are going to have
them you know be a brand there and I was
so shocked I was so shocked when
I saw that Instagram post um was a trend
mood who like freakin wrote about it
first I saw like Jeffrey star and like
Buddha Beauty getting all salty and
their people were just like I didn't see
it coming
now when I first heard it was color pop
it kind of was like what but now that
I'm kind of like sad with it for a few
days why don't you wear your hair down
anymore I'll just touch on this really
quickly because I get asked all the time
I have lupus and I
have some really really bad thick
scarring and hair loss and bald patches
so this is just how I like to do what my
hair but I promise that once everything
is healed up I will go ahead and wear
down
I plan on cutting it to you at my
shoulders or to my chin so it will be
down all the time but yeah it's just
that makes me comfortable I usually
don't get super uncomfortable but stuff
like that I guess you could say or just
stuff in general but that definitely
does make me feel a little
self-conscious so yeah nothing wrong
with a bun thank you I like my little
ready bein all right Geoffrey star salty
oh he would never right I know he was
all up in there huda beauty so how long
is your hair currently it's about down
at you my boob area so like down here
but before I think it was almost down to
my advice really long you guys can go
back to some of my older videos maybe
one day like I'll do a live sugar just
like take it down I've shown like a few
of my bald patches and stuff but yeah it
makes me self-conscious so I'm sorry I
don't need to you know I don't need to
like you know drag it along and be like
oh I'll get my hair cut one day I'm just
you know yeah we all have those kind of
things that make us a little
self-conscious anyway what was he saying
you guys colour-pop well blah blah blah
something about jeffree star salty salty
low bitch yes that right there um so
yeah they were all commenting and I even
content like what's going on but now
that I start with in I do feel like this
is gonna be a good collaboration you
know I feel like colour-pop is one of
those brands that's kind of instituting
a sort of like morphe but the difference
between a morphe and color pop is that
like morphia if they were to lose their
beauty influencers and like their
affiliate codes and basically not have
an Instagram I feel like nobody would
buy their makeup just sipping on that
team I personally wanna buy their makeup
anyway about I feel like they rely on
social media so
colour-pop when they first started what
about three years ago they were 23 tiny
little indie startup company and they
started to really reach out on social
media and I like that they really kind
of grew on there but I feel like their
products are good enough that like if
they lost their social media it wouldn't
be an issue but yeah so I'm kind of
surprise big shows then but legging now
I'm not as surprised I don't know I'm
kind of digging it I'm kind of digging
it so far is building the competition
with Ulta so a lot of people yeah it's
only the US I do think that if this
collection goes well I believe that they
will release it you know so for
Australia as well as Sephora Canada but
it probably want to test out the waters
first because it's a little
controversial and another thing I want
to touch on is I don't remember I don't
remember
sit back to you girl yeah yeah my shady
ass over here I think having likes put
them on the map I absolutely agree and I
love that but they have really really
you know if you've done so much stuff
and it's gonna be so nice that's the
first thing I want to talk about it's
gonna be so nice to go in store and
swatch that out because I swear I
hate ordering from the colour-pop a
website every time something comes
shattered and I love the little hammer
and note and all that kind of stuff but
at the same time nothing looks the same
on my desktop like when it arrives in
the mail is completely different I feel
like their websites just a little off
with coloring what is big problem I
don't know I have friends who aren't a
big makeup people and don't watch Beauty
youtubers but still know color pop and
bite that's very interesting because I
have friends like musician friends that
were like I don't know what color pop is
but my friend said something interesting
to me she said well if I go into Sephora
and there was a fifteen dollar
highlighter versus a $45 Lancome
highlighter I was like yeah you know
which would you buy and she was like
probably the cheaper one some girls like
to wear makeup some boys like to wear
makeup but it's not something that's
like oh you know they have to go for a
certain brand or oh it has to be you
know amazing luxury products you know
let's see here things always look
different on the screen because screens
are back Lynn you talking about me I'm
let's see earlier people I'm sorry I
probably should have like sat down and
I'm never on my ring light but I just
wanted to do this super super casual i
snapchatted you about the advice arts
dark matte palette did the better
version of the AVH that's good to know
I I'll get back to color pop I
personally did not like the desert or
visor pellets
I got the cool mass and that went back
to Sephora $80 no uh we know it didn't
go back to Sephora you know when I gave
it to her she'll I gave it to her she'll
and she loves it I could not push it to
blend I mean I have a hard time getting
a lot of to blend like this
eyeshadow this glitter actually hurts my
eyeballs right now I'm like ah but yeah
I have a hard time getting a lot of
shadows to blend but specifically the
B's art it was like really hard
so no giant girl crush on Kathleen like
I know right he's so beautiful a lot of
you are recommending her in my last
livestream at which a lot of people were
saying was a little controversial
because I was talking about other
youtubers but you guys are disaster you
know you were asking questions and I was
answering but I yeah I really do like
her she is going to be in my youtubers
not youtubers like trust video youtubers
I recommend as far as like makeup
channels are concerned Michelle is one
lucky gal she sends me a lot of stuff so
yeah I'll take he's not getting polar
thought that is correct so Ulta is uh
there was some sort of customer service
like glitch I feel like someone's
getting fired because they said
something coming soon and no they
actually colour-pop said no we're just
going to Sephora so no Altos looks very
interesting Jake I know I love her she's
also gonna be in that video I really
enjoy her content I mean she's just so
beautiful with the freckles and
everything sure what the are you
doing I had a little respect okay he's
trying to route a little pile of
that I made here so this can no badger
no what are you doing come here oh hold
on
can you not can you not mm-hmm yeah yeah
really good can you not thank you okay
let's see her Natasha - no not Natasha
didn't no no I got so expensive also
commented that it was strange for
colour-pop listen I mean I think we all
were like shocked but I think some
people were just a little salty as well
I purchased the modern renaissance in
July so great quality that's good to
know
I'll to happy away a better customer
rewards system perhaps even source of
worry you guys I love getting 100-point
perks I don't know what is wrong with me
but it's just like my favorite thing
sorry like going into the splits
my legs are hurting you are beautiful
you're simply thank you I should like a
hot bath boy thank you
I agree I'm checking out Andrea M oh oh
hello she's subscribe to me I should
subscribe to her I saw someone had said
um I can't remember what it was but like
when you look at your subscriptions you
can actually list like the most
subscriber like who's following you who
has the most subscribers and I stock
Kimberly Clark and Stephanie Nicole and
I'm Troy Abbot Ileana were following me
and I we go there's expect to be let's
see here does milk make ferrets lose
their minds I don't know he means like
actual breast milk because I have heard
better what are you doing sorry he's
like falling all over the place I have
heard that it can be dangerous if you're
like pregnant and you have a ferret I
don't know why they like the smell of
like breast milk but no he doesn't fit
smells we don't do that I love your look
tonight thank you okay you guys let me
get back to my little my little list
here so number one like I said the pro
of having colour-pop at Sephora
you know the accessibility is gonna be
amazing we can go in store we can swatch
stuff I also really like the Sephora has
taking interest in a smaller branch is
know what I mean because it's not like
they're just thinking I mean I don't
think they're thinking hey we're just
gonna take collar poppin than that same
that's gonna be you know we're we're not
gonna go for any other brands I highly
doubt that's what they're going to be
doing they're gonna be you know pulling
in more affordable brands on my opinion
let's see him the prices in quality
won't change but that doesn't seem
possible because it's the forest sell
stuff oh yeah I didn't see what
Stephanie said I would love her even I'm
obsessed to tell people she isn't
literally my everything I look up to her
but I need to see was she was that on
her what was that on her Instagram
neither should go read that but yeah so
I really do think it's nice that Sephora
has taken the time to appreciate a brand
like color pop and I think they could do
something good here like I said I feel
like color pop has a very strong pull
when it comes to social media and they
have a lot of people that they can send
over to the Sephora comma website you
know I think that would be nice
all right as far as like Hans are
concerned I literally have like a little
list here so I can stay on track the
overall shopping experience like can we
just talk about this is obviously gonna
be a little different uh yeah when you
walk into Sephora I mean sometimes I
walk in there and like I I don't know I
don't look very cute and like people
look at me like I'm in a shoplift or
something I don't like the overall vibe
of some of the employees that work there
just a little judge but when you walk in
there and you have your full face of
makeup on you know you feel
sophisticated Sephora has a
sophisticated sort of vibe going on
there and that's not to say that ultied
uhsome because I feel like Ulta has a
different sort of thing going on I love
that I can go and find high-end you know
products and then turn the corner and be
a physician's formula when I'm you know
shopping at Ulta but there's something
about Sephora that just you know it's
one of those things where you just
always felt very luxurious because
everything looks expensive
everything's high ended luxury there so
it's one of those situations where I
think that some people who really only
purchase high-end and luxury makeup but
they're not gonna like this because can
you guys imagine okay first of all the
colour-pop display like it's obviously
gonna be in that section where you have
like benefit and to face because it's
like a little more childish in my
opinion it's never gonna have a hard
time with the packaging like keeping up
with these other brands because when you
want to like the luxurious kind of side
of that can't speak the luxurious side
of Sephora you can see like hourglass
Sun comin to you or you know you just
feel like I sense a bit you know like oh
I feel like a booty bitch and
everything's very streamlined
everything's beautiful you think about
color pop is that if they do pull in
like their whole collection they have so
much you know what I mean
especially lately they've been pulling
in so much new stuff and I do get
worried when it comes to all those the
limited edition products and all of the
collaborations like I said I don't feel
like they rely on my kind of thing but
they have been they have been releasing
a lot of limited edition stuff now the
one thing I will say that they're good
at is restocking their limited edition
products that's good you know the
support on websites upset restocking and
you know people
get these limited edition products and
then you can't get them so we don't want
that to happen what color pops we're
gonna be good so let's hope it that
Sephora can pull through with this line
I feel like the ferret testers are fear
the fear of plus if ferret testers I
cannot read I feel like the testers are
going to dry out quick
yes so it's gonna be like that cream
formula I do feel as if I you know like
- packaging - lids on tight and it's
just that really cheap acrylic you know
white packaging they're gonna have a
hard time standing out in Sephora I
really really think they are I think
they would have maybe been a better fit
at all time because of that because you
know also carries the drugstore and the
middle range and also the tight end but
at the same time you know like I said I
really like the Sephora is doing
something different and they're stepping
outside of their comfort zone this will
be very very interesting to see if this
is gonna work you know what I mean I
agree they released way too many
products yeah lately they have been and
like I said I enjoy that they restocked
until everybody gets what they want
but Sephora like flick Sephora you know
you're gonna go on there and that
will sell out and then they'll restock
like three months later colour-pop is
used to restocking like on a weekly
basis so I hope that they can figure
something out so that there's no any
issues with that but yeah that was
definitely the first like kind of you
know con I wanted to talk about was just
the overall shopping experience it's
gonna be a little different it doesn't
have to be but it might feel a little
different if you're walking by Lancome
and then suddenly you walk into
Tuesday's and then you see color pop and
then you're like oh what's that you know
you see cheap prices that maybe not the
best most luxurious packaging again it's
one of those things where of course the
packaging is cheap because they're
products they want to keep that price
down which makes sense but is do they
belong in a place like Sephora I feel
like hey let's do it let's try it out
you know let's see here what else yeah
so like I said I'm a little worried
about the first launch that they're
doing so it is going to be a limited
edition and I believe it's giving you
like a couple pallets there's my I don't
know we don't really know so I think
it's going to be Sephora exclusive so
that means it will only be on the
Sephora calm website
like I said color pop is really
with restocking their limited-edition
stuff Sephora is slow and they
usually and they I feel like they kind
of play around a little bit because they
won't let you know when it goes live
they won't you know they don't want the
website to crash I feel like the website
has only crashed two times that I know
of when I've been on there but yeah I'm
a little worried about the limited
edition stuff I don't like that they're
starting it out with a limited edition
I'm like there's my house and then I
guess like the last kind of thing I want
to talk about is just that the scale is
clearly uneven now and I mean obviously
you know you're gonna have one
affordable brand with all of these
really really expensive brands or
high-end brands and luxury brands and I
do feel like you know like I said
there's gonna be a color pop display and
a lot of people may turn their nose up
to that you know it's just I don't know
it's just one of those things where I do
feel like some people are not gonna like
it
I really don't have that much of an
issue with it I will say when I first
saw the post I was like oh no oh no they
can't be a Sephora and I was like but
why like why bitch like why can't they
be at Sephora and it's just because I
you know Sephora vibe you know feel
sophisticated maybe a little on the CV
side I feel like I'm allowed to say that
because I used to work at Sephora just
so you guys know I can't remember if
I've talked about that on my channel yet
but I did as a skin care consultant when
I was living in Manhattan so I kind of
know I kind of understand some of the
stuff like some of the stuff that goes
on behind the scenes we see here yes
it's just a collection for Sephora Aaron
Bryn hmm okay I'm talking too much see
I'm out of breath all the time people
are like you talk too fast yes I did
work at Sephora that I don't think I
have so basically I'm I did a work at
one of the Sephora's in Manhattan when I
was in college I was a skincare
consultant so I definitely didn't Apple
it with the makeup stuff but the reason
why I say some of the Sephora stuff is a
little shady is because I've seen some
of the shady and the reason why I say
some people are not gonna like this
change the color pop it's the guys at
least to get customers I mean these
little old women like 80 90 years old
would come in to buy their
Lancome Hypnose drama blue mascara and
they would literally turn their nose up
at anything that was under like these
$50 mark I mean they would leave with
$800 worth of stuff basically an
obviously basis so I think it's kind of
funny because like for me I've seen that
I've seen that there is a specific sort
of customer appeal when it comes to
Sephora and yeah there's gonna be both
people that don't like it that's all I'm
saying
let's see here and supportive shade
there really isn't shade like that's the
thing I see all those videos of people
talking about um oh sorry how about you
kissing my throat disgusting I know okay
better people talking about my horrible
experience at Sephora that didn't really
happen for me you guys I just wanted to
do the skincare stuff because for me I
was really bored on the weekends when I
was in college so I went to music
conservatory I'm super busy during the
weekdays and when I talked to the
manager we worked out a schedule that I
could work the weekends and then on top
of that when I had like a month offs for
winter vacation and spring break I would
go in break I would also go in and you
know basically work for like a month
straight so it was nice to have extra
money on the side especially living in
Manhattan all right let's see here I was
wondering why oh I thought the chat hook
froze I just didn't scroll down that's
the NYC snob way I live in NYC yeah
thought I was there for five years I'm
telling you some of these little old
ladies that came in there like I feel
like are you interested in this product
I don't know how much is that face cream
I feel like I 80 five dollars I don't
put anything on my face unless it's over
two hundred dollars like sometimes
actually said that to me before so you
know I'm just saying I'm just saying I
know that they're gonna be people that
have a issue with this no wonder you
know so much about skincare well that's
the thing is like I don't try myself in
the fact that like I worked at Sephora
again I didn't work with the makeup so
I'm not good enough for that but you
know I know some of my stuff when it
comes to skincare people like to correct
me all the time and this one we find I
just know what I learned at Sephora so
yeah Lancome groupies are also hell yeah
with their little
Sarah my grandma used to wear their blue
mascara mm-hmm so I feel like there is
gonna be a little bit of an uneven scale
you know mm I'm sorry nice putting out
like friggin I don't want to like hack
it up because that would be disgusting
Manhattan in the house Upper East Side
on the Upper West Side Sheila I mean I'm
only 22 but I don't want little kids
being annoying in Sephora either yeah
this could drop the age range as well so
usually with Sephora what I noticed when
I was working there was there were
usually I didn't see a ton of high
school-aged girls maybe they were
highschool age but they look like they
were in college it's just one of those
things I feel like I saw a lot of
college girls and boys I mean whoever
and I did see you know a lot of older
people as well but yeah I do see more
younger you know 15 16 17 18 and more so
like in Ulta and that's probably because
there's drugstore hell yeah when I was
in high school I thought drugstore I
didn't have money for frickin Sephora
Hale though what do you have for dinner
you out me eat such good food I had
pizza rolls
yeah not so good but I'm looking at the
time here 529 gave us wrong starts in 30
minutes are you guys prepared I'm so
excited
it hurts my heart having 13 year olds
buying uh TJ Toshi Divya oh my god I
mean I wore makeup when I was really
really young a little bit of a badass
and a rebel so I feel like as long as
you know you teach your daughters or
your sons like kind of like a light hand

that a lot
mr. Chi makes fun of me because he's
always like um you're literally like the
little spike - you know he always tells
me like I'm so sure and he's like it's
just so tiny and median you get so so
angry and I'm like all right let's see
have you ever watched at Beauty news
makeup breakup videos I have I love I
kind of want to destroy his Omega for
real for real though maybe I've been
seen up until 5 a.m. watching your video
Rose she was here that was like
ah at me shoulder that was cracking I'm
25 now all right let's see here I was 11
when I started makeup Wow very nice
I used to live in the Bronx and now in
Arkansas is quite the move I show my
great sign of your videos to prove to
him I'm not as crazy there you go that's
that's her she has to do because I'm
 crazy and everybody knows it so
you could just be like listen this bit
just even more crazier than I am your
content is so original and fun yeah
something that I like to do because it's
just YouTube is so boring
sometimes the beauty community was
really boring I'm sorry it is does your
boyfriend to watch your videos he
doesn't you know I think he hears me
record them sometimes so he's like nah I
don't need to watch them live it would
mean so much to me if you followed my
DIY natural skincare makeup page on
Instagram what is it mama loves math
I'll go ahead and check him out I'll
keep this video you're so pretty you're
so sweet I really look like a mess right
now I went I'm gonna ham with the
bronzer and the frickin lip stuff still
waiting for the color pop yes please
look I know I know I just really I don't
love doing the makeup on camera you guys
just like I'm really a review based
channel but it's so fun to do those get
ready with these I'll have that up maybe
next Saturday I have Crohn's disease and
seeing how you talk about your lupus and
all the symptoms openly Oh helps you to
heal and you're really inspired okay
that's good that's good I'm happy to
hear that that makes me very happy
I'm s you're gorgeous you're just too
sweet no sweet let's see here my
husband doesn't watch my videos either
yeah I don't think he just he just you
know interest well he can hear me
recording them so what's your advice I'm
starting a channel just be yourself I
know worst advice out there right no I
seriously mean it you guys just be
yourself because if you're not yourself
people are gonna see right through it I
was not myself when I first heard of my
channels like watching a alien
I'm like who that hello that Beach okay
uh
go back to some of my older videos like
I I get freaked out talking about like
so bad and uh yeah just feed yourself
and do what you want post the videos you
want to post so if a ranting makes you
happy and if you're a little bit of a
heated person like I am like post a rant
video once or twice a week nobody I had
both from my alopecia in high
school it was really hard this people
would prank calling as if I had cancer
she says Christ you're gonna go worse my
god I'm so sorry I see you love ante
holes yeah I'm like oh that's maybe the
video that's why not player this week I
don't know everything written down I
have everything written down I have
about 50 different video ideas that list
right now before I start adding new ones
that's my issue is that I just keep
adding new ones to the list and then I
don't get to other ones that like I
promised you guys so yeah I'm wanting to
start a channel but I'm Way too nervous
don't be nervous
it's okay I mean you just have to
understand that people will judge you
and they will be axels
I'm just thinking just being
straightforward people are very very
prone to being a little more aggressive
but when you can't see them when they
can go ahead and thumbs down something
when they can you know when they have
the option to basically be a troll they
will be very very harsh if they want you
but you just have to know that like I
think those people would ever say that
to your face I don't think half the
people that say some of this to me
in the comment section would actually
say that and if they'd be like that's
great we can chat about it let's see
here girl you probably have enough video
ideas and series thank you still lasting
years I mean I put together those 50
ideas probably four months ago and it
still keeps hear that
I have a stricken little bin here he's
inside the big all right I don't know
how people don't like you honestly
there's certain people I don't like
okay I'm very obnoxious who can I deal
with that like hey are you going to get
the Queen of Hearts palette when it
restocks yes everybody talks about it
but I also feel like maybe like playing
around with that loon addition status so
we'll see I know can you hear the noise
measure what are you doing he's
literally underneath the freaking thing
we question any tips to get a job at
Sephora badger have a little
perspective okay
let's see here Oh any tips to get a job
at Sephora so honestly if you're going
to forest skin here you don't need to go
in looking on badger BAM
if you vote in it for a skin here it
just has some nice light makeup on but
showed that you take care of your skin
and you know what you're talking about
if you go in for a makeup I'm the wrong
person to ask because I'm not
I'm not amazing at makeup by any means
you know so I mean I would honestly just
be yourself again so bad sons so stupid
be yourself but honestly it's all about
just being true to yourself being
original you know people like that will
you please stop I'm sorry you guys he's
actually doing me right now stop banter
let's see here ah so I'm sorry that was
like the cheesiest response ever but it
really just comes down to do your own
thing and you know the questions they
ask you for this interview for me it was
mostly just being here related so
obviously alright let's hear I love
mister better I don't right now you
literally trying to nibble me too all
right I love the way you say better
alright let's see here live how do you
feel about the in cosmetics setting
powder in translucent I know which one

I look at it hold on let me stretch my
leg out again then I look at it and I'm
like but wait doesn't that look like
every other pallet that's releasing
right now but everybody speaks so highly
of it I don't know what grade do you
teach I'm a special education preschool
teacher I teach autistic three and
four-year-olds so for me because I teach
a conservatory I do all sorts of
different ages but mostly the younger
kids because I'm hyper as and young
kids like me let's see here girl more
skincare related video sure you guys
know I used to work at Sephora maybe
you'll actually trust me with giving
stinkier advice yeah alright let's see
here are you getting it the My Little
Pony stuff from pure
 that My Little Pony My yes
okay no it should be called my little
badger okay that sounds bad but I mean
in My Little Pony
I'd never wash my little pony okay I was
watching like some real a
when I was 12 years old I was watching
like saw and all that kind of stuff that
 me up for life but you know I'm
not getting that I just can't I can't
the colors are so pretty
all right let's see here yes more
skincare hell yeah I want the My Little
Ponies up listen the palette is
beautiful but I just can't anymore do
you see him right now
after I honest and go what yahwehís I'm
joking okay I know someone's gonna take
that and like write it on reddit it's a
joke I would never I literally love him
more than I love myself alright what do
you use from Sunday Riley that you like
Luna is great Luna sleeping at night oil
I do love the Martian and mattifying at
melting water don't litter
it doesn't work as well here in my mouth
it doesn't work as well for me and now
that I'm here in the desert but when I
was more combination oily that was great
and then also the UFO oil I love the
clarifying oil so teach us skincare live
now now people want it huh yeah I always
get so many comments in my skincare
videos relic you know what you're
talking about I'm like I just learned
everything from Sephora like if you
insist all right what's the difference
between an essence and a serum and oil
so with Lewey wait you screw up so I
can't catch that comment okay so in
essence it happened is something that
you would want to put on your skin after
your toner so if there was like like a
series of steps that this is what I
personally do I will cleanse my face and
then I will go in and I will tell my
skin now normally people just tone and
then they put serum on and then
moisturizer for me I like to put an
essence on which is basically just like
a very nourishing toner so below II
would say witch hazel or like folic acid
if you want to miss something to have a
little more like the elf hydrating water
essence which I really really like
there's like hyaluronic acid and there's
something to have a little bit of
moisturizing properties it can balance
your skin it back out if you do you have
really really dry skin and you
absolutely cannot get toners to work
just pick up in essence and use that as
your toner and then as far as serums are
concerned those are the powerhouse of
your skincare routine they are the ones
that are going to sink in super super
deep I think they go 3/4 like into the
epidermis it's crazy babe serums are the
powerhouse and then as far as
moisturizer is concerned you can use an
oil or you can add oil into your
moisturizer a lot of people say to me
you know sometimes they put their oil on
and then go in with their moisturizer I
personally wouldn't do that just because
the oil does stand on top of the skin
and anything that you put on top of it
is gonna be harder to skin
okay how do you get rid of acne scars
and texture on the face so I definitely
do have texture and I'm literally wiping
my makeup off I definitely have texture
especially when I do have a lupus flare
so for me I'm I love acids
I love acids you know salicylic acid
glycolic acid lactic acid anything that
you can get I mean you can get these for
cheap you know like the ordinary they
have the lactic acid treatment which in
my opinion is very similar to be sundae
Riley good genes very very similar in my
opinion so it's one of those things
where I you know I feel like having an
acid is good it will exfoliate your skin
if you have super dry skin it will help
with texture if you have more
problematic oily skin and also takes
care of breakouts so alright I feel like
the desi Acadian news are best for those
with warm undertones I don't know all I
know is that I want to try something new
I'm gonna go outside my comfort zone I'm
probably gonna look like with that
makeup on my face and I'm ready live I
love acid oh yeah I want to ask right
now I love happen alright let's see here
lots of people use derma roller derma
rollers yeah hella ROM so I'd be careful
I used to have one you got to be very
careful you have to be very very careful
University of Sephora come on without a
cosmetology degree you know just as much
as the average scales pretty yeah are
you talking in the eye I never see I
never said that you know just good I
worked as before it makes me know stuff
about skincare I don't I don't
understand this is what I like never
mentioned stuff like that like I didn't
mention the support thing before because
I don't think it means that I know more
it's just what they taught me there
that's all alright can you do a testing
out lusha makeup sure I'm so hyped for
desi and Kate yes Samantha hell yeah I
know you're gonna get that collection
I'm gonna get everything I'm super
excited let's see here at personally not
a fan of the desi Katy collection the
colors don't inspire me
the colors inspire me there's something
about it I recently just picked up some
stuff from dose of colors as well for
the first time I'll be doing a video on
that
I just I'm inspired by the brand I
really like the brand
I haven't even tried them yet
are there any product ordinary dupe so
for me I feel like the 100% pure rose of
seedoil is really really nice what is it
similar to reminds me of the laura
mercier rose hip seed oil and then like
I
said the what is that why are people so
mad at me what am I saying what did I do
sorry hold on I don't understand I
didn't say that I'm an expert in skin
care people are just asking this is why
I say I worked as a farm before listen
you're just you're just talking to
yourself now a guy as far as I'm
concerned I'm gonna block here you can
say whatever you want but I'm not
claiming to be anything okay yeah all
right can you make a tutorial on your
everyday and make up yes I can the
ordinary products are already a pretty
inexpensive I think so expensive I was
like Jess they are not yeah they're
really nice in my opinion AJ all right
what do you think about Glenn blows mud
masks I did like them I love to them a
lot but they do tests on animals so I
will not repurchase anymore but they do
work they work it founds me to say it
but they do let's see here begin cooking
with Liv yes fine
I love your videos I'm not mad at all
love you Liv okay oh I know I'm not
marry anyone you guys I'm not blocking
anyone we don't have a moderator in here
you are
I left the you know comments open you're
allowed to do whatever you want you're
allowed two thumbs down the video the
reason why I block the ratings on my
videos is because people will just come
and thumbs down and said of telling me
what they want me to work on I can't
learn if you don't give me feedback so
anyway the person talking up the
skincare stuff like I said I'm not
claiming to be an expert people were
just asking are you a vegan girl I go
back and forth between vegan vegetarian
and eating absolute uh I do find
for me personally it does help when I
eat vegan just because that's how I was
raised that's what I'm used to
well yeah did you try the new Burberry
blush unfortunately no Burberry test so
I won't be doing that oh my god alright
