gonna bring small little sets and kits
and I brought like my whole fucking
collection I'm just like take it off um
so yeah I have two of these shades on
today and let's see how many times have
I worn this now three times I feel like
three times is still kind of like first
impressions sort of thing for me
personally but this is just not what I
was expecting it to be no this shape
right here is the one that I do have on
my lid and then I took the warmer tone
shade right here and smoke that out on
my sorry about my hand it's already I
smoked that out on my lower lashline
with the toasted palate I've had this on
all day so kind of looks crazy but if
these are incredibly incredibly glittery
you guys and the thing about it is you
know on the Super Comp website they were
saying you know metallics metallics and
then they said like something glitter
but it was towards the end of the little
paragraph where you read about the
product um yeah these don't feel Oh like
the a you know color pop I think I love
you palette these don't feel like me
fricking yes please palette like the
shimmers in there they're Scratchy
they're chunky they fall out all over
your goddamn face they go everywhere
everywhere um am I the only one not able
to see anything oh I think you
misunderstood I think I tell you
shitless I'm so confused
I'm sorry guys I wasn't looking at the
chat let me see here I live in love you
love you too it looks like these Sephora
exclusives are going to be launching on
colour-pop a website November 9th yeah
the cleavage is everything thank you
like I said we're gonna push a bra um
let's see here
I wasn't even excited about the whole
color pop I was excited because like a
look it's like pretty and pigmented but
there's this like I don't even know how
to describe it can you guys tell that I
brought you go lighting with me I want
to film some videos here so I did bring
a special light attack that in my
luggage because a professional booty go
row okay anyway hmm give me anyway this
is you know kind of what this watch
looks like
I hadn't watched some of these you guys
can see the pigment is there the colors
are very pretty but they're so
incredibly chunky I mean you need a
glitter glue you know this shit gets in
your eye gets in your ear it's gonna get
in your bellybutton it goes everywhere
okay and look at those kind of colors
you see that very very similar once you
get them onto the lid I don't know you
guys I'm just not impressed and again I
like to play with my you know I like to
play with my palettes for a while before
I mmm damnit what is in my throat come
on
hmm I like to play around for like a
week or so before being like this is a
fucking piece of shit don't you ever buy
this but um this is a fucking piece of
shit don't you ever buy this okay now
it's not a horrible you guys it's just
not what I was expecting uh you know and
they kind of lifted the price there's no
mirror some of their newer palettes that
they're gonna be releasing a veneer I
don't understand I mean it's just like a
whole nother you know kind of
collaboration sort of thing the colors
are pretty okay here's here's a swatch
but compared to the other color pop
palaces now what I thought it was gonna
be okay this is not what I thought it
was going to be yeah and look at those
that's just like the same color I mean
especially with like my skill level with
my eyeshadow is all just gonna blend
into one big jumbo ball okay all right
let's see here let me go ahead and look
at the chat here um I hope you're
enjoying your vacation I am thank you
yes and my tan
do I look tan yes oh my God look at that
oh yeah I need workout okay um eating my
belly button yeah I swear you guys this
shit is everywhere okay even if I let me
go up close hope you guys can see okay
there's glitter all up here okay and I
don't know fuck that is okay I'm now I'm
rubbing it onto my face okay you know
what
there is glitter on my face even if you
can't see it it's there and yeah I just
I don't know what to say
I'm Fieri very underwhelmed with this
guy's very underwhelmed let's see hi
live from Washington DC hello hello
yes describe it also for is the glitter
finish but if you read the whole entire
thing or at least a fucking paragraph
one
I got it you know five days ago they
were saying it has a variety of
metallics in here there are no no
metallics they might look my talipes are
all glitter I feel like it's kind of my
fault like I should have known because
you know it's kind of like the Fenty
galaxy collection sort of like the urban
decay heavy metals but I mean the heavy
metals to be better than this in my
opinion I mean the pigment is way
stronger I just I look at this and I'm
just like why are you why are you like
this
alright let's see here color pop or
raise their prices yeah
cursing like a sailor yes bitch I always
hello from Iowa had to oh your work
ethic is impressive it's not work ethic
I mean I'm on vacation right now I'm
just sitting down you know have a towel
gear so I can do my splashes all right
let's see here I just got D and yes
please and love the okay what I'm
confused I hate chunky shadows I don't
know why but I feel like you're alive
videos you're I don't I don't know why
but I feel like I like her oh you like
your live videos more than the edited
ones well thank you I appreciate that
can't hear anything that's not good okay
let me see I'm gonna scroll down now umm
lips have you tried to eat healthier I
was wondering did you get your protein
and have I tried to eat a your and this
little thing right here is like cute
Abbas okay so um the answer is no I
tried okay do try once in a while you
guys know I was raised at vegan but um I
don't know I like good food okay I like
good fucking food in them up they didn't
really raise the prices and that much
there's a more product in the Sephora
but I understand but this is I've is it
my fault
should I have known it was gonna be
glitter what is wrong with me what is
wrong with me I don't know it's just
that the photos of it I thought they
were gonna be soft and italicized and
that one word metallic in a paragraph
and I thought that so I'm not gonna be
too harsh but I mean I I don't know a
whole bunch of this even the colors are
pretty I enjoy looking at it and I hold
on to it just a look at it you know I'm
gonna do that - Florida who's watching
the babies AB my dad is watching the
babies he is staying at the apartment in
Arizona alright let's see here the price
is higher period yeah you know what if
we can complain all day or I mean we can
sit here and say like oh they didn't
really move the prices but I mean
end of the day we're the ones paying for
okay yes the price is higher and it's
fucking shit alright I'd rather have
these smaller size and regular price I
think it's stupid
I think this release just this why I
don't know I don't know I try not to be
a bitch right now can you guys tell I'm
trying not to be like I'm stuck just a
lollipop okay because I believe in them
I believe in them but I could just this
is not what I was expecting and you know
the whole shimmery palette thing I mean
what like a year ago people would have
been like what the fuck is that okay
because this is just becoming a popular
thing within the past couple of months
but I like the heavy metals palette I
just I I don't like this I just don't
like it okay I don't like it
I suck at putting a good look are you
gonna return and we kind of return you
know I have a friend named Brittany who
is obsessed with colour-pop and she
really wants this palette she's sending
me become Rosa so I think I'll go ahead
and send this one to her I was
disappointed when I saw the Sephora
collection do we put glue yeah why do we
put glitter and eyeshadow I know right I
know I know I know and I feel like I
should have known right
I should have kind of known all right
let's see here yes the lid is the queen
of no crap reviews I'm trying not to be
you know I feel like it would be very
biased of me right now to be like I hate
you I don't hate them okay I'm just
saying this was a little a little bit of
a letdown I've only worn it three times
though so I need to play with it more
maybe magically tomorrow it'll be like
fucking unicorns on my eyes okay we
don't know we don't know uh-oh let's see
here not crazy with shimmers ofor at me
I understand fangirl sigh I need to play
yes I love em adore so just the look of
it everything about it I'm so excited
but yeah any questions about those you
guys I don't know what to say I can't
give a full review I mean it's been
three days but uh yeah not not very
special
what mascara you got on I have the it
cosmetics superhero mascara on yes yes
yes
glitter is making a comeback young girls
I know I kind of feel like a teen or
something like wearing these kind of
colors well I can't work these into like
my crease or anything I don't have that
skill level you know so anyway you guys
you see this bruise right here that I
got some flying look at
my legs they're all purple and nasty I
know I can't I can't not like move my
legs and when I have to sit still on the
plane it's horrible but alright no depth
to the shades just repetitive it
glitters I agree I agree you would think
with this a bean color pops big break
into Sephora they would do way better I
mean you know I don't know how quickly
they had to pull this together I mean
has this been in the works for a while
or literally when they brought it up
like four months ago was that when they
were like okay yeah we're gonna take you
I feel like Sephora wanted to take
colour-pop after they saw that Ulta was
like hey we'll take all welted fucking
take all the indie brands you know and
then they were like oh my god like I
have to step up my game which you do
Sephora step your game up right love
superhero it's amazing I agree I agree
Rochelle you're muttering I've been
distracted hi let's see the outfits
uh-oh the one I'm wearing right now it's
just this little black top and I have
some jeans on so yeah all right let's
see here have you tried a CYO I have not
I have not most recommended eyeshadow
brands brands that's a tough one I
couldn't yeah that that's a tough one
because I feel like you know formulas do
change with brands I want to do a video
all about my makeup family within my
makeup collection talking about multiple
like kind of repeat palettes that I do
have from the same genre I don't want to
say like formula because you look at
like the fucking hourglass palette all
three of them had a different formula
you know all the holiday palettes and
the scene with the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills low kits but I don't know I think
that would be a fun video to do have you
tried any Marc Jacobs eyeshadow palettes
I have not I was going to pick up the
$99 one this year and then I did and
where is sure that my voice just are you
yeah okay where is your top from the
ladies are popping thank you this is
from Wet Seal I got this I think four or
five years ago something like that
so alright let's see here are the
Natasha demons
palettes worth it Natasha demons well if
it's a demon palette I'm gonna say again
that we're a bit live at Roy witch hazel
for the bruises oh yeah girl oh my god
my poor fucking legs you guys like I
can't just see how purple and sad and
depressing my circulation so bad and
yeah it's like I don't know I don't know
what to say you can always tell that
there's like purple stuff going on here
and here but yeah my legs really could
not handle it on the flight it was like
a six hour flight and I was like all
right I don't want any more glitter
after there being a new supernova Stila
like I shows yeah I'm just I kind of was
like okay I can see the all shimmery
palate thing like I like it I like it I
like the Urban Decay heavy metal so I
should've just stopped there what am I
gonna do with all these palettes right
all right let's see here Oh long flight
yes yes arnica cream is great for
bruising yes I need to look into that
yeah Natasha Danone oh I've been a
pretty happy with all the lorac ones I
have yeah yeah I mean I feel like for me
my little rock pro four nose are
fantastic but I've got such issues with
the rock with their cruelty free stats
like what the heck you remind me of the
chat is going okay where did it go
um okay I'm sorry I just lost that
comment it makes me cringe when other
beauty bloggers try to speak a friend so
you are such a breath of fresh air thank
you um arnica saved me with bruising
yeah I need to look into an article
cream that would be good for sure let's
see here the colour-pop sephora palette
sucks I just got here it's not that it
sucks
it just isn't amazing you know I was
expecting something amazing because
color pop I don't care what the prices
you know they have been releasing some
really really good quality eyeshadow
palettes so for them to come out with
this it just caught me by surprise
that's all I'm not loving it
I'm not loving it you know there's some
pretty shades for sure though you know
look at that it's like a beautiful
beautiful color but I don't know I don't
know guys I just I don't have much to
say I don't know what to say I'm
literally stuck every single I look that
I put together I mean this shit is
everywhere it's all over my face the
glitter is everywhere
video is still not working I'm sorry I
don't know what's going on maybe it's
because I'm in Hawaii currently I don't
know by the way if I seem a little more
I mean
I'm having some caffeine right now but
if I seem a little more calm I did it
have to take like an anti-anxiety med
because we went on a helicopter ride so
if I seem a little more chill you know
what you know what all right let's see
here she does look like angelique boyer
what is your favorite color pop
eyeshadow palette definitely yes please
for sure all right
what is your go-to daily eyeshadow
palette live my go-to daily eyeshadow
palette currently is a tart toasted
palette it changes a lot I have a lot of
palettes oh you guys should we talk
about what I brought on the trip and
then the first item is the Too Faced and
over rx-3 and one we're punishing a
primer spray all over them tattoos it
smells amazing it's beautiful
I really do like this but I prefer the
Smashbox photo finish primer water
they're both silicone free they're both
oil free yeah they don't have any
silicone and they have no oil in there
no alcohol but I do prefer the Smashbox
if you guys are curious I brought the
Urban Decay Naked skin to one and done
hybrid complexion Perfector I wear the
shade light and almost done with this so
I have one cup of that on my face today
it gives a nice amount of coverage but
you can still see you know little marks
and things like that through there and
then I brought this guy this is the
cushy loot what is this - should he take
from bye teary this is basically they're
concealing highlighting brush I hate the
scent on this you know this was sent for

slight things there are so many I know
of God can you imagine if they come like
the hundreds I'm ready for you you
stupid little twelve-year-old let's go

GG collaboration worth the money bitch

having a hell of ideo coming up soon so
I will let you know that oh alright
let's see what do you think of buying to
be personally oils for the Sephora sale
alright so far Solly I'm on there PR
list and you know they do a lot of I
guess I can just say it so they do a lot
of sponsored stuff so when they
approached me and asked me if I wanted
to be on the PR list the first thing was
like do you want to do a sponsored
Instagram video and you guys know I'm I
don't post the sponsored stuff I have
never done that you know so and I don't
think I ever will so I don't really like
how they're pushy with what they want
you to say in videos and stuff like that
but they do still send me PR I like
their unicorn essence but mostly when I
was like a little more humble wavy skin
I is their oil super super super special
not really and I mean I don't have any
issue if they want to take me off their
PR lists you know for saying that oh my
god how offensive she didn't like our
product all right let's see here Jason
shut the fuck up who's Jason Jason I
will call your mother oh I didn't see
him let me go back and find him Jason
I'm coming for you dumb little beach all
right let me see oh there's Jason when
slap

rip your wig off oh how aggressive gosh
your parents know he's come on Jesus
coming from the girl who swears like a
sailor we're good to get the chocolate
bar during this sale has the formula
change some people are saying the
formula has changed some people are
saying that it hasn't go in stores wash
it out if they swatch and they don't
streak and they go on really nicely and
pigmented then I think it's the same
formula I reported Jason Jason is being
a bad boy and I'm gonna have a
conversation with his mother okay yeah
my teacher sign is coming up all right
of the thousands of names for you to
pick you pick Jason oh no I'm not trying
to acknowledge and he keeps sending the
same post over and over so I see that
first all right ah let's see

first impressions that didn't happen so
somebody remind me okay because I have
three foundations sitting in my
collection that I need to do a first
impressions on I just really don't like
first impressions videos anymore which
is why I'm hesitant with this because
this is a third impression and it's
still not enough you know what I mean
and what's the point of a first
impression if you're not gonna follow up
with Jesus Christ all right let's see
here best concealer you would recommend

Monday okay let's see can you talk about
brands that have taken you off their PR
list yes I can't I want to do a video
all about it I also have some other
videos on my list let me pull the list
up so like I said I wanted to do my
makeup family's formulas that I have
purchased multiples of and then I also
want to do let's see here makeup Browns
trying too hard to be something they're
not
which is be interested in that and then
also I want to start a new series called
view truths kind of like you too but you
truths talking about specific things and
then also brands who showed their true
colors
social media we could talk about racism
as well as like grown-ass men acting
super super fuckin petty like a little
plots Jarrett and Jeffrey makeup brands
like I said trying too hard to be
something they aren't uh let me know if
you guys like those ideas I'm trying not
to add too many to the list right now
because it's just one of those things I
already have 300 on the list I'm already
behind
goldfish squirrel bitch did you just add
squirrel into I don't I am fuckin Queen
over here okay people are like you're a
squirrel and I'm like I'm really I'm
fake tits Muslim something out come on
stop spamming if you just send one
comment I won't block you alright there
okay and thank you for saying that my
tits look like they're fake because
they're not they're not but I like that
thank you for the gobble bit alright
what's your number one bang for your
buck palate that's a good question can I
do
currently bang for the buck I would say
Sonia Kashuk I on neutral palate yes
always changing what do you think about
kuda beauty's new foundation color
selection um I didn't look into it
because I'm not interested in Hooda but
- what is the color selection light does
it look good um let's see you keep it
real I'm looking forward to these it
thank you you're goofy hamster thank you
so much I appreciate it
what does having an LLC do it protects
you against being sued and having brands
coming after you mm-hmm oh my god this
girl defending Fendi who's defending
Fendi but nobody said anything about
Fenty yes those are fake they've never
been boobs like again if they think
though yeah it's called a push-up bras
children okay alright block a drama
queen please I'm only blocking people
that come in like this one right here
they do multiples at a time cuz it's
annoying but I mean if they want to sit
there and say that I have but I don't
like when it comes in multiples at a
time because then I can't see your
comments alright so these kids can't
handle someone's opinion are you
children of course they're children
clearly alright live a block a drama I
think I did how can you be racist
a brand wait oh did someone say that
wasn't aware if it was draw my just
finding it hilarious I did okay yeah ah
she's going crazy about funky okay I
didn't say anything bad about Fendi
she's great I mean I think they're great
I haven't tried their foundation yeah so
no fucking no
but anyway and that is everything that I
brought from makeup and then I don't
have my brushes in front of me hmm
yes I do curse like a sailor every day
bitch every day every day is the Marc
Jacobs velvet norm mascara waterproof it
is not not the formula that I have but
you can get one that's all right let me
see Europe the light chat just froze
what's happening oh you seem so calm I
know I know it's Suzanne axe my face
I've got my helicopter
drama queen was hating about fenty oh
well we can all have our opinion it's
okay but yeah okay
those concealers you suggested are great
for dry skin so Annie kept on T a lock a
concealer creme you have to be careful I
would mix that one with something a
little more hydrating but the aqua
sealer from Tarte absolutely great for
dry scampi all right
um how often do you use your hourglass
ambient edit volume three totally bought
because of you I love it but it's so
sparkly so I'm noticing it that diffuse
light has sparkle in it and then that
middle shade definitely has sparkled
that strobing powder I'm very very very
unimpressed with the fact that our glass
has been releasing it powders with
straight-up glitter in it lately like
what are you doing okay this isn't the
core a formula just leave it fucking
leave it but yeah I have been using it
I've been using I thought I was gonna
bring it on this trip and then I didn't
end up right yeah there's just so much
stuff coming out all right let's see
here hi Liv I am from Chicago hellooo if
you want better highlights though I
would pick a Beck I we're beautiful
don't let these haters bother you Oh
sweetie
trust me they're that don't you worry
about that thank you for following up
all right - what is your favorite
foundation for dry skin light/medium
full-coverage lights would be Smashbox
TV water drops medium hourglass lose
hyaluronic skin tint and full coverage
would be the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation it's good all right live it
never said anything bad about fenty wait
where is the spent eat girl what if she
I can't see let me go back there's just
so many little twats in here tonight so
many little class alright I think she
said the tart blush Bazaar wasn't their
usual formula I haven't tried the tart
blush Bazaar from this year I didn't get
it so I do you but usually with their
holiday palettes they are a little
different they're not identical to the
full-sized compacts that's what I notice
at least alright let's see here
uh-oh it froze again why you look a lot
like Cameron Diaz I love you thank you a
jeffree star
okay what about Geoffrey star I don't
like him I'm not a fan of ya
okay I will not be buying his makeup
alright stop asking about Jeffrey Stehr
yeah I don't know I've talked about it
briefly but yeah I'm not a fan of him
he's very unprofessional in my opinion I
don't really like the way he puts out
things about his brand he I don't know
if you're gonna be a brand be a little
more professional you know like I would
never have a makeup company because I
would also do what he does and go off on
Twitter and stuff like that but then
don't have a makeup ring you have to be
somewhat professional he is not very
professional at all and I also just
don't like you know the racist past kind
of thing what time is it in Hawaii it is
around 6 p.m. here fresh the very oil
worth of buying it is very very
beautiful freshness tests on animals you
are curious I feel like fresh Seabury
oil reminds me mmm you know what no it
doesn't remind me of that oil yeah it's
pretty good it's pretty good yeah
alright let's see I agree he's annoying
he's just it's just there's so much
drama you know can you talk about the
information you got on belief I read on
tire that they are cruelty free but then
I saw your video they told me personally
that they are not cruelty free at least
that's my email that I got
oh shit of you yes see yes maybe I'll do
a room tour I did a few of those last
time you know Hawaii as well let's see
here a sliver of lava bullet lipstick
brand same old favorite right okay I
can't actually it's not an actual word
favorite bullet lips
I don't know I guess it's like beauty by
beauty yeah I dunno see you know 12:46
a.m. wow that's crazy I can't believe
this 460 you watching right now because
I know a lot of you are on the East
Coast but thank you for Solly it worth
it yeah I don't know I don't know you
guys I feel like they're oil I mean it's
just it's it's an oil I feel like I have
tried other oils that have done more for
my skin like tarte maracuja oil I really
like that for inflammation with my skin
I love josie maran argan oil for
hydration there's a lot of good oils out
there it's not that special
so you know not anything that you need
let's see - malaysia handle our limited
edition hourglass pallets still worth it
to you yes they are I just I collect
them I love them if they start putting
glitter in every fucking shade maybe not
for long but as of right now yes what
base cleanser do you use you have

there were some little plots that came
in about 30 minutes through how are they
have you tried the cover FX enhancer
drops are they worth it they are you
guys they're beautiful they're really
really nice if you do have dry skin you
want to like mix that into your
foundation kiss luminous beautiful look
to the skin if you apply too much I mean
artificial and plastered
I don't like it as a highlight because I
can't do the whole fucking you know
cream on top of powder thing I just
can't do it and people are like oh you
should just you know powder after I
can't do that either
I can't with cream products like cream
highlight cream blush I just don't do it
but I do like to mix a minute to my
foundation - Laura can love your videos
my daughter thinks you look like a
porcelain princess I had sweet what is
your favorite foundation so far josie
maran vitamin C foundation fluid I would
say have you heard anything about the
new Becca palette coming out in two days

to buy it uh yet again you guys know I
love it Becca palette so I will most
likely go ahead and scoop that up as
well

formula or when you just love a you know
collection you want it all Danna
question no thanks for taking up on
vacation with you thank you for watching
I have in North Carolina a team that's
what I've been using let's see here

great so much better than the website is
it oh my god it these Sephora website

my cart and I was like ready to go and
it was like there's an error and I was
like you better fix yourself before I
jump into this screen and thank you sub
all right come on
all right live just above the shade and
light contour palette from Kat Von D
what do you think about it I have never
tried it you believe it I've never tried
it I know everybody talks about it but
I'm just not huge on contouring it's not
something I do you know yeah it's just
not something I do on a daily basis so I
hate from Hawaii hi I'm in Hawaii - what
do you think of the Becca full coverage
foundation I really like that one
actually they recently sent that for PR
I hated the other one they sent the oil
free Becca ever Matt look like shit on
my skin but the full coverage complexion
creme is nice kind of like a easier
version of the Kat Von D lock at tattoo
foundation it's a little more breathable
do you like it Sean cookie n um no not
really I don't know I don't know I
haven't really watched a lot of his
videos I do like drama channels though

all right let's see er I'm worried that
being in Sephora is going to bring
colourpop's quality I just I don't I
don't know I don't know what to say I
feel so hopeless about the whole
situation when I found out that they
were going to be at Sephora I was like I
don't know I feel bad kind of excited
I'm kind of not and then this palette of
course I didn't think anything else up
so again I can't jump I'm holding my
fucking tongue because I can't be
talking about products that I don't have
but yeah Samantha merch is like one of
my faves just like well thank you
Tarte contour palette I think I'm gonna
declutter mine I just don't reach for it
as often as my other contour palette
which I do have five in my collection I
don't wear contour on an everyday basis
so that's my god I have three that I
want to go ahead and declutter soon love
Samantha March the both of y'all are
people yes music and writing exactly
exactly when you said something about
your throat I felt like you drink tea

I just haven't you know I haven't really
watched any of his content I don't know
why I know people were talking a lot
about him I mean they talk about the
drama channels I love your top where's
it from this is from Wet Seal what's
your favorite healthy snack ever um I
don't eat healthy but um mmm
healthy snack God if I was a healthy
person what would I say like celery with
a little bit of peanut butter on it just
plucking peanut butter they're healthy
yeah I love your top thank you it's your
favorite contour lib okay it is the it
cosmetics like if this is how often I
wear contour you guys I can't remember
it is the it cosmetics Pro body and face
contour palette that's the one does your
color pop palettes have oil leaks so far
it does not but I mean this packaging
does remind me exactly absolutely
identical you know to the Nicole
Guerrero glow kit from an associate
Beverly Hills so I could see that
happening they definitely are a little
more connected but they have the
scratchy surface to them you know
I just I keep looking at it like you're
so you're so strange this weird little
palette all right would the aqua sealer
work for way they scan it definitely
would just make sure to go ahead and set
it so that you know you can kind of
prolong the longevity throughout the day
I think I hear mr. t in the other room I
think he's up you guys so I think we're
gonna go ahead and head it down and get
a drink I want to get a drink and maybe
I shouldn't mix that with the anti just
want to go down to the pool and hang out

show you guys the when we go to the
lanai we're gonna be flying to London I

difference on how eye shadow Oh God not
