am currently on lunch break as you can
probably see I feel like I'm vlogging
right now and these little videos called
living life to get it like living life
I'm so funny these are going to be up on
the days in March where I don't have
time to film a sit-down video I was
supposed to do a sit-down video
yesterday didn't have time for that I
was supposed to do a sit-down video
today I don't have time for that so the
easiest thing for me to do is just pick
up my phone and do a little bit of a
vlog now I always said I would never
blog on this channel one of the reasons
for that is because I feel like when you
start blogging you have to share your
whole entire life and while I am a very
very open person there are certain
things that I just will not share with
you guys um so you know I have a lot of
people in my life that just straight-up
don't want to be on camera I have a lot
of people that are willing to be on
camera but there are a lot of people
that just don't want to be on camera
including us some family members as well
as co-workers so I'm never gonna take
you guys to work with me I will do a
classroom tour if you guys would like to
see one my music classroom but where I
don't show any students and I don't show
any of my coworkers but for the most
part when I do these little vlogging
videos is mostly just gonna be be anyway
if you're curious of where I am right
now I am in my dad's new empty house I
thought I'd give you guys a little bit
of a house tour I also want to show you
some PR and then I thought we would go
through the ultra 21 days of beauty
event because I don't have the catalog
but I got the print off for it and I'd
let you guys know what I recommend and
what's on my personal wish list so I
know that these Sephora vib sale is
coming up as well I'm not quite sure the
dates for that when I used to work at
Sephora it was usually in the middle of
April so I am very very excited for that
sale as well there are definitely some
items that I want to pick up when I have
a good 15% off but yeah so my dad
decided to get a house down here he also
has a condo down here and I know people
seem to give him like a lot of for
that every time I mentioned he has this
new house and then he also has the condo
people are like what's the point of that
why does he do that my dad is now fully
retired and he's allowed to do it over
the funky once he worked really hard as
whole entire life so please be polite in
the comments my dad is one of those
people that is more than willing to be
on camera and I will definitely share
him with you guys on camera today so
please be respectful and please be nice
I'm totally fine with you guys giving me
some but if you give my family some
 we're gonna have a problem know
that I get a lot of questions about my
pair
like are they divorced are they married
so we do have multiple homes we have two
homes in Minnesota so we have a cabin as
well as a house in Minneapolis where I
grew up and then my dad did recently
sell his condo in Florida and then he
has the places down here my parents are
not divorced you guys I know I get asked
this question a lot they have been
married for over thirty years and they
really do love each other but my mom
just doesn't like the heat she never
wanted to live in Florida and she sure
as hell doesn't want to live down here
this is just going to be a winter home
for my dad because obviously in
Minnesota it gets freezing I
grew up there I know I'm from Minnesota
so I've spent a lot of time in the
Midwest it gets very very cold up there
since we're so close to Canada and you
know he wanted something to be able to
come down to when it's warm and I think
my mom will come to visit once in a
while but she really does like cold
weather she's just one of those people
so anyway I thought I would walk you
guys through before we get into that I
am breaking out so bad and I went to
work looking like this today I literally
have pimples everywhere and I feel like
a few of my co-workers were like alright
so when you walk in you turn over here
here's my dad hi dad hello again this is
gonna be his little office clearly not
organized yet but look how cool this
table is really really like that desk
and then over here we have this little I
love this this is like a light fixture
it is so cool we already put down a few
little carpets they have cat hair all
over them cuz you guys know I showed you
Cinderella from my house in Minneapolis
these are from the house of Minneapolis
and she's got her hair everywhere and
then over here we have some little
plates dad where do you get these plates
where are these plates hanging on the
wall where are these from from farmer
actually from France
okay long time ago 200 years Wow
beautiful
all right so then you walk over here and
you have I see we have a little
paintings here and then you have the
kitchen here like I said he just got the
keys yesterday so we don't really have
anything organized but over here you
have the laundry room and then you have
the walk into the garage and then you
have it this little area where you walk
down and this is the master bedroom
as you guys can see and then over here
we have the walk-in a bathroom with a
painting of a naked lady so here is the
walk-in bathroom you have a beautiful
tub as well as a walk-in shower which i
think is really cool so there's the
shower I'm something my dad has to head
and show a V note what is that a V no
body wash over there you also have a two
different little sinks here and then
over here we have the bathroom and then
you have this walk-in closet area which
I was filming in earlier and yeah I'll
just put all his stuff in here obviously
doesn't have everything down here yet
but it's a nice area to store all your
towels and all that I can't even
speak so that is basically at the
walk-in master bathroom as well as the
bedroom and then you have the TV up
there and then when you walk over here
we go back to the other side and like I
said it's just like the perfect size
because you have like the walk-in with
the open area here and this is the kind
of living room dining room area again
you have a TV here and the people who
moved out left this table and these
chairs look at these chairs they are so
cool I love these chairs so they left
this and then you have an outdoor patio
which is really beautiful and then you
have another dining-room table with a
really interesting rug that they also
left and a really cool light fixture a
bunch of paintings here that my dad
wants to hang up all over and then here
is the kitchen area as you guys can see
still a little messy what can I say I
have my brother and my dad down here and
they are messy boys do you think your
mom would be rolling over in her grave
right now if
knew that you washed her crystal dishes
in the dishwasher do you think that's
far more would not like this front door
is right there and then on the other
side you walk in and you have this cute
little bathroom and check out this sink
it's not the cutest thing you've ever
seen I don't know why but I'm in love
with that sink all let's turn off the
fan I'm in love with that sink you have
a nice little mirror here again you have
a bathroom with a walk-in or shower
which is beautiful and I just really
like this I think of a lady who lived
here before specifically put this in and
I just think it's so cool super cute and
cute rug and then you walk in here and
you have the TV of the bookshelves and
obviously they had some sort of a piece
of furniture over here and this is
basically a pullout bed kind of like the
guest wing and then you walk over here
so my brother's been hanging out the bed
is not made because he's my brother and
then we have this little area this is a
lamp oh my gosh you guys this is a lamp
from the house in Minneapolis where I
grew up and I made these little bobbles
here when I was like 10 years old I used
to make these little things all the time
I loved making jewelry so very eccentric
style is if you probably tell and then
you walk in over here and again you have
two double sinks and then you do have a
shower and they left the shower curtain
and I'm in love with this shower curtain
look at it it's got glitter and sparkles
on it you guys know my favorite color is
glitter so really really beautiful again
bathroom in here and yeah that's pretty
much it so really just a nice area for
him it to be in it's a great little
house a nice amount of room but not too
spacious just because you know if it's
just him down here he'll be a little
lonely so yeah that's pretty much it and
hope you guys enjoyed the door let us
know what you think we should do as far
as decorating is concerned I would love
to hear your thoughts down below but now
I have some PR I wanted to share with
you guys so the first little batch of PR
I have is actually from the hush app if
you guys haven't heard of hush I don't
know where the you've been because
hush has been doing sponsorships and
giving a PR to a lot of different Beauty
vloggers recently to promote their app
they have a ton of different brands that
they sell on there but probably their
most popular is bad habit bad habit is
this brand that made
suppose the dupes for like high-end
palates so they did reach out to me and
asked if I wanted to do a sponsorship I
declined the sponsorship but I did say I
would like to test out the products for
PR you know for free to give an honest
review as always so they told me that I
could pick ten to 15 different palates
and I picked a bunch of different stuff
I also got a highlighter from Jake at
beauty that I saw was on their website
that I really wanted to pick up but yeah
I will definitely do a video for you
guys letting you know if these bad habit
palates are any good there is also
another brand that I picked a few
pallets from that is cruelty free as
well so let me walk you guys through
those like I said the first item that I
picked from the website is actually from
Jake at beauty I have heard so many good
things about these you glow girl baked
highlighters I got the shade ygg 106
Bella Rose and it really is pretty I
will show you guys the swatch here in
natural lighting it definitely is that
typical baked sort of feeling so if you
don't like those more like rough texture
highlights you probably wouldn't like
the feel of this however it goes on
really smooth and I don't feel like
there's any glitter in here I mean when
I look at it at certain angles I almost
feel like there's really really just
bigger chunks of shimmer but I'm not
seeing any glitter and I think it's a
beautiful color so I'm excited for that
and then like I said I got some bad
habit pallets hold on I feel like and
the lens here is a little is that better
I think that's better so the first one I
got is called the aftershock palette I
think this is supposed to be a do before
one of the little mini huda beauty
palettes it has a ton of bright colors
in here and I will say the mats are
really really nice and silky but they do
not swatch very well and then the
shimmers in here swatch very well so
there's three shimmers the rest of them
are matte I will keep you guys updated
on that one up next we have the bad
habit solstice palette now this is
supposed to be a dupe for the natasha de
no no sunset palette I already do have
the color pop yes please palette so I
will also compare it to that one but
yeah that is the Solstice here is the
retro love palette this is supposed to
be a dupe before the subculture palette
very excited to test this one out for
you since a lot of people did not like
the subculture I personally did like the
subculture I didn't have any issues but
that is the retro love and then I wanted
to get a neutral one as well this is the
midsummer night palette it's supposed to
be a dupe for the natural love palette
from Too Faced which I did not like now
there appears to be a lot of glitter in
few shades in here but they swatch
pretty well
I will say if you like a lot of these
shimmers as well as the mats feel silky
but they're very thin almost like you're
gonna have to build up a lot of layers
that's just what I'm noticing with the
bad habit palettes so far and then I
also got the Aphrodite as well as the
Athena palettes which are supposed to be
dupes for the hooter it does are dusk as
well as the whatever the other one is
called so this is supposed to be the
desert dust palette and then this one is
supposed to be the first one which I
forgot what it's called I'm very excited
for these because huda beauty is not
cruelty free as you guys know so I'm
excited to test these out this one right
here is straight-up just the glitter
pressed into a color press into the pan
but that's okay hopefully these will be
good beautiful beautiful colors so those
are the bad habit pallets that I will be
reviewing and then I did pick up a
couple of products from the face candy
brand this is also a cruelty free brand
so this is the face candy
palettes the first one which is supposed
to be a dupe for the aurora glow kit
from anastasia beverly hills and then
this one is mermaid glow which is
supposed to be a dupe afford the moon
child so I for one and very impressed
with how these are swatching this is
kind of the moon child dupe I'll put it
in the sunlight as well not a lot of
glitter they swatch really really nicely
they're very metallic eyes I hope they
go onto the skin and this nicely so
anyway that is the moon child dupe which
is called the mermaid glow from face
candy and finally they also sent me the
Sahara and Amazonia palettes really
really nice packaging here this first
one oh my gosh look at these colors I am
so into this super super creamy mats and
the shimmers are nice they seem like
they're gonna be those kind of shimmers
that you have to build up on the eyes
but look at these colors like toucan oh
my god all of these are absolutely
stunning and then here is the Sahara
palette this one's a little more warm
toned as you guys can see I am excited
for these so so far I feel like the face
candy palettes are looking a little
better than the bad habbit palettes but
I will keep you guys updated and then
over here let me move these over I have
a little package here from bio clarity
if you're one of those people that
struggles with a lot of different skin
issues like you sometimes breakout you
sometimes have really dry skin I feel
like this is a line that might cover you
quite nicely you have a really basic
cleanser right here called the cucumber
green tea chamomile
sir my dad used it this morning he said
it was super cooling and it felt really
nice on their skin so I'm actually gonna
leave that here for him now this guy I
did use today this is the treat number
two it's the complexion perfection 2%
salicylic acid acne treatment gel with
oak kernel I liked this a lot I want to
see how it layers together with the
makeup but what I like about this whole
line is just that all you have to use
these four products every single morning
and every single night and you don't
have to worry about like Oh am i mixing
this product with this product is this
gonna be inactive because I mixed it
together with this oil or because I make
tit mix it together with this acid it's
a very very simplistic basic like
four-step routine so if you're someone
who's on the go in a hurry you guys know
I love skincare but I still wanted to go
ahead and try this out so we'll see how
everything goes and then here is the
serum I really like this one because as
you guys can see you have a little bit
of a pump here now this also said that
you could use this as like a mask it
kind of confused me but I used it as a
serum and it went on really nicely
no complaints there it will keep you
guys updated and then finally the argan
oil olive oil flora luck some
moisturizer I love that this is in a
squeezy too it's got a really really
nice texture to it not too thick not too
thin it hydrates my skin very very
nicely so so far I am really loving the
3 of these and then like I said I will
leave this one for my dad but yeah if
you're looking into natural skin care
cruelty free skin care and you want
something that just goes together that
you use in the morning and at night I
would definitely recommend taking a peek
at these again I need to test them out
just a little more but so far so good
with those and I believe it's like 20
dollars for all four steps which is
pretty cool so yeah that's my little PR
haul now I wanted to go ahead and walk
you guys before oh sorry my back just
cracked before I head back to work I
wanted to walk you guys through what I
recommend and what I have on my wish
list as far as the 21 days of beauty
event is concerned at Sephora and not
 Sephora at Ulta
so let me go ahead and grab my computer
21 days of beauty is going to be a three
week thing this year it starts on Sunday
March 18th and the three items that will
be on sale are the Tarte lights camera
lashes four in one mascara the lorac pro
3 palette as well as the philosophy
micro delivery exfoliating facial wash I
have tried this before I thought it was
a piece of I tried it back when I
wasn't cruelty free this is also a piece
of I'm not just saying that cuz I'm
boycotting Tarte every single Tarte
mascara makes
I lashes fall out they're like way too
dry and they just fall out in clumps and
then the lorac pro 3 palette also
wouldn't recommend unless you absolutely
love neutral natural palettes if you are
in a very very professional work
environment and you need something
smooth and creamy and you want the
shimmers to be just as blendable as the
mattes you would probably love this
palette but I personally decluttered
mine so won't be purchasing anything on
the 18th as far as the 19th is concerned
I might pick up the by by pores pressed
anti-aging finishing powder this retails
for $14.50 50% off
origins I'm skipping on that neither
benefit or origins are cruelty free nor
do I have any desire to try those but
the it cosmetics 5 by pores press powder
is interesting I do like the loose one
but I feel like my ELF HD setting powder
the silica powder does the same thing
but this guy is really really easy to do
the buffing technique with or touch it
touching up your makeup throughout the
day so I might pick that up and that is
preemptively on my wish list now on the
20th we have the Clinique three-step
introduction kit which is on sale the
juice beauty stem cellular anti-wrinkle
moisturizer as well as the pure 4 in one
pressed mineral foundation I hate this I
know that who is it
Samantha loves us samantha loves this
powder i hate it it does not
work for me
I never thought that the Clinique 3-step
system worked well for me it when I was
not cruelty free and as far as juice
video is concerned I've never tried this
out but I don't need a new moisturizer
right now so I will be skipping on all
of those as well
recommendation if you do have more oily
skin you might like the foreign one
press mineral foundation but I'm just
personally not a fan it was a little too
cakey on my skin
alright guys on let's see here the 21st
or which is going to be Wednesday the
Smashbox photo finish primer water will
be $16 I will be picking up 3 or 4 of
these
I love these matchbox photo finish
primer water I really want to pick up
these scented ones while they are still
on sale as far as the persona identity
eyeshadow palette is concerned I'll be
skipping that I have heard good things
about this brand though
and then the Proactiv emergency blemish
relief or skin smoothing exfoliator I
have other things that can treat my
pimples as at the moment but the
Smashbox photo finish primer water you
guys is so good it really does make up
my makeup last longer throughout the day
so that is definitely a recommendation I
would definitely I definitely personally
think you guys should look into that now
on Thursday we have let's see here Oh
we've got the Bucks info on lip creams
which will be $10 apiece Clarisonic and
me a to a cleansing system as well as
the Aiko eyeliners I've never tried that
Clarisonic is just okay but I much
prefer my Michael tada Beauty Sonicare
cleansing system because they are
technically cruelty free and then buxom
right here full-on lip creams I recently
got sent quite a few of these for PR
they are great they are really really
great they do pump they do moisturize
and they do nourish in my opinion not
sticky a really really nice on the lips
oh yeah I would say on Thursday I would
definitely recommend you guys look in it
to this baby right here now on Friday
we've got the Urban Decay eye shadow
singles on sale for $10 apiece in the
exuberance performance peel which I
don't know what that is the dr. Brandt
pores no more never thought that was
that great this is the pore refining
primer I tried that out when I wasn't
cruelty free didn't love it and then
velour lashes never have tried those I'm
not really a lash girl but the Urban
Decay eyeshadow singles are cool if you
have a particular color that you're
really drawn to I would say go ahead and
pick one of them up and just avoid the
glitter infused one alright guys moving
into week 2 we have the it cosmetics
foundation compact as well as the brush
the professional from benefit and the
Mallee face defender I don't like any of
these products Mally face defender I
have this and I don't understand or know
how to use it and then the benefit
Porefessional I feel like you can get
other silicone based primers for cheaper
at the drugstore also cruelty free
options like Smashbox which are just as
good so none of those for me on March 26
they will have the Ultra therapy lip
butter as well as the facial radiant
intensive peel from first aid beauty I'm
skipping on those the Becca backlight
priming filter also skipping on that I
know a ton of people love this but I
feel like it leaves a very artificial
cast on the skin if you've been wanting
to jump on it right now would be the
time to get it or at least on Monday
March 26 that would be the time to get
it because it's gonna be 50% off and
then the Lancome Hypnose drama mascara
which is a gorgeous mascara however it
is not cruelty free so not purchasing
that and in the derma Kuato
what is that intense feat vitamin C for
like acid peel or something I'll be
passing on that as well now this I'm
very interested in this is Campari this
is their coconut melt what is it like a
makeup melt away sort of cleanser I've
had my eye on this for a while I know
that a lot of people say just use
regular coconut oil but I heard that
this rinses off cleaner
khari is a vegan and cruelty-free brand
so I'm thinking of picking that up now
as far as that blush is concerned I
believe that that is from Stila these
are their convertible colors they are
sheer lip and cheek tints I have tried a
few of those before never thought they
were that great they're very very sticky
on the skin however the lorac pro
contour palette I've heard is amazing it
does retail for $45 it will be $20 I
might pick that up but I really don't
need any other face contour palettes
right now so actually I'm talking myself
out of that if you want a good
contouring palette though and you want
something with intense pigmentation I
have swatch this before and it's crazy
and then here we have the say Tropez in
shower gradual tanning lotion I've never
tried that I believe st. Tropez is
cruelty free but I love my hemp
self-tanner so I'm going to be passing
on that so that is the 27th as far as
the 28th is concerned we have the
tortoise and double-take eyeliner which
I have never tried if the Estee Lauder
travel site is the travel size advanced
night repair serum and day wear
moisturizer passing on those skin
laundry select cleansers I've no idea if
they are cruelty free brand if you know
let me know down below and then the bare
minerals 5 in 1 BB cream eyeshadows I
have tried a few of these before I tried
using them as like an eye base if you
are someone who really really has
pigmented lids you have a lot of
discoloration these are actually quite
nice they retail for $9.50 a piece on
that particular day it and then when it
comes to the 29th it looks like they're
gonna have the full exposure travel
palette from Smashbox on sale I haven't
heard great things about these I heard
they don't blend very well nearad will
have their acne clarifying cleanser and
anti-aging cleansers on sale for 15 to
$19 I'm not quite sure on your ads
cruelty free status but I do it like the
acne clarifying cleanser and I haven't
tried the anti-aging one but just wanted
to let you guys know I do like the other
and then benefit roller lash and never
thought this was a spectacular mascara I
did try it out when I wasn't cruelty
free and I was not impressed all right
here we have the Lime Crime highlight
palettes these will be on sale for $19 a
piece on Friday March 30th as well as
the melted matte liquefied long-wear
lipsticks from Too Faced and the Peter
Thomas Roth unring gokyo pad these used
to be my favorite too when I was not
cruelty free but I will not be
purchasing these again
they're basically a chaise be a chaise
they have glycolic acid all that sort of
stuff in them you put them on the skin
you let them sit there for about three
to four minutes and then you rinse them
off the Too Faced melted matte liquefied
long wear lips
I know a lot of people love these but
they were way too drying on my lips they
made them look like a little dry
butthole and then here we have the Lime
Crime light ballads and I just do not
support Lime Crime so not bucking by mad
all right here we have the Oprah banana
powder this is going to be on sale on
let's see your Saturday March 31st as
well as the anastacio Beverly Hills brow
Wiz and the Mario Badescu whole entire
brand so I will be going ahead and
purchasing the new lavender water as
well as the green tea and the rose water
so I will be purchasing quite a few
things from Mario Badescu I was debating
whether or not I should pick up the
lavender water just because I do feel
like sometimes my skin is a little
sensitive to lavender but I want to test
it out so we'll be purchasing a few
things from Mario Badescu for sure and I
do want to try out the pressed banana
powder from Oprah maybe I'll get this
instead of the a cosmetic always I feel
like there are much better brow pencils
on the market so passing on that but I
would recommend looking into the Mario
Badescu line for sure and then let's
move into week 3 we have the Ciro vital
HDH I've tried this as human growth
hormone it did nothing for me so
would not recommend I will be purchasing
the dose of colors what is this
marvelous mops palette I have the sassy
siennas and I love it they are
creamy they are buttery this is going to
be on sale for a great price it is only
going to be $16 so would highly
recommend that Perricone indeed this is
the cold plasma collection never have
liked anything from this brand I don't
feel like it does for the skin and
then the bare minerals foundation
primers I feel like are incredibly basic
especially the prime time your April
second we have the butter LONDON glazing
lip glaze and eyeglasses we have the
oil-free broad-spectrum Shiseido
moisturizer or is that the SPF I don't
know and then we have the Platinum Park
Mac instant artistry lip prep nude kits
and the it cosmetics confidence in your
glow heavenly skin one-step wonder brush
I'm gonna try this out I've heard really
really good things about this this is a
weird ass brush but I want this I think
that these are beautiful kind of like
ombre highlight blush and bronzer sort
of palettes I'm also interested in the
eye glosses here I know that I'm not
really a cream kind of girl but I've
heard really good things about the
butter LONDON
eye glosses Shiseido passing on that and
then obviously passing on Mac but would
definitely recommend looking into the
two of those I'm excited and then on
April 5th we had the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion z' my favorite
are at the anti-aging version as well as
the original so I will be picking up one
of those would recommend you look into
those as well
skin Iceland
entik relief eye cream I am not buying
any more eye creams this year but I have
heard good things about those skin
Iceland is a cruelty-free brand and so
is Juice Beauty and they are also
cruelty I'm sorry they're also vegan too
speedy is the stem cellular anti wrinkle
booster serum alright and then here
we've got the Dermalogica delia micro
foliat I've never tried this Dermalogica
has sent a few @pr packages before and I
did like what I got so maybe I will go
ahead and pick that up and the tart is
quick dry matte lip paints are
incredibly incredibly dry and would not
recommend you look into those and then
the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place flawless wear concealer I've never
tried that and I won't be trying that
because they are not cruelty free and
finally on these sevens we have bee
philosophy peels on sale the Too Faced
better than sex the Mac prep and prime
and Benefit Cosmetics I know a lot of
people are gonna go for the Mac prep and
prime but honestly I would recommend
going for the Smashbox photo finish
primer water I really feel like it does
something it can be a primer as well as
a setting spray I will be picking up a
new Too Faced better than sex mascara
because I do enjoy it quite a bit so
would recommend that for 11:50 and then
the other two I would not so anyway guys
