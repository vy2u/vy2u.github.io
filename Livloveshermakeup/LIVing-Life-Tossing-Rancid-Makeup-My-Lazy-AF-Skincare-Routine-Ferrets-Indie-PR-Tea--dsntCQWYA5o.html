in bed currently and my hair is filled
with oil I put rosehip seed oil on my
scalp last night I thought I would go
ahead and do a little vlogging thing for
you guys today I need to go and pick up
my DSLR camera at my dad's place and I
don't know if I will vlog for that I
want to get up a regular video today as
well but if I don't there will be a new
video up tomorrow there will not be a
fails and holy grails for the next two
weeks or a shot my stash because I'm
leaving on Thursday I am at the maid of
honor and my best friend or Rachelle's
wedding and if she's not getting married
anytime soon but I need to go ahead and
pick out and my maid of honor dress we
need to pick out her wedding dress so
I'm going to visit her in Michigan for a
whole week so I am trying to get as much
pre filming done as I can sometimes I'm
really good with pre filming and
sometimes I'm stuck with pre
filming so we shall see you should I
wash my hair today so I put oil in it
last night I don't need to go anywhere
today should I just put like dry shampoo
hmm okay I just put like 5 pounds of dry
shampoo in my hair so I hope it looks
better I'm doing my quick skincare like
lazy as routine and that I have
been doing probably about the past two
weeks I've just been so tired and so not
really motivated in the morning so I've
been using basically three different
products which normally I use like 6 or
7 so first I go in with the Burt's Bees
at my stellar three-in-one cleansing
solution and as you guys can see there
is residual makeup from yesterday on
here which is disgusting I've been
trying out a different oil based
cleanser and clearly it's not taking my
makeup off at night so that's gross so
this will always be step one and I just
go ahead and run this all over my face
with an organic a cotton pad or a cotton
I am looking into getting some of those
biodegradable reusable cotton drums from
Etsy let me know if there's a specific
shop that you guys purchase from but
yeah the next few products are just the
Josie Maran Argan infinity nope whipped
argan oil face butter this is the juicy
mango scent it smells really good and
then I'm just gonna mix in a little bit
of rose hip seed oil and I will take
this all over my face my neck my
decollete as well as around my eyes and
neither of these products are irritating
I feel like if I'm just getting up in
the morning and I gotta get out the door
really quickly the last thing I want to
do is you know toner and all that kind
of stuff I just want a nice hydrating
base so that my makeup sits Butte
my skin's Relic alright skincare is on
and you can already see I just look
brighter and a little more refreshed and
obviously the a moisturize asian from
the erosive seed oil as well as the
josie maran which smells so good
by the way i just kind of plumps up my
skin and gives a little more of a glow
and then also if i'm running really late
or something i don't have to put primer
on because this is a nice kind of sticky
or tacky base so I just added in the
three drops of that and I kind of
scooped into the Josie Maran when I take
like a little I would say quarter sized
amount I don't like that you have to dip
your hand in there it's a little
unsanitary but that's my lazy as
skin isn't he I am having a Zetas Oh
Refresh mint it's an invigorating herbal
infusion of peppermint and spearmint
dressed up with a pinch of tarragon it's
super good and I have it in my little
Grand Canyon Railway mug so the Tazo I
think I ordered this off of Amazon I
know a lot of you have been asking me if
I have like an updated teas lisore what
currently are my favorites I used to do
a tea time little live series so that's
why we're talking about this recently I
have been really into the super super
sweet teas so I love the country peach
fashion as well as the black cherry
berry and also watermelon lime zinger
from celestial Seasonings and then I do
have it quite a few at different Teavana
teas back here that I've been taking
some progress on I know that Giovanna is
closing it down but I absolutely adore
their peach tranquility T it is so
 good
so those are two that I've been enjoying
and then also this is a ongoing favorite
to be Tazo apricot vanilla creme and
this is the white tea it has a little
bit of caffeine so if you don't want
caffeine don't get this and that oh hi
do you want to jump in the shower he
absolutely loves to shower up here he
loves to go in the showers that is
Phillippi but badger especially loves it
ferrets are related to otters so they
naturally have kind of like this ability
in the water I've never really stained
badger like full-on swim
I have seen police in full-on sweaty
shoes
so anyway you sit in there I'll wet sir
don't chew on that
better don't you on that yes sir you're
so cute you are I'm gonna get ya
I'm gonna get you gonna get you little
fluffball
oh he's excited look at him flippin
better don't hurt yourself
alright guys I get asked all the time
how do I know when my makeup has turned
how do I know when it's gone bad and
what do you do with makeup that has gone
bad if they are as far gone as these
guys right here my suggestion is to
always go ahead and toss them I know a
lot of people you know keep mascara
tubes open for more than six months I
know people use foundations and
eyeshadow palettes longer than their
expiration date the three things that
really stand out to me when my products
have gone bad are first of all a change
in scent a second is a change in texture
and also color so let's go ahead and
jump right into it this is a Maybelline
matte lipstick the shade is called touch
of spice there's a little bit of texture
going on here and as you can see at the
bottom we have some tiny little sports
and those little spores right there are
probably just a build up of a
bacteria and disgustingness I've had
this in my collection for well over two
and a half years so anytime you notice
that one of your more moist makeup
products has little spores like that on
it it's time to go here we have some
covergirl blushes other people wouldn't
be able to tell the difference between
this and hardpan but this is a build up
of not only just a brush hitting the
surface of this product many times it's
also as you guys can see a little tiny
bubble sort of like the little spores on
the lipstick and it's not hard pan like
I said I have scraped off the hard pan
on here and I really thought this was a
horrible piece of hard pan at one point
but I have noticed that these just do
not blend out on my cheeks the way they
used to is a clear indicator that your
product has gone bad so both of those
blushes are going to be tossed out here
is an example of color change this is
the Smashbox photo-finish
hydrating under eye primer it used to be
a really really kind of pinky salmony
color and it has completely turned white
luckily I did kind of finish that off
before I had to throw it and then here's
a really good example of color changing
this is the elf blush and this is one of
their single blushes and the shade is
called pink passion it is supposed to be
all this color do you guys see how it's
like this whitish color than kind of a
salmon color and then a dark pink and
that is a clear clear indicator that
this product is way past its due Amy
from touch of glam Beauty sent over
another PR package for me with some new
products so these are highlighters as
well as I believe they can be eyeshadow
so I will double check with her on if
they are ice safe or not but
and this is a gold shade it's called a
pot of gold is that what it's called
yeah pot of gold it reminds me of the
Breanna highlight and then this one
right here is by me diamonds which has a
little bit of a shift to it so it kind
of has like a greenish undertone and
then you guys can see it flashes silver
it is so freakin gorgeous I also have
these tiny little liquid illuminators it
says drenched in is that lead or
something like that I think that's what
it says and then this one is Pixy poison
so shake well before use let's watch
these all right so that is Pixy poison
on the top so pretty and then there's
the goldish greenish one have a little
bit of glitter in it and these are kind
of based in an oil so it will be
interesting to see if I can work these
into my routine I would probably add
something like this to my foundation to
give myself like a strong glow or maybe
I would use it as highlight even though
I'm not the biggest fan of liquid
highlights as you guys know so anyway
I'm super excited like I said she also
sent over for more highlighters and then
a buxom I'm not gonna show you guys
everything they sent over because they
are very very very kind and sweet when
they send me PR but they did add on some
new shades to their buxom full-on plump
lip balms and these are crazy this is a
product I did not know existed but this
is a huge huge lip balm this is in the
shade fiery and then they also sent over
a nude as well as kind of like a plummy
color I'm gonna bring the plumy one and
the new one at two Rachelle because I
think she would like those so when I go
to visit her I will bring those and then
these are the new shiny liquid lipsticks
in the tropical collection I believe and
they are very pretty lots of bold bold
colors this first one right here is
called guava kiss that first one is
guava kiss and then this kind of a warm
toned reddish coral color is called
paradise found I really do like these
shiny liquid lipsticks I did to see that
they have added on some new shades so
very excited for those a PR product put
my makeup on now and then my dad is
going to come and pick me up with my
far-far or my grandpa so that will be
fine and I think we're just gonna kind
of hang out today so it's gonna be a
very very chill laid-back day later when
I get home I am going to do some laundry
and probably some pre filming so anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
