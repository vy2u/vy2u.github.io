channel and welcome back to look of the
week or where I recreate either of my
most requested makeup look that I have
been wearing this week or I actually
recreate my personal favorite one today
we're gonna be going with my personal
favorite look that I was wearing this
week which is really nice kind of glowy
skin rosy cheeks a kind of like red or
raspberry lip and also a little bit of a
nice I wouldn't call it like a peachy
smoky eye but just a little bit of
definition around the eye area so anyway
let's go ahead and get started I'm sorry
if I sound really tired I literally just
woke up I am doing a bunch of
pre-filming as I'm filming this it's
actually Thursday morning so you guys
have probably seen me in this outfit now
for about four days are you both
swimming this outfit for about four days
Tom's parents are coming to visit us for
Thanksgiving so I'm trying to get some
filming done and what else did I want to
say oh yes this whole entire makeup look
if you guys watch shop and swatch my
stash this week you know that I am using
a hundred percent drugstore items so
yeah that is what we are doing today so
let's jump right into it the first item
that I am going to use is my wet and
wild coverall primer and I'm going to
take this and apply it all over my face
as my actual base so I'm going to take
about a pea-sized amount of this I am
running very low on this so and that is
the amount I'm going to take let's go
ahead and just apply that all over the
face I really do like this primer I just
wish that it wasn't so tacky and sticky
but I think that's what makes it so good
and it does kind of dry down to a
powdery finish it's actually a really
really cool consistency also if you hear
things in the background I have our
rumbas on because one Khosla we're
getting ready for gasp so I just want to
make sure everything is super clean so
I'm going to let them go a while I film
this alright moving on the next thing
I'm gonna do is go ahead and put on my
eye base I have been using my Maybelline
and master prime long lasting eye shadow
base and if there's a shade 510 or 515
this week and this is the lightest one I
think it's called 510 but they have like
four different shades so I'm not quite
sure when I took the label off
everything else came off wasn't of
course so really don't know but that is
what it looks like if you guys are
curious and I'm just gonna go ahead and
blend that in quickly with my finger
kind of doing patting motions I love
this I base it is so beautiful these
really
Saten me look to the lids which I really
enjoy and I know a lot of you enjoy us
while a lot of you have said that you
had picked this up since I have been
raving about it and that you really
liked it too so I'm so happy to hear
that
alright moving on let's go ahead you can
jump right into a foundation so the
foundation whoo it's all wet why is it
wet the foundation I have been using
this week is the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte foundation the shade that I wear
is called 1:01 classic ivory I am also
running very low on this so oh it just
came out a lot nevermind I shook it well
but I'm kind of running low on this and
I'm gonna take about this much on the
back of my hand usually about a
pea-sized amount or a quarter size
amount I guess today we are taking a
little more and I am going to go in with
let's see here this morphe flat top
kabuki foundation brush I just like to
go into the product and then just start
wiping in kind of downward motions onto
my skin you can also go ahead and
distribute it onto your face first and
then do this but this particular brush
will really picks it up nice and evenly
because it is a flat top kabuki so I
don't mind just kind of swirling it onto
or directly onto the brush from my hands
so I'm just doing kind of downward as
swiping motions I adore this foundation
I've talked about it so many times
before it is just one of my all-time
favorites and I really like the way it
applies with this particular brush I
feel like it weighs really nicely with a
very soft brush and this one is just
very very soft alright and then I'm
gonna take a little bit more just being
careful cuz I know I'm running low on
this I'm just gonna take a little bit
more and I will take that with my
fingers and then kind of dot it along
the areas where I'm breaking out a
little bit I talked about it pretty much
all week but I am breaking out right now
because of the Luna 4 Rayo mini
hopefully by the time you guys are
watching this on Saturday I am no longer
purging but I'm just tapping that onto
areas where I am purging a little more
and we are just going to go ahead and
stipple it on so we can really keep that
coverage right there alright next we're
gonna go ahead and go in with our first
concealer yes I said my first and seller
becuase I've been breaking out so I want
to kind of
right underneath my eyes and then we
will go in and do actually let's go
ahead and do spot concealing first that
makes more sense I'm gonna be using my
Maybelline master concealed by face
studio camouflaging concealer in the
shade number ten at fairs and I'm also
running low on this phone I'm running on
all my drugstore products so I'm gonna
really shake this up and then take out
just a little bit here and we're just
gonna spot conceal on the areas where I
do have some little breakouts mostly on
my forehead but also around my nose area
a little bit and on my chin so I'm just
gonna go ahead and do that and then I
will take let's see here I guess I'll
take this more feet no you know what
I'll take this little guy right here
this is the LC LC this is the alpha
selfie blurring brush that's why I
wanted to say LC no became a healthy
selfie blurring brush and I am just
going ahead and kind of stamping that on
to the skin if this particular concealer
doesn't have that much coverage I do
prefer it underneath my eyes but it's
actually really nice match for my skin
tone right now so I thought I would use
it as my actual spot concealer now we
are gonna go underneath the eyes it kind
of brightened up a little bit with the
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser this is a knee brightener
version make it this on my chin down the
bridge of my nose do a little bit up
here and then also on my eyelids and of
course underneath my eyes in a little
v-shape all the way to the bottom of my
nose here I love this concealer I feel
like I'm using a lot of Maybelline
products yeah I am it's kind of weird
anyway I love this concealer it
brightens up so so so nicely and we need
a little more over here I just love the
way it looks on my skin and even if you
are fair complected and this seems to
blend in really nicely do a little I'm
gonna keep it slow as well but I'm gonna
take this clean morphe angled foundation
brush and I'm just gonna kind of dab
this and so that it is completely
blended you can also do stippling
motions I like this because it blends it
really really quickly and it is angled
so it gets underneath the eye but yeah
so I've been going for a little bit of a
heavier happier look on the face this
week but that's just mostly because I
haven't breaking out so bad but like
they said hopefully by the time you guys
are watching this my little
breakouts have subsided from the Luna
because they do think it's a nice
product I just don't like the purging
how can I say same thing happened with
me with my Clarisonic you guys actually
my Clarisonic I feel like it was like
two and a half or three weeks so
hopefully this will be quicker alright
so that is kind of our safe space let's
go ahead and set that in I have been
using my ELF tone correcting powder in
the shade cool this week to go ahead and
set that in so I'm gonna take this
morphe and be 3:9 a brush just a really
nice chunky kabuki sorta brush and I am
just going to go ahead and stipple this
on to the skin you guys know this is my
preferred method of setting everything
in with a really nice densely packed
brush and I just like to stipple it on
so that it looks really nice and
seamless with my foundation I will say
my combo skin has started to get a
little more on the dry side like I'm
noticing it sucks because right now I'm
having like you know a little bit of
breakouts but I'm noticing I also I'm
having some dry patches and I'm like oh
that's lovely the combination of the two
is really not that fun not that fun a
bud
sometimes like smack in the middle of
winter you guys will see that I don't
actually powder my entire face because I
do get that dry it's crazy it is crazy
alright to go underneath my neck and
then a little bit blended into my ears
and we shall move on alright let me wipe
down my lips quickly because you guys
know me I'm messy and I get stuff all
over my lips I really should just avoid
this area like when I'm stifling my
product on but for whatever even I doubt
okay moving on let's go ahead and jump
into a bronzer so I've been using my ELF
golden bronzer this week I really adore
this bronzer it is beautiful this is
what it looks like you have four
different tones here and I just like to
go in with this little guy right here
this is the flawless face brush this is
from bare minerals I like to just go in
there swirl around the product top it
off and then I'm just gonna hit the
outer perimeters of my face really nice
and lightly this has been giving me
beautiful kind of glowy skin this week
and nothing too crazy you know it has
really nice color to it and I just like
I like that the pigmentation isn't too
crazy too because you really can just
get a nice a dusting of glow eNOS if you
do have a very fair complexion like me
alright so let's go into blush now I am
going to be using the L'Oreal True Match
super blendable blush in the cool
version this is called c-56 rosy outlook
and this is what the actual color looks
like it's beautiful taking up my up and
up a blusher brush I'm going to tap into
there tap off the excess just a little
bit and start working that onto the
apples of my cheeks you really don't
have to tap this off of these are super
super blendable and not super pigmented
so it's kind of nice to build them up on
the skin but I'm just kind of smiling a
little bit and then applying that to the
apples of my cheeks then to blend that
in just a little bit I like to go back
with my powder brush and just kind of
stipple around it to make sure there are
no harsh lines and then we are gonna go
ahead and highlight our things so the
highlighter that I have been using this
week is from wet &amp;amp; wild this is the mega
glow highlighting gold bar in the shade
I believe it's just called the
Goldilocks this is what it looks like
we're gonna take our Sigma let's see
here tapered highlighter f-35 brush I'm
just gonna tap into that product kind of
swirl back and forth and go right onto
my cheekbone here oh I love the way that
this looks I am going a little heavier
with this product on the cheekbones but
that won't be go down the bridge of the
nose and also keep saying a lot we go
down the bridge of the nose I'm going to
tap off the excess then hit very lightly
on the chin as well because it is
technically darker than my skin but you
can't tell on the cheekbone but towards
the flat surfaces you definitely can
tell so just dusting that lightly and
then really building it up here and I'm
almost just like not even going on the
cheekbone I'm kind of just like hidden
my whole damn face but it just looks
beautiful I love the way that this took
on the skin so
after that I'm just going to stipple
over again with our powder brush down
the bridge of our nose and on our chin
and we shall boot into the eyes actually
let's go ahead and do brows first so I'm
gonna be using my Maybelline brow drama
pomade kranj in the blonde version this
is what I've been using all week I'm
just going to go ahead and fill in the
front part of my brows let me get my
little mirror here I'm just filling into
the front part of my brows this is what
I've been doing pretty much all week
there was a day in the middle where I
did fill in like the inner part of my
brows as well but I just love live this
brow product I think it looks amazing
and beautiful and I have no idea where
my spoolie went which is great because
obviously that's sarcasm I need to brush
these out I guess I'll have to do that
off-camera but yeah I really love what
this product does for my brows really
like it I will brush them off camera
after we are done let's go in with our
eyeliner I have been using a Z let's see
here Maybelline master drama by eye
studio studio yeah and you shade a
midnight master this week this is a
beautiful beautiful eye liner I am going
to go ahead and put it on to my kind of
doing the two thing so I like to tight
line by going like this I go on to my
waterline then close my eye and then
gently go back and forth so that I'm
hitting my tight line that's just
personally how I like to do my tight
line I know a few of you were asking
about how I do my tight line that is how
I just closed my eye I go into my
waterline I close my eye and then I
gently go back and forth it looks like
it's it hurts but it doesn't at all
especially you have a very soft pencil
so anyway I lined my tight line and s on
my waterline let's go ahead and get
right into I shadow shall we alright so
for eyeshadow this week I have been
using my covergirl two naked roses
palette so this is what it looks like I
love this palette the first thing we are
gonna do is take this shade right here
I'm gonna take my wet and wild crease
brush just going to tap into there and
then we are gonna hit from the lid all
the way up to the brow just as a nice
kind of base color you also can go
underneath the eye for a little extra
brightness and then using the same brush
we're gonna take the kind of light
bobby shade at this
right here and we're going to tap into
that we are going to tap off the excess
defenses are quite powdery and lightly
I'm just gonna work that back and forth
into the crease and it's okay if it goes
down onto the lid as well this is just
going to be our transition shade just
going back and forth and doing a little
bit of circular motions as well all
right next we are going to go into the
shade right here I wish they had they
used to have names for these I thought
there was like a sticker but I took it
off this is the shade that I will be
going into my crease with and I am just
going to be taking it this little guy
this is a morphe m5 11 I'm tapping into
their very lightly tapping off the
excess and then we're just gonna start
building that into the crease these are
very powdery but they do build up in
nicely and just have to keep keep
building if you want a lot of color
payoff so just going really lightly back
and forth into the crease and building
that color up I love this brush because
it blends as you go which is awesome so
I enjoyed that and then with a cleaner
brush I'm going to take my let's see
here morphe m5 13 I'm just gonna go back
and forth and blend everything from the
lid all the way to the upper crease area
back and forth motions I haven't been
doing anything too crazy with the
eyeshadow this week I just like a nice
kind of defined eye and I think that
this palette is correct for that so I
have an enjoyment quite a bit alright
moving on let's go ahead and take you
should foil onto our lid yeah I think
that's what I was doing it this week for
that way I look that I was lucky was I
using that I think I was so I'm going to
take this little morphe guy right here
this is technically a what is it it's
technically like a concealer brush I'm
just gonna foil it down with my ELF
illuminating mist and set and then I'm
going to tap into I can't remember who
super powdery I can't remember if I was
feeling this shade or this shade onto my
lid but we're gonna go
the lighter one so I'm going to pick
that up onto the brush and then we are
just going to go ahead and tap that on
to the lid and kind of blend it few of
you were asking me with foiling I do my
shadows ever get like a little bit of
hard pan
I personally that problem has not
happened to me yet just because you're
not like making it super wet you're just
getting it damp but you also can go
ahead and spray your brush first and
then go I'm sorry you can pick up the
product first and then spray your brush
which I do actually most of the time I
don't know why I just did it that way or
camera but that's what it is I'm just
gonna putting that on it to the lid
lightly it was that what I was not
kidding I'm not verbally but I was
wearing eye makeup wise I was mostly
just focusing on my skin and my lips
this week alright then taking it that
morphe brush again and kind of blending
it next we are gonna go in with and this
little so for a dual I did a lip brush I
know kind of crazy and we are gonna take
the same shade that we went into our
crease with this guy and I am just going
to go ahead and put this onto my lower
lash line it can be kind of sloppily
doesn't really matter because we are
going to go ahead and blend it out just
for a little bit of added definition
that's the best way that I would
describe it and then to blend that I
will be taking my Coastal Scents are no
BRC Soh brush and I'm just going to go
back and forth alright and that's pretty
much all I've been doing with eyeshadow
let's go ahead and do our that I was
necessary let's now let's go ahead into
our mascara first I've been using my
comp clump crusher I could never say
that right by lash blast this is just
the original version I'm going to go
ahead and put that on to my lashes one
coat of this and then I've been going in
with my L'Oreal telescopic which I
really have been enjoying as well it
doesn't give me like super crazy awesome
to find lashes but it still looks nice I
mean it gives me defined lashes doesn't
give me like clumpy lashes which I
normally like alright so one layer of
the lash blast and then we will do one
layer of the L'Oreal
let's go ahead and get that so here is
the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black ooh
it does give a lot of length I will say
this little wand is so nice and precise
should have probably curled my lashes I
have not been into curling my lashes I
think I said this in my last look at the
week video like I don't know why that I
have not been into curling my lashes
lately it just feels like an extra step
that I don't want to do alright so after
we have done that we're just going to go
ahead and put our lip color on and then
that is it is a relatively quick look
has been taking about 10 minutes to
complete this week can never get this
frickin mascara back in the wands but
yeah it's been taking about 10 minutes
to do this I look and my guest 20
minutes on camera cuz I'm talking but
very quick relatively quick release
alright wipe down the lips and I will be
taking my Revlon lip butter in the shade
a raspberry pie and I'm going to apply
this to my lips kind of didn't dotting
it on a little bit I'm going like that
you have to be careful with these
because they do go outside of the lip
line I'll try and fix a little bit of
that quickly right after I do this you
can already see it's going that way now
a lot of people a lot of you guys
complain about the fact that I do this
and it goes over my top lip line hello
you various like I don't know how many
times I have to say boss I'm a
professional flutist so no matter what
when I pick my flute up it's gonna go
outside of my lip line anyway so that is
why I do that if you were curious whoo
so anyway I'm taking a q-tip and just
kind of cleaning up that lip line and
that is it guys so that is look of the
week this has been on my favorite look
that I have been wearing on my face this
week let me know what you think down
below I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you tomorrow
