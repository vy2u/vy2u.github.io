my channel today we are doing a look of
the leaked look at the week is where I
obviously a very casual style put on a
full face of makeup for you guys they
either recreate my most requested makeup
look I was wearing this week or my
personal favorite now we are going with
my personal favorite this week because
the whole like shot my stash theme this
week was picking out Holy Grail makeup
products that I've been really really
obsessed with lately so that is why we
are going to recreate my current Holy
Grail face of makeup so anyway let's go
ahead and jump right into it I have
already toned my skin and I did put on
some serum now I'm gonna go in with the
collab glow and mega illuminating
moisturizer in the shade a nude glow I
just wanted to show you guys what this
actually looks like on my skin because a
few of you were asking me yesterday in
my skincare video so that is what it
looks like on the inside I'm just gonna
take a nice amount of this as you guys
can see and I'm going to go ahead and
apply this all over my face even around
my eye area
I like the DISA mooster Isis but mostly
I like that it gives a little bit of
something back to my skin you know it
doesn't make it look as dull it
definitely makes your skin look
illuminated and the more you apply the
more glow you do get so give this
applying this and ramping it into my
skin it is by no means like the best
moisturizer on earth in fact sometimes I
feel like it actually is not enough
moisture for my skin personally but it
is still really beautiful and I do enjoy
it and then around my eye area I am just
tapping lightly and then I'm taking just
a tiny little bit onto my eyelids I've
been trying to be better lately about
not like beating the out of my face
when I apply my makeup I just move fast
you guys know that's I'm trying my best
not to be like super super aggressive
but yeah so that is what's the mega
illuminating moisturizer looks like on
the skin if you were ever curious it's
really really beautiful it's a nice way
to like start before putting on your
makeup you know what I mean I'm still
gonna be going in with a primer but this
also works really nicely it's kind of
like illuminating primer so let's go
ahead and let that sink in for a couple
seconds here and now I'm gonna go in
with my primers I do have an eye primer
that I chose this week as well as a face
primer the eye primer is from Maybelline
it's my all-time favorite eye primer it
the Maybelline master prime long-lasting
eyeshadow base this is what it looks
like we are just going to go ahead and
take some of this product on it to the
eyelid all the way up to the brow I also
do take it a little bit in the inner
corner of my eye because I don't know if
you guys can tell it but this particular
eye primer does have a little bit of
luminosity to it as well so what pear is
very very nicely with the mecca
illuminating moisturizer from glam glow
and to blend that in I'm just gonna take
this a morphe angled concealer brush
right here and I am just going to go
ahead and kind of stamp that on to the
skin again I'm doing it this way instead
of tugging it with my finger because I'm
trying my best not to like we're at my
face off rip my skin off so anyway this
video is probably going up super late
you guys I I woke up this morning
because Tom had to go to work so I woke
up at 7:00 and I couldn't go back to
sleep so I called my friend or Rochelle
we talked for a few hours talked to my
friend talked to my friend my mom no
talk to my mom who obviously is my
friend my best friend talked to my mom
and then we did go ahead and like
FaceTime my dad as well or i FaceTime my
dad and that was fun it's nice to keep
in touch with the parents I feel like
I'm a really bad daughter sometimes and
I just never called them so of course a
FaceTime with my dad and then I went
back to bed and now I'm up and it is
literally like 3 o'clock when I'm doing
up my makeup so I'm guessing this video
probably won't be up until like 7 or 8
o'clock tonight but that is okay I'm
gonna try and put the actual quality of
the video down so that it will upload a
little quicker
usually when you upload at 1080p well
not like it takes forever to upload so
I'm gonna put it down - I think 720p I
hope you guys don't mind anyway here is
the YSL - she clawed this is a beautiful
beautiful blurring primer I'm gonna take
this BH Cosmetics flat-topped kind of
it's like a synthetic almost stippling
brush I got this like it was like a free
purchase or something or a free gift
with purchase I'm taking two pumps of
that and I'm going to go ahead and put
this on to my face is my actual primer
and this is going to take away a little
bit of the luminosity and shine that we
did guess from the mega illuminating
moisturizer but it won't take away
everything this actually does have a
little
particles in it as well so really nice
glowy skin this week and I did take one
more pump to work on to my forehead area
this stuff smells amazing it does have
like the consistency of the maybelline
baby skin and it really does completely
smooth out your skin which I really
enjoy all right now let's go ahead and
jump into some color correcting I have
been color correcting this week Easter
is next week and these little guy always
reminds me of Easter eggs for some
reason they are the Urban Decay Naked
skin color correcting fluids in a
lavender pink and yellow so first I'm
gonna take the lavender shade and what
I'd like to do with this is kind of go
around areas where my skin is a little
more yellow I definitely get discolor
during lupus flare ups around the
outside of my mouth and also this color
corrector is really really nice for kind
of helping fill in fine lines and
wrinkles as well and then I have a
little bit of Salamis over here I don't
know why after this last layer if I was
just left with like you know a little
bits of like melasma things like that so
again right here at the tops of the
cheekbone as well just gonna put a
little of that lavender and then I'm
gonna go in with the yellow shade and I
really like to take this on my eyelid so
I'm just gonna take probably about one
not one that was like sixteen swipes
onto my eyelid I'll if I'm like it's
just one no that's like five I'm gonna
take a few swipes of that onto my eyelid
and then I do go in with the pink shade
and I like to work this one underneath
my eyes and I'm just gonna go ahead and
kind of apply that right there I don't
need too much color correcting under my
eyes this week I haven't been sleeping
that well but I know this discoloration
hasn't been a horrible underneath my
eyes so anyway I feel like it was like a
little kitty cat now let's go ahead and
blend that in with the Ulta damp Beauty
sponge make sure I bring this out so
this is what it looks like and I am just
going to go ahead and blend those color
correctors in I love the sponge and I do
you want to do like a battle of the
SpongeBob's before you guys like where I
talk about battle of the Spongebob
little SpongeBob's for you guys where I
talk about my favorite Beauty sponges
that aren't the Beauty Blender I do not
think the Beauty Blender is worth that
you guys for twenty dollars I used to
purchase it and now I don't
so anyway if you guys would like to see
that def when let me know down below
anyway I'm just going ahead and blending
that in
you guys can see that kind of helped
with a little bit of color correction I
don't have too much red tones in my skin
right now maybe a few I mean it's just
not horrible you know what I mean so I'm
not going in with anything green but
yeah that is pretty much it now we're
gonna go ahead and take the Armani the
luminous selca foundation this is what
it looks like and I'm going to be taking
three pumps of this I already shaved it
number two by the way excuse me I wear
the shade and number two by the way I'm
just taking three pumps of this right
onto the sponge if you don't want to be
sponge to absorb too much product or if
you do have time you don't want to be
lazy like I am right now I would
recommend going ahead and just dotting
it on to your face with your actual
fingers and then blending in with your
sponge but for me personally I just I
can't be bothered to do that right now
and for some reason there's something
about the contact between the sponge and
this particular foundation that I feel
like really emulsifies them nicely when
you apply it this way like I said you
can also just dot it on with your
fingers and then blend in with a sponge
that way you won't lose as much product
but I don't know I really like the way
this looks so just going ahead and
blending that on to the skin taking a
little bit around the eye area and I
really do love this foundation you guys
a few of you were saying that it's not
similar to the charlotte tilbury magic
foundation the show little berry magic
foundation was the next one I wanted to
try out because I am trying to find a
cruelty-free Dupre you guys on this
because it's just so stunning on the
skin you know and I mean I've combo skin
it does start to get a little oily on me
towards the end of the day it's not
something I'm gonna be able to wear
during the summer time but I really have
been enjoying it well it is a little
cooler out let me go ahead and just wipe
down my lips quickly I always get
foundation all over my lips you guys do
that to it for like when you wear a lot
of face makeup that just happens alright
now we are gonna go in it with concealer
and you definitely don't have to do this
I had two shows this week that's why
maybe my face makeup with a little
heavier but this is the Maybelline
master concealed by face studio this is
their camouflaging concealer in the
shade number 10 of fair and I am just
gonna go ahead and take a nice sized
amount of that and what I like to do is
just go right underneath my eyes take it
kind of down to the sides of my nose and
then a little
as well on my I later and then with that
same sponge I just go ahead and blend it
in this is the product that I am trying
to use up in project pan and I'm almost
done with it it's a nice concealer and
it is a little unlike the moist side so
if you do have dry skin I think you
would enjoy that but it does lean a very
very yellow tone I feel like all of the
Maybelline like foundations and face
products leaden a little dark a little
bit orange or yellow toned and I'm not
yellow toned but is okay also the Armani
luminous stuff does lean a little more
on the yellow tone side as well if you
are curious I am a self tanned and they
self tanner that I do use I think it
asked all the time is the Jergens ultra
glow in fair / light I have like a bunch
left from last summer I stocked up on
them they are probably my favorite self
tanner for sure because I really like
the mousse is very easy it dries very
quickly and it never leaves you looking
a super orange or anything I don't feel
like I look orange I just feel like I
have like a little bit of the olive look
to my skin or yellow look I would rather
be yellow than orange so anyway let's go
ahead and set our face in now I have
been using this powder this week it is
the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 16 hour
powder and like I said this is all about
like my Holy Grail face of makeup I've
been loving it this powder you guys but
I will say it still is too dark for me
I'm taking it on my morphe mb3 9 brush
I'm just gonna go ahead and start around
my t-zone and I just stipple this on to
set my whole face dead I love the finish
of it I think it's beautiful it really
does leave you matte practically all day
I really have to touch up with this but
this is a shade of porcelain and it
still is way too dark for me and it's
just so upsetting cuz that's like I'm
even self tan right now like really a
really L'Oreal I feel like L'Oreal
usually is pretty good with their
foundations and stuff like they've
gotten better with color selection I
feel like they're one of those brands
from the drugstore that has gotten a lot
better with color selection like a lot
of their foundations actually do match
me but Maybelline I'm like why why why
why but yeah this particular powder does
lean at very very yellow tone so just be
aware of that I do have to follow up
with a silica powder just to make sure I
get like a little bit of like a white
cast over my face as you can probably
see there's a little bit of discrepancy
between my face and
right now which I know a lot of you ask
about in videos please also remember
that these lights really zoom in right
on my face not so much the rest of my
body I think that's what a lot of
youtubers I see that comment all the
time and I think it's really important
to remember like the ring light is
around your face it's not around your
neck or your chest unless you're sitting
up on a pillow if you do see that it
looks a little dark here too it's also
just the lighting so anyway let's go
ahead and jump into the Hydra powder now
so like I said I do like to follow up
with the silica powder just to lighten
it a little bit and this is the binary
hyaluronic hydra powder this was sent to
me for PR and I'm almost done with it
which really makes me sad because it is
so so so good so I'm going to go ahead
and tap a little bit into the lid it's
gonna fly all over the place I'm gonna
take this BH Cosmetics fluffy brush
right here so sturdy sorry it's the only
brush I square that it's dirty I
literally dip clean you know my brush is
the night before doing look at the week
so that you guys don't have to wash
dirty brushes on my face because I hate
that I actually did clean my brushes
practically every night after I use them
I'm just figuring like anal retentive
about my brushes so I'm just taking it
and I am just putting little strokes at
this over my face it will gradually
lighten it just a little bit naturally
silica powders do have a little bit of a
white tinge or cast to them which is
very very helpful if you are fair
complected like I am so yeah I basically
just took everything that was in the cap
there and I applied that to the skin
it's also really nice for just kind of
having an extra veil around the skin a
little bit of extra mattifying mists and
then of course it does make your skin
appear a little more smooth and pretty
alright now we're gonna go ahead and
jump right into this baby right here
this is the Jacqueline heel a Becca
champagne collection face palette and
actually what we're going to do is take
this a blush right here from NYX this is
the blush in the shade cinnamon and then
we're gonna take Rose a spritz right
here and top that on top of our cheeks
so first we're gonna go in with the
cinnamon blush from NYX this is what it
looks like taking that same brush that
we applied the actual um silica powder
with I'm just picking it up really
tapping off the excess I'm gonna go
ahead and work that on to the apples of
my cheeks very very
lately like it looks oh we're gonna go
but you have to be careful with this one
because if you don't use a fluffy brush
it will get way way way too much pigment
on a fair-skinned
so I'm just taking a little tiny teensy
bit of that and now we're gonna go in
I'm gonna take my ELF complexion brush
which looks like this I love this brush
and I'm going to take that luminous
flush blush from the palette in the
shade Rose a spritz and we are going to
apply that look that I just dropped that
brush we're gonna have to go with this
one
I'm gonna take rosy spreads and I am
going to apply that to the apples of my
cheeks as well and this will work kind
of as a blush topper but these luminous
flesh blushes still have a lot of
pigment to them so really a blush topper
you've got to be careful that name is
like so not what it is so anyway just
kind of going ahead and stippling that
on being very careful not to get too
much product because these Becca blushes
and the NYX blushes are hella pigmented
if you go in with anything too densely
packed you are screwed especially if you
have fair skin so that's just gonna give
a little bit of a glow to our cheeks and
then I am going to go ahead and a take
the shade of champagne hop in here which
is one of their shimmering skin
perfecter press and I'm going to take
that with my Lexi's 5:22 tapered
highlighter brush I'm going to swirl
into that product and I'm going to apply
that directly to my cheek bone which I
really love it's a glow that this gives
and then of course on the other side I
just kind of blend it in circular
motions and usually I do like to layer
the two I like to do Prosecco pop and
then champagne pop but today it we're
just gonna do a champagne pop because I
feel like we have pinky kind of cheeks
going on champagne pop that's more of
like that peachy iridescent to it
Prosecco pop has more about you yellow
tone to it and it can be very obvious on
fair skin so you have to be careful but
yeah alright so there is our kind of
face makeup you can also take this shade
right here which is called amaretto in
the middle
that makes a beautiful contouring and
bronzing shade on fair-skinned but I
haven't been doing really any contouring
or bronzing let's be honest like when do
I ever contour in bronze I mean I love
bronzers I just recently picked up the
new Beckett ones um two of the sunlit
bronzers which I'm going to have a
comparison for you guys on a Tuesday
against the Physicians Formula more
butter bronzers but at the same time I'm
just like I never contour my face would
do anything like that so all right now
we are gonna do let's go ahead and jump
into our brows so I'm going to take my
revlon colorstay brow pencil in the
shade of blonde I've been doing my brows
a little thicker of this a week but the
main focus has really been to just kind
of fill in the front area so some days
I've been going really thick and then
like yesterday for my show and stuff I
did in so let me show you guys how I do
that
I'm just gonna take the spoolie and kind
of comb them out and then now I'm
filling in the front part of my brow and
this is so hard to do on camera because
I feel like usually when I do this I'm
like really up close with my simple
human mirror remind me next week or
something to show you guys how I do that
really really thick full brow I'm not
gonna do that today I think taun are
going out for dinner and I don't need it
to look at that dramatic but I'm mostly
just kind of filling in the front part
and I really like to kind of start at
the top instead of the bottom because
this one you can see I started kind of
towards the bottom and it looks a little
on the wonky side so really kind of
filling in towards the top here just
makes it look really really nice and you
get that nice definition you get that
thickness and it does anybody else
realize that they look a lot younger
when they have thicker brows like I read
that in a magazine once Oh like you look
younger with thicker brows I never
believed it and then I compared like a
photo of me last week when I wasn't
wearing any sort of brow stuff because
my lupus was not allowing me I have a
lot of eyebrow shedding so I was using
my rapid brow this week and it kind of
cleared the back up but there is a huge
difference between like a thin brow and
a thicker brow you really do you look
younger when you have a thicker brow so
that is a pretty much it I'm just kind
of blending them in they don't have to
be perfect my eyebrows are not even I
think a lot of people's eyebrows are not
even but that is pretty much all I've
been doing definitely let me know next
if you want me to show you like that
full full umbrella I've been doing and
now we are going to jump into some
eyeliner so I'm taking my next slide on
eyeliner in the shade sl0 something as
l16 golden bronze and i'm going to go
ahead and really work this on to my
waterline and you do have to build this
a little bit but it's so worth it
because this is like the prettiest
prettiest prettiest eyeliner shade ever
you guys like when I say prettiest I
mean prettiest and it definitely can get
onto the lower lash line as well it
doesn't have to be perfect but this is
beautiful if you have blue eyes this is
gonna make them pop and don't worry it
may look like I'm hurting myself but I'm
not these are super super soft and
creamy you guys see that like the blue
eyes dress iPhones love that color and
now we're gonna go ahead and jump into
the peanut butter and jelly palette from
Too Faced so the first thing I'm going
to do is take the shade right here which
is called extra creamy it is that white
one and I'm going to be taking my Sedona
lace EP 13 brush I'm going to pick that
up and I am going to go ahead and have
to hat all over my eyelid all the way up
to the bottom part of my brow this is
just gonna be kind of our base color so
that we have a little bit of something
to work with here and then we are gonna
go into the shade spread the love which
I like to use as my transition it is the
first shade in the palette and has a
little bit of a peachy iridescent to it
with the tiny bits of like micro glitter
but it's not really shown on the skin is
that one right there with the same brush
just going right in not gonna tap off
the excess I just start working that
right into the crease it can also go
down onto the eyelid and no worries just
kind of sloppily blending that together
this is how it really does smell good
guys I love it I love it so disappointed
with that peanut butter and honey but
this one I'm like yes yes yes yes
slay me slay me two-faced god I can't
even say slay me without laughing I feel
like that's such an overused word like
ass play yes I'm like yeah I hear that
all over the time like on snapchat and
all that stuff let it like hear you guys
account alright now we're gonna go ahead
and take
let's go in with his he's Sigma e35 I
just realized I think I'm using the same
exact brushes that I did last week I'm
trying to be good and shot my statue of
my brushes every single week so I
apologize but I'm taking my sigma e35
I'm gonna take my favorite shade in the
palette which is that middle one which
is called peanut brittle I'm just gonna
pick that up tap off the excess and I'm
gonna start working that into the crease
love the shade it is just so beautiful
it's like foiled it blends like a
 dream it's just like yes yes
like I said slay me to face now I can't
even say that without like no it's like
one of those things you know you just
can't say certain words like I just
sound wrong when I'm like yeah I can't
do that I can't say slay me and like I
don't even know there's just certain
things that just I can't do it I just
can't do it alright so I'm just working
that into my crease really lightly and
you guys can see this is blending like a
 dream really really beautiful
love this palette now I'm gonna go ahead
and take let's do should we just go in
with our lip color let's build the
peanut-brittle up a little more I've
been doing different variations of this
look all week just because like
everything everything in this palette I
love the only shade that I'm not crazy
about is jelly and I tried to be a
little more crazy about it this week and
I kind of worked it all over my lower
lashline and also on my lid and I
definitely preferred it that way you
have to foil it but like every single
shade in here I love and it's kind of
been the same I look every single day
this week just kind of like a warm I
look and then I pulled in some single
shadows as well which we are about to do
in a second here so after i kind of
blend that in i'm gonna go back to that
i'm Sedona lace brush and we're just
gonna kind of make sure the little area
above the crease looks properly blended
and I want to make sure that I do
maintain that light shade right under
here you don't want that to go bye-bye
cuz I like it alright just realizing
didn't zoom you guys in somebody asked
last week if I would stop zooming you
guys in let me know if you like this or
if you don't like this I don't know why
they wouldn't want me to zoom in um I
don't know I don't know what that's all
about
helpful if you guys could see what I was
doing but anyway now I'm gonna take my
L'Oreal infallible shadow in the shade
amber rush this is what it looks like
I'm gonna take on at my ring finger this
particular shade and I'm going to put it
on to my eyelid you can also foil it but
you really don't need to you can foil it
and put it on with a brush but you just
don't need to this color is beautiful
now sometimes if you just swipe it this
way it's a little chunky and it can kind
of emphasize texture on your actual lid
so make sure that like you're putting it
on but you're also going back and forth
so that you're getting an even amount
everywhere because you don't want any
creasing on your lid I noticed that
these are really creased sometimes so I
don't know that's just me but it does
help to kind of work it back and forth
alright so putting that shade onto the
lid I love that shades that would be a
fall
now I'm gonna go in with the metallic
crushed shadow from Palladio in the
shade Eclipse which looks like this and
I am going to take this little Urban
Decay of Vice double-ended brush I'm
gonna pick it up with this kind of flash
shade or side over here then I'm gonna
spray it down with my skin janae via
post and makeup recovery spray to foil
it and then I'm going to work that onto
my lower lash line I really liked doing
this the other day if you were asking me
like what's on your lower lashline it's
this particular shade and I kind of like
that the crease shade was darker and
this one was actually lighter on the
lower V I'm not lower beyond the lower
lash line cuz normally like you don't do
that but it's me I'm weird I like to do
weird things with my makeup so anyway
just going ahead and I'm kind of smoking
that out down there and then to properly
blend it together so that there are no
issues I'm going to go in but this
little pencil brush here from crown
brushes it's the c5 13 brush and I'm
just going to go ahead and kind of blend
back and forth
it's not the greatest brush for blending
cuz it's a little stiff so why don't we
take the other side of the vise brush
which truly is like a stippling blending
brush I'm just gonna blend alright now
we are going to jump in - um I guess
we'll just jump into mascara I had a
little bit of like
mascara if you this week so what I'm
gonna do is take my L'Oreal carbon black
telescopic mascara I'm gonna apply one
layer of this to my eyelashes and I
guess I'll talk about tomorrow hit my
face and holy grails I tried to combine
this with a mascara this week and it
looked like a mess so I ended up
just wearing one of them at a time and I
thought today we'd go with the L'Oreal I
love this mascara it's beautiful but it
could be a little difficult if you're
layering it with another one especially
if it's like another wet formula because
this one is very wet as well and you do
have to be very careful with this little
brush because although it's very slender
and precise it can still kind of clump
them together especially the lower
lashes if you're somebody who kind of
scoops your lower lashes like I do where
you go like this and then you go
underneath you do have to be careful but
yeah try hearing this together with a
mascara I'll just tell you guys it was
the Lancome Hypnose drama I look like
 it looked horrible I just
could not pull it off it was really bad
so anyway this is kind of taking the
wand the Curt and now making sure
nothing's too clumped together for some
reason this always just clumps my lower
lashes together but it really makes the
upper lashes look nice this has also
been open for yeah I think this one's
been open for over four months so you
know the formula starts to not be as
good the older it gets but yeah that is
pretty much the eye look that I have
been wearing this week now we are gonna
move on to lips the first thing I'm
going to do is line the bottom part of
my lip with the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on lip pencil and you shade naked
I just like to take it right here
because when I do wow you can see that
it didn't sharpen it properly when I do
actually rub my lips together this is
the area where it gets a very sloppy
looking I guess you could say so just do
the bottom parts and now I'm gonna go in
with my Tarte striking lip surgence lip
creme I'm gonna apply this to my lips as
well
how pretty is this color and love this
color and then on top yes I've been
doing three lip products I'm going in it
with my oh man color plus balm in the
shade rosy lips and this will just kind
of make it a little more warm toned and
then I kind of go in with a q-tip and
make sure that it's not too much like
packed up in my Cupid's bow you can also
go ahead and like put your lip liner
there but I just never do so anyway guys
I'm pretty sure that is about it so let
me go ahead and set my face in with
these Scandinavia post makeup recovery
spray this was sent to me for PR I don't
use it as its intended but I just like
it as an actual setting spray and yeah
that is pretty much a look of the week
this is the makeup I've been using this
week this has been a my holy grail of
go-to for like concerts for shows and I
just really really enjoy it so I hope
you guys did enjoy it thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow from up wales and how the
Gredos
