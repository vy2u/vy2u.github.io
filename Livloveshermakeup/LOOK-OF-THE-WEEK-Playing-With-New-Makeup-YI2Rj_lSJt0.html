welcome back to look of the week you can
tell it's look of the week because i
have my headband on and of course my pjs
and this is how i like to do my look of
the week videos because this is how i
look when i do my makeup in the morning
I one of those people that gets makeup
all over me so I never put my clothes on
first and then my makeup I always do my
makeup first and then put my clothes on
but anyway welcome back to look of the
week this is where I recreate either my
personal favorite makeup look I wore
this week or your personal favorite
makeup look that I wore this week so we
are going with your favorite this week
and that was the makeup I was wearing in
my all to follow up haul it was kind of
like a pinkish I like pink eye yeah a
pink eye a little bit of pinkness to it
definitely more warm toned shakes with
like a golden highlight which I know not
everybody was into but I kind of liked
it and yeah that's pretty much it so I'm
going to be trying out some new products
as well i have been using this new
sponge here from NYX Cosmetics this week
also some new brow products from
covergirl now I'm not quite sure if i
will use these today or not i have been
having some really severe eyebrow and
also eyelash shedding so i don't know if
i want to put too much on my brows today
but this is the cover girl easy breezy
brow shape and define a brow gel i'll
probably use this and then this little
guy here i do not really like that much
this is the brow fill powder I do have a
new product here from they believe as
well this is the color tattoo I chrome
in a gilded rose shade and then also the
new cover girl stole a shi'ite mascara
and will also be trying out some
products that were sent to me from octa
lee i have been using this blush all
week this is the cheek to cheek swish
and pop blusher in the shade first love
like I said I know a lot of you didn't
love the warm tone blush I was wearing
this week but this was it and I kind of
like it my friend said this kind of
looks like a boob doesn't it it's kind
of funny oh and then here I have this
little Charlotte Tilbury brush set that
was sent to me again from octal if you
don't know what octa Leah it basically
is just this website where they will
send to your products and you can get in
contact with brands it's unsponsored
unbiased and you can give your honest
opinion so I personally like that anyway
let's go ahead and just jump right into
it guys I'm going to start with my face
primer so the face primer i have been
using is the it cosmetics feel the
moment primer this is what it looks like
it is very very hydrating and my skin
has been extremely dry so what I like to
do with this is just run my
hands down the actual dropper I'm taking
quite a bit of this normally I would
only recommend probably a drop or two of
this you really don't need that much but
like I said I've been insanely insanely
dry I have even had some psoriasis on
the side of my mouth I went into my
dermatologist because I was like um
excuse me is this psoriasis or is it
still cold sores because you guys know I
had that bad like bout of cold sores and
she actually told me it was psoriasis or
something else that's like lip psoriasis
which is super gross but it's been very
difficult to practice my flute and stuff
like that having such a dry lips it's
especially like right on the outside of
my mouth so that has not been a lot of
fun but that is ok we are just going to
put this moisturizing primer on and it
does help quite a bit so I'm going over
my mouth area as well I was so freaked
out last week because I was like oh my
god it's more like cold sores you don't
good not thank goodness it is not all
right then I'm just gonna wipe my hands
off on my little ulta makeup removing
class which I love and then I'm going to
go in with I primer so the eye primer i
have been using this week is also one
that's a little more on the hydrating
side hold on let me fix my mirror here I
just get like a big mirror hanging on
the wall or something around the window
this is the benefit Air Patrol BB eyelid
primer and I just feel like this is very
hydrating around the eye area it does
have a little bit of color correcting
properties as well which I do like so i
am going to take the lid off if i can my
hands are all slippery now from the it
cosmetics primer but if you guys have
ever tried that it is beautiful super
super moisturizing like ridiculously i
just gorgeous so I'm gonna take about
two clicks of this put that on at my
eyelids and just kind of dot it on and I
do like to take it on to the inner
corner of my eye as well because it does
have that yellow tone to it anyway I
hope you guys had a wonderful week I did
not go to work until Thursday because I
got home from my trip on Tuesday and I
didn't have to be back at work til
thursday so technically I only have like
two days of work this week it has been
quite nice so now i'm just going to tap
that in lightly with my middle finger
one of my new year's resolutions is as
far as makeup is concerned and skincare
is to be a little more gentle with my
face I feel like I'd beat the out
of my face every single time I put my
makeup on I'm like pulling and pulling
and I'll watch these videos back and I'm
like girl you need to you
not do that yes so trying to tap
delicately around my eye area um maybe
I'll start using a brush like when I
blend my eye primer and maybe that would
be a little better for me who knows
alright now we're going to jump in
chicken color correcting and concealing
this is the NYX color correcting
concealer palette this is what it looks
like and I have hit some pan on I think
every single shade almost every single
shade except for the lavender and the
bronzer shade so what I'm going to do is
take this color right here which is the
yellow and I'm gonna put that on my
eyelid i will be using this little
angled concealer brush right here from
morphe and i am just going to take that
and tap that on to my eyelid we will be
blending the same but they sponge so I'm
not being too precise and I'm basically
just taking that all around and then on
the inner corner of my eye as well to
cancel out any sort of blue tones and I
love this concealing palette I've told
you guys before this is my second
favorite color correcting item besides
my Urban Decay color correcting fluids
then I'm going to take this kind of
peachy tone color right here using the
same brush and I'm just going to work
that right underneath my eye I do have a
little bit of blue tones there too so I
don't mind the yellow you know the
reminiscence at the yellow underneath
there so just taking that right
underneath my eye and then I'm going to
go in with the green shade and I'm going
to put that on the areas that I need to
cover a little bit a few days ago I put
so much green on the side of my mouth
again these are not cold sores it's just
dry skin so don't worry I'm not
contaminating anything but the other day
I put so much green on the side of my
lip I told you guys to leave me the
little green frog in the comments
section if you like can you tell so now
i'm taking the flawless face sponge this
is new from nyx cosmetics and i'm just
going to blend that in when i first
started using this i was like oh my god
it's hard as a rock and it still feels
really hard when you do put water on it
but it actually does apply foundation
quite nicely and I does blend and
concealer quite nicely so don't judge a
book by it's cover sometimes those more
firm sponges actually do apply product
quite nicely so I'm just kind of
blending that in a little bit the green
color in this concealer palette is not
my favorite I feel like it's a little a
little on the sheer side but I'm just
blending blending blending and now we
are going to jump into
foundation so the foundation that i have
been using this week is from stila this
is the Aqua glow serum foundation in the
shade of fairer and I'm running solo on
this product so I'm actually going to
take the whole applicator out and I'm
going to put it on the back of my hand
slip because I really don't have that
much product left in here this is like
my second favorite serum foundation of
all times I do prefer the so I'm taking
a bit of that on the back of my hand
just going to spread it quickly I do
still prefer the smashbox BB water drops
those have been on my favorite serum
foundation for the year but this one is
still pretty darn good and I'm putting
it like I have to amount on it may look
like it's a lot and I think it kind of
is a lot but this does have a really
nice hydrating base to it so it is going
to give me all day hydration and
yesterday when I put this on for some
reason I put on like a lighter layer and
my skin that look as good so I do like
this because it's buildable and the more
the merrier right guys that sound so bad
and then I'm going to blend that in with
the same sponge so going ahead and
blending that in I love the shade fair
really really nice if you have a quilt
undertone and a fair complexion I really
like these water foundations because
they are so beautiful on the skin first
of all but also you really can layer
them without looking cakey and I have
wanted full coverage this week without
obviously having like a matte finish on
my skin since it's been so dry so just
above ending the lending blending what I
like about this little sponge to is the
fact that it does have that little angle
they're really really pointed angle so
you really can get into like your nose
crevices and around your eye area very
very easily which is awesome so I have
been enjoying that oh I'm starting to
get hot underneath these lights I'm
wearing a fleece nightgown yes I wear
nightgowns they are so comfy you should
try one out sometime but just making
sure that is properly blended in look at
this my little side burns over here I
tried like taking like an electric razor
to them because I thought they looked
weird and now they look even worse so
either I'm going to have to continue
doing the electric razor on my sideburns
which didn't even look
add in the first place or I'm just going
to have to let them grow out so i'll
have to like turn those up today they
look so weird why did i do that do you
ever do that where you start like
shaving or like buzzing like a certain
part of your body like i have always
shaved my arms i know that sounds weird
but i always shaved my arms I always
shave my arms it's been something I've
been doing forever I've been doing it
since like eighth grade and I started
trying to let it grow out and it was
just so prickly it couldn't deal so now
I always have shaved arms oh goodness I
know someone's going to say to you I in
the comments section but it is that it
is so yeah I'm gonna have to whack off
these razor burns over here why did I
say those in the first place don't even
look weird I swear sometimes I look in
the mirror and I'm like oh my god I have
to do something about that and then it
looks even worse alright now we're going
to go ahead and we are going to set in
our face I have been using my essence
all about match-fixing compact powder
this week this is a new one that I
recently hit pan on no surprise there
I'm going to take this morphe angled a
foundation brush I'm going to swirl in
there and starting around my eye area I
am just going to stipple that on any
weight leave me a comment down below let
me know if there is like a weird part of
your body that you have shaved and then
regretted not talking about like your
announce their their I or anything like
that i'm talking about like if you have
shaped your face before and then a group
back all prickly or if you have shaved
your arms and regretted it because i
have always always regretted like
shaving my arms starting to do that
because it just grows back so gross and
I just continually like wax or shave
them now all right just stifling that
all over now kind of focusing more on my
t-zone obviously even though I am dry I
still like to set in my foundation
because I think it really really helps
with where time so that is what I am
doing right here making sure everything
is blended and you guys know how i feel
about this powder no just literally
everything it is everything all right
now we are going to go in with blush so
like i said as a blush that i have been
using this week is the charlotte tilbury
one in first love so this is what it
looks like and it is it's it's pretty so
here it is and i'm just going to swirl
in there with the stippling brush here
from bhcosmetics
you have to tap off the excess and then
I've just kind of been putting it
lightly onto the cheeks I don't feel
like this color would work for you if
you do have a very very like dark
complexion because obviously it's a
pretty light neutral color but I do like
it on my cheeks even though I am more
cool toned um and yeah so just kind of
stippling that on really lightly and
then we're gonna go over it with kind of
like a blush topper / highlighter which
has been that really really at my ear
which has been that really really like
gold toned color that I've been wearing
on my cheeks this week like I said I
know not everyone's into it I kind of
like it so I'm taking my lexy 522 tape
my highlighter brush and next we're
gonna go in with the hard candy baked
bronzer in the shade Tiki so this is
what it looks like I love this bronzer
it's gorgeous so first I'm just going to
take a little amount tap it off and hit
my chin and also the bridge of my nose
like the flat surfaces but then on my
cheekbones I'm really gonna go in there
and then I'm gonna build that up quite a
bit and I'm taking it down to the apple
of my cheek because I'm almost using it
as a blush topper as well and again I
really like the way this turned out I
know it's not for everyone but it's very
very pretty so as you can probably tell
this color is just way way way too dark
to actually be like a true true
highlight on me but it's gorgeous as a
blush topper and it's a little bit of
like a bronzer or glow if you do have a
medium complexion this will be like the
most stunning gold highlight ever on you
so I would highly recommend checking it
out it's like five dollars at Walmart
all right next I am going to go ahead
and let's just come out our brows
quickly so I think what I'll do is just
use the covergirl easy breezy brow the
brow gel like I said that powder stuff I
have been hating if you have noticed
like my brows have been looking super
super strange this week in videos it is
because of these weird covergirl
products so you guys can see when I am
brushing this on right now it leaves
like a white cast and then it does dry
down which is good but I don't know I
don't like these new brow products i
will be talking about them when i do my
what's new at the drugstore video but
yeah just kind of combing them through
going to leave them today just because i
have been having so much brow shedding i
know it looks so weird right there with
that little hole
my brow but then again just have to take
care of like my skin and my hair and
stuff so I'm gonna leave that and now
we'll just jump right into some eyeliner
um keep wiping the lips down the
eyeliner that i have been using this
week is from Smashbox to see always
sharp kohl liner in the shade raven you
guys know I love these a lot so that is
what it looks like and I'm just going to
put that right onto my waterline I
always like to put my eyeliner on first
before going in with my eyeshadow I
don't know why I think most people put
their eye shadow on and then going with
their eyeliner but to each their own so
after doing that I'm going to go ahead
and we are just going to jump right into
eyes shadow so the palette that i have
been using this week is a new one to me
this is from pure cosmetics and this is
actually an item that was in my box each
arm last month so this is what it looks
like it's kind of supposed to be like a
naked sri dupe you open it up you do
have a nice sized mirror it comes with a
double ended brush as well and like take
a look at the colors you guys can see
and honestly this is good quality i feel
bad because when i first unboxed it i
was like i'm sure it's not as good as
the naked palettes which i don't even
really like the naked palettes ah but
this is actually very good quality I
prefer this over the naked palettes I
have no idea if likes watch if you
swatch them side by side if their exact
color dupes I feel like they are but ID
colored my naked 3 long time ago so if
you do own both let us know if they are
exact color dupes but what I'm going to
do is take the pure cosmetics double
ended brush that came in the palette and
I'm going to take the shaded una first
which is this one right here this what
and I am going to take this side over
here tap that in there tap off the
excess they are very very powdery just
so you know and I'm going to work that
into my crease as my transition shade
but yeah these are very powdery but I
feel like they're pigmented I feel like
they do blend pretty easily and overall
good quality I prefer it over my naked 3
let me know if you also prefer it over
your naked 3 alright so just going back
and forth doing small circular motions
as well kind of going back and forth in
the crease and I needed my powder brush
against I'm starting to sweat above my
lip I always get sweaty they're
disgusting these are the lights you guys
these lights are so freaking hot alright
so going back and forth in my crease
like I said
and then I am going to take a my little
brush right here this is a more fiemme
330 brush I'm going to go ahead and just
kind of blend that out to back and forth
not spending too much time doing that
since it's not that big of a deal is
just our transition shade then I'm going
to take my wet and wild crease brush and
i am going into the shade mo java or mo
job this is what it looks like it's a
beautiful kind of rosy pinky color and
i'm going to take that on the brush
again tap off that excess start on the
outer part of my eye over here and then
work it into the inner part of my crease
i'm not taking it all the way in over
here because i am one of those people if
i use too much pink eyeshadow i can look
a little sick so we don't want that to
happen so i'm just focusing on the outer
part of my eye bringing it into the
inner part of the crease and blending in
circular motions but yeah i really love
this color reminds me of the naked 3 oh
goodness i care remember what that shade
was but it was also my favorite shade
and the naked 3 that really nice pretty
rosy toned color I love Rosie toned
eyeshadows i'm all about that look so
anyway doing that on both sides making
sure they are equally built up on each
side and then we will take that morphe
brush again the 330 and we're gonna
blend this out so that there are no
harsh lines really pretty though that
color love love love alright so back to
that 330 brush let's go ahead and just
blend I like this one because it's not
too densely packed it's actually kind of
like a week brush like it's just like
boom but it does kind of blend it nicely
give sort of a you know it is a very
blended appearance so I'm just going in
circular motions in my outer crease and
I am blending that in next we're going
to go back to the other side of the dual
ended brush that came into the palette
or came with the pallid but first we're
going to go into the shade right here
which is called quartz which is the
lightest shade and we're just going to
tap that above or right below the brow
so that we have a little bit of
lightness they're still eyebrows look so
weird i wish i could fill that in but
I'm scaring the eyebrows we're just
gonna like fall out if I keep piling
product on oh well alright so after that
is done we're gonna go back in like I
said with that dual ended brush this
time we're taking the more like precise
like definer side and we're going to go
back into that moshav color Oh moja moja
moja off and we're going to take that
right onto the lower lash line and I'm
taking that all the way in I just really
love this shade so into it so so so
pretty it's like a neutral pink but like
not too pink to the point where it's
like red where it's gonna make you look
sick because I'm somebody who well I am
already kind of sick all the time so I
already looks like old I'm right oh my
goodness so it's not gonna make you look
too sick if you do have more like a
yellow or warmer under tower I actually
this little extra pretty but yeah
alright so after we have done that again
I'm going to take that c330 blending
brush from morphe just run that under
underneath a little bit so we can smoke
it out and now we're going to go in with
that Maybelline I chrome color tattoo I
don't love this not a huge fan was not a
huge fan of the maybelline color tattoos
in general but a lot of you are
requesting i try it out for my video
next week which will be what's new at
the drugstore so now i'm taking this on
the inner like first third of my eye and
then i am going to go ahead and blend it
in with my jaw bone ask what is this 200
brush so just going kind of like back
and forth pulling that but not pulling
it all the way like back towards the
color that we put on so over here i'm
just going to go ahead and kind of tap
it on but it's pretty it's just i do
find that it starts to crease throughout
the day and i'll talk about that a
little more tomorrow in my fails and
holy grails which I will probably film
right after this video but yeah I just
feel like it starts to crease on me and
honestly the color tattoos have always
creased on me so I didn't think this
formulation would be that different but
I like to try stuff out for you guys
because you requested and also you know
maybe I can find some use for it you
know maybe I can find something that I
do like to use it for so I'm just
blending that out again with that
Shepard last brush this is one of those
brushes that's like angled so if you do
want to work it into your crease
cool anyway we got that at ulta when I
was on sale by the way did you see Alta
is having like they're 21 days of
skincare or whatever oh my god the peter
thomas roth I'm wrinkle peel pads are
gonna be on sale for like fifteen
dollars you need to get them you guys
know I talk about those all the time I
think they're on sale on the 10th or
something so you can already see this is
starting to kind of go into a few lines
on my eyelid again don't love it but
it's just okay alright now we're going
to go in with mascara like i said i have
been using the cover girls soul ashy
mascara this week I do have some
thoughts on this and I'll let you know
tomorrow I and my fails and holy grails
how I really feel about it I think it
looks amazing on the upper lashes so I'm
just putting a coat of that there but
it's really hard to use on the lower
lashes like very very very very hard to
use on the lower lashes so I'm just
doing this because it does have this
little pointed ball at the bottom and
normally i'm all about that pointed ball
life you guys but it is just a little on
the difficult side i forgot to use that
charlotte tilbury brush set oh well um I
will go ahead and talk about that maybe
i'll talk about it feels and holy grails
tomorrow yeah so I am just putting this
with the little ball part onto my lower
lashes going back and forth like this
because every time I try and just take
the brush and go like this on my lashes
it kind of poked me in the eye which I
really don't like I don't like that so i
will show you guys i will show you guys
how I put myself on the I know but it
just it just looks a little weird but I
do like the definition I get from this
master I think it's really pretty on the
upper lashes just know that it is a
little harder to work with on the lower
lashes what have you have been asking if
I'm ambidextrous because I switched my
hands while I do my makeup I used to be
ambidextrous when I was a kid but now
I'm left-handed I have become a
left-handed dominant person but I do use
both hands when I do my mascara I know
it's kind of weird all right again gonna
wait my lips down one more time because
I
a messy girl and I get makeup everywhere
and then the electronic that i have been
using this week is really nice and
lightweight again I was telling you guys
I was worried that this over here was
like more cold sore so I wanted a
product that I could dip my finger into
or a brush into so I wasn't like double
dipping this is the elf lip balm tint in
the shade Barry and I have like a
newfound love for this it's very
pigmented and pretty and I just in
tapping that onto my lower lip and then
going like this and I just love that
little bit of color it's comfortable it
tastes good its kind of moisturizing
it's pretty much perfect so anyway guys
that that is pretty much look of the
week I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you guys tomorrow from the
files and how to grails bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
