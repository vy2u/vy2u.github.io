thank you so much for joining me happy
Saturday I'm so happy I slept in today
this is why this video is going up way
later than it was opposed to but anyway
welcome back to my channel welcome back
to look of the week
and this is where I recreate either of
my most requested makeup look that I've
been wearing this week or my personal
favorite so we're actually gonna do both
of those the makeup that I really like
this week was what I was wearing
yesterday it was kind of like a warmer
crease with like a bright silver on the
lid very very simple and easy you guys
know I don't do anything too extravagant
with my makeup really all that often so
that's what I was wearing I told you
guys on a snapchat last night that that
was the look I wanted to go for and a
lot of you agree that that was your
personal favorite so yeah
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
have already cleanse my face with one of
my Sephora rose cleansing wipes and then
I did go ahead and go in with my
Hungarian water essence with a few drops
of oil from belief so yeah I haven't
been wearing too much skincare this week
last week I was wearing a lot of
skincare a lot of makeup and I felt like
my pores were getting a little clog so
haven't been doing too much in the
skincare route lately or I guess this
week alright so let's go ahead and jump
right into it we are going to start with
primer all of my skincare has completely
sunk in by the way so the face primer an
eye primer that I have been using this
week is the maybelline baby skin instant
pore eraser I've been taking about a
pea-sized amount of this and I like to
just apply it in my t-zone of course
mostly focusing on my t-zone and then I
also apply it around on my eye area so
it actually works quite nicely as an eye
primer I was surprised I really like it
right underneath my eyes focus camera my
camera's been having issues focusing
lately you guys I don't know what's
going on I think I just need to clean
the lens but yeah so I am just applying
this and letting it kind of sink into my
skin I don't feel like it creases too
badly when I use it around my eyes or my
eyeshadows don't crease too badly when I
use this so that's kind of cool
sometimes you can use face primers as
your actual eye primer alright so moving
on we're just gonna go ahead and jump
right into foundation the foundation I
have been using this week is from
L'Oreal it is the infallible Pro glow
foundation this is a 24 hour wear
foundation and the shade that I wear is
2:01 classic ivory this kinda reminds me
of the Urban Decay all nighter in the
sense that it goes on really really
light
and then oxidizes throughout the day so
I'm just gonna give it a good shake and
I like to take about this much on my
finger so it really is super super runny
as you guys can see it's probably about
the size of a large pea and I just like
to go ahead and apply it to the areas
that I want and then I am blending it in
with my Ulta sponge
it's from the Ulta collection and it is
a beautiful damp a little sponge this is
what it looks like and I'm just gonna go
ahead and blend this Foundation in so
this foundation has very very light
coverage I probably will jump back in on
the areas that I feel like I want to
touch up even more but I am blending
this in and like I said it goes on
really really light and then it starts
to oxidize super super pink throughout
the day
and normally I'm the kind of person I do
have a strong pink undertone I know a
lot of you think I have a yellow
undertone the lady really focuses in on
my face so if you ever see like a
discrepancy between my neck and my face
that's probably what's going on it's
just the ring light is super focused in
on my face so it would be different if I
was kind of sitting up more but I don't
know maybe I just started sitting on a
pillow or something but yes no I do have
a cool undertone in my skin you guys
very cool undertone but even this goes a
little too pink for me like I need
something a little more neutral it
starts to really oxidize so I do have a
little bit of scarring in this area so
I'm just gonna go in with a little more
of this foundation I'm just gonna put it
directly onto the sponge this sponge I
feel like doesn't actually soak up too
much product so I'm just kind of
touching up on those areas and blending
them in and then I'm gonna go in with a
concealer the concealer that I have been
using this week is the naturally radiant
concealer from Too Faced it's beautiful
really really kind of mimics the actual
consistency and the finish of this
particular foundation so I really like
the way the two of those pair together
so the she that I wear is called very
fair if you are curious in the concealer
this is what it looks like the Born This
Way concealer and I'm just gonna apply
this right underneath my eyes and on my
eyelid I haven't been doing too much of
like a triangular shape and all the way
down you know to my nose and in a
triangle just because I don't know I
haven't I don't know I don't
I feel like I need to cover too much
this week not saying my skin looks
amazing cuz I do have my period but I
don't feel like I need to highlight that
whole area I've been getting a decent
amount of sleep this week so taking that
same sponge and just gonna go ahead and
blend in the concealer and I really do
like this concealer I do have a layer of
the Jurgens
um natural glow what is it called
self-tanner on today or I have this week
just one little layer but gives me a
nice glow to my skin I'm getting my
lupus shot soon so I just want to make
sure that like I don't know it helps to
have self-tanner on kind of evens out
the redness and stuff in my skin so
anyway I really like the way that this
particular concealer blends in with one
layer of my Jerkins natural glow it's
like the exact color but they really do
need to make an even lighter shave for
when people are paler than that cuz
right now I'm probably about an NC
20-ish and when I'm at my Ferris I'm
like at NC 10 so I'm gonna wipe down my
lips quickly again of course with one
rise - forward with cleansing wipes
obsessed with those and we're gonna go
ahead and set in our face I have been
using my essence it's all about Matt
fixing compact powder which is one of my
all-time favorite powders to use and I
have been using this brush and I did not
clean it I clean all my brushes for a
look of the week but this one just takes
forever to dry it and this is the elf
ultimate kabuki brush this is what it
looks like and you guys this thing is
amazing at setting in your face really
quickly so I just kind of pull up the
powder like this and I love that it
covers so much surface area it's really
funny because I usually use this for
contouring or blending out contour but
it's actually amazing and setting in
your face super quickly I think it would
be actually really good at using for
foundation as well maybe for a
foundation kind of like this one not so
much a foundation that's like super
super full thick coverage that you
really have to pull pull on you know
like really really blends but it is
beautiful to actually set in your face
because it does it in like three strokes
it's absolutely crazy so this is
actually really cool and it's very soft
and very very dense so if you have this
passion you don't know what to do with
it definitely try it with foundation or
try it with powder alright now we're
going to go ahead and jump into blush
and highlight
I have been using my Becca Jaclyn he'll
face collection a palette this week one
of my all-time favorite face palettes
this is what it looks like on the inside
and the look that I was wearing
yesterday was amaretto mixed together
with Prosecco pop so we're gonna take a
maretto as our blush I am taking the
up-and-up blush brush I am tapping into
that shade amaretto tapping off the
excess and I'm going to start going
ahead and building that on to the apple
of my cheek I love this color I mean
it's like a really bronzy color and you
could technically use this as a bronzer
especially if you do have a cool
undertone because it does lean a little
more rosy toned but love I love with the
bronzer when it leans a little more on
the cool side so this is really really
beautiful on the cheeks though and I
feel like it makes me look nice and
glowy without being too over-the-top you
know it can still pull off I can still
kind of pull it off it's like a warm
toned blush kind of reminds me of Maxim
bask so I'm just going ahead and
applying that everywhere and then
because it is kind of a drastic color
difference between my skin and that
color I am going back in with that
ultimate powder brush and I'm just kind
of blending it in circular motions
towards the back of my ear now we're
gonna go ahead and take a Prosecco pop
which is definitely the more yellow
toned um highlight and this can be
tricky if you're super super fair I will
be taking my Lexy 522 tapered
highlighter brush I'd tap in there very
very lightly to hit the bridge of my
nose and also on my chin because this is
technically darker and then my skin so I
don't want it to be too in-your-face
in those areas but then I really pick it
up and I like to really kind of go hard
when it comes to my cheekbone because I
take it all the way down to the apple of
my cheek and then all the way up and it
actually starts to kind of mix together
with that blush and it looks really
really beautiful so doing that on both
sides and of course I still do go in and
blend out with that elf ultimate kabuki
brush again just because when you are
wearing a darker highlight and you have
fair skin you know it can still give you
a very very nice glowy skin but at the
same time it can look like a stripe of
yellow on your face so
again taking that ultimate kabuki brush
from ELF and I'm just kind of going over
this time and stippling because we want
the highlight to blend more with the
blush instead of with your skin tone
that sounds super weird but it looks
more natural if it can kind of go down
further towards the blush all right so
that is for a blush and highlights next
we are going to go ahead and jump into
brows so I'm going to be using my
beloved Maybelline brow drama cran
pomade in the leg a shade I love this
stuff I've just been filling in the
front part of my brows as usual if you
guys haven't watched me for a while you
know I'm kind of a no-fuss girl with my
brows actually I'm completely no-fuss so
what I like to do is just kind of fill
in the front part of my brows and then
sort of up here towards the arch my
brows tend to be a little on the thinner
side really also depends like the last
time I've been in a lupus flare up
because I lose a lot of brow hairs
during flare-ups and then I'm just
taking a spoolie and brushing it out
lightly it will take a little bit of the
product off but again it just looks more
natural when you have that and I haven't
been setting it in with wax or any sort
of what is it called like I was gonna
say serum come on girl you can think gel
because I feel like the more you do that
the less natural they look I kind of
like the thought of them just looking
more natural and bushy so yeah anyway
that's what I've been doing now we're
gonna go in with eyeliner originally if
you watched out my stash this week you
saw that I was using as the Milani
liquid eye pencil guys I tried to heat
that up in the microwave but first I
tried a blow-dryer on it to kind of like
loosen it up it was super hard as a rock
so I tried to get it a little warmer I
could not use it you guys have just
scratched up my waterline and I was just
felt horrible I could not soften that
damn pencil so I had it too long I still
think it's a good idea but I had to go
ahead and toss that in my empties video
so I'm into my empties Ben bar my
empties video so the eyeliner that I
have been replacing it with this week is
the Smashbox always sharp cool
waterproof liner in Sumatra I'm just
going to go on my waterline quickly and
I also was using the clinic skinny stick
in the shade slim sable which is really
nice for getting your tight line but I
love this it is always sharp and
I really like the way it coats my
waterline very very quickly so anyway we
have lined our waterline I always get a
little watery after and then they go
look but they look crazy all right now
we are going to go ahead and jump right
into I shadow so I have been using in my
chocolate chip pallets from Too Faced so
we are gonna start with the white
chocolate chip palette it looks a little
something like this
we are going to go ahead and take our
base color for our eyes this one right
here which is called a glaze and I am
going to be taking a sigma e40 brush I'm
just going to dub what did I want to say
it I was gonna dust in there I said dump
I'm gonna dump it in there guys I'm
gonna dump that brush in there
and I'm gonna apply this all over my
eyelid all the way up to my eye
good talking talking is hard sometimes
you guys taking a little bit on the
inner corner of my eye as well I had a
lot of you asking me um if this palette
would be good if you had like a deeper
skin tone so I have a friend at work who
has a really gorgeous deep chocolaty
skin tone she got the matte chocolate
chip palette but this one did not show
up on her and I said that in my review
too if you have like a really tan skin
tone or darker I don't think that this
palette is really gonna show up that
well on you because these are very
pastel light colors but even for me with
my NC 20 skin right now it shows up
beautifully I don't have an issue
whatsoever so I think this is great if
your very fair and then the matte taco
chip is great if you do have a darker
complexion but one thing you have to be
aware of what this little guy is that it
takes a lot more to blend out and you
guys will see that I think I'm gonna go
ahead and pass this along to my friend
who does have the darker complexion even
though she did pick one up herself she
could always have a backup for me
because I just don't like blending that
much alright next we're gonna go ahead
and take this little shade right here as
this one is called cake batter and I'm
going to work that into my crease as my
transition shade tapping off the excess
and just working it right into the
crease perfect if you do have fair skin
it will just give a little bit of depth
and it is a little more warm toned which
is very pretty and I've kind of been
mixing together warm tones with cool
tones on the eyes especially yesterday I
did so that's what we're doing today
alright so now we're going to go out
into the matte chocolate chip palette
and I am going to be taking this Shea
right here which is called Matt hazelnut
that is what it looks like you can tell
I dipped my brush in there yesterday and
I am taking a let's see here let's use
my morphe and b13 brush because i really
want this to be exact I'm gonna tap in
there tap off the excess I'm gonna start
working this into the crease and I
really want to make sure I'm depositing
it where I want it because these have
the tendency to be a little tougher to
blend so when you start really blending
them they can go all the way up to the
eyebrow if you're not careful and I
don't want that darkness all the way up
to the eyebrow that happened a little
bit yesterday when I did my makeup so I
just don't want that to happen again so
I am just working that in to my crease
and already you can see it's kind of uh
it's just these are these are harder to
blend you guys they're just a little
harder to blend with the matte chocolate
chip palette just something to be aware
of my camera just went completely yellow
I look like a Simpsons character oh
great
alright next we are gonna take a
blending brush I'm going to take my
Sigma e30 hmm
should probably take my Sigma e35 so
there's the e35 and I'm just gonna go
ahead and blend it back and forth
normally I would use something fluffier
like the e-40 but like I said these are
a little harder to blend so I really
want something that's going to get in
there and blend this out alright so
going back and forth doing small
circular motions as well and you do have
to spend a little bit of time with this
particular shade or this particular
matte chocolate chip palette which you
guys know I'm not not a fan of sitting
there and blending forever alright after
I have done that I'm going to go back in
with that shade again at the hazelnut
shade and I am going to take let's see
here mm-hmm
I think I'll go ahead mm-hmm I can't
remember exactly what I did yesterday if
I took it underneath my lower lash line
you know what I did but first I went to
had it and I foiled a shade onto my lid
so I'm gonna spray down with the elf
makeup mist and set onto the brush and
then I'm going to go back into the white
chocolate chip palette and take the
shade indulge which is this one right
here it's a silvery shade and I'm going
to pick that up and start packing that
on to my lid oh yeah
I remember what I did okay I was like
did I put stuff on my lower lashline and
can't remember so I am just packing this
on a to my lid I really really like this
color I like the color below it even
more which is called sugar Drazen but
this one is really pretty all over the
lid and like I said I was kind of doing
that cool tone thing with the warm toned
eyeshadow and I actually really liked
the way that it turned out and the brush
I'm using is from my Naked 3 palette
which you guys know I t cluttered my
Naked 3 palette I just gonna deal with
the textures in there and that kind of
stuff it just wasn't really my thing
however I did like the brush so I like
this side over here for really really
packing a color on to the lid it's
really nice because it's not too big so
you really can get in there I don't have
tons and tons of lid space again get a
foil it for the other side I don't have
tons and tons of lid space so I really
need something that's maybe like a
little longer and a little tinier so
that when I do want to foil something
and pack it on to the lid I can do so
without it looking crazy and without it
get interrupting like my crease color
that's the last thing I want is for it
to start interrupting my crease color I
just heard a weird sound the hell was
that mr. badger is out right now running
around the apartment you better not be
doing you better not be messing
things up he's such a little but I
love him alright so that is what I am
doing just packing this color onto the
lid like I said I really like this shade
it's so pretty it's so pretty and then I
want to go back in and with that a35 one
more time and just kind of blend here
just a little bit more can never have
enough blending guys never have enough
blending alright
now remember what I did so I go back in
with that indulgence shade with the same
brush and I put it right underneath my
lower lash line like the first part
right here and then I dipped back into
that hazelnut shade and then I went on
the outer parts of my lower lash line
with the same brush didn't use a lot of
brushes this week I couldn't remember if
I had done usually kind of smoke out the
lower lash line I didn't really do a
whole lot of that this week
all right so that is pretty much all I
did for the eyes I am gonna go ahead and
take that ultimate kabuki brush one more
time and just pick up any sort of fall
out when you do foil the shade it's not
too bad with any sort of fallout but
still still want to go ahead and do it
all right so now we're gonna go ahead
and do our mascara the mascara I've been
using this week is the YSL a baby doll
mascara I love this absolutely beautiful
I don't know why the camera just got so
forgiving a yellow oh well and I am just
going to apply a coat of this my lashes
and I haven't been at layering mascaras
this week I've just been wearing this
one so that's kind of interesting
normally I like really clumpy lashes and
I go ahead and I do like a huge thing of
clumpy lashes looks like 10 mascaras but
no just one this week this one is just
great I just love the way it goes on
it's a nice kind of tacky formulation
you guys so it will give you the length
and the definition and the clumps if you
like clumps like me so there it is touch
this side up just a little more and that
is pretty much it for the eyes what I
did yesterday now we're gonna go ahead
and take my wire sell the left end in
oil in the shade Orange Crush I'm going
to apply this to my lips
just got it right there goddamnit
alright taking a little brush alright
alright guys so that is it this is look
at the week this was the look that I was
wearing yesterday that was my favorite
from the whole entire week I hope you
enjoyed this video and should put a lip
liner on anyway I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow for my
mouth and how to write bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
