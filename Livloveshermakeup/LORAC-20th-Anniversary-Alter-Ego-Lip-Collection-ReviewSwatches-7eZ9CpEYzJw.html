thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day i'm
sorry if my dress is falling off of me
just doesn't wanna stay on anyway i'm
very excited for today's a video i am
doing i review and give you guys my
thoughts my opinions and i'm doing
swatches for you guys as well on the new
lorac 20th anniversary lip vault it
looks like this i purchased mine for $75
on the lorac cosmetics calm website and
i will link below where you guys can
pick it up um if you are not familiar
with these kind of bolts that come out
this sort of this like time of year
urban decay releases a lot of them by
beauty does and these are normally
around 200 to 300 dollars everything
that you get in this lorac lip vault is
basically totaled out at about 375
dollars so the fact that you are getting
it for $75 is absolutely fantastic so i
highly highly recommend going on to the
lorac calm website if you are interested
in this and purchasing it ASAP because i
don't know how long this is going to
last I don't know how long this is only
going to be $75 I did purchase mine on
black friday but I was very very happy
to see that this sale has continued on
and I think the reason they're doing it
is because it is their 20th anniversary
so happy birthday lorac by the way or
congratulations but anyway like I said
it is a lip fault so comes gorgeous
gorgeous black box like this and you
just kind of open it right here and it
has this cute little latch and opens up
like this and inside you get 10 a
full-sized alter ego lipsticks that
range in colors from nudes to purples to
Pink's to dark colors and then you get
the matching or corresponding 10
full-size alter ego lip glosses so I was
very very excited to get this I think
that the way that it is displayed is
just absolutely gorgeous you could have
this out and just kind of I don't know
have it open like in your beauty room
like this I think it's absolutely
stunning to look at it I posted a
picture on Instagram vests and I was
just look how stunning that looks you
know like the packaging is just
absolutely gorgeous or you could take
them out and do whatever you want with
them the lipsticks and the lip glosses
have this little logo on here that says
lorac 20th or 20 as in their 20th year
anniversary and
I just love that they are released a
vault like this and put it at such a
great price because compared to what it
should be which is around three hundred
dollars for $75 you are basically
getting 20 lip products and it's just
such a great deal if basically like they
total out at a couple dollars apiece so
I highly recommend like I said you get
the lipsticks in the front and then the
lip glosses in the back you get three
kind of nude shades you get three kind
of pinky purple shades and then three
darker shades so I feel like any lip
lover is going to enjoy this kit because
you get such a wide range of colors um I
will say I really really do like the
texture of these lipsticks the lipsticks
are kind of like a demi max sort of
finish they don't go completely mad and
feel like crusty on your lips by any
means but they do have like a little bit
of I don't know they have a little bit
of like in that texture to them but
they're more of like a satin I guess
that's what I'm trying to say they have
a kind of satiny texture to them they're
beautiful very very comfortable on the
lips and I noticed that they last a very
long time I am wearing the shade
dominatrix right now on my lips I've
been wearing this for almost five and a
half hours so it is starting to fade a
little bit I do have it topped with the
gloss the matching gloss however I feel
like it's just it still looks very very
nice it's not completely separating I
didn't want to touch it up before this
video just so you guys could see like
the where time but I'm not wearing a
primer or anything underneath it I just
put it on my lips and I feel like it has
done quite well for five and a half
hours so especially for a dark color you
know sometimes they'll start to break up
on the lips and you can tell exactly
like where I don't know where it's
trying to like it a little uneven and I
feel like you can still kind of see that
with it right now on my lips however
it's not as bad as it could be so anyway
I really do love the formula of the
lipsticks I think they're very nice they
have that beautiful kind of satiny
texture they last a very good amount of
time and then the glasses are great too
they are not sticky at all whatsoever I
do not like sticky glosses I love the
amount of shine that they give to the
lips especially when you pair it with
the corresponding lipstick I think the
two different textures together really
are beautiful you get that kind of shine
on the lips and then that kind of Demi
matte finish with the lipstick you can
pair them or you can just
pair them the glasses are extremely
extremely pigmented as well so you can
wear them alone and get a lot of color
on the lips but anyway they both um or
they both they all have the glasses and
the lipsticks has they have a beautiful
um sort of i would say vanilla like sent
to them you have a smell like vanilla
cupcakes they smell very similar to math
lip products if you like those kind of
lip products with the lipsticks from Mac
you're probably going to like these so
anyway let's just get into swatching
like I said very very happy with the
formulation I think they last a good
amount of time and the price is right so
we're going to start with the lighter
shades and I will swatch the lipsticks
first and then do the corresponding or
matching lip gloss so the first one we
have here is called bombshell this is a
beautiful kind of peachy nude color it
looks like this I'm gonna swatch that on
my hand for you guys and then I will
also swatch the gloss I really love this
color because it's not too nude you know
it doesn't have any kind of weird gray
undertone it really has that nice peachy
sort of undertone and even the gloss and
this is the lightest shade in here even
the gloss has a very very high like
pigment to it it's very very high indeed
mentation so there are the two together
so we have the lipstick and then we have
the gloss the beautiful beautiful sort
of peachy color I think a lot of people
could get use out of that and I just
think it's beautiful i love when um i
don't know about you guys but i
absolutely love when nude lipsticks have
kind of a peachy undertone because I
find it a lot more flattering the next
color in here is called a visionary and
this one has a little more of that kind
of grayish undertone to it so I don't
find this to be as appealing on my skin
particularly but of course everybody's
different but it is one of those like
your lips with better sort of shades it
has a little bit of a rosy undertone so
it helps it so that it doesn't look too
crazy and kind of like whoa that's like
whiteout nude on her lips you know what
I mean very like your lips but better
kind of 90s supermodel esque kind of
color there so this again is visionary
we have the lipstick and then the gloss
really really beautiful and I do like
that these colors just kind of take a
step down in each one they just kind of
like you know it goes from like peachy
to
Rosie to purple to pink to red to really
deep it's just really really beautiful
the next one we have here is called a
secret agent and this one definitely has
more of a brown undertone in it so this
is the lipstick and again these just go
on so beautifully and very very
pigmented I'm just like so so impressed
especially with the glasses too I mean
what's better than having a really
really pigmented gloss like one that
just goes on full color it's like you
don't even need to pair it with the
lipstick you know what I mean so this
again is secret agent we have the
lipstick and then the lip gloss
beautiful beautiful kind of rosy Bobby's
for color really really stunning I like
that one a lot the next one we have I'm
not completely sold on I'm not great
with like purple colors but this is
gorgeous this is free spirit and this is
definitely a kind of dark purple color
and I think it's gorgeous a little
outside my comfort zone but i'm going to
try when it comes to spring and all that
kind of stuff you know around a
different season i guess you could say i
will definitely try this out on my lips
I've not worn these yet obviously
because this color is just a little
outside of my comfort zone but
absolutely gorgeous you have the
lipstick and the cloths really a really
beautiful color very very fun and I feel
like it's definitely a vibrant pop of
color on the lips who wouldn't like that
the next one we have is really really
funny this is more of a lavender sort of
color this is my friendly auras this is
her favorite one it's called beauty guru
go figure this is a beautiful light kind
of lavender color and I think it's
gorgeous this one I'm a little more
comfortable with I'd be a little more
comfortable with this one than the free
spirit one just because it's got a step
it's a little I don't know it's got like
a step down from the super super bright
vibrant purple it's got a little more
pink in it and it's a little more it's
just lighter you know like a lighter
purple so there's the lipstick and
there's the gloss again the shade is
called a beauty guru how fitting okay um
let me grab another wipe the next one is
kind of like a medium toned or kind of
like a mixture a medium
and light pink sort of mixed together it
looks like this and the shade is called
party girl and this is really like the
pinky pinky one in the batch I think
it's gorgeous it's not pretty so that is
the lipstick and the lip gloss paired
with it is beautiful yeah I don't call
this a medium tone pain because the next
one down is like a hot pink so this is
more of a medium tone pink so this one
is called party girl you have the
lipstick and the lip gloss sorry I love
what I'm looking in the viewfinder I'm
like wait wait that's over there um the
next one you have is definitely hot pink
this is called hot shot it looks like
this very very hot pink color but
absolutely gorgeous I mean just very
very vibrant and out there but I am
still going to wear this color I'm
comfortable with wearing bright pink
colors then like bright purple I don't
know why but that is what this one looks
like absolutely stunning again that is
called hotshot swatches off I'm sorry if
I seem like I'm in a bit of a hurry I
have to get back to work it's the only
time I had um a little chunk of time to
film for you guys today the next color
is a beautiful red color this is called
celebrity and I think it's gorgeous it
is just a true red with a bit of like a
burnt brownish kind of undertone it's
stunning it's really stunning actually
you know maybe has a little more of a
berry I can't tell like in the packaging
it looks a little more brown but then
when it's swatch it's got a little more
of a berry undertone I think it's
beautiful either way absolutely stunning
look at those colors whoa there's the
lipstick there's ellipses and there's
the gloss I really really love that
color you guys know I love kind of like
Barry lips I don't know why I guess I'm
just really really drawn to those are
attracted to us and then here is what
I'm wearing on my lips today this is
dominatrix again absolutely stunning
this one has more of a berry undertone I
would say I think that's why I'm
attracted to it because it does have
that gorgeous kind of berry undertone um
but I just love it I love the
color very dominatrixes loose I was kind
of a bad swatch but there is dominatrix
gorgeous right look at a classic a shiny
and the last one in here is a very very
deep deep deep dark color and this is
called nua i'm guessing makeup artists
it's almost like black looking um but it
does have a bit of like a brown
undertone i'm going to show you guys in
a minute when I swatch it let me get
another wipe because my hands are all
taken up now um but yeah this one is
very very interesting I prefer
dominatrix just because it does have
that little bit of a very undertone but
this one is a really gorgeous as well so
this is mua you go ahead and just watch
it here i don't have tons and tons of
room now because my hands are all
stained so that is anyway can you guys
see that very very dark vampy almost
purple Undertown I think that's why I'm
not as drawn to it because it has that
purple sort of undertone but anyway
those are all of the shades like I said
absolutely a fantastic deal for $75 you
guys you really can't beat it I hope I
got through everything and talked about
what you would want to know about this
product I will link below where you guys
can pick it up love the formula love the
price love the colors I think you guys
would really really like this kit so I
