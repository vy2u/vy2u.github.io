channel this video is going to be a
review swatches and also a quick little
demo on the new LaRocca light source
illuminating highlighters I picked up
all four shades that were available and
they were $22 a piece on the ulta.com
website right now they are not available
for anybody the reason I got my hands on
them was because I am a platinum member
at Ulta and they sent me an email about
a week ago saying would you like to pick
them up so if you are a platinum member
you've got the email and hopefully you
pick them up if you were interested in
them but they will be available for
everybody to purchase online on March
27th and in the store on April 14th let
me go ahead and read a little bit about
what it says on the Alta calm website so
you guys can get any better
understanding of what this product is
like it says instantly bring luhan
luminosity and life to your face with
lorac light source highlighters these
paraben free hi pearl highlighters are
infused with anti-aging antioxidants and
light diffusing soft focus pigments for
a silky smooth luminous glow this
illuminating complexion enhancing
formula can be worn sheer for a soft
natural Sheen or layered for a high
shine dramatic effect become a beautiful
sensual source of light with lorac so I
think that's super super cute and today
I am wearing one of the shades right now
and I am going to demo with it as well
just to kind of show you guys how it
feels on the skin but this is in the
shade start like if you guys are curious
so anyway the shades that are available
are called
daylight's starlight Twilight and
moonlight and this is what the outer
packaging looks like you can see the
names of the actual shades on the top
and then they look like this they're
just really thin little boxes you have a
little peephole so you can see the
actual color and I do like the color a
variety that they have on they also got
calm website they looked a lot darker
and I was a little worried but honestly
they're all very similar in common in
color
I personally am going to go ahead and
keep all of them but I don't think
that's necessary if you're someone who
doesn't collect makeup and things like
that I don't think it's necessary that
you pick all of them up because they are
sort of similar to each other so the
first two shades that we have here are
moon lights which is a beautiful kind of
dusty rosy color I don't know how to
exactly how to describe it it kind of
has a little bit of a gray undertone but
it's very very beautiful this is what it
looks
like go ahead and swatch it and there it
is
swatched on my hand so very very
beautiful as you guys can see this
particular formula is not like chunks of
glitter or anything like that it's a
very very luminous on the skin
there's no grit there's no texture it's
just luminous and glowy and beautiful so
that is the first one that we have the
second one that we have is sort of
similar to this shade and it's called
Twilight but this one has a little more
of a gray undertone to it this one
reminds me a lot of the hourglass
ambient lighting powder in the shade dim
light except it's a little more golden
and there's definitely more chunks of I
don't want to say challenges of glitter
but there's definitely more gold glimmer
in here so this is what it looks like
and this is what it looks like on my
finger and swatched a very very
beautiful color I personally really
really like it I can actually get away
with putting it all over my face and it
doesn't look too dark on me I normally
have that issue with powders where it
will darken up if I turn my head but
that one is actually really really nice
alright the next one we have is called
starlight and this is kind of the
opalescent yellow one this is the
lightest one out of all four of them and
this one reminds me a lot of Becca's
shimmering skin perfecter in the shade
moonstone so if you like that kind of
yellow gold color you would really
really love this one
paratis swatched on my hand very very
beautiful as you can see it's just a
gorgeous kind of wet looking sheen these
are not a big delay sort of formulation
but they look like it so really really
beautiful on this skin alright and then
the last one we have that is sort of
similar to daylight is a v-shape or I'm
sorry the one that's sort of similar to
starlight is daylight and daylight is
kind of like that yellow opalescent
color but just a few shades darker and
I'm gonna go ahead and swatch this one
you guys will be able to see can you see
how it picks up a lot of product at once
I will say the formula on these is
really beautiful like I said they're not
a Beit Jala formula but they do pick up
a lot of products so I highly recommend
using something like a fan brush to
apply these
if you use a brush that is too dense
it's just going to pack it on and it's
going to start to build up in areas that
you don't want so you're gonna start to
see fine lines and wrinkles and texture
and things like that so I highly
recommend using a fan brush which I will
demo with this one this is the elf fan
brush anyway this is the last shade
isn't that beautiful so they're all very
kind of similar to each other I wasn't
really expecting that because like I
said on the Alden home website they look
so different and dark and it really
showed that this color right here
Twilight was like literally like a deep
dark tan color and it's really not like
that it looks very similar to the
ambient lighting powder in dim light so
I really do like the shade selection I
am gonna go ahead and keep all of them
but like I said if you are someone who
isn't super super into collecting makeup
you definitely don't need to pick up all
four I would suggest just picking up one
of them you do get point to three ounces
or six point five two grams of product
in here for twenty two dollars which I
feel like is a pretty good deal and it's
really cute if you do end up picking out
all four of them they actually stack
magnetically on top of each other the
packaging is kind of like that gunmetal
color but it's actually very very
similar to the what was it lorac nude
necessities palette so it has that kind
of pretty like um yeah gunmetal sort of
color I guess you could say so I really
like it it does happen magnetic closure
on all of them and I don't feel like
these are gonna open up and explode in
my purse by any means
so overall the formulation is really
nice I find that these to wear all day
long I have been working a nine-hour day
and I feel like you can still see the
highlight even though I did not wear
primer today and I did not use these
settings for am trying out a new
foundation so that's why anyway I really
really like them I think they're very
buttery very very pigmented like I said
I would use a light hand because they do
kick up a lot of powder and they just
have a lot to kind of fall out on the
face if you get mud drips so you don't
want to go in there with a super super
dense brush even the Sigma tapered
highlighter is gonna be a little too
dense for these powders I highly highly
recommend going in with a fan brush so
I'm gonna go ahead and pull my hair back
and demo these for you guys so you can
see like I said I already do you have
starlight is it I get confused yes it is
starlight I know starlight on right now
and I'm going to go ahead and put that
on as well and I'm just going to dust
into the product very lightly so when
you go like this you can see instantly
that a lot of powder kicks up can you
guys see that I hope you can see that
and it doesn't build evenly on the brush
hopefully you guys can see that it
doesn't build evenly so you really want
to make sure that you're just dusting
this on your not like going like oh yeah
like blending it in they're just really
really lightly dusted on these are gonna
be that gorgeous powder that just gives
you a little bit of light on the face
without looking too overdone but you
really kind of layer them quite nicely
so I think if you use a fan brush I did
use a fan brush with this product as
well this morning I think they build
beautifully on top of each other but if
you were to use a very dense brush
they're just gonna start to get you know
chunky and clunky on the skin
Clemmy you know maybe they're gonna
start to kind of clump up on the skin so
that is what the actual color looks like
I love this shade all of them look like
this they just have that beautiful
luminosity and kind of wet look to the
skin without being full of glitter and
shimmer so I really love the way they
look
I love the wearability I love the
pigmentation of them I think they just
have a beautiful beautiful formula like
they said it is a little powdery but for
the most part it looks beautiful on the
skin so I hope you guys enjoyed this
little review swatches and demo on the
new light source illuminating
highlighters from lorac okay thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
