thank you so much for joining me hope
you guys are having a fantastic day I'm
sorry if I sound a little stuffed up I
am dealing with a head cold right now so
if I sound a little different to that is
why anyway today's video is going to be
a review i'm also going to be doing
swatches for you guys on the new lorac
mega Pro palette 2 or the lorac mega pro
2 palette just what people are calling
it this is a $59 Ulta exclusive I did
order mine on the alto shaam website you
can also purchase it in-store you get 16
shimmers and 16 matte eyeshadows in here
and it is very cool toned if you picked
up last year's um which was like in the
red packaging it was a lot more warm and
tone and it just looked absolutely
delectable I did not actually get my
hands on last year's it sold out so
quickly I actually couldn't but this
year I actually waited up until like one
o'clock when this launched on the LG
calm website to get it so I have had it
for about a week now and I feel like I
can give you guys my honest thoughts and
opinions on it so yeah so anyway this is
what the box looks like like I said
really really cute it just has little
tiny finely milled sparkles all over it
and it just says lorac mega Pro 259 dot
$59 it is a 205 dollar value and it is
an Ulta exclusive so it says go pro with
the lorac mega Pro palette 2 created by
sub celebrity makeup artist Carol Shah
this limited edition pro artistry
palette is the sequel to our original
best-selling mega Pro palette double the
size of the original pro palettes the
mega Pro palette 2 is loaded with 16
shimmer and 16 matte eyeshadows to add
to your collection of pro shadows lyrics
velvety smooth shadows are infused with
soothing botanicals and an ultra
pigmented to perform wet or dry you can
use any shade shadow line and find their
eyes just like a pro so if you are not
familiar with the pro formula from lorac
it's absolutely amazing I do own the
lorac Pro palette which is just like the
skinnier version it's got the maps and
the shimmers in it but it's a smaller
version of the mega Pro and it's amazing
i mean the pigmentation of the
you know quality of the shadows are so
buttery they're so beautiful they are
very um they're so creamy and buttery
that when you touch them like you tend
to get a lot of like kick up of the
product which is something that I
experienced with this palette as well
however I just noticed that it's there
so buttery if they actually don't get
like fallout or anything like that it's
the weirdest thing like it's just the
creamiest most buttery formula you will
ever work with pigmentation is
absolutely phenomenal when it comes to
the lorac Pro formula of eyeshadows it's
just phenomenal I have a lot of the rock
you know palettes and general I palettes
and things like that and the palettes
that tend to WoW me the most are
definitely the pro palettes they just
have that wonderful wonderful wonderful
wonderful formula so anyway let me show
you guys a little more about this
palette so this is what it looks like it
looks basically identical to last year's
like I said I did not get my hands on
last year's so I can't really you know
say like oh you know last years was
better or this or that because this is
the first mega Pro that I've gotten my
hands on I know a lot of people are
saying it's very cool and tone which I
feel like it's a dead giveaway since it
is blue last year's was um red and they
do have the same kind of texture so this
one is kind of like that NARS texture
it's kind of um it's got like a little
bit of like give to it if that makes
sense it's got like a little bit of pull
to it but it is very very sleek as you
guys can see I mean this will be perfect
for travel and you open it up it is a
magnetic um you know closure you get a
nice big full mirror right there and
then these are the absolutely gorgeous
shades so you guys can see that I have
gotten in here are already quite a bit I
have really kind of dug around in there
I have used a lot of these already I am
where I'm have on my eyes today if you
guys are curious I have sorbet as my
transition I have porcelain on my brow
bone and all over my lid actually I have
Prosecco on my lid as well that's what's
giving that kind of shimmery a pretty
sparkling look to it I have Gogi in my
r vm cinnamon in my crease and those are
definitely some of my favorite shades in
here goshi cinnamon Prosecco those are
absolutely gorgeous but like it says you
get 16 Maps 16 shimmers and you know the
quality and texture of these I already
was pretty sure I would absolutely love
because I love my lorac Pro palette in
general they just have the buttery asst
creamiest creamiest pigmented most
amazing shadows ever and you know like I
said when you rub your finger in there
you really do pick up a lot of product
and it does kind of kick up some product
but it's weird that when you apply it to
the eyes you actually don't get fallout
I don't get fallout from these from so
that's kind of like on to me I don't
know why but I just always um consider
anything that's super buttery and super
pigmented to give me some sort of follow
up but I don't get fallout from these so
really really love them they are great
with or without an eye primer I have
tried both ways today I'm actually
wearing without an eye primer and I
really love the way it you know it just
basically showed up oh my I don't know
what else to say it really really showed
up well um and I don't get any crazy or
anything like that so you can use them
with or without an eye primary probably
better to use it with a knife primer if
you really want it to last all day but
over all these are just insanely creamy
and pigmented and amazing the quality of
the shadows are just outstanding I
really really like the color formation
here a lot of people are saying you know
Oh compared to last year is it's so much
more cool toned I don't like it as much
I think if I had gotten my hands on last
year's palette I probably would have
enjoyed that one more just because there
were a lot more warm tones in there but
I am kind of digging the cooler tones in
here it is overall a much cooler tones
palette but I really like the way they
threw in you know some warmer shade like
up here like tawny burlap melon and
tangerine you get this wonderful you
know like orange color just kind of
burnt sienna colors really really
interesting how they kind of mix the
colors together you get a matte black in
here you get a whole whole like a
variety and range of like lighter colors
over here which I really like I am a
fair skinned girl and I love a good um
Matt or shimmery you know under brow
kind of color that will really really be
light enough for my skin tone so really
really liking that section over there I
would say if you
have like two medium skin tones you know
you'll probably have any kind of palette
really shows up on you any kind of
lighter color like that but a lot of the
times if you are fair like me a lot of
these sometimes don't even show up on
you so I really like that they gave you
a nice range you get to shimmers to
matts and overall I'm just really really
impressed and just I'm loving this
palette guy from just really loving it I
love how easy it is I love how I can dip
in any kind of brush and start working
it into my eye and it blends out like a
dream you do not want to over blend
these shadows and because they can be
over blended because they are so soft
and creamy the more you kind of go back
and forth the more they can almost
disappear so it's one of those great
palettes then even beginners can use
because you just start working it you
know into your crease or something like
that and it basically blends itself
because of the actual you know quality
of the product it's amazing the
formulation of amazing you guys so
really really loving this um I really
don't have a lot of bad things to say
about it overall I just think um it
really just depends on what kind of
colors you like I feel like everybody
would like the lorac Pro formulation of
eyeshadows it's just like a given if you
have last year's and you really like
warmer tones you probably might not want
this one but if you do want something
with a little more cooler tones this is
absolutely lovely and you guys can also
see in here you do get quite a few pops
of color you get blue quartz you get
gold leaf you get these nice like um
sort of like jewel tones like a few
jewel tones in here that really really
pops so really really lovely and I'm
just absolutely loving this palette you
guys so let's go ahead and starts
watching I'm actually going to go
vertically so that I can Squatch like in
a row on my hand so I'm going to go down
this way so we're going to start over
here with the lighter shades so the
first one is called porcelain and this
is a matte and you guys they just feel
so creamy I just can't I can't the
second one is called bisque I'm going to
swatch these in a row for you guys the
third one is called sugar and this one
is a shimmer and then you get moonlight
so you're kind of working down from the
top shade which is kind of more
eh I don't know I've guess I would say
so you have this right here and this top
shade right here that is the first one
that one is porcelain and it's
definitely a max got a little more of a
yellow or warmer undertone to it so it's
really really beautiful and then you get
disc which is also a math but it's got a
little more of a pink undertone so just
depending on if you have a pink under
torn undertone or a more yellow warm
undertone you can use either of those
all over your latest egg wash of color
and then the third one that we have
there is called sugar and that one is a
little more warm but it has shimmer in
it and then the fourth one is called
moonlight and that one is like very very
yellow and has a lot of shimmer in it so
that is the first row and like I said I
feel like you get such an array of
different kind of you know I keep
wanting to say under brow colors I
remember colors know like you know um
just a lot of different highlighting
shades that you can work with you could
probably wear these two on your cheek
bones down your nose really really love
that so the next row that we're going to
do is this one right here it goes from
kind of like this custard color which is
kind of a yellowy mat into a little more
like purples and things like that so the
first one like i said is custard and
this is a matte it is like a matte
yellow I would say it's a little more
yellow toned than porcelain is but
really really beautiful the second one
is called lavender and this is a matte
lavender color and it's really really
beautiful you guys the third one is
called chiffon and this one is um kind
of like a how do you describe that it's
almost like it's got like a purple
undertone in it but it's kind of more of
like a pink color and then we have sea
shell which is very very similar to
moonlight the other one that i swatched
but this one is more like a bisque kind
of undertone so starting down here we've
got custard then we have lavender then
chiffon and seashell at the top hope you
guys can see those really really
beautiful alright next we are going down
this one right here and we go tani
purple Prosecco and p.m.
I love the shade prosecco it is one of
my favorites I will stop and tell you
guys we are hitting some of my favorite
shades but I have Prosecco on my lid
today it's gorgeous so the first one is
called Thani and this is kind of like a
really really perfect like transition
shade I would call it it's kind of like
a medium toned matte brown but it's got
a lot of like yellow in it and then we
have purple which is a matte purple
color and it's very basic just a purple
color very very pretty then we have
Prosecco which like I said is one of my
favorites I absolutely love it so I'm
going to swatch those three first so
down here we have a tawny then we have
purple than we have Prosecco and I love
Prosecco cuz got like that bubbliness in
it you know it really looks like it just
opened a bottle of Prosecco it's just so
um shimmery and absolutely gorgeous so
those are the first three in that row
and then the last one we have is peony
which is also a shimmery shade and this
one is um it's kind of a beautiful
peachy kind of pinky undertone to it
really really gorgeous highly shimmery
almost like duochrome kind of thing
going on absolutely gorgeous all right
to the next row we are going to do is
starts with burlap and it goes to sorbet
then South plum and dark Siena sober lip
is a really interesting it's kind of
like a I don't know every time I look at
this I'm like if it's like a like cubish
that's so weird you guys it's like a
brown it's similar to tawny except it's
got more of a green undertone in it if
that makes sense like it's just got a
lot more green in it it's just kind of
it's different if that makes sense it's
just different so that is amber laughs
right there let me show you guys up
close quickly so you can see so there's
Thani and there's burlap can you see
that you know Thani has a little more of
like warmth to it whereas burlap hats
like a little more flaky greenish under
tongue a little more coolness the second
one we have is sorbet this is one that I
have in my crease today is my transition
color absolutely gorgeous medium toned
mouths kind of pink color then we have
soft plum which is really nice too it is
a shimmery color and it's kind of like a
kind of similar to sorbet except it's
got more of a purpley undertone and then
we have dark Sienna which is a beautiful
beautiful dark chocolate brown
on with lots and lots and lots of
shimmer so there are little ooh that one
went over my knuckle kind of weird but
we have burlap we've got sorbet we've
got sarp soft plum and then dark Sienna
really really beautiful all right I'm
moving on we are going to go to this
little row which starts to get into some
more warm tones so we've got melon goji
cinnamon and Penny melon is absolutely
gorgeous I am wearing goji today in my
outer V like I told you guys one of my
favorite shades in there and cinnamon
depending up also one of my favorite so
this little vertical line is definitely
a favorite of mine in general so melon
is a beautiful beautiful um Matt even
know what I would call this like soft
orange color I guess you could say
really really beautiful really gorgeous
and then go she is also mapped and it's
just a beautiful berry with like a
little more of a mob undertone than very
like not so much red undertone but just
a little more of like a moth undertone
it is completely matte as well then you
have cinnamon which is gorgeous it is
just a um I don't even know I was going
to say it's like a dirty penny but it's
not because penny the color after that
is coming up this is like a beautiful
just perfect bronzy neutral bronzy shade
really gorgeous highly shimmery and then
we have penny which is literally like a
dirty penny really really beautiful
cinnamon and Penny together are
absolutely stunning gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous so impressed with this
palette you guys so impressed all right
now we are moving on to tangerine
Cabernet Sam stone and olivine so
tangerine like I told you guys really
gorgeous it is just a completely matte
neutral like orange color it's almost
got a little bit of like a burnt
undertone you know like a little more um
like it goes a little more Brown than
orange orange if that makes sense but it
is absolutely gorgeous and I love that
they threw that in there so different
next we have Cabernet which is also a
mat and this is just a beautiful wine
kind of know it looks deeper in the
palette it looks like
going to be a chocolate brown in the
palette but um when you actually swatch
it out and when you wear it on your eye
it's just a deep wine kind of color and
it is completely mad as well like I said
it then we have state samstone it
sandstone and this is a shimmer and this
is beautiful it's not like grayish pinky
undertone in it you guys see that it's
got a little bit of pink eNOS in it I
like it and then we have olivine which
is really really great and this one has
a little more of a silver on your time
I'd say lines up they're really
beautiful all right I need another wife
hold on guys oh this is the big pilot's
watch alright next we are going to be
going into the row where it starts to
get like a little deeper and darker in
color so we have a saddle we have ash we
have gunmetal and we have gold leaf so
saddle is just a deep chocolate brown
it's a matte it's gorgeous and not a
whole lot to say there yep next we have
ash which is a deep matte Ashley color
it's got a lot of purple in it actually
and a lot of little bit of that mob but
a little bit of like navy blue in it
it's right there ash gorgeous then we
have gunmetal this is a true silver got
a little bit AV blue undertone in it
gunmetal highly shimmery and gold leaf
which is also very shimmery and this one
is a very very true gold color no orange
undertone true true gold with a lot of
yellow beautiful and now we have come to
the last little row and this one has
forest black blue quartz and black I be
in it too so we're right there and don't
you love how like lorac doesn't go all
crazy with their names like they just
give it to how it it's like porcelain
black blue gold I think that's so funny
but anyway so forest is a deep deep um
hunter green color and it is completely
happy
really interesting shade to get in a
palette that's completely mad so that is
what forest green looks like I'm not
just forest and then we have black black
is just a black matte color and you know
what I appreciate having a good nice
matte black in any sort of palette and
the next one is called blue quartz this
is really really stunning color it is
very um very very I don't want to say
super like shimmery but it's just a
gorgeous gorgeous almost looks like it's
deeper in the pan than it is when you
actually swatch it out but it's just a
gorgeous color can you guys see that I
feel like you could use that as like a
pop of color underneath the lower lash
line or even on your lid it's just
gorgeous and the last color in the
palette is called black ivy and I would
actually love this color as much as I
thought I would um it kinda reminds me
of like a smoky black color and I feel
like if I'm gonna go black I want lat
black you know what I mean so they do
give you black in the palette but this
one has almost like a greenish undertone
with a ton of gold shimmer so anyway
those are all of the shades washed like
I said the formulation is absolutely
beautiful I actually really do like the
way they kind of put the colors together
in this palette I think that it was done
in a really good way and they really
knew what they wanted because of the
year before they had done the warm
colors and this is really cool toned but
still really really cool they pop in
some jewel tones and it's really awesome
and I think that for $59 it's such a
steal honestly for the formulation it's
just awesome so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and swatches of the
new lorac mega pro 2 palette i'm like i
said i did not have last year's if you
did let me know below what you thought
of it how you're comparing this year's
to last year's i'm really curious to
know because honestly when i look at
videos of people showing the one from
last year i think i always end up
thinking wow I think I would have liked
that one better and maybe it wouldn't
have picked up this one but because I
have nothing to compare it to other than
just my regular lock
Pro palette um I think that it's
fantastic so I wonder you know I wonder
sometimes if I had gotten my hands on
that one I wonder if you know maybe I
would have loved this one as much as i
do but i absolutely adore this one and
I'm very happy for what I do have so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
