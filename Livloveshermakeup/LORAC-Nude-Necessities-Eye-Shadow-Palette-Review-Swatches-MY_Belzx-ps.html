thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day i'm
here to give you guys my review my
thoughts and swatches on the new lorac
new necessities eyeshadow palette i
purchased this for thirty dollars on the
altar comp website it is exclusive to
alta and you can also type in your zip
code on the online website to see if
there is if your store that is near you
has it in store yet I don't believe
every single one does because i took the
my zip code and it said it was not
available in store yet so i did order it
on the online website but i'm gonna read
for you guys a little bit about what it
says on the back of the box quickly so
you guys can kind of understand what
this palette is all about it has really
been a very very hyped up the past
couple weeks i would say maybe a week
week and a half on instagram if you
follow lorac they really really been
kind of hyping this product up and a lot
of people have been talking about it so
let me just kind of tell you guys what
it's supposed to be like because i feel
like they really give a good explanation
on the back of the box so it says get
natural definition and subtle highlight
with lorac nude necessities eyeshadow
palette this sleek and sexy eyeshadow
palette contains 12 silky nude tomed I
shadows with buildable plentiful and
highly pigmented color create soft
delicate and wearable combinations with
shimmer and highlighters Matt faces and
transitional shadows and
color-coordinated rows of warm cool and
neutral shades that are perfect for
everyday wear achieve the no makeup
makeup look with lorac so they are
really really going for a basic basic
nude sort of palette they're not saying
oh it's going to give you tons and tons
of cut you know color on your lids and
things like that they're really telling
you is kind of like a no-makeup makeup
sort of palette so I think there's a lot
of pros to this palette I think there
are a few cons as well and i'll talk
about that in a little bit but this is
what the outside of the packaging looks
like it's a beautiful kind of gun metal
mirrored palette all the way on the
front and the back i would have
preferred if it was all like rose gold I
think rose gold is gorgeous but I do
like the kind of gun metal packaging it
does have a really decent sized mirror
in there and then here are these shades
so as you guys are going to be able to
see right away and the first thing that
I noticed when I first opened this
palette was the fact that a lot of these
colors don't have a lot of
um I don't know how to describe it when
I look at them they are so so similar
and when i swatched them and when i put
them on my eyes the colors are so they
are only like a smidge away from each
other when it comes to like color
variances I guess you could say if they
really really don't vary in color they
are very very very similar so that is
the first thing that I noticed and that
was kind of one of the cons I was just
like wow like are those even going to
show up on my eyes as different colors
are they all going to blend together and
start to look a little muddled and muddy
and I um ran it on my eyes today and I
don't feel like they look muddled or
muddy together I can definitely tell
where I have different colors I'm
wearing this white shade all over my lid
and then i have this gold shade right
here i have that on my outer part of my
lid and then this kind of warmer lighter
gold shade it has a little bit of a
champagne e touch to it i had that on
the inner part of my lid and then i have
this color right here in my crease this
on my lower lashline and i feel like i
can tell and when i'm looking in the
mirror up close I can see okay there's
like the lighter gold champagne color
there's the darker color there but as
far as like finishes go I can't really
tell whether they're Matt whether
they're shimmery I feel like the
shimmery shades really don't have tons
and tons of shimmer in them there's
definitely no chunky glittery shades in
here and the map ones just kind of seem
to blend all together the second little
con about this palette is I'm already
starting to have some issues with colors
seeping into each other I wish they
would have given these colors names so
that there was a little more space in
between them so that they don't start to
seep together because right here i have
a matte shade and it's already starting
to seep into that shimmery shade and I'm
just like I don't want that I don't like
that but overall I would say that the
formula is pretty darn good it is not
the lorac Pro formula um I love the
lorac Pro formula it is one of the most
amazing formulas ever they are so
buttery they are so creamy they are so
blendable but I'm telling you right now
it is not the lorac Pro formula however
it also is
just their basic formula if here i have
the summer glow eyeshadow palette and
the party eyeshadow palette I feel like
lorac has to sort of formulas that they
come out with this is their regular and
then they have their pro formula I
definitely prefer the pro formula I just
think it's so buttery and blendable
highly pigmented awesome I would say
that this palette falls right in between
I find that it is very very blendable
very very pigmented I but I just don't
feel like it is as buttery and soft as
the pro formula so that is definitely
something to remember this is not the
pro formula however I do think that
these we're pretty long like on the eyes
pretty long on the I think they are very
long wearing on the eyes especially if
you wear a primer I'm going to do
swatches for you guides without a primer
I think that they do work without a
primer but they do crease a little bit
if you're not wearing one so I highly
recommend pairing this with a primer
anyone will do i'm wearing the benefit
eyelid primer today but i also have worn
the shadows with the elf one dollar
primer and sheer and it was great as
well so overall I think the formula is
good it's not as buttery and soft and
pigmented as the pro formula but it's
also not as scratchy as the regular
formula that they have of their eye
shadow palette so it's a nice in between
and I feel like again for thirty dollars
it's just a really really good price now
i am at the altar calm website right now
and it says shades and it shows that
there are sort of colors but i don't
think that these are official colors
because you can see on the back of the
palette there are no names on the inside
of the panel that there are no names and
on the back of the box there are no
names by the way when you open the
palette it does come with that little
sleeve protector i'm going to be tossing
that but i just want to let you guys
know so it says road one they show the
color is called white and it's a mat and
then they show light gold which is a
shimmer this one is called gold which is
also a shimmer and then taupe and this
one is also a matte obvious in the
station i'm sorry this one is a mat and
then they show row two this one is
called light nude which is they matched
cool light brown is a shimmer cool taupe
is a mat and then Brown is
and then they show rose three nude is a
shimmer lect copper is a shimmer tan is
a matte and cool brown is a matte so I
don't really feel like those are names
for the palette I feel like those are
just basically telling you what the
actual color is so I do not think there
are official names for this palette but
when I swatch them i will tell you guys
you know what it says on the website so
one thing I will say that I really
really do adore about this palette is
that there are some damn good transition
colors in here I love a good transition
color I am wearing this one right here
today and that one is called light nude
which is a matte and it is beautiful
it's got a beautiful kind of pinky
undertone I think it's perfect for those
who have fair skin like me and then i
have to say all of the matte colors and
here are really really great for
transition this one right here is called
cool sorry cool taupe this one right
here is called tan which is also a mat
and then this one up here is called
taupe which is a matte and i feel like
these could be transition colors for
everybody from pale skin all the way
down to a deep deep dark skin so we
really love that i think that's
fantastic um and yeah I feel like it is
just a very very basic neutral palette
if you are someone like me who collects
makeup you love makeup you just want
every single palette that comes out I
don't really think that you need to have
this one you probably already have a lot
in your collection that you could do out
with these colors I feel like if I dug
into my Alex drawers right now I could
definitely find probably dupes at the
drugstore and also just dupes in general
for the colors the formulation is really
really nice and buttery but I probably
could find dupes for the formulation as
well but overall I think that if you are
a makeup collector it's not really a
necessity so is this the rock nude
necessities and necessity not
necessarily however if you are someone
who really does like they're neutral
makeup you never really go out of the
neutral boundaries like you don't really
like color pops and things like that and
you know that you would get a lot of use
out of something like this I think it is
a very very well priced and definitely a
good formulation so it's hard to mess up
a look with this palette to be
completely honest like today I didn't do
tons and tons of blending on
I look and I feel like it looks pretty
and it doesn't look horrible I feel like
it's very very hard to mess up with
these kind of shades there definitely is
I know they say that there is supposed
to be like a cool toned and warm toned
theme in here I see a little more cool
over here but for the most part I find
it to be a little more on the warm side
but again I think it's very very pretty
on the skin and I think would work for a
lot of skin tone so let's go ahead and
just get started on these swatches so
I'm going to start as they like describe
it row one row to row three so starting
here this first one right here is called
white and it is a matte color and I have
this all over my lid today and this is a
pure stark white color it has absolutely
no like yellow undertone in it no pink
undertone it is just stark white and its
really beautiful very very brightening
so that is the first shade right there
the second color is this kind of
champagne II color like I talked about
that is the one that I have on the first
half of my lid and this one is called
light gold it is a shimmer and it's
right there on my middle finger don't
mean to flick you guys off oh I will say
ok this was weird I didn't get a lot of
Saul out when i use this like today
especially I felt like I really was
dragging some of these colors on my
lower lash line I don't get a lot of
fallout but when i dip my brush in i
think they're real reason that they seep
into each other like the colors start to
seep into each other it's not just
because they're really close but because
you get a lot of kick up however i
didn't notice that i got a lot of
fallout so i don't know what that's all
about but anyway this is light gold and
that is the shimmer shade really
beautiful the third one is called gold
shimmer and it is right there my ring
finger there is gold shimmer and then
the last one in this row is called taupe
which is a matte and that is all mopey
key cannot move my pinky without moving
like another finger so there is what's
it go taupe
alright next row and by the way i am not
watching these with primer so just keep
that in mind they really do show up a
lot more bold and bright when you use a
primer alright the next row is this one
right here it's a little more cool toned
the first one is called light nude and
it is a matte color that is the one that
I used as my transition today the one
that I was talking about that I really
really liked let's get a little more of
that it's a hard color you can't really
see it so there is light nude the second
shade is a shimmer it's called cool
brown it's right there there is cool
brown the third one in this row is
called cool taupe and it is a matte it's
on my ring finger you see what I mean
like there's not a lot of difference
between those two shades right there and
it doesn't really come off that like on
the eyes too like you can see it's hard
to describe like I can tell the
difference between the gold and the dark
brown but like these two Browns right
here I wouldn't be able to tell a
difference on my eye and then the last
one in that row is called brown and it
is a share so you can see those last
three colors just sort of similar but
again if they really described on the
back of the boxes that's what they were
going for this is almost like a
no-makeup makeup sort of palette so
alright and then the last row isn't this
one down here it's a little more warm
toned rule number three the first one is
called nude and it is a shimmer that is
what it looks like beautiful lid color
the second color is called light copper
and this is also a shimmer some a middle
finger the third color is a matte and it
is called tan I think this would be a
great transition color on darker skins
gals or guys there it is and then the
last one in here is called cool brown
which is a Matins definitely a cool
brown color there they are so those are
all the swatches on this palette like I
said if you are an avid makeup hoarder /
collector like me I don't really think
that you need this I feel like you could
definitely find lots and lots of dupes
for this in your collection but if you
are someone who really likes subtle
looks and you don't like tons and tons
of color variety I think you would
really really enjoy this palette so
