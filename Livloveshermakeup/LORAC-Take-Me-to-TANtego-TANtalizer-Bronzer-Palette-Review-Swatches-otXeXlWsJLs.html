this video I'm giving you guys a review
and swatches on the new lorac take me to
tend hey go palette I was so excited
when I saw that this released it
basically is on Nicole's comm website as
of right now I have no idea when it's
going to be available at Ulta but it
will be available I'll take in the
future but I'm a link below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
it up from the Kohl's calm website I did
purchase it for $30 and you basically
get this little box right here and then
you do get a little brush with this
palette as well which is why it's not
$25 it's very very similar to the lorac
unzipped cheek palette which is $25
which is the same exact packaging and
concept it has two shimmer shades and
two matte blushes and this new bronzer
palette is the same sort of concept same
exact size and packaging and it has two
mat bronzers and to shimmer bronzers so
I was super super excited and like I
said I think the reason it is $30 is
because you also do get a little brush
with it the brush is actually not that
bad I did use the brush today to apply
it this product and I like it it's very
very fluffy not super super dense but I
think that's good because a lot of these
monsters are actually quite dark so
anyway this is just supposed to be a
little travel friendly bronzer palette
so that you can kind of bronze your face
up basically on the go and I absolutely
love it I think it's a great little
concept and for $30 it's definitely
worth it you do get 0.42 ounces or 12
grams of product in here and you do get
a nice little mirror as you guys can see
and then this is what the actual palette
looks like now check out those names how
cute is that tan Antonio Tan Diego Cabo
San Lucas and then we have tanta cruise
so I think that is so adorable I love
the names on here just really really
cute and look at how gorgeous the shades
are you're getting a nice variety of two
mats on the top two shimmers on the
bottom and you're getting cool tones in
here you're getting warm tones you're
getting some with a little bit of
glitter and some with a little bit of
shimmer these are absolutely stunning I
am wearing the shades tan Antonio today
and the two mats you guys are so
freaking buttery and delicious on the
skin I have them on today I did use this
little brush its whit
not that bad I do like that it's not
super super densely packed because I
personally feel like when I am browsing
my skin or even just doing a little bit
of contouring which I kind of did with
that tan Antonio today I don't want
something that's super super harsh
because that is just gonna be really
obvious but this was really nice because
it is a tapered brush and it just went
right into the hollow of my cheek really
nicely and I kind of buffed it in
quickly and then around the outer
perimeter of my face love this shade
right here it's beautiful for us fair
girls I was a little nervous about this
shade down here called Santa Cruz
because it's like a cool toned super
super dark shade I don't know how it's
picking up on camera but it is dark it
is quite dark so I was a little nervous
about that one but honestly I can use
that as a contouring shade really really
lightly and it's beautiful so as a fair
girl who are the very fair complexion I
am actually loving every single shade in
here I'm loving how you get some warmer
tones I'm liking how the undertones in
the warmer tones are more red tone to
than orange tones I personally really
really like that and I think you guys
will appreciate that as well and then I
love the deeper cooler tones so the
actual pigmentation is amazing they're
very creamy very blendable the two matte
shades are actually a lot creamier a lot
creamier and more blendable than the two
shimmer shades and that's you know I
feel like that's just kind of given a
lot a lot of the times matte shades are
a lot more smoother in my opinion when
it comes to cheek products but with
eyeshadows it's not really that way
sometimes they're a little more chalky
but these are super super creamy and
blendable and then these are still
really really soft don't get me wrong
like these are beautiful and really
really soft as well the two bottom
shades but I just feel like the matte
shades have the best formulation so I
personally I'm really really loving this
the wear time on these is very very
strong I have been wearing at the shade
tan Antonio pretty much all day today
and I'm loving it so far and I did wear
it yesterday as well and it lasted
really nice amount of time on my face so
really really beautiful little palette
let me go ahead and give you guys some
swatches so the first one is tan Antonio
which is that gorgeous matte shade that
I have today that I have on today I
should say it's really really beautiful
love how blendable these are too I feel
like sometimes you get a bronzer or like
a contouring product that is too dark
and then it's also just not blendable
like you know what I mean it doesn't
really have like a blendable formulation
these are so buttery and easy to blend
so that is tan
tonio the next shape we have is tan
Diego which is also a mat and this one
is so oh god they're so creamy and
buttery I will say when you put your
brush in here you do get a little bit of
kick up but it's nothing crazy a
horrible this one is a lot deeper in
tone and it has a little more of a cool
tone and I just love it there is that
one right there and that one is tan ta
go so here we have tan Antonio and then
tan ta go those are the two mats and
then the two shimmers are Cabo San Lucas
and then we have Santa Cruz so this is
Cabo Tim Lucas and this one is very very
similar to can Diego except it has a
little bit of shimmer in it like gold
and shimmer really beautiful it almost
goes on filed on the cheeks there it is
my gorgeous I love it and then the last
one we have a Santa Cruz which has that
really really cool kind of reddish
undertone I know that didn't make sense
really really cool tone but has a
undertone of a red tone if that makes
sense
really really beautiful this one is a
very very dark I have to use they very
very fluffy brush with this and he liked
hands so there we have Cabo San Lucas
and then Santa Cruz so I feel like the
shimmery ones go on kind of foiled on
the cheeks which is awesome you can use
these just to bronze your face you can
use them as a blush as a blush topper
you can do whatever you want I put these
shades at Santa Cruz on the apples of my
cheeks the other day and I thought it
looked really beautiful like I looks
like I was really just glowing from
within and I loved it and then I feel
like you can definitely contour with the
two shades that are on the top the tan
Antonio in San Diego depending on your
skin tone if you are deeper in like
complexion and then I am I don't think
it's really going to work for you as a
contouring product but again they don't
actually like say that this is a
contouring palette it literally is just
a on-the-go travelling bronzer palette
so overall I'm really loving this I
think it is worth it for me $30 like I
said I will link below in the
description bar but you guys keep
picking up thank you so much for joining
me I do want to add when you do purchase
from the Kohl's website you also get a
free gift with purchase
this is the lorac Cobra mascara and I
quote it just fell out of my hands
I feel like you get a nice amount of
product in here it's like a little just
until life-size sample and this is what
it looks like so yeah kind of like a
nice little free gift with purchase and
like I said the
she's not too bad or too shabby either

quick review on the new Arak 10 ta go
