welcome back to look at the week of
where I recreate either of my favorite
makeup look I was wearing this week or I
do my most requested makeup look from
the week so today we will be doing a my
a favorite makeup look that I was
wearing this week I don't even think you
guys got to see it on camera because it
was a day where I was filming a
declutter video um but it does feature
the lorac mega pro 3 eyeshadow palette
and today we are also going to do a
first impressions as well on the Wet n
Wild mega glow highlighting gold bar the
shade that I have is Halle gold head and
this is what it looks like I did take
the little tag off but I have not even
touched this yet and this was sent to me
by a friend she has really good luck
when it comes to the limited edition
items from Wet n Wild so she sent this
to me and if you guys didn't know last
week I did do a first impressions on the
Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting powder
in the shade rose what does it call I
was gonna say rose petal precious petals
this is what precious petals looks like
and here is the gold bar so if you were
curious about color white I think this
one's more rose gold this one is more of
a true gold this was also sent to me by
a friend I think everybody just knows
that I seem to have issues finding
limited edition stuff from Wet n Wild
here in my area but anyway we are going
to do a first impressions on this little
guy I feel like they're trying to do
like these Charlotte Tilbury thing with
us so and that will be interesting in
our really interested in trying that out
that's what I'm trying to say sorry guys
that's really early in the morning when
I'm filming this and I am filming this
on Friday so that I can hopefully get
this up Saturday morning for you guys
because a lot of you were saying in my
last one like I want to get ready with
you but you got this video up at like
8:00 p.m. so we are filming on Friday so
that we can do that so I just keep
saying so so so anyway let's go ahead is
just jump right into it shall we
the first item I am going to use is my
Maybelline master primer long-lasting
eyeshadow base the shade is either 515
or 520 I honestly can't remember it
doesn't even have like the little label
on it anymore it came off completely so
I'm not quite sure and if you are
curious I have already put on my
skincare and it already sunk in so I am
just putting this all over my eyelids
this is my all-time favorite eyeshadow
primer I adore it and after I put that
on I'm just gonna go ahead and tap it in
with my finger and NEX
I will take underneath my eye as well
which is what I like to do with my eye
primers especially if they are more of a
smooth one and not so much of a like
tacky eye base so I am just patting that
on and then as far as my eye primer is
concerned this week I've actually been
using a tinted moisturizer balm from
Bobbi Brown
it's the SPF 25 tented moisturizing balm
in the shade alabaster tint and this is
a really interesting product it is
something I'm trying to use that in 2016
as this is what it looks like and like I
said he does have SPF 25 and the shade
is alabaster tint and it looks like it
would have a lot of coverage to it but
it really doesn't so I just take a nice
thick glob of that and I like to just
put it all over my face avoiding my eye
area and I'm just kind of tapping it on
it's a really nice color match but it
really doesn't have a lot of coverage so
I'm just kind of tapping that on and
then I will be going in with a brush to
kind of blend that in and the brush that
I have been using is this kind of
smaller brush right here I will be doing
a collab video featuring these little
brushes these are kind of like a dupe
for the artiste brushes and it is from
the pro balance line I got a set of 10
of these on Amazon and on Monday I will
have a collab video going up with my
friend Meg who also purchased kind of
like a dupe for the artiste brushes and
we're gonna tell you guys if we think
they are worth it but I'm taking this I
think this is the third largest brush
and I am just kind of putting this on I
will say this particular brush set to
there are definitely some hits and
misses but I will mostly be using the
hits in this particular video so I'm
just blending that in and one thing I
will say about these brushes that is
that it really does blend in quickly and
you know you guys know me I'm one of
those people that really likes to put my
makeup on quickly so that is what our
primer is going to be next we're gonna
go in with our foundation and the
foundation I have been wearing this week
is the Revlon Colorstay whipped creme
foundation and this is what it looks
like the shade that I wear is called 110
ivory and I'm just gonna take a tiny
dollop of this and put it all over my
face
I noticed if I wore too much of this
this week that you've really started to
look bad so I'm basically just dotting
this all over my face and then we will
blend it in with another one of those
artiste dupe brushes
and the one I'm going to take is the
largest one which looks like this so I'm
just going to go ahead and kind of put
this on I do like the way that the
foundation applies with this brush but I
will say if I layer this if I start
layering this foundation for whatever
reason is started to look very cakey on
me this week I think it's mostly because
my combination skin is kind of getting
out of its oily phase and going into its
dry phase for the winter time and I
don't think I can handle too much of
this foundation during the winter so I'm
just wearing one layer of it and it does
give pretty good coverage if you do one
layer if you do like two layers you get
really full coverage but I would say one
layer will give you a nice solid and
medium coverage and I do find that it
lasts quite a long time on the face so
after we have blended that in I am going
to go in with my concealer the concealer
that I have been wearing this week is
one of my favorites it's actually like a
color correcting concealer this is from
Maybelline it is the instant age rewind
eraser dark circle treatment and I am
taking this underneath my eyes all the
way down to my nose kind of doing that
little triangle I'm also taking it on my
eyelids I love the brightening effect
from this and it's just such a good
product I know everyone raves about this
and I really do think it is a wonderful
wonderful brightening concealer from the
drugstore I'm also taking it down the
bridge of my nose a little bit on to at
my forehead and on my chin and then to
blend that in I'm gonna be taking and
the second two largest brush from that
oval collection or they call it the
mermaid brush collection which is really
huge because it does look like a mermaid
brush and I'm just kind of going ahead
and blending that in I will say some of
the smaller brushes in here I would
recommend like if you have the artiste
ones go ahead and use the smaller brush
for this since it would fit better
underneath the eye area but I do find
some of them in this set could be a
little scratchy which is why I'm using
the third largest one so I'm just kind
of going and blending this and I do one
thing I'll say about these is that
they're really meant to kind of like
pull on this and not pull on the skin
but it's meant to kind of like semi
strokes with the actual brush not so
much like stipple like this I do notice
that it gets splotchy if I stipple but I
am someone who really likes to stipple
I'm I found a
and I also like my powder and stuff like
that so I just wanted to put that out
there really quickly but again I'll talk
about that more on Mondays and video
after shop and swatch my stash all right
and then I'm going to blend underneath
my neck as well make sure there is no
line there and now we're gonna go ahead
and set everything in the powder that I
have been using it's my essence all
about Matt 16 compact powder which is
one of my all-time favorites and again
just like last week I'm going to be
taking this morphe angled foundation
brush I really like this it's very big
for a foundation brush and I like to
take my powder and stipple it on I
really like the way it gets underneath
the eye area I feel like if you use this
brush underneath the eye area and for
your whole face there's no need to go in
with an extra like under-eye powder
because it really fits into that area
really nicely and I am just stippling
this all over my face to completely set
everything in and this is smaller than
like your standard powder brush but I
really like how precise it is and you
know like I said I really like to
stipple my products so I think that this
is a really really great option and if
you've never tried this particular
powder before it is very good if you
have combo at least again alright next
we are going to go in with our blush
we'll actually really go in with our
bronzer first the bronzer that I have
been wearing this week that I've been
getting a few questions on oh very very
powdery the bronzer I have been wearing
is the Too Faced sweet Hertz bronzer in
sweet tea hold on let me just wipe down
my lips um
it is the Too Faced sweet hurts fronds
are in sweet tea a lot of people were
asking about this I think this is a
fantastic review and I still love this
particular bronzer people were saying
that it tends to look muddy on them I do
find that no matter what brush I use
when I pick this product up by the way
we're gonna be using this really really
fluffy not so densely packed kind of
flimsy where's this from I think this is
a BH Cosmetics little kabuki brush I
find that no matter what when I place it
like onto my face it looks like there's
like a little bit of a bruise there so
you really want to tap off the excess I
the deal with this bronzer is the fact
that it really really is
it's very very powdery and it also has
quite pigmented so you just have to be
kind of careful but I really just like
to use a very very fluffy brush with
this guy and I don't go too crazy so
putting it underneath and then another
really great thing to do if you are
someone who you know tends to have
issues with bronzer or even just putting
it onto your face if you're really
really fair one thing you can do is go
back in with your powder brush and then
go over that area again which is what I
do so I go over and I make sure that
everything is blended and it's not
looking like I have a bruise on my
forehead a war that's on the side of my
jaw so I really like this I don't know
how it's picking up on camera but I feel
like this bronzer looks relatively
natural on my skin tone one side is more
cool tone one side is more warm toned
and when you do mix them together I
think you get a little bit of both you
get like a little bit of warmth and a
little bit of coolness but I still
really like it it still is one of my
favorite bronzers so alright next we are
gonna go in with our blush blush that I
have been using this week is the Elsa
blush palette this is what it looks like
this is the light version I have both of
them and I decided to keep both of them
through my declutter series because
these are really awesome blushes and the
shape that I'm going to take is this one
down here it's kind of like the darkest
shade it's more of a red tone with a
little bit of gold shimmer in there what
did I just drop okay it was the brush
it's got a little bit of gold shimmer in
there and I'm taking my mimimi cosmetics
blush brush I'm tapping in there and
tapping off the excess you guys cuz
these are very very pigmented and then
I'm just working this on to the apple of
my cheek and I really really love this
color I don't feel like the gold is
super super prominent the little
shimmers in there so if you're worried
about it looking kind of crazy on your
cheeks don't worry it's not super super
prominence but I definitely recommend
using a light hand if you're gonna use
this darkest shade especially if you are
quite fair like I am because it is a
true kind of reddish color but it really
looks nice like you just like walked out
but I don't know like you just walked
inside from the coals or like you just
went on a runner
no it's like a really natural flushed
cheek look and then again I like to go
over with that powder brush again and
you could do the buffing technique which
would properly blend everything but I
just like to make sure there's no harsh
lines again because I am quite fair some
of these colors can be very very dark
looking so you just want to make sure
all right guys I'm moving on and we are
gonna go ahead and do that first
impressions on the wet and wild make a
glow bar so here it is and like I said I
feel like this is probably their way of
trying to do that Charlotte Tilbury what
was it her gold bar thing and I thought
that when I looked at this up close it
was a little more firmly press than that
other Mecca glow highlighting powder
from last week so I'm really gonna pick
it up with my Sigma tapered highlighter
f-35 brush really get in there tap off
that excess and then we're just gonna
start putting this on oh girl it is
quite pigmented it is very a very gold
tone so if you are very very fair just
know that this is like pure gold like
pure gold color but it is very pretty I
wonder if you guys can see that I hope
that's picking up on camera I'm gonna
have to go ahead and go over with my
powder brush the down the nose area and
also on the chin because those are flat
surfaces so if you just have a
straight-up darker color there it will
look dark but on the side of the
cheekbone you have a little bit of a
slant going on here so it doesn't really
matter if it's too dark but I'm just
taking that and kind of building it up
going down to the apple of my cheek can
you guys see that
oh ho god it's so glowy I will tell you
like these wet-and-wild highlighters are
really really beautiful oh and that
looks great I love it I love it again
gonna take that brush really quickly go
over make sure there are no harsh lines
first impressions on that is it is
beautiful I think if you do have a warm
undertone like that would look extremely
natural on you I am someone who pulls a
very very strong cool undertone so it
may not look as natural but I still
think it looks pretty alright moving on
we are going to go ahead and let's curl
our lashes first and then for brows I'm
not really gonna do anything with brows
I really have been not doing anything
Brow's this week so I'm just gonna brush
them up with my spoolie this is from ELF
it's a one dollar spoolie and I did pick
out a brow product this week but I just
haven't been using it sometimes I really
am into doing my brows and sometimes I'm
not actually for the most part I feel
like I never really eyes so I'm just
gonna brush them up today we're gonna
curl our lashes quickly which is
something that I have been neglecting to
do pretty much all week I don't know why
I used to be obsessed with curling my
lashes and now I'm just kind of like
it's like that extra stuff I don't want
to take know why alright so let's go
ahead and also put on her eyeliner the
eyeliner I will be wearing is the next
slide on glide on stay on and definitely
a turn-on eyeliner in the shade SL 16 a
bronze and I'm gonna put this on to my
waterline and I love the way this pairs
together with that warm toned I look
that we are going to do so you can also
put this on your tight line if you want
to I am just putting it on to my
waterline but this is one of the
prettiest shades especially if you do
have blue eyes love it alright let's go
ahead and get into the lorac mega pro 3
shall we umm let's open it up this is
what the palette looks like fine it
looks so dirty and crazy like I cannot
but okay I'm gonna be taking this wet
and wild crease brush and the first
thing I'm gonna go into is crepe and I
am going to take that all over my lid
all the way up to my brow and this is
going to be kind of our base color I'm
gonna take a little bit underneath my
eye as well and we are just going to
blend that all over and as something
that I've been doing with this palette
this week like I said today we're
focusing on more of a warm tone to eye
look but something that's really cool is
kind of like interchanging the color so
you can do like a warm tone transition
and then go in with a cool color in your
crease and then do a warm outer V and
then go in with like something cool
tones on your lower lash line I really
have been enjoying doing that but I will
say if you tend to stick to just the
cool tone side of the palette or the
warm tone side there definitely is not
like I think there's plenty of
combinations you can do here but I
really do think it looks nice if you mix
and match the cool tones and the warm
so after we have done that I'm going to
go in with another what a wild crease
brush thanks so much to my friend who's
done this to me and we're gonna go into
the shade toffee which is this guy right
here so here was crap and here is toffee
we're going to use that as our
transition shade so I'm going to tap
into that other wet-and-wild brush tap
off that excess since these are very
powdery this is the lorac pro
formulation which is very very well
known for being quite powdery and we're
just working not really messily into the
crease as our transition shade and this
will help so that we can blend these
shadows together really really quickly
and easily and I love these crease
brushes from Wet n Wild they're so soft
device they are synthetic and I highly
recommend checking them out if you can
find that like I said I can never find
any of this at my drugstores I
don't know why but they are very good
alright moving on we're gonna go into
the morphe I'm five-eleven and the she
that I'm going to take is this one right
here which is called a cider which is a
really nice kind of warm tone shade I'm
going to tap into there definitely tap
off that excess and we're gonna start
going ahead and working this into the
crease and I do like the m5 11 cuz it's
a little bigger so it will kind of
diffuse up against the crease as well I
don't even know if that makes sense
oh mama makeup artists guys but what I
do like about it is that it gets the job
done quickly it will kind of go into
your crease and then above your crease
and very very quickly I'm just going
back and forth and then doing small
circular motions and I love this shade
it looks darker in the pan than it does
when you actually put it onto your eye
but that's okay it's still a beautiful
kind of like a warm toned look and I'm
all about warm toned eyes during the
fall so back and forth doing some
circular motions as well and then to
blend that out so we're gonna be taking
our Sigma e35 brush I have like a
bajillion of these and I'm just gonna go
back and forth and kind of do a little
bit of circular motions as well making
sure that we are blending everything out
properly and it's not too hard with
these lorac shadows because they blend
very very fast but one thing that can
happen quite quickly is that these can
start moving around you guys kind of
see how this like ends here and then
this one's starting to go up here they
just have to be aware of where you're
placing the shadow and then how much you
want to actually blend out because they
move around quickly since they are so
soft and buttery which can be good and
it also can be bad so we're just going
back in fourths I don't really mind if
both of them are not completely even but
it will take that well crease brush and
kind of go back and forth right here so
that it doesn't look completely
completely crazy all right so next we're
gonna go in with this for the guys here
this is the morphe m5 is 0-3 brush and
soap ah great we're gonna go into this
shade right here which is called a brown
sugar which is really beautiful and I'm
going to put this on at my outer-v again
really really tap off that excess and
then tap it on to your outer beam you
may have to build it up when you are
tapping off your brush but trust me it's
worth it if you just go in with these
shadows and you just put them right onto
your crease or right onto your outer V
you're gonna have fallout galore so it's
better to build them than to just
straight up throw them on your eyes I
think a lot of people just kind of
straight up throw them on your eyes and
if you're not familiar with the
formulation that's something I would
also do because it's quicker but it's
not something you want to do with these
shadows and then I'm going back with
that morphe ms5 11 brush and I am going
to blend at that section now and I'm
mostly doing circular motions so you
guys probably know since I pretty much
do it the same a thing every single time
with the same brushes every single week
of a lot of brushes I need to kind of
get through or get us-- added but i do
the same sort of technique I just I
don't know you know you get used to
something and then that's all you do and
in the meantime we're gonna go in with
the best I made cause a medics boudoir
brush and I am just picking up any sort
of fallout because it is there Dennis it
is there alright and then we're gonna go
back in to another one of those wet and
wild crease brushes back into the shade
toffee which was our transition ever
gonna focus it kind of on the top part
of the eye here so that it's still a
nice and warm toned
oh that fallout girl that's fall out but
yeah these mats are very very easy to
work with very very easy to blend the
shimmers are everything about this
palette is really good I'm going to go
back in with that Sigma e35 got a 35
brush actually you know what let's take
our morphe m200 brush and let's just
blend the upper part of the crease now
this is a very very fluffy brush I like
what it does it's really nice if you
want to do some upper crease work and
just put a little bit of extra color
above like a halo effect but it's also
really nice for just blending really
really quickly and one thing I will say
about morphe shadows is that they can be
over blended you may notice things are
starting to get a little muddled
together I don't personally mind I'm not
like hoping for every single shadow to
be like an exact placement but that's
just something to be aware of alright
next we're gonna go in and I'm going to
take this Sigma e55 brush and I'm gonna
spray that down actually no you know
what we don't need tools I'm just going
to take this sigma e55 brush and I'm
gonna go into the shade Bellini which is
this one right here very very pretty
color and I'm going to go ahead and tap
that on it to my lid and I'm not tapping
off the excess because I really just
want to pack it on quickly but I am
packing it on to the inner part of my
lid and also a little bit of the outer
part and then you do have to kind of
blend the two together so that you still
have that nice darker outer be going on
I'm getting fallout galore but that's
okay
and one thing I will say about this
palette it's like this is the perfect
neutral palette if you're someone who
works in like a professional air space
or area or whatever you're gonna love
this you're absolutely going to love
this is just perfect
nice I'm taking this little tart fluffy
blending brush here and I'm just working
on the outer part here and one thing I
will say is that I've started to them
I've started to see that the colors are
kind of molding together but again I
don't really mind I don't mind alright
then I'm going to go in with this little
guy here this is from the Urban Decay
electric palette I'm going to be taking
this a little side over here and we're
gonna go into the shape pomegranate
which is a nice reddish color and I am
going to work this on my lower lash line
and kind of smoke it out a little bit
it's just gonna give a little bit of
extra warmth and this
particular shape looks a lot more red in
the pan than it does when you actually
have it on your eyes I just want to put
that out there I don't know why but a
lot of these colors will look different
in the pan than they do when you
actually put them on the eyes which is
interesting maybe it's just my eyes but
who knows it could just be my skin tone
it looks different against different
skin tones but I'm taking that under
there and then taking my Sonia Kashuk
number 116 brush and smoking that out
and blending it and one thing I like to
do is go back into that toffee shade
which we used as our transition and I
like to kind of blend it underneath here
and you can do like a two-toned under
eyes so you could actually take toffee
on a really really dense brush and work
it right underneath and then you have
that sort of halo effect but I'm just
kind of doing it like this working on
the upper crease again making sure
everything is properly blended and then
again the best I'm a cosmetics board war
Vashta boudoir
making sure we don't have fallout and
that's pretty much the eye look guys
very very basic but again I thought it
was really really pretty for this time
of year and now we are going to go ahead
and obviously curl our lashes wait we
already grabbed our lashes so let's just
go right into our mascara the first
mascara that I have been using this week
is the YSL baby doll at mascara and I'm
gonna put one layer of that on I love
this mascara it's so good you guys a
soul so good I already got it right
there and you see that I am so messy
with my mascara I'm just one of those
people I like to put it on so quickly so
I always have like a bajillion q-tips
just sitting around a little tip wait
till it dries completely and then it
just flakes right off with a q-tip don't
try and move it while it's still wet
because it wasn't that it will never
work and will never work
all right then we're gonna go in with
the Sephora outrageous curl mascara
which is my all-time favorite mascara of
life and I'm putting one layer of this
on as well and I love the way the two of
these like apply together you guys they
look absolutely insanely beautiful in my
opinion you get just the right amount of
like clumpiness or which I love and then
you're also getting a nice amount of
volume and I like a decent amount of
length here but mostly like volume I
love really thick looking lashes that's
like my favorite which is probably why
I'm attracted to clumpy lashes because I
the thickness but also does give you
some length so now if you want to
separate them you can go in with
something kind of separate them a little
bit but I like to leave the messes
because you know what I like it I like
the club's
alright guys so that is pretty much at
the eye look I really really liked this
I love this week I don't know why it was
just super easy to recreate and uh you
know it's one of those eye looks it's a
typical sort of like lorac mega mega Pro
sort of look I feel like a lot of lorac
pro formulations like a lot of their
palettes are kind of similar but I don't
mind like I feel like you could always
get really basic pretty eye looks and it
could just go a bajillion ways you can
mix and match with the warm tones with
the cool tones or you can go ahead and
you can just do warm tones or just cool
tones but now that gets alright and for
lips this week I have been wearing two
of my la creme lipsticks from Too Faced
of one in the shade pink chocolate which
is more of a cool toned very kind of
color it has a little bit of reddish in
it as well and then the shade of
sugar-daddy which is a little more warm
toned and that is what we are going to
put on our lips
I've just been putting a little bit on
like that and then I like to go in with
a clean q-tip and kind of clean up any
area that needs to be cleaned up as far
as like a mascara smudging is concerned
and like I said as long as you let it
dry down it will just flake right off
and that is it guys that is the look of
the week I hope that you enjoyed it this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
