thank you so much for joining me I am
here to give you guys a review on a new
contouring product that I recently found
at the drugstore I actually got it on
the allcom website for $12.99 I will
link below where you guys can get it it
is the L'Oreal infallible Pro contour
contour and highlight palette and the
shape that I have is 8:13 light they do
have a medium shade as well and a newer
deeper shade so they really are catering
to all sorts of skin tones which i think
is fantastic and I think that this is a
really really nice little product
actually it is $12.99 which I feel like
again the drugstore is just getting
insane with their prices especially
L'Oreal my goodness I am reviewing a
foundation after this if you guys want
to see it it's the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi cushion this is like almost $20.00
this foundation is which is ridiculous
so I feel like a lot of drugstore prices
are creeping on up there and I just
don't like it but I feel like $12.99 is
relatively good for it this little
palette I don't think there are a lot of
options at the drugstore I know McLean
did recently release one as well that
comes with a blush I think they have two
or three shades of that or maybe two
yeah light and medium or light and dark
or something like that so if you also
want a blush in the mix you can go ahead
and check out that one but I was just um
excited and curious to try this I'm
excited that you know drugstore brands
are coming out with contouring products
and I thought I would give this one a go
so this is what it looks like it does
have 0.24 ounces of product in it you
open it up there's a big little space
right here where this absolutely useless
little brush goes and then you can see
there are your two shades you have your
highlight which is a beautiful kind of
yellow gold color and then you have your
contouring shape which really is a
contouring shade it's got a lot of taupe
undertones a lot of gray undertones it's
not too warm or golden so let me talk
about this useless brush quickly I feel
like L'Oreal has tried doing this brush
many many times I remember trying like
an eyeshadow palette from them ones
where they had a brush like this where
you were supposed to be able to just dip
it in and then sweep the product on and
you have like a whole eye look put
together these are so useless so the
thought of this is that you can dip it
into the two products so you get like
the highlight and then you get the
contour you dip it in and then you can
just put it right onto your cheeks I
only kept it to show you guys in the
video I'm going to be tossing it right
now actually it is absolutely useless it
does not work whatsoever it just gets
really really like strange looking on
the skin it literally just looks like
you painted your face it just doesn't
work but overall I think that the
highlights and the contouring shading
here are pretty darn good they are not
super super pigmented I'm wearing them
on my skin today and I felt like I
really did have to build up especially
the highlight shade the highlight shade
I felt like I really had to build up but
I think it's an absolutely stunning
highlight shade it is like unlike any
highlighting shade that I really have
it's kind of like a golden color um you
have like a lot of gold in there but
then a lot of yellow as well and I
thought oh you know this kind of looks
similar to my Becca moonstone shimmering
skin perfecter but honestly this color
is just completely different I think it
looks beautiful on the cheekbones
absolutely stunning on fair skin so I'm
really really loving the highlight like
I said you do have to build it up quite
a bit and then the contouring shade is
also really really nice as well these
aren't like I said a very very pigmented
but that's okay because sometimes when
you're working with dark products or
like a contouring shade it's better to
be able to build it up on your skin
first especially if you're not a pro at
contouring which I am fine I'm
definitely not like by no means am I
like pro at contouring I'm actually
pretty bad at it so it is difficult for
me personally when I get a super super
pigmented product and I like dip it in
and then I put it on my cheekbone it
just looks like a big streak or a big
like math you know on my face so I think
that this is nice especially if you are
a beginner in that field like I am when
it comes to contouring I think it's just
nice to have something that's a little
less pigmented and a little less harsh
because it's better to build it up
rather than put it on your skin and then
have to find a way to erase it off your
skin so anyway I'm going to go ahead and
swatch these for you guys like I said
you really do have to kind of build them
up on the skin but that is the highlight
shade right there I think it's just
absolutely stunning it's just a
beautiful yellow gold color it has no
chunks of glitter or anything in like
anything like that in it it really is
just a beautiful iridescent sort of
color and I just think it's absolutely
stunning on the cheeks and then the
contouring
it's really really nice I really like
the thing you have that kind of pulpy
undertone in there it's not to oranjee
it's not to reddish they really did a
good job with this as well and it is
completely matte the contouring shade is
I'm going to build that up a little bit
on my skin so there is the contouring
shade and then there is the highlighting
shade and I think they really just did a
nice job I think the color combinations
are really beautiful from the medium and
the dark little contouring palettes that
I saw online it looks like they really
were trying to cater to a lot of
different skin tones and the
highlighting shades all kind of were
different the deepest one had kind of a
I would say like a beige sort of
highlight which I feel like would look
really really beautiful on you know
darker skinned ladies or guys and then
the medium one had more of like a peachy
kind of color to it which i think looks
beautiful on medium skin tones so I
think they did a really nice job kind of
picking out colors for everybody skin
tone and I am quite happy with this
product like I said if you're kind of a
beginner in the whole contouring field
and you don't want to maybe get like a
whole kit like I don't know like the
lorac one or the Tarte one or any of
that you just don't want to get like a
whole kit because you just don't do it
as often or you don't contour your face
every day basically I would definitely
recommend checking this one out I'm
definitely gonna check out the
Maybelline one as well I haven't yet but
like I said I will link my friend
Hailey's video below on that but I think
this is a really really nice little
option at the drugstore and I'm quite
happy with it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this a review thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
