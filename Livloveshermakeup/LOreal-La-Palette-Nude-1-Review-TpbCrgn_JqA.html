i'm going to be reviewing the new
l'oreal appellate nude number one this
is the number one pallet they have two
of these that have recently come out i
purchased mine at target for 1599 and i
know you can also get it on the Ulta
website i will link both below where you
guys can pick this up but anyway I found
this in the target stores and I am love
I love this palette basically inside you
get 10 different shades and i will tell
you guys right now this um number one
pallet they have one and two like i said
the number one is more of a warm palette
in my opinion it has a lot of golden
warm shades and the second palak is more
cool toned and it has more purple
neutrally maybe pinkish kind of shades
so anyway this is the kind of more warm
um you know uh warm colored warm toned i
would say inside you get this little
duel and did a tool you get a little
brush and then you get a sponge I don't
love the sponge end but I do like the
little brush and so I'm going to keep it
and inside you get 10 gorgeous shades
let me show you guys so basically you
get like a nice highlight a little
shimmery color you get some nice um gold
Tunis color some bronze you know deeper
chocolaty Browns and then you get to
overhear this taupe color and then you
get like a nice pink and highlight over
there I will say the only eyeshadow in
this palette added I don't like is this
taupe color which is such a shame
because it is a beautiful color but its
chalky it's not as pigmented as the
others and I just don't like the texture
however all of the other shades all nine
of them are so good except for that one
so out of all 10 I love online um you
get one two three matte colors and the
rest are all like a satin shimmery
finish I will swatch some of these for
you guys quickly so you guys can see and
i have to tell you right away the matte
colors oh my gosh these feel like Urban
Decay Matt you know finish like the
finishes these are amazing they feel so
good I have to say the max are just like
the stand outs in this palette the
shimmery shades are really beautiful too
and they are pigmented and creamy but
the matte shades are just oh my gosh
board
so I'm really really happy with this I
am wearing this golden shade right here
today on my lid and then I have this
nice dusty rose neutrally color in my
crease it's just two looks it's really
really I mean two shadows it's a really
easy look you just you know blend them
together it's like a one-and-done kind
of thing I'm so excited as yours you're
probably tell folks they develop this
palette I love the thought that a
drugstore brand has come out with like a
nice versatile palette like this that
you can pick up for under twenty dollars
I would say this is comparable to the
naked palettes I have the naked one and
the naked 3 and I think this is
definitely comparable so I would say if
you don't have the naked palettes and
you want something similar go out and
purchase this I always always recommend
the revealed palettes also from Coastal
Scents as dupes for the naked palettes I
love the revealed palettes I think they
are better than my naked palettes but
honestly those go for twenty dollars you
can get this for 1599 at the drugstore
so pick this up these are awesome so
anyway let me show you the shades again
up close they're just really really
beautiful I'm just I'm really really
loving this palette highly highly
recommend um I mean yeah I think it's
awesome I will review the other one I do
have the other one the lapel it's number
two I hope they come out with a third
one and a fourth one and all Matt's one
and just everything I'm really really
excited super super happy and I think
this is awesome that we are now getting
pellets in the drugstore that are
affordable yes you might look at it and
say oh my god 1599 you know what the
heck L'Oreal but if you think about it
you're getting 10 shades in here you're
getting you know this versatile little
um packaging which is a decent you know
it's plastic but it's decent and you're
getting that for under twenty dollars so
i think that's really great i will show
you both on the back they do not have
any names for the shadows but they do
number them on the back one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten and
then they do kind of what to face does
where they show you how you can create
certain looks so they show a nude ombre
they show a sultry angel look feline
fancy look and a lady butterfly look and
I just think it's so cool that they're
doing this and they're reaching out and
looking at
higher end makeup brands and seeing that
you know the naked palace did really
well and they're seeing probably the
Coastal Scents came out with those
revealed house that did really well so I
love that loreal and I hope that more
drugstore brands will reach out and
start doing more pallets like this so
anyway that is my review on the l'oreal
the palette nude number one like i said
i will be reviewing the second one on my
channel so stay tuned for that I hope
you guys enjoyed this I will link below
for you guys can pick this up from Ulta
and target and i'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
