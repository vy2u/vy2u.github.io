today i am doing a review for you guys
on the l'oreal appellate nude number two
i did already review on my channel the
left palette and number one the nude one
i will link below where you guys can
find that but basically i thought i
would go ahead and review the second one
for you guys today this consists of
basically the same exact thing is the
london want except different color
scheme of course so you get 10 shades
and instead of being warm tone to these
ones are cool toned as you can see with
the first talent these ones are very
much warm toned you get some like gold
some brown some very very kind of
neutrally neutrally colors i'd say
however I prefer the second palette and
I just think it's gorgeous I think you
get those nice cool tones the Ashley
colors you get six mats and for shimmers
and matte colors are just beautiful
there's a few swatches right now on my
finger just absolutely i mean they pick
up gorgeous gorgeous color they're just
very very pigmented very very easy to
blend just like the other palette if you
guys watch my other of you you know that
i really like these pallets or i liked
the other one and this one too so yes i
really like both of these and I'm just
really really impressed i think it's
austin that l'oreal has come out with um
you know a palette from the drugstore i
think that's so cool and i love that you
can pick this up for under twenty
dollars now when i picked it up at i
picked both of these up at Target and
this was probably when they first came
out which was a couple months ago they
were nineteen dollars and ninety-nine
cents now for some reason I've gone on
to the target website me these because
they're not brand new anymore but they
are now under sixteen dollars on the
website and they also go for fifteen
dollars and eighty four cents on the
walmart com website so i will of course
if link below where you guys can pick
this up for a cheaper price you can pick
it up on drugstore com for about $19 but
might as well pick it up on target or
the walmart website if you guys really
want a good steel so basically in both
of these pallets you get 10 eyeshadow
shades and like i said with the other
one there more it was more warm toned
this one is my favorite i love the cool
toned i just think it looks beautiful on
the eye you can get a nice smoky look
you can also get you know kind of that
rose gold e kind of you know beautiful
look that's really really in right now I
would say the light purple and dusty
rose hues are very in right now last
year i think it was really into like
that marsala II kind of like almost pink
based out color but now this year I
really think light ashy purples are very
very much in so I think that this
palette really really embodies you know
the coloring system that's really really
in right now so again like I said you
get ten shades 6r mat for our sim er I
would say the matte shades are
definitely creamier and paid a lot more
pigmented in my opinion saying with the
first pallet they just seem to blend in
so easily and they honestly feel like
the Urban Decay matte shades or like you
know a matte shade from Too Faced or
something like that they just feel so so
good and they're so easy to use I highly
recommend the shimmer shades are kind of
a hit and miss um if you watched my
review of the first pallet you'll know
that there was a shade in there that was
more of a Miss for me however these are
these shimmer shades from this palette
and as you can see like that middle one
is gorgeous and super super pigmented I
don't really have a Miss when it comes
to this particular palette which is
awesome I'm really really happy and with
every single shade and I think all of
them have you know the versatility and
the ability to make a really really
beautiful I look so really really happy
with that um I don't have anything
really horrible to say about this
palette something I do notice is that
you do get a little kick up or a little
bit of fall out when you pick it up with
your brush like if you really dig in
there can you see that it kind of gets a
little a little um it picks up too much
product at once if that makes sense so
then if i were to put it on to my hand
you can get a little bit of fallout so
that's just something you have to be
aware of maybe put a little piece of
paper under your eye or even I'll fast
like a device that you can hold under
your eye while you're doing your
eyeshadow that helps with fallout that
can help pick that up and make sure that
it doesn't get underneath your eye or
you can always just take a really really
nice loose brush and just wipe it right
under the eye but overall I'm really
really happy with both of these pallets
I would say this one is my favorite out
of the two I like the more cool
and shadows and i think that there's not
one miss in the eye shadows like there's
not one that I don't like so this is
definitely my favorite out of the two
like I said I think it was just such a
steal and such good value you know like
I love the drugstores coming out with
this kind of thing now I think that's
really really just so cool so I'm going
to hold up the two pallets next to each
other so you guys can see the lapel it
nude one is on the bottom and the let
palette new number two is on the top as
you can see you get the more warm warm
based palette is the first one and the
second one is the more cool tone so I'm
really really liking the cool toned one
the second one I feel like I just
grabbed it and reach for this more often
but the number one is also really
amazing so highly highly recommend these
pallets I will of course like I said
link below where you guys can pick these
up I hope you enjoyed this review i'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
