review on a new L'Oreal mascara it's
about two to three weeks old I picked it
up when I was in Manhattan and of course
now i'm in the Midwest but I picked it
up when I was in Manhattan so it was a
little more expensive there it is the
Loreal voluminous miss manga rock or
miss manga rock mascara this is kind of
like a sequel to their miss original
miss manga or miss manga mascara that
looks exactly like this the packaging
except to have a pink tap and I was
really excited when I saw that this was
out again it was a little more expensive
because i purchased it in manhattan i
think it was around twelve to thirteen
dollars probably however i'm in the
midwest now and i went to walmart the
other day and I saw it for around like
eight or nine so definitely order online
if you are in a state that you know like
if you're on the coast where things are
very expensive order online but anyway
um I was really excited when I saw that
this was out because i love the original
miss manga or miss manga mascara i'm
really a fan I like the look of kind of
clunky or eyelashes and I feel like this
is the kind of master that's going to
give you that look they kind of show you
on the packaging that's what they're
going for the kind of anime big I kind
of you know three eyelash kind of things
going on there so it's not a mascara
that's going to look natural it's not
you know a mascara that's going to you
know stand out your eyelashes nicely if
you buy this mascara or the other one
you kind of know that it is kind of a
clumpy mascara and you have to kind of
like that look um I personally like that
look I like to layer a lot of mascara on
I have a kind of medium you know lashes
there they're not super long but they're
about medium length and I find that I
like to look for a mascara that really
volumizes really well the original miss
manga really really lengthens very well
and I like that however I like this one
even more because it really volumizes
very very well so basically this is a
spiked overloaded brush that gives
volume on the top and bottom lashes with
a rebellious rock attitude it says the
brush is 360 degrees spiked brush it
loads maximum volume from the roots and
stretches lashes to pointed tips and the
formula is mega
texturizing formula creates a
high-intensity impacts sweetie hold on
but runny nose wiping my face with this
dirty makeup towel gross um anyway uh so
yeah so it really really is kind of
showing you that it's going to get
volume it's gonna look a little clumpy
er it's not going to be a natural look
semester so if you're not into kind of
clumpy or you know mascaras that you can
tell you're married mascara with I'm
probably won't like this but anyway this
is what the brush looks like as you can
see it is a tapered at the top it's very
very pointy of the tip and then it kind
of goes down and it gets bigger and you
can see that there are those tiny little
spikes or tiny little rocks i guess they
call it and those are basically um you
know that's like the part of the mascara
that's basically the part of the mascara
that's going to you know load up onto
the lashes the spikes are really really
short and tiny and they really really
get that product and that formula in
between them really well and you really
just start putting it on and within one
coat you know you have you know it looks
like you have two coats of a you know
normal master on so it really kind of
clumps up nicely I don't want to say
clumps up but it really gives a lot of
volume it kind of separate and I don't
want to say separates either it
separates them into like little pieces I
know that's gonna sound so weird but if
you are into kind of clumpy ER or like
you know doe-eyed kind of mascara looks
you know what I mean when I say that it
kind of pulls the lashes together in
certain areas and it makes them appear
really volume eyes and thick which I
really really like so like I said the
original miss mom guys a little more
lengthening this one is a little more
volumizing I like to layer them together
and get like aids false eyelash kind of
look it's amazing the formula is great I
got the original formula I believe they
do have waterproof this is in 387
blackest black and it's a really really
nice dark formula really really like it
it definitely colors my blonde eyelashes
you know a lot very very dark makes them
very dark so I like that um I noticed
that I do get a little bit of transfer
underneath however I don't get it up
here I care about it up here a lot more
than underneath it looks really ugly
when you go like this and then you get
globs of mascara right there I don't
like that so I don't mind if it
transfers a little bit underneath
however it really stays put for about
eight hours then it starts to transfer a
little bit it starts to get a little
flaky however it's not a dry mascara
like the you know Two Face better than
sex so it's not going to completely
start you know like coming off in like
you know in little pieces it's a nice
wet formula so it really is going to
last a you know good amount of time so
you don't really have to worry about
transferring and I'm one of those people
to get stuff all the way up here by my
eyebrow all the time so I'm really
impressed that I don't get that with
this I also don't get that with the
original miss manga so I like that too
but overall I'm really really happy with
this I think it's great it's you know a
really really great mascara if you're
into kind of the more volume eyes kind
of clumpy er I'm definitely wearing
mascara kind of looks um if you're into
more natural kind of you know whatever
and you kind of just grabbed it because
you thought the packaging was cute it's
probably not going to be what you had
hoped for but um it's really outstanding
and I think that it really is dramatic
and I like that look so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this review I will link
below where you guys can pick the
product up and I'll see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
