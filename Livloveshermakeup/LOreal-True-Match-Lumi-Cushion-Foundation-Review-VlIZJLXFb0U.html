is my final review of the night and it
is on the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
cushion buildable luminous foundation I
purchased six specific I purchased this
for 1699 on the altar dot-com website
you can be seen my face right now
sixteen sixteen dollars and ninety nine
cents when what did L'Oreal think it was
okay for them to start releasing
products near the twenty dollar mark I
mean seriously I feel like their next
you know foundation is gonna be what
$19.99 why shouldn't I just go spend the
extra ten dollars and buy a high-end
foundation at Sephora to know what I
mean I'm like whoa like really really
crazy so yeah 1699 really really I think
is just ridiculous but anyway I
purchased this on the all SOCOM website
I will link below where you guys can
pick it up if you are interested in the
shape that I picked up and - I'm gonna
get into that in a minute
because it is not the really correct
color match for me unfortunately but
anyway when I was on there I saw that
they had about 12 different shades it
seems like they are you know they do
have like their whole like n:w see you
know they do like cool tones neutral
undertones warm undertones
so they have that whole thing going on
so they have tons and tons and tons of
shades I'm sure in store but online is
how that they had about 12 and it looks
like they range from really really deep
to really really light so first I want
to talk about my shade match because I
picked up empty because I recently have
picked up a L'Oreal True Match and
mineral instant shine eraser powder that
I've really been loving and I picked
this up in the shade n 1/2 or soft ivory
so I thought that this would be a good
match for me but end - it's not if the
little dark on me and unfortunately it
just doesn't have like a neutral
undertone it really has more of a pinky
sort of undertone so it's not a great
color match for me that could be one of
the reasons I'm not absolutely a like in
love with and adoring this product but
there are a few more things that I want
to talk about just in general besides
the price and besides the color
selection so anyway like I said this is
1699 it comes
this little packaging right here it's
rose gold on the top I thought it would
have been much cuter if they had done
the whole rose gold thing all around the
whole packaging because then you get
this big bulky white area in the back um
that I just don't think it's very
attractive but this is part of their
True Match Lumi collection or it's under
their true Match Lumi umbrella I was
never a fan of The True Match Lumi
foundation I might be the only person on
YouTube that was never a fan of that
foundation I went ahead and just tossed
mine out I never liked it I never really
thought it made my skin look very
beautiful I never thought it really even
my skin out properly and it really
didn't give me a glow or a luminous
finish in my personal opinion so I kind
of took a chance or a risk with trying
this foundation out because I knew that
it was under that to match Lumi umbrella
and I just kind of was like alright well
I'm gonna try it because I'm really
really interested to see this little
cushion thing like I want to see how
that works I'm a huge fan of the Beauty
Blender the Real Techniques sponges all
of those kind of applicators really
really get me going and I love stuff
like that so I thought you know what I
want to try it out so anyway this is
what it looks like on the inside you get
a nice little mirror and then you take
your little um special little sponge so
this is basically what it looks like it
supposed to be kind of like a silicone
II sort of applicator it is a little
flimsy
I feel like if this little area right
here this little ribbon was a little
tighter I could fit my fingers in and
just have it nicely like nice and tight
around my finger so that I could
literally just stamp this all over my
face I must say this is definitely my
favorite way to apply the foundation a
lot of people that I've been watching
their reviews on with this foundation
they have been saying you know I prefer
to just go in with a brush it is quicker
to go in with the brush or go in with
like a beauty blender or something like
that but I think that this foundation
personally applies the best with this
little sponge so this little sponge is
basically the reason that you're getting
this foundation because it's so special
and it's so different and this is really
one of those kind of things like the
cushion foundations I know Lancome has
done it I know philosophy has done it a
lot of different brands have done it and
it is bigger in the Asian market I feel
like they've had you know cushion
foundations around forever where you get
that kind of
this look to your skin and it's very
very easy to apply it's kind of like
similar to a beauty blender but it's not
supposed to absorb as much product which
I don't know I kind of feel like it
absorbs more product than the beauty
blender but basically you're just
supposed to tap it all over your skin
and it's supposed to just give you a
really really beautiful coverage you can
even build it up in areas that you want
to and I'll get into that in a minute
because again I don't feel like this
product builds up well whatsoever so
anyway you have that little area right
there where the sponge is and then you
open it up and then you have this right
here and that is basically your little
cushion foundation area so when you push
on this or when your little sponge
pushes on it product basically excels to
the front or it pushes forward and you
get it all over your little sponge or
your brush or your fingers however you
want to apply it so like I said this
color particularly is not a perfect
match for me I feel like it is a little
on the pink side which is weird because
normally L'Oreal foundations pull a very
warm undertone on me personally and I've
heard that about L'Oreal foundations in
general they normally have a very very
strong yellow undertone but this one
pulls a little more pink on me it's not
anything that I can't fix I actually
think that this L'Oreal True Match
mineral pressed powder actually really
will lighten it up nicely for me I've
been really enjoying this powder I like
it a lot and it's a lot lighter even
though the sheets aren't the same this
is a lot lighter in tone so I feel like
it does lighten it up nicely I did apply
it today on using this little applicator
this is definitely my favorite way to
apply it I think it just puts it onto
the skin in a really seamless beautiful
manner and it really just pushes the
product into the skin and I think that's
the whole point of this foundation it is
very very liquidy if this was not in a
cushion compact I feel like it would be
one of the most liquidy foundations on
the planet because it really really is a
watery consistency and I'm not huge I'm
not a huge fan of consistencies like
that personally but I feel like a lot of
the product does get absorbed into this
little sponge applicator which is kind
of annoying and also I don't know how to
wash this thing because does anybody
know how to watch this because I have
absolutely no idea how to wash this I
did try removing some of the product
with what was it my
make up forevers like spray brush
cleanser but it didn't really do
anything and I'm just like what do you
keep like buying new one of the things
are buying $16.99 foundations like at
the drugstore just to get this little
applicator because I think this
definitely is the easiest way to apply
it but I'm not gonna be it's purchasing
more and more of these you know I want
to know if I can wash this so if you
guys know please let me know but anyway
I think it applies the best with that
little cushion I just think when I apply
it with a brush it just looks streaky on
my face I'll breast you know I'll dip it
into the product and I start putting it
on and just looks streaky and I don't
know if it's the luminous effect of this
foundation or what but this stuff looks
like water on your skin like it looks
greasy on my skin I have combination
skin so I am very oily in my t-zone and
I'm dry on my cheeks and right now I
feel like my combination skin is a
little more dry even just because it is
the winter time and I still feel like I
look like an oil slick with this product
on if I didn't set this with powder I
can't even imagine what I would look
like it really really just looks like
there's like an oil spill on my face
like really just not cute whatsoever so
I'm really not a huge fan of the
consistency I will say it is beautifully
beautifully blendable like you can blend
it like no other you really can blend it
in with your fingers if you want to I
would say the best way to use this
foundation is either the little
applicator or your fingers like I said
it does you know it will work well with
like a Beauty Blender or a real Tiffany
sponge or a foundation brush I just
think it goes on a little streaky and I
do find that any time I'm applying a
foundation with a brush it does take a
little bit of the coverage away and that
is the next little thing I want to talk
about the coverage with this product is
so barely there I have two layers of it
on my skin today
I don't feel like it builds up very well
on the skin in fact I feel like it
starts to actually show more fine lines
in just areas of roughness or texture
under the skin the more you build it up
it just doesn't look pretty on my skin
personally it's um when I look really
really close up I'm like yeah I can see
where it has settled into fine lines and
I think it doesn't do that as much if
you
like just one layer but that second
layer really just doesn't look okay it
really just doesn't look at it really
starts to just kind of fill into areas
where you don't want it to fill into you
know your fine lines around your mouth
you know any areas where you might
scrunch your forehead up I just feel
like it doesn't sit beautifully on the
skin it doesn't sit on top of the skin I
read a really wonderful primer today
I've tried this with silicone primers
I've tried this with a lot of different
products and I just feel like no matter
what I do no matter what product I set
it with it just doesn't look end up
looking beautiful on my skin at the end
of the day so my overall opinion on this
foundation is that it's definitely not
my favorite and you guys are probably
getting matted from me fitting very kind
of ranting about it but honestly it's
just not my favorite I don't like the
coverage I don't think it's very
buildable it is very blendable don't get
me wrong I think it's beautifully but
blendable like really really nicely
blendable I feel like you really could
blend this in with your fingers with
anything truly but I feel like it does
get streaky with certain products and I
just feel like it blends so well that it
almost just blends into my skin and I
don't know where it is the coverage is
so light and I have been reviewing a lot
of lighter coverage foundations lately
and I have to admit like this is like
the lightest of the lightest I've heard
a lot of people saying it's like you
know light to medium buildable coverage
and I'm like where like I don't even
know where this product goes I literally
feel like it just sinks into my skin and
I'm like what am I wearing like a BB
cream literally it's that light on my
skin I can't seem to build it off in
certain areas the only way it can really
build it is if I used a little
applicator I dip it in there and then I
tap on I'm not like swiping or anything
like that I really just tap on and
that's normally how I'm applying the
product is by pushing it into the stem
that's how they tell you to use it but I
feel like I really just can't build up a
nice even coverage all over my face so
yeah this is just definitely not my
favorite foundation I'm thinking that
the you know True Match Lumi like
umbrella or whatever it is the the
little line within the line the line
within the brand basically it's just not
my favorite in general I don't love the
formulation I feel like the dewy part or
the true match
Lumi part just looks oily on my skin as
somebody with combination skin which is
strange because I've heard a lot of
people and I watch a lot of gurus that
love love love that foundation that
really have been enjoying this
foundation as well and people that have
combination skin that are wearing this
with no problem but for me it just
doesn't really work I don't like the
coverage I don't feel like the price is
right
I feel like this should be $8.99 you
know I don't feel like it should be 1699
and I feel like if the color match is a
little it's a little off and it's
unfortunate because I feel like the
other L'Oreal products like you should
be able to just find your match like if
you know that you like this powder in
n12 you should be able to pick up the
end one too in the foundation and it
should match your skin but unfortunately
it doesn't so it's like well okay why do
you have those color selections if they
don't all match each other so it's a
little annoying again a price is just
really too much for me I'm not I'm not
into it I will continue to play with it
I think that for me personally the the
best thing for me to use this for is
probably just going to be as like a base
foundation if I want to put a heavier
foundation on top one that I've been
loving from the drugstore and that I
reviewed I'll link it below this is the
Maybelline Dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation this is half the
price you get more coverage you get just
as much like you don't get like
luminosity with this but you get as much
hydration in this product as you do in
this one and this one I just feel like
I'm just getting oily it's really kind
of gross but anyway I would say the only
really special thing about this cushion
foundation is the cushion the cushion
itself that's really the only thing that
excites me about it and I think that the
whole concept is very very cool and I
think it's awesome that L'Oreal has done
this and gone to that point where
they're like oh we want to try this we
think people will be interested I think
it is very interesting L'Oreal but I
just feel like you know for me
personally the True Match Lumi you know
formulation is just not my favorite in
general so I just don't like the
formulation and also I don't like the
price so anyway those were my thoughts
and my review on the new L'Oreal True
Match Lumi cushion from
definitely not my favorite I will be
wearing this underneath other
foundations it basically gives me the
coverage of a BB cream very very very
minimal light coverage and I feel like I
can build something on top of it I could
use my Maybelline Dream velvet on top of
it and get some nice coverage but
overall it's not my favorite I don't
like the way it wears on my skin
especially after a while I just feel
like it starts to sink in and show
texture more and it is likely very very
light to the point where it's like oh
you know it almost looks like skin but
then after a while it starts sinking
into certain areas and you can tell that
you're wearing foundation so not my
favorite let me know what you guys think
of this product if you've tried it out
below and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
