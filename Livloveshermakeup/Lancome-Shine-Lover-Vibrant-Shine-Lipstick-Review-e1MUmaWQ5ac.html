going to be reviewing one of the new
lipsticks from Lancome these are the
shine lover vibrant shine lipsticks the
color I got is in 346 Electra sont it's
like this really really hot pink color
it looks like this I am wearing it on my
lips right now I love it so basically
these are like really high shine
lipsticks they have probably 15 to 20
shades on the website I purchase mine on
the Sephora website for $25 um and I
just picked up one to start with just
because I'm not quite sure if I'm in the
IB you know right away with lipsticks if
I order them online I don't know if I'm
gonna like him right away and if I do
end up liking them I'll go back and
reorder some more colors so I'll
probably end up are you ordering some
more of these because I actually really
love the product so um the formula is
really really interesting it's a very
shiny um when you first apply it however
that goes down to almost a matte texture
um probably 10 to 20 minutes after
applying it so I think the name is a
little like misleading because it's
shine lover vibrant line from vibrant
shine lipstick you're gonna think that
it's gonna be glossy like this on your
lips the whole time that you're wearing
it however I have found that that is
just not the case that it really does
die down to kind of a matte or semi
matte finish after wearing it for a
while um they have like I said 15 to 20
gorgeous shades all of them are very
much like spring or summer related
really really bright like this one some
really bright corals really bright reds
um nothing looks very neutral if that
makes sense
so I will link below where you guys can
find all of the colors and the product
if you want on the Sephora website um
but basically like I said this is the
color and this is what it looks like on
the lips so right away when you apply it
it's really nice and shiny however it
does dye down to that matte finish later
on um I think the packaging is really
really nice I would prefer I don't know
what it is I really love the colors like
gold and white but I've never liked
white and sulfur for some reason and I
find that if I just have something
that's just like plain white packaging I
started
a little tacky I don't know why I think
that's just me a lot of people like the
colour-pop ones and things that are
packaged like this but I would prefer if
it was white and gold or black and
silver I just think that would look
better um I just think like a Lancome
like when you're buying something like
this for $25 like you really want to
love the way the product looks and I
don't think it looks like that classy
just like sitting on the ledge I don't
know because like I look at something
like this which is a Lancome blush
palette and I love that if this was like
gold and black that'd be so cool
but anyway I won't it's not like I'm
going to return it because like oh I
don't like the packaging I'm definitely
not going to return it I love the
product actually so um
I think that they're just super wearable
the texture is so nice um I do love the
shine and I wish the shine would stay
like that I wish after I like applied it
it would stay as shiny as it does on the
lips when I first apply it um I'm not
super upset if that it doesn't because
it's not like it dies down to a matte
finish where it's like mmm it feels bad
on my lips now or it feels drying it
always feels moisturizing this feels
like a bomb going on I just reviewed the
buttercream lipsticks from bite Beauty
yes and those have a really thick creamy
texture this one is like a thin
consistency it feels like a bomb going
on but you get full color so I'm just
like really really into this this
formula I think it's great for summer
it's so glossy it's sostiene you know
the sheen is just so nice when you first
apply it like I said it does die down to
that matte finish but it never gets
uncomfortable on the lips and I think
that's so important and so lovely so I'm
going to read for you guys a little bit
about what it says on the Support
website quickly
it says the Lancome shine lover vibrant
shine lipsticks $25 each what it is a
moisturizing glossy lipstick that's
infused with hyaluronic acid and Rose do
Muscat oil to smooth and conditioned
lips what it does it enhance all of your
lip looks with this glassing lipstick it
stays on the surface of the lips
reflecting light freeze your
healthy-looking lip look um light fruity
and fresh the balmy conditioning
lipstick can be applied easily on the go
that using a mirror for perfect
application that melts onto the lips
without drying them out I totally agree
with that
it just feels like a gloss like when
you're putting it on turn down a glass
and start like a ball it feels like a
ball but you get this nice full you know
pigmentation full color really really
great what else you need to know it says
Lancome laboratories have developed the
perfect creamy lipstick that is
guaranteed to enhance the appearance of
any lip tone and skin tone for the first
time Lancome introduces the ideal shade
range and lipstick formula for vibrant
and healthy looking lips with the ease
of a balm and the attitude of a lipstick
so love it I think they hit it right on
the bat when they you know with
everything that they said they're the
only thing I'm just kind of iffy about
is the fact that it's Lancome shine
lover lipstick and the shine doesn't
stay on the whole time it's only there
when you first apply it so that's really
my only um like thing with this lipstick
I love really everything else about it I
would say um you know I know I did
mention the packaging but the packaging
doesn't bother me that much it's more
about the product for me but overall
I've definitely think I'm gonna purchase
some more of these just because they're
like 15 to 20 shape that they have are
so bright and so beautiful for spring
and summer I just think it's great
awesome so that is my review of the
Lancome shine lover vibrant shine
lipstick I will link below where you
guys can pick this up and I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
