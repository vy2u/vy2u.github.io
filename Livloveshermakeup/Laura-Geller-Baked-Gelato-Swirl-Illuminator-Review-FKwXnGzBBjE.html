I am reviewing the new laura geller
baked a lot of swirl illuminator I got
this shade gilded honey they have two
different shades on the Alta home
website you can purchase this for $26 I
believe in store also so in Ulta or on
the online website I will link below
where you guys can find this product but
they have two different shades they have
gilded honey which is the one I picked
up and they also have a more like mathy
pink shade which is called ballerina so
um like I said I picked up gilded honey
and I absolutely love the packaging I
think it looks adorable really really
easy clicks clicks clothes really really
nicely so it's like you don't have to
worry about things opening up if you're
traveling and I just think it's a nice
size and for $26 you do get quite a good
amount of product what I will say that I
don't like about this is how it feels
the texture is not good and it's funny
because it's supposed to be this um
innovative blend of powder to cream and
it absolutely does not feel like a cream
product and it doesn't even feel like a
powder product it feels like a baked
baked baked product and you guys know
what I mean when I say that that really
really dry rough crispy sensation that
you get from a baked product that's what
you get with this and I'm not quite sure
I like that so basically here is the
color you get it is beautiful it's
really really metallic it almost looks
like it could be a like a eyeshadow
pretty pretty pretty pretty awesome and
cool so that is the actual color it is
really really gold it doesn't look like
anything that I own
um it's really just straight-up gold
doesn't have any kind of undertones not
a lot of sparkles just tiny tiny little
shimmers really almost metallic looking
so I do like the way it swatches out I
just hate the texture I hate feeling it
however you have to understand that when
I'm applying this I'm not using it with
my fingers I like to apply it with my
f-35 is that f-35 I think so the Sigma
tapered highlight brush I just dip it in
there and put it on to my cheekbones
down my nose and my chin and I am
wearing it today and that glow
that I'm getting kissed from this
product and so it's like well why does
it bother me if you know I'm using it
with a brush so that's all I'm saying if
you are someone who likes to apply
highlights with your fingers you're not
gonna like the way that this feels it's
just you know even though it looks
really creamy and luxurious it really
just feels crispy and baked and I don't
like that feeling however like I said it
does come off nicely on the skin I don't
have any issues with chunks of glitter
or like you know areas sticking to dry
patches or emphasizing my pores so I do
like it for that reason I like it for
the price and I like the way it looks
I'm gonna read a little bit on the Ulta
website what it says for you guys it
says the Laura Geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator and gilded honey $26 a
ballerina is also $26 and it says
illuminate your natural beauty this
innovative hybrid texture applies like a
sheer powder what feels like a cream
creating a translucent wash of luminous
color that can be swept all over the
face for a lit from within glow a fresh
3d design captures the look of your
favorite Italian dessert and lasts until
the very last application so um like I
said I really don't see it to being that
special hybrid between a sheer powder
and a cream it doesn't feel like it's
your powder and it doesn't feel like a
cream at all it feels like a really
really crispy baked product and I just
don't like the texture but like I said
it does apply beautifully with a blush
it doesn't look textured on my face so I
mean I'm happy with it I'm just not
happy watching it with my finger and I
don't know if that makes me sound like a
total diva because I'm like oh I just
hate the way it feels you know with my
finger but what i'm swatching it was my
finger I'm just like you know it's a
really rough texture Habra don't notice
it with a brush so anyway those are my
thoughts on the new laura geller
um baked gelato swirl illuminators um I
think that they are lovely they do pick
up a nice color they really are like a
glow a lift from within kind of look and
um I don't know if I would repurchase
because I am just so iffy about texture
you guys you know texture is a big thing
to me when I'm applying products I
really like them to be nice and smooth
and creamy but um I will definitely go
through this it's not something that I'm
not going to use I am
be with it sort of I am somewhat happy
with it okay I will use it until it's
gone I just don't know if I would
repurchase so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
