channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day in this video I am giving you guys a
review and swatches on the new laura
geller
beach mat bates hydrating bronzer there
are three different shades that you can
pick up on the altar comp website for
$33 a piece the shape that I have to
review and swatch for you guys today is
called sunrise fair which is in lightest
shade so like I said they do have three
different shades they have sunset deep
which looks like it's a very dark cool
tone color and then they kind of siesta
medium which has a little more ready
undertones in it and then of course you
have these sunsets there which is the
one I got so these are $33 a piece on
the ulta.com website it will go ahead
and link below in the description bar
where you guys can pick them up if you
are interested and this is basically
just supposed to be a really gorgeous
natural beachy glow on your skin even
though is a matte product it's supposed
to say very very hydrating on the skin
it says it has whipped hydrating
extracts antioxidants it has weightless
moisturizing properties to it and it
gives you a stepped off the beach sort
of glow and I have to say I am really
enjoying this bronzer I applied it all
over the outer perimeters of my face
today with a really fluffy brush and
then I just went back in and applied it
basically all over my face
this sunrise fair shade is amazing if
you have fair skin this is beautiful
absolutely beautiful this particular
shade is definitely definitely not going
to show up on medium to deep skin tones
it's just very very light this is what
the actual color looks like and as you
guys can see I was very drawn in so this
is because of the packaging I mean look
at that it literally is like a little
like embossed cushion which i think is
just way too cute and the outer
packaging looks like this so when I saw
these on their website and when I saw
them on trend mood I saw a few pictures
I thought that like the cushion would be
like sticking up more you actually don't
get that much product in here you get
zero point four ounces or 12 grams of
product and the actual bronzer part lays
completely flat so for $33 I don't
actually feel like you're getting too
much product in here if the actual
packaging this part right here that's so
like big and chunky it's actually the
mirror which is nice I do like that you
get a little mirror in there but I mean
come on they could have made you know
the actual products like maybe stick out
a little more
it looks like that on the pictures I
don't know if I'm the only one but
anyway like I said I think this is a
beautiful beautiful shade match for
those with fair-skinned I really can
just dust this all over my face and it
looks beautiful there's no shimmer to it
it's really really silky and it's very
very soft to the touch you guys like
it's very very soft and I noticed when I
run my finger in here
it doesn't actually ruin like the
embossing which I really really like I'm
sure at some point you will but it's
beautiful so there is the actual shade
and like I said if you have I'm gonna
have to build this stuff so you guys can
see if you have medium to deep skin like
this is not going to show up on you the
reason I am reviewing this particular
shade is because it's probably the best
option for my skin tone it does pull a
little bit of a warmer quality to it but
almost a little more of a yellow quality
I don't want to say orange because I
don't feel like it's orange it pulled a
little bit of a yellow tone and I
actually think that's a very very
flattering and beautiful on fair skin
tones and mine too even though I have a
cool undertone in my skin I think this
is beautiful
so overall the formula is really really
nice it does wear absolutely all day
long I will be going on with my day
after I film this you guys won't see
this video until tonight but I just feel
like this will stay on absolutely all
day it almost has like a waterproof
formula because I noticed the other day
was it was raining out yes it was
raining and I was out in the rain and I
had kind of like covered my head and it
was funny because everything looked like
it was starting to get ruined like my
eye makeup everything my lip color was
coming off this was just like perfectly
like it was exactly where I put it on my
face like it just looked absolutely
gorgeous and I felt like it was almost
making like a shield for my foundation I
know that may sound crazy but it looks
absolutely beautiful so I almost felt
like I had a bit of a bit of like
waterproof properties to it as well but
like I said very silky to the touch of
very blendable really really strong wear
time on these and I just think they're
really really beautiful I'm a sucker for
packaging and I have to admit this is
the reason why I picked this up now I
was going to go ahead and pick up all
three shades but again $33 for a bronzer
is quite pricey to be completely honest
I do think the outer packaging is
gorgeous too but for the most part I
think this is the problem I
you guys on Instagram last night I was
like I think you can do this color like
no problem
you guys I went through my collection
and I cannot find anything that actually
Dukes the exact color match of this
product and I think it's because it does
pull more like yellow undertones than
orange undertones or red undertones now
of course it depends on what shape you
pick up I would recommend going in store
and swatching these out but I did not
find a deal for these and I was so
disappointed because I'm like 33 dollars
for a bronzer I absolutely love it I
love the packaging but I just thought I
was going to be able to find a color
dupe for this and I cannot so overall
I'm actually really enjoying this
product again I thought it was something
that I'd probably already had in my
collection and I can't find anything
that is similar to this so really really
beautiful products I love the way it
wears on the skin I love the packaging
it's just it's just overall a really
really good product so I finally
recommend checking it out I will search
for ad for this in my next video I will
go ahead and try and find something for
you guys but I was actually pretty
surprised this is a very very unique
shade this particular shape these
sunrise fare very very unique and very
beautiful on the skin so I hope you guys
enjoyed this quick little review and so
watches only laura geller beach match
baked hydrating cushioned bronzer as I
like to call it thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
