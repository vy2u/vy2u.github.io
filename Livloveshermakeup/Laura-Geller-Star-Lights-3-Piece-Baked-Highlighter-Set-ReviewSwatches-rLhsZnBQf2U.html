review and some swatches on the laura
geller star lights 3-piece mini
highlighter kit you get three of these
little mini sizes of highlighters and
they all vary in color and I think
they're all really really nice so it
originally came in this cute packaging I
should have kept it I'm sorry I did it
it was like a little ornament so I think
this is a holiday um you know like a
holiday gift so go ahead and check it
out before it's sold out I bought my
another Lord gala website or it was
somewhere on eBay where they sold Laura
Geller I just remember them having cash
back and then I just ended up being this
so anyway here are the swatches on my
arm and I realized that you may not be
able to see these because these are
highlighters I guess I didn't really
think that through but anyway um I'm
going to also just do some I guess
swatches on my finger so the first one
I'll start with is golden rose and these
are so so soft that's golden rose on my
index finger I think you go like this
that seems a little better so that first
one there is golden rose the second one
is french vanilla this one has more like
um right there I would say it has more
yellow like undertones to it so I really
like that as you can see it's a little
more yellowy so it is very like color
corrective and the last one that you get
in the kit is Portofino it's on my pinky
got a little more white in it and um I
don't know I think it's nice for paler
girls like me so those are the three
swatch I'm so sorry if you can't see but
um let me go ahead and put them back on
my finger how am i dying you guys can
see from the fingers perspective I guess
so
those are the three there so the one on
my pinky is Portofino the one in the
middle yeah the one in the middle of the
two is french vanilla and then the one
on my middle finger is golden rose so I
love these I think they're really really
good
um highly pigmented and I think that you
know highlighters take forever to go
through so you know getting a size like
this really actually doesn't matter
because it will take you forever to go
through these so um really really love
these i think laura geller has some
amazing products and because this was
like a holiday gift it was a little more
on the cheap side so I would definitely
recommend either going to her website or
finding um you know a website that sells
laura geller through it because this is
one of the little holiday things so
anyway um that was my review and my
swatches of the laura geller star lights
mini highlighter trio I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I'll see you next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
