doing review for you guys today on the
new laura geller the wearables eyeshadow
palette color story it looks like this
you get 12 baked eyeshadows in here that
you can use wet or dry I purchased mine
for $42 as you can see on the box at
Ulta it says that is $130 retail value
so cool that's a steal anyway there are
12 based shadows in here and like I said
you can use them wet or dry and they're
very very nice and neutral I love that a
few brands right now are coming out with
really neutral palettes for the summer I
think that's so different because
usually at this time of year you're
coming out with lots of color lots of
you know like the Too Faced sugarpop
palette or things like that so I love
that
for instance Tarte just came out with a
really nice neutral palette the
showstopper that I reviewed and now
Laura Keller has done at the wearables
color story so basically it comes in
this packaging it's really really nice
it's like magnetic closure and it's a
little gray matte palette so basically
on the top you get kind of the chunkier
section which is actually the big mirror
which is great and then on the bottom
you get the little thin part you get to
the big shadows and you can see you need
that top part because they stick out at
the top as you can see so they need to
close so that you don't close in on the
shadow so I've always really liked baked
eyeshadows or baked anything because I
feel like they last a really long time
because like me I don't actually know if
there's more product but you know it
sticks out so you feel like there's a
lot of product there but I was really
excited to try this I've tried quite a
few of Laura Keller's products and I
know that she does make these and
they're like made in Italy like baked to
perfection just really really great
stuff I think that she puts a lot of
time and work into the whole thing and I
just thought it would be fun to try out
some of her eyeshadows so basically like
I said I got this for $42 on the Ulta
website I will link below where you guys
can pick this up um and yeah so in here
you get 12 big shadows like I said and
over here you kind of get cooler tones
and then towards this area you get a
little more warm tones so right now I
feel like what's really really in like
in a lot of like like Spring Fashion
Week and all that kind of stuff is a
really nice like pale purpley dusty
color like not I'm talking dusty rose
like Naked 3 status
talking like a nice dusty purple color
so I feel like this palette really
embodies that so if you want to be
really in this palette definitely has a
lot of those shades especially in this
area
they are so so soft for a baked product
I associate baked with being kind of a
rough texture or something that has a
lot of shimmer and I need to be kind of
careful not all of these have shimmer in
them they do have quite a few matte
colors and they're just so soft and
creamy and every single shade in here
has that feeling to it
so I really really love my favorite
color is this
iris one right here I think it's
beautiful it's got like a lilac with a
little bit of a blue undertone and then
that navy blue color is gorgeous too so
you get like the deeper shades at the
bottom you get a little few color pops
you know those two blues and I just
think it's really beautiful but like I
said they're really easy to blend and
they feel so creepy and they're just so
pigmented I'm really really impressed
and I really like that there's not
chunks and chunks of glitter in all of
these there's a few in this color up
here called blossom the pink one up
there but other than that most of them
just have like a nice neutral kind of
satiny finish and then the matte ones
like this one up here and this one down
there are really really really nice so
um yeah so the colors you get are
Sunstone blossom oyster roast mist storm
Jasper Java iris carbon tourmaline
tourmaline tourmaline chocolate and
royal like I said iris is my favorite I
love that shade beautiful so um yeah I
mean I'm just I'm really really
impressed I think the packaging is great
I think the texture the blend ability
everything is awesome I am wearing these
shadows on my eyes today I know might be
hard to believe I have a lot of eyeliner
going on but um I am wearing let's see
here I put moister all over all the way
up to the brow I did blossom on my lid I
then worked sunstone as a transition
into my crease and then when it with
Java in the crease and then I took
chocolate and did it on my outer V so I
really really liked it and then I went
in with royal and carbon and did my
lower lashline and then I just wore a
nude
eyeliner on the waterline so I feel like
it really kind of opens up the eyes and
it's just really beautiful so again here
is a close-up of the shades I feel like
this Pat like palette maybe wanna like I
don't know maybe you want to wear this
dress which maybe you want to put lots
of eyeliner on it was just like it was
it was a fun makeup morning it was
really fun working with this I really
really liked it so I'm gonna read for
you guys a little bit about what it says
on the Ulta website it says the wearable
color story $42 a stunning collection of
everyday shades to make your eyes a
focal point this one palette flatters
all holds of the 12 based shadows for an
unparalleled collection of shades and
allows for endless mixing and matching
from warm neutrals to cool hues the
wearable color story is in your new
daily go to like all of the laura geller
baked products these shadows beam as
liquid pigments they start as liquid
pigments and then are baked into a hand
finished in Italy into a silky dome sub
powder
resulting creamy weightless color each
shade can be worn dry or wet for a
deeper color payoff perfect for doubling
as a liner whatever the occasion this
one-of-a-kind ice shadow palette is one
you'll never want to be without and I
have tried these wet also and they
really really really were pigmented they
did not crease they were great all over
the lid everywhere really great I should
also add that I tried wearing these one
day without eye primer and they didn't
show up quite as much so I do recommend
brain a primer no matter if your mind
them dry or wet it says the benefits of
this product because big products are
made without additional fillers or
binders the colors are more vibrant so
that can also be helpful if you guys do
have some more of like sensitive skin it
might be better to use thanks shadows it
says baked products deliver high-impact
color with less product so they last a
long time and innovative texture applies
like a powder but feels like a cream
hand finished in Italy and ideal for all
skin types so like I said I'm really
really enjoying this I'm getting a lot
of use out of it I think it's really
really fun and I feel like those rosy
kind of I shouldn't even say rosy those
light purples are really in right now so
I've been working a lot with those and
it really actually looks good on blue
eyes my friend I did her makeup the
other day and did a few of the light
purples it was beautiful brown eyes so I
just feel like this is such an invalid
right now um I'm a link below where you
guys can pick this up from the ulta.com
website if I can find it on the Laura
Geller website I will also link it and I
hope you guys enjoyed this review see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
