I'm sorry if I'm talking a little soft
my boyfriend is actually sleeping right
now it's really really early in the
morning and I wanted to go ahead and do
a first impressions review for you guys
so the product that I'm using is new for
at Sephora from Sephora No
at Sephora it's from Laura Mercier this
is the candle blow soft luminous
foundation and this was $48 on the
sephora.com website so for me because I
don't edit my videos my first
impressions are a little different I
will put the product on my face I don't
use any primer or any sort of concealer
or anything like that I will set it with
a powder but only after letting it sit
and kind of set first I want to see what
the actual product looks like first just
applied and then I will set it with a
powder if I feel like I need to just
because I do like to set my foundations
with powder but you guys will be able to
see what it looks like with and without
a powder no primer and also no concealer
so we'll see what the coverage looks
like I was really really excited about
this one it seemed like it was going to
be a very luminous sort of foundation
and um I know Laura Mercier let's see
here I had one foundation from her and I
think I got rid of it it might declutter
series it was totally the wrong shade
and this time I really really spent a
long time on the website looking for my
exact shade last time I got I think it
was called fair and it had neutral
undertones um I'm sorry it was not fair
it was called light and it had neutral
undertones and it was so so so yellow on
me it was just horrible so this time I
went with the shade called shale which
is fair with cool undertones I do have a
little more cool in my skin so I don't
really know why I reached for the
neutral one last time I just thought
maybe because I don't know I was trying
it out for the first time maybe neutral
would be better but I am quite cool
undertones so I did get shale this time
she has a huge huge array of colors
really really good from deep deep deep
deep dark shades to a really really
light shade so she has many many
different fair shades with different
undertones like cool undertones warm
undertones new neutral undertones she's
got middle shades and then some really
really nice darker colors and she has 24
different shades for the foundation so
that was a much better selection
than the one I had tried I can't even
remember what it was the foundation name
but that was a much better selection
than the one that I had because I don't
know there were not 24 different options
so I was really excited about this and
hopefully this will match and let me
read a little bit about what the product
is supposed to be like for you guys um
it says you want to apply to clean skin
using a sponge or with fingertips I am
going to apply with my fingertips like I
said no primer nothing like that and it
is an ultra lightweight to medium
coverage foundation that creates a soft
candlelight glow on the skin
day or night camp will glow soft
luminous foundation spotlights your skin
with a soft glow it's calibrated blend
of radiant pearl mica embedded in an
ultra lightweight formula mimics the
reflected glow of just lit candles this
microfusion is blended with purified
water to hydrate skin and allow
foundation to glide on and I saw that
when I was reading about this foundation
I was really really excited because um
it kind of seemed like it was going to
be one of those like what is it the
Sephora tone infusion or tint infusion
where it's like that ethereal glow
foundation where it's like very very
silicone II but it's not very hydrating
but it can patch up on certain areas of
your face I kind of thought he was going
to be like that until I read this
description and it said that it had like
purified water in it and oils and I
thought oh it's gonna be different it
probably won't have silicones in it and
it probably is going to be very very
moisturizing so that was kind of cool it
says let's see here yes it hydrate skin
allow foundation to glide onto skin for
lasting smoothness and natural
luminosity its blend of lightweight oils
lock in this moisture to lead skin
balance soft and beautifully radiant
while micro-fine color true pigments
provide a natural skin and flattering
finish and it says what else you need to
know laura mercier are we streamed up
inventing a foundation that recreated
the atmosphere of a candlelit room this
product is dermatologist tested and
non-comedogenic
all right very cool I'm sorry my lips
are super super dry I put the bite
Beauty agave lip mask on last night and
it didn't completely like sink in so
it's kind of balled up on the side if I
would sorry um so it seems like she's
kind of going for that whole like
luminous
the light sort of thing like reflective
like reflecting sort of thing kind of
like the hourglass ambient lighting
powders they really really got everybody
into that whole craze of like late
reflecting powders and whatever so it
seems like this is basically that but in
foundation form hopefully it will be and
let's try it out so the packaging is
really really nice it's like very very
like matte box I really really like it
like they said my shade is shell and
this is what the actual packaging looks
like really really beautiful it's got a
frosted glass bottle and then a nice
little like top that comes up and you
have a pump so that is great this looks
like it's going to be a good skin match
for me hopefully and there is only one
fluid ounce of foundation in here I feel
like that's kind of low compared to some
of the other foundations I have I feel
like that's kind of low especially for
the 48 dollar price tag foundations
usually an ounce or one fluid ounce yeah
like they're usually a little more than
that but anyway this is what it looks
like and let's go ahead and pump a
little on the back of the hand alright
so it looks very very like watery like
it moves you see it's like moving down
my hand I'm going to blend it into my
skin really quickly yeah really really
watery it doesn't have that silicone II
kind of texture it looks like it's gonna
be a good color match for me maybe even
a tad lighter than my skin tone by the
way I'm sorry if my voice sounds a
little raspy I think I'm coming down
with a cold again so literally the 25th
time this season that I have a cold but
um yeah my throat gets all raspy and my
voice drops down a few notches which I
guess some people might like because I
like this but anyway this is what the
foundation looks like so it looks like
it's gonna be a pretty decent color
match it might even be a little light
which is totally fine with me you can
always dark any foundation oh um so yeah
it looked like it was very very watery
it did not feel too silicone II
whatsoever it really really just felt
hydrating so let's just try it I'm just
going to apply this with my fingers like
I said first I'm gonna put my little
Sephora clip then though so that I can
make sure that
I don't get any foundation in my hair
I feel like I'm not wearing the right
shirt for this today this cute little
collar thing is my cue this little
forever 21 shirt but I don't want to be
gaining foundation all over but anyway
let's do this so I'm just going to pump
this onto my hands when you take that
much just start and we'll just see how
this goes
it looks like it actually might be a tad
light for me which is okay
you can always darken things up but if
you have first thing you know that
normally things get you know products
are normally a little dark and then it's
really hard to lighten them up so I
don't mind if it's a little lighter than
my skin tone because I can darken it up
great that went on really really nicely
it feels really really good you guys
really good I feel like I'm rubbing like
nothing on my skin literally like water
alright let's let that sit for a second
like I said I'm not going to use a brush
or a sponge or anything
I normally probably would with my
foundation just because I prefer it that
way
but I wanted to see how this applied
with the fingers so let's put it sit and
set I was gonna say set a minute that's
it
I said sit let's let it sit outside so
I'm just gonna let it kind of set
quickly it looks a very very dewy and
I'm very luminous actually really really
pretty on the skin actually I like that
a lot
let's look in a little mirror here to
make sure that I don't have any sort of
weird blotches anywhere so is that
pretty good at covering but in a
beautiful way like it looks like it
looks like skin basically you can still
see my acne scarring and also any active
breakouts that I have it is that time of
the month and they always come so I
thought it was a good idea to film this
now while they are there right but it
looks really beautiful on the skin it
seems like it is kind of a dewy like
it's not gonna completely set
it doesn't feel sticky or anything like
that it just feels moisturized and soft
I would definitely say this is not
medium coverage this is more like a
light coverage in my opinion but a
beautiful light coverage alright let's
go ahead and apply another layer because
I'm curious I'm just gonna do a few more
squirts on my it really feels like
nothing like when I rub it between my
hands but not in like a way where it's
like that
Maybelline what is that dream scanner
whatever it is with the little
applicator that one feels very like
silicone II this just feels like water
like it's very easy to blend but not
slippery or silicone II in any sort of
wind it just
like water like it doesn't feel oily or
anything
it's a good foundation to test out as
far as applying with your fingers goes
because it's you know not heavy coverage
and it doesn't set very quickly so that
is the second layer let's take a look in
my little mirror here
see what we have going on here I could
use this little sponge to kind of blend
anything there's a few little areas here
that just look a little splotchy it's
just my finger tips you know blend it
into my hairline a little bit
just because you can actually see the
areas where my fingers spread it right
so it looks like it did not really built
up anymore than it did before
I think I look a little more dewy than
before which I don't particularly like
it looks like the coverage that you get
the first time you apply this is the
coverage you get with every single layer
so you don't really need to build it up
because it looks like it don't look as
beautiful on the skin the second layer
is that makes sense it did conceal my
eye area pretty well it is early in the
morning right now and my eyes are pretty
red so I feel like it did that pretty
well it seems like it's well like it's
like a demi matte it really is kind of
just a luminous finish if that makes
sense it doesn't feel so sticky like I
said but it just feels like there is
moisture there maybe a tiny little bit
of oil but it feels really really
beautiful I will admit that second layer
probably didn't need to do that it
actually kind of emphasized some fine
lines and dry spots
I think the first layer looked really
really a lot better than this so I know
that for next time when I use it again
to just do one layer but like you guys
can see it does not it's not full
coverage I don't even think it's medium
coverage I would call this a light
coverage foundation
it really doesn't build up to anything
more than a light coverage foundation
and it seems like it has completely set
so it sets in kind of like a dewy finish
sort of way so if you have dry skin you
would probably find this very very
comfortable on the skin because you
wouldn't have to set it with powder
however I do like to lock in my
foundation I have combination skin so I
am going to set mine with a powder all
right so let's go ahead and do that I'm
using the l'oreal paris to match a
little bit of True Match very early in
the morning L'Oreal Paris
match mineral instant shine eraser
powder in n12 and I'm going to be taking
I'm not going to take that little sponge
that came at the bottom I'm going to be
taking this bu beautifully Pro flat
kabuki brush I will link it below where
you guys can pick this up from Amazon
it's really really nice and I'm just
gonna go in there and tap this onto my
skin and I am gonna do a little bit of
swiping motions because I'm not wearing
a super heavy coverage foundation so I
feel like it can you know it's not going
to move the foundation around normally I
like to just tap tap tap tap tap but
this is a very light coverage you know
very light coverage foundation so I
don't think it's gonna be going anywhere
it's just not noticeable you know well
that looks beautiful with the powder I
really like that I like seed I like that
particular finish I thought the first
layer that I did was actually really
really stunning I would wear that
definitely and not set it with the
powder however I think that the second
layer look it's just not nearly as good
but I think it looks really really
beautiful set with this powder I really
like that
so I really am not needing tons and tons
of powder if you guys watch my empties
video empty the videos sorry I'm like
making sure I don't hit the collar of
this shirt but if you watch my empties
videos you probably know that I go
through powder really quickly a really
like a matte face and then if I want any
kind of doing Asst I normally use like a
powder product which I'm trying to get
out of like I'm trying to stop doing
that because I have a lot of cream
products that I know are gonna go bad
quickly and I'm trying to get used to
you know just letting the foundation set
itself without setting it with a powder
but I didn't feel like I needed a lot of
powder that was my point okay so I'm
gonna wait my lips one more time great
let's take a look so you guys can still
see like I said the little areas where I
have pimples and you can definitely
still see my acne scarring through this
however it looks beautiful it literally
looks like skin and it doesn't you know
it looks like skin and I'm under really
harsh lights right now and I'm looking
really close up it's not taking up
anywhere I think it's beautiful
absolutely beautiful alright alright so
that is my first impressions on this
product so far so good the way that I do
first impressions on my channel I don't
know if I mentioned this at the
beginning but I will do like a follow up
a little I was gonna say follow up haul
that's something else I do on my
channels that I will do a follow up on
the first impressions in about a week
just because I don't edit my videos so I
can't go out the whole day and you know
film for you guys what it looks like and
also I feel like just one day it's like
not enough you know what I mean I really
love it right now but I need multiple
multiple days to use this I want to try
it with primer I want to try it
with concealer I want to try it with a
different powder you know I want to try
it with a beauty blender so you know I
will give you guys my first impressions
now which is that I really really do
like it right now however I want to use
it for about a week to give you guys my
final thoughts so anyway that was my
little first impressions on the Laura
Mercier Campolo soft luminous foundation
reading that Oscar website I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I think this a
beautiful foundation so far and thank
you for joining me bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
