review for you guys tonight this time it
is on the new laura mercier extra lash
sculpting mascara it comes in a box like
this and I purchased mine on the Sephora
website for $25 I am wearing it today
and I just want to show you guys up
close what my lashes look like because
look at that link it's really funny but
seriously I am so impressed with this
mascara I absolutely love it it comes in
this nice little packaging like this it
looks really chic and very like mmm you
know very high-end I guess you could say
very very pretty very sleek the only
color that they have right now is called
black onyx so of course that's the shade
that I picked up black onyx and you just
unscrew the top obviously a typical
mascara and out comes this gorgeous wand
now you guys if you've watched my
channel you know that I love plastic
ones I don't like the normal like
regular kind of wands I really like
plastic wands and I think that this kind
of wand is totally might go too so it
has really really short bristles on some
ends and then on the other end they got
these really really long ones so you
have like interchanging bristle sizes
you need your changing bristle sizes and
I just love that when it comes to
mascara I just think it really really
makes your lashes pop and I only put on
one coat of this today and like my upper
lashes are just like boom like really
really lengthened I was actually
expecting this to give more volume than
length just looking at the brush that's
what I thought however it really gives
awesome length too so for one coat of
mascara I really thought it did a
beautiful beautiful job and I was really
impressed um this has a similar wand to
some of my favorite wands let's see here
well Too Faced better than sex actually
has like a normal it doesn't have a
rubber wand I love that wand but this
one kind of reminds me of the benefit
they're real it's got a similar brush
except on the end it doesn't have the
extra little spikes on the end which
would have been even more awesome
because you can really get into the
little corner
the only thing I don't like about this
mascara and this is just a normal
complaint with mascara is when I pull it
out it always gets extra on the tip as
you guys can see it just picks up a lot
of product on the tip so I end up just
Donnie dotting it off there and then
kind of rubbing it I really just I'm
really loving this I've been wearing at
the past couple of days and I think that
when you have those interchanging
bristle links that's really what gives
you the nice volume and the nice length
those really nice long bristles give you
the length and then the shorter ones
give you the volume so this is an
awesome mascara I'm really really
impressed like I said one layer of this
on today and my upper lashes just look
awesome I did hit them from the front
and then I would close my eyes and hit
them from the back also and I did notice
a little more clumping on this side when
I hit them from the back however um that
can be easily fixed and I've been
wearing this all day and you know since
early this morning and it's already 9
o'clock at night and it really really
just hasn't you know it hasn't moved
anywhere this is not a waterproof
formula by the way but it has not gone
underneath my eyes it has not gotten
stuck up here which is like something
that always happens to me I'll look down
or something or I'll look up and the
lashes actually like touch near my brow
and then I get like a line that has not
happened with this and I think it's
because it's like a really nice wet
formula that's another thing I do want
to talk about it has a really really wet
formula so you need to let it dry if you
are gonna go in between coats like if I
wanted to put another coat on you know
like a second coat today you need to let
it dry completely before going again and
you really want to make sure you don't
get smudges all over because you're
gonna have to wait forever til it dries
to get them off but um like I was saying
I really think that it's just like the
formula is great and I love that it
hasn't gotten stuck up here I'm just so
impressed I absolutely love it I really
think it sculpts out the lashes and yeah
so anyway I'm gonna read a little bit
about what it says on the Sephora
website for you guys it says Laura
Mercier extra lash sculpting mascara 25
dollars the color is black onyx what it
is a long wearing mascara with a creamy
flex formula and a uniquely shaped
molded brush that gives lashes
built-in memory control for mega
lengthening and styling what it does it
builds sculpts and styles your lashes
this Lex creamy flex formula gives the
lashes built-in memory control from mega
lengthening and styling the combination
of the uniquely molded brush and easy
glide texture gives your lashes instant
shape clump free with no with no uneven
buildup it features an applicator
designed with bristle with dual bristle
lengths allowing lashes to separate for
a fresh even coat even hours after
application coat the full length of
lashes it coats the full lengths of
lashes even the shortest for a sculpted
effect that achieves ultimate
lengthening and styling what else you
need to know this product is
dermatologist tested and suitable for
contact lens wearers so anyway those are
my thoughts on the new Laura Mercier
extra lash sculpting mascara I
absolutely love it I totally think it's
worth it for the $25 it's awesome it
doesn't travel all over your face it
stays on it's got a great formula and it
really really works at sculpting out
lengthening and thickening up your
lashes so I hope you guys enjoyed this
review I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
