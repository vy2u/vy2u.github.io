video is going to be a review and
swatches on the views she asks laura
mercier highlighters I'm just kidding
this is going to be a review and
swatches on the laura mercier face
illuminator so if you don't know as the
actual difference between an illuminator
and like a highlight the best way that I
kind of like think of it or the best way
to explain it to you would be the
difference between like a Becca
shimmering skin Perfector and an
hourglass ambient lighting powder an
hourglass ambient lighting powder is a
product that you can apply all over your
face it doesn't have to litter in it it
will illuminate your skin and you can
apply it anywhere
whereas with like Becca moonstone or
opal you wouldn't put that like all
over your face that's the best way I can
describe it Becca stuff those are
highlighters and then hourglass those
are more like you know illuminators so
this is marketed as an illuminator this
is what the outer packaging looks like
really really beautiful like super super
stunning these new ones by the way these
are new for I believe summer 2016 she
does have one shade that is already
permanent and that one is called
indiscretion but the new ones for summer
or spring 2016 are addiction which is a
gold devotion which is a pink and then
seduction which is a deep bronze here a
seduction this is the only one out of
all three of them I'm going to keep it
is absolutely stunning and I mean look
at that
like orgasmic okay the packaging is
orgasmic I will say the outer packaging
not that impressed $44 for a little
plastic container like this and not
super impressed I do like that there is
a mirror but I mean these are just
stunning stunning stunning to look at so
you have a really nice shade range here
I do want to point that out quickly she
did a really nice job with that the dark
color is great for those who want to
highlight um you know if they have
deeper skin tones or for people like me
who have fair skin who wants to go ahead
and bronze and then we have the gold
shade which is addiction which looks
beautiful but it just looks like a
glitter bomb exploded on your face when
you actually wear it and then we have
the light pink shade which is great for
it you know all fair-skinned girls love
the pink this is the shade devotion
and again looks beautiful but again
glitter bomb all over the face so these
are basically marketed as they smooth
creamy illuminator that you can dust all
over your freaking face you could not
dust these all over your face okay
the only one with the good formula is
this one which is seduction and I was
talking to my friend Amy because she was
like I'm only going to get the two
lighter ones because I'm never gonna use
this one it's really too bad that she
didn't pick this one off because this
one is the best out of the like all
three of them I hope that she goes ahead
and returns the other two so if she can
get this one because it is just
different the formulation is different
now I do want to say right away my issue
with these kind of illuminators even
though they look absolutely stunning
like when you're looking at them whether
it be an illuminator or a highlighter my
issue with stuff that has like a raised
surface or is it completely like flat is
that your finger or your brush is never
going to pick up the same amount of
product at once so you could put it in
there and really really get in there but
you're never evenly going to get a lick
completely even layer on your finger or
your brush it's the same thing with the
Laura Geller baked gelato swirl
illuminators those are more like a
highlighter by the way but it's the same
sort of thing they feel rough to the
touch but they go into the skin
beautifully but I think the reason they
feel rough is because they have that
little indentation which makes it cute
to look at but you have to think about
it like it feels actually rough those
are one of my favorite highlighters but
honestly they feel like this scratchy I
mean they feel like cardboard am I in my
opinion I have a lot of other
highlighters that are a lot creamier
like the becca ones are you know the
dior one but anyway so like I said the
packaging is okay I mean I don't really
like that it's plastic but these are
quite chunky you do get let's see here
0.35 ounces of product which actually
isn't that much for a $44 product like I
said the only one that I'm keeping is
this one I'm really happy that I went
ahead and picked off this darkest shade
and the reason I kind of wanted to was
because I thought it could be a blush
topper but really I just like to use
this to bronze my skin all over it's
beautiful it doesn't feel buttery to the
tattoo but it really does have something
different in it there is a little bit of
shimmer and sparkle in there but it goes
on a little more like a bakelite formula
which has been my favorite kind of
highlighter or illuminator like lately I
guess you could say I've just been
really really enjoying that sort of
formulate
this particular one just goes on so much
smoother than the other ones now one
thing I do want to touch on is that once
you start to kind of get into this
product you get the tiniest little
amount of hardpan and I'm one of those
people like I understand when you have
like oils on your fingers and you're
going in and swatching you can get hard
pan but hard pan is a freaking pain in
the ass if you don't know what hard pan
is it's basically where you get a film
over a product and you have to go in
with duct tape to remove it it just is
from like oily residue from your fingers
or your brushes but if this happened
immediately with all three of these and
I was like seriously
like I don't want to have to go and
freakin duct tape all the time like
that's just not something I personally
want to do so that really kind of shows
that these are very very hard pressed
and I'm not surprised because they feel
you know pretty rough to the texture so
overall I would say the only one that
I'm really impressed with is the
seduction one it just goes on a lot more
like finely milled and more shiny than
the other ones but these two I'm so not
impressed with so the pink one and the
gold one are stunning to look at I think
the color selection is beautiful but
they just have so much glitter in them I
just cannot stand it so when you first
apply that like you can see that looks
beautiful but when I start to turn my
finger to the side you can see it's not
evenly coated on there and that's
because of the texture and the fact that
it is pressed very hard but when you
actually like put it on and blend it out
the only thing that you end up really
seeing is the little tiny chunks of
glitter and I find personally that when
I first apply it it looks gorgeous it
looks like I have like a wet highlight
on and I just love it I think it looks
amazing literally within the hour or two
hours later all that's left are those
tiny little pieces of glitter and let me
tell you those will start to you like
emphasize and you sort of pores texture
fine lines that you have on your face I
don't care how perfect your skin is you
do not want glitter on your face and I
think that's something that irritates me
the most is that they actually market
these as illuminators and they recommend
dusting them all over your face and you
don't want to dust glitter all over your
face it just doesn't look cute so I feel
like these don't work as an illuminate
they don't work as a highlighter and I
just hate the wear time on them now this
one is better in my opinion like I said
the formulation is a little different on
this one definitely my favorite but I
find I have to wear a primer and use a
setting spray with this baby or it's
gone it's practically gone by the end of
the day they just don't blend into the
skin nice so I feel like they really
just sit on top of the skin and it's not
an attractive look so here's a pink one
this one is devotion and same thing as
the gold one it just has well first of
all turn pan on all three of them but it
looks really nice
when you go like this and then I bring
you guys up closer and you can kind of
see there's texture there it did not
evenly pick up the product your brush
will not evenly pick up the product and
then when you blend it out it looks nice
from far away it looks like oh yes
glowing but then up close you can
probably see there's a little bit of
grit there and of course like I said
again it's really hard for me to make
this video and tell you guys because it
looks beautiful but two hours later that
gorgeous like wet sheen is gone and all
you're left with is the glitter on your
face and the glitter stays there for the
rest of the day it's like okay that has
great stain powder powder great staying
power but the actual formulation like
the base of it like the illuminating
part literally just goes away instantly
so you're just left with like chunks of
glitter on your face and it makes my
fine lines look emphasize it makes my
skin look like ten times worse than it
is and I cannot see any sort of skin
type no matter if you have flawless skin
or not I cannot see these two shades
right here devotion and addiction yeah
addiction I cannot see these looking
good on your skin I'm sorry I just don't
think it's attractive when you have
something as glittery as this and you
dust it all over your face or you use it
just to highlight with she does say that
these are buildable but again it's like
buildable what if these are illuminators
I should be able to dust these all over
my face and there shouldn't be chunks of
glitter in there so I mean it's really
kind of difficult I've never tried I
know that um her face illuminator like I
see pictures of these all the time I
know that she releases new ones all the
time I
we have never tried them before so I had
not had experience with this formulation
which is why I got so excited and bought
all three but I will definitely be
returning addiction and also devotion
because I mean literally my drugstore
like my makeup revolution anything like
that at Physicians Formula
those illuminators or highlighters
perform ten times better than this for a
fraction of the price so I would say I
mean if you want a really gorgeous kind
of glowy bronzer I would recommend
checking out the shade seduction if you
have a very very dark deep like
chocolaty complexion I think this could
work as they I like for you but overall
I would say that this is just kind of a
disappointing formula
I cannot imagine this looking good on
anyone I'm wearing it today and honestly
well let me show you the one I'm right
today I am wearing devotion today for
the video to show you guys and I feel
like my fine lines are very emphasized
today if I don't think my skin looks
very good I just reapplied it and I
still feel like I'm kind of seen as like
glitter so it's not a highlighter I
don't think it can be used as an
illuminator I don't really know what
these are
I'm not even interested in trying to use
them as an eyeshadow because I don't
think they would even perform properly
um and yeah I would highly just
recommend staying away from these I
actually just think the formula is
pretty crappy you can still get a better
glowy bronzer than this one but I do
like this color it has kind of like a I
was like a cool tone undertone which I'm
really attracted to because I do have a
natural cool tone in my skin but yeah I
really don't know what to say guys I'm
just a very very disappointed with these
and it was my first time experimenting
with them again the formulation is new
to me but I just can't believe they were
so shitty because honestly people hype
these up so much I see pictures all over
and I don't blame them like I want to
take pictures of these they are so so so
gorgeous just looking at them it's like
these are absolutely stunning but it's
the way a product performs and just
because it's pretty doesn't mean that
it's good and I feel like that is what
you're getting with these so I hope you
guys enjoyed this little a review and
swatches on the new Laura Mercier at the
limited-edition shades for their face
illuminators
two of them will be going back if you
guys try these out let me know in the
comment section what you think I'm very
very curious and I will see you guys
