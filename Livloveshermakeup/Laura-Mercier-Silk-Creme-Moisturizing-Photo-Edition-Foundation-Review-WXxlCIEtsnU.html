going to be reviewing the laura mercier
silk creme moisturizing photo edition
foundation for you guys today I
purchased mine on the Sephora website it
was $48 and the shade I have is ivory um
I will say right away that the shade I
got ivory is much too yellow on my skin
um let me show you guys right now it
really is just way too yellow tone for
me and I probably should have picked up
the as you guys can see I probably
should have picked up the one with like
a pink or peach undertone because those
are the under times that I have on my
skin but I don't know I think the name
kind of threw me I thought ivory and I
thought oh that will match me but in
reality ivory just is too yellow for me
so I think if I were to go back and get
like another shade I would get the one
called rose ivory which is very fair
with cool like pink undertones so anyway
um let me tell you guys about this this
is a new foundation that they've come
out with there's silk creme foundation
is something that they have before but
they kind of wanted to revamp it and
release one that is supposed to give you
a flawless effect on camera you know
everything's coming out nowadays that
says photo finish or you know HD things
like that so this is supposed to be a
photo edition foundation it's supposed
to look flawless on camera flawless on
the face all that kind of stuff so
basically um you get let's see here one
food ants in this little packaging right
here so it looks like that you get one
fluid ounce and I really like it as you
guys can know if you guys can hear that
but it is really really liquidy and the
texture is a very smooth and creamy it
just really really glides on beautifully
when you blend it out I like using it
with my Beauty Blender but when you
blend it out with your fingers even you
can see that it just has such a smooth
beautiful creamy texture and it just
really makes the skin look gorgeous
um it's not super super high coverage
but the thing is is that it is
moisturizing and it does feel great on
the skin and I think that when you have
a product like that you're not gonna get
as high coverage of something that you
know is
Matt or something that doesn't have as
much moisture in it however this really
does give a nice I would say medium
buildable coverage so really really like
it um like I said the only thing I would
change is that ivory you know it's much
too yellow for me so I would go ahead
and pick up a different a different
color when I repurchase it because I
think I will repurchase this I do like
it a lot
um now for me personally right now I'm
going to be mixing this with like a
white mixer foundation when I get home
I'm out of town right now but when I get
home I think I'll be mixing this with
the face Atelier white foundation or
maybe even the ELA mask Oh rich liquid
foundation in RF 105 or 100 just so that
I can get it to match my skin tone
perfectly so anyway on the back it says
the technique of using this it says
shake well before using and apply a
small amount with a sponge blend gently
into skin for a flawless luminous finish
and I think it really does give a nice
luminous finish to the skin um that can
be covered up immediately when you apply
powder sorry my cats running around
Beckham V you know it doesn't look like
shiny luminous it just looks beautiful
on the skin it's like a Demi matte kind
of satiny finish if that makes sense
like a combination of the two and I
think it's really beautiful it really
does work really well with the blue t AB
you a blue B blender a Beauty Blender or
any kind of a damp sponge but like I
said it does apply well with your
fingertips as well let me read you guys
a little bit of what it says on the
Sephora website um it says it's $48 like
I told you guys it looks like it has
about 15 different shades so you really
can get your color right I recommend not
doing it online like I did because of
course - too yellow I would recommend
going into the store and testing it on
your neck and seeing you know which
shade blends in um so it says what it is
a 12-hour wear photo-ready foundation
for a flawless natural looking finish it
says what it does it's the moisturizing
long-wear formula blends seamlessly onto
skin hiding even hard to cover
imperfections it's intensely pigmented
it provides full coverage feels
comfortable on the skin and increases
the skin's luminosity ingredients it's
infused with a silk protein blend to
help
retain and deliver moisture for normal
to dry skin leaving a photo-ready finish
that's perfectly photogenic for video
photography and special events what else
you need to know laura mercier said this
a woman should feel flawless every day
whether she is dropping her kids off at
school or getting ready for a black-tie
event whether you're seeking an oil-free
formula with a natural matte finish or a
moisturizing formula with a luminous
finish silk creme photo edition
foundations will give you the confidence
for a photo ready flawless finish
whatever the occasion so keep a little
quote there I like that's beautiful um
but like I said I'm really really happy
with this it is pricey I mean I think
$48 is pricey for a foundation but
that's just what you get when you
purchase um you know a higher-end
foundation so I think I would repurchase
I do like it enough just for reference I
have combination skin I tend to be oily
in the t-zone and dry on the cheeks but
I this works well for my skin so the
only thing I would change is my shade
but I would definitely repurchase so I
hope you guys enjoyed this review of the

photo edition foundation I will link
below where you guys can pick this up
from the Sephora website and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
