my channel happy Friday today's video is
going to be my lifestyle favourites for
March 2017 the reason why I'm starting a
lifestyle favorites is because number
one people have been asking where the
hell did tea time would live go number
two people have been asking why I
haven't been showing home fragrances in
at my weekly favorites videos and number
three everybody's been asking about not
everybody but a large amount of you
especially on snapchat have been asking
if I would make more videos about my
vegan lifestyle all that kind of stuff I
was raised vegan and I recently switched
back to eating vegan of five days a week
I will eventually get back to seven days
a week but just right now while I'm
starting out I like to be able to eat
what I want on the weekends and then
five days a week eat vegan and I kind of
made that decision just for my health
thing do you feel better when I'm not
eating meat I do feel better when I'm
not eating dairy and my lupus flare is
honestly or less severe when I don't eat
as much dairy so anyway I thought I
would go ahead and just put all the
stuff into one video so that I don't
have to be doing like tea time would
live and then all those other kind of
stuff a little miscellaneous series all
over the place during the month so this
is just gonna be an easy way for me to
share my fashion favorites my food
favorites home fragrance favorites and
my tea favorites so let's go ahead and
jump right into it we're gonna start
with fashion favorites the first fashion
favorite is definitely this address
right here so I did post a picture of
this on Instagram and a lot of you were
like holy you actually have a curvy
body I am very sorry you guys I'm like
5-2 and I weigh about 105 pounds but I
do have almost a full D cup and this
this particular dress you guys makes my
boobs look great it really does I do
have to wear those little chicken
cutlets underneath so that it can push
them up because if you do have natural
breasts like I do and you do have a
larger cup size then chances are your
boobs do say just a little bit and mind
you they are starting to get a little
saggy so I do have to go ahead and wear
chicken cutlets to kind of push it up
with this but this is a beautiful
beautiful dress I will go ahead and link
a picture down below if you want to see
what it actually looks like on but it
goes down to about the knee and you guys
can see it has this beautiful beautiful
print on it so it's white and then it
has like this lilac kind of purpley blue
kind of flowers on here and it does have
convertible straps so you can wear this
however you want to what I like to do is
actually crisscross it around my neck
right here so I kind of go like this and
then I let everything kind of hang out
here and in the back it actually has the
straps just going down and vered
and you can wear it the other way as
well if you don't want to show off as
much cleavage thanks Cleveland typical
image of things like that but overall I
would say this is just amazing I've been
wearing this for date night and I know
it's freaking cold out but I always make
sure I'm worried my jacket with it but
yeah I like to wear this on date night
it makes me feel sexy and I have gained
quite a bit of weight this past year I
think I put on about well not that much
I think I put on like 10 or 12 pounds
normally I'm anywhere between like 90
and 105 and I think the heaviest I got
this year was up to like 100 1215 so I
was not sure if this would still fit me
this year but it does and it's beautiful
I did get it from Wet Seal I heard that
Wet Seal is going out of business so I'm
sure you could get something similar at
ah let's see here Charlotte Russe and ow
so probably forever 21 but yeah really
love that the second fashion favorite
for the month are definitely these are
boots right here so these are from
JustFab calm I'm not affiliated with any
of the brand what I'm talking about in
this video by the way
but justfab.com is an awesome brand
where you can get like a subscription
service that is what I have I think I
recently cancelled it cuz I'm trying to
move to all natural or all cruelty free
subscription boxes but I did push these
boots a couple of months ago they're
really really comfortable I'm the one
thing I will say is I'm a size six so I
do have very small kind of like narrow
feet this is a 5.5 and it still is a
little big on me so if you do have very
narrow feet or very small feet - these
might not fit you I would really
recommend going down a side with
justfab.com
uhm but yeah overall these are just
really cute I like that they have a
little bit of a heel like I said I'm a
shorty so I really do enjoy a little bit
of a heel and those have just been
favorites for me this month and then
finally of course infinity scarves I'm
always wearing infinity scarves and I
feel like I never really wear them on
camera honestly just because it's so hot
it's so hot when you film under these
lights but I do have this one right here
which is kind of like an ice hockey
shade I have this one which is black
this is the one I'm actually wearing
today with this outfit just not right
now and then I have this one right here
and it feels so soft my mom got this
from me a couple of years ago and yeah I
like to wear this with my jacket
I love infinity scars because you can
wear them just like straight down or you
can kind of wear them like a shawl I can
even like jazz those up and wear it on a
stage if I have a really like open kind
of dress and I want to be a little more
conservative you can just kind of wear
it as a shawl and it's so beautiful so
really really been enjoying infinity
scarves alright
ahead and jump into food a favourites
the first one I want to talk about is
this Barney the butter this is almond
butter it is smooth and it says it's
made in a peanut free facility so this
is what it looks like I was trying to
figure out why the hell this almond
butter tastes so good and now I know why
it does have cane sugar palm fruit oil
and sea salt in it and lately I've been
trying to eat really really well so I've
been eating peanut butter that's
literally just like crushed peanuts and
sea salt but it really tastes better
when there is a little bit of sugar in
there a little bit of salt in there and
I've just been absolutely loving this so
that has been a favorite I also have
been loving the coffee Nate's natural
blue pick coffee mate
natural bliss coconut milk creamer this
is all natural it is dairy-free I had
such a hard time finding a good coffee
creamer I do drink coffee in the morning
one cup I have like a blonde rose and I
only do one cup a day I really don't
need it but it just kind of became like
a trend in the morning you know you wake
up and you do certain things for me it's
drinking a cup of coffee so I usually
have about a six ounce cup of coffee and
I always have this in there now and it
is so freakin good you guys the actual
flavor is sweet creme and if you really
love those super super super sweet
coffee creamers like I used to I would
highly recommend checking this out you
do have to dump quite a bit in there but
it's only let's see here 25 calories for
one tablespoon so that's what like I
guess 1015 calories less than 1
tablespoon of like the regular dairy one
so I really really enjoy this super
super good and it is non-gmo which is
awesome and then finally and my last
favorite has definitely been this diet
cheese right here this is a dairy-free
jalapeno Hardy style cheese and this is
the third little tub that I'm going
through this month and look how gross i
am i literally have just been digging my
goddamn fork in there and the reason for
that is because tom will never touch
this Tom will never go vegan he loves
meat and that's fine so I have just been
going ahead and basically eating like
eating right off the block I've been
eating it right off the block you guys
and honestly it's so good there are a
lot of vegan cheese's out there that
really don't taste like cheese but I
find that if you want to find one that's
really really good and it does sort of
taste like cheese get one that is flavor
this jalapeno really kind of covers up
that super super strange vegan cheese
taste and it just honestly really does
taste like cheese so I have been
enjoying that a lot um
as far as home fragrance is concerned I
haven't enjoyed these two products here
from Bath and Body Works the first one
is a deep cleansing hand soap this is
very Mary meringue and I know a lot of
you were saying why don't you show these
anymore in weekly favorites
I want my weekly favourites to be
designated only to beauty so this is why
this is like when I will show you guys
my favorites from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works for
the month so anyway this is whipped
lemon meringue glazed sugar and a hint
of vanilla and it smells amazing you
guys I got this during the Christmas
time I feel like it was during Christmas
time and at first I wasn't really into
it cuz I was like it just smells like
springtime but now it's springtime and
it really smells amazing it kind of
feels like you're rubbing like a like a
that doesn't feel like it but it smells
like you're rubbing like a lemon bar on
your hands so it smells really really
good if you do like the scent of lemon
but not like that Meyer kitchen lemon
like you want something that still
smells kind of like a cupcake lemon you
would enjoy that and then also I have
been in loving my New York black-tie
three we can handle this smells like Tom
or like I don't even know it's like
mahogany teak wood had a baby and this
is what a smells like it is so so so
good so anyway this is a dramatic stage
dark tonka bean and rich sandalwood and
I don't even know I don't smell any of
that in here I just smelled like a sexy
man it kind of reminds me of the ec
Miyake cologne like the original one so
if you love that you would love both and
I really only burned one of these at a
time normally I have like seven candles
burning at the same time if you follow
me on snapchat but I don't do that with
this one because it is so overpowering
it's like mahogany teak wood and it
really really has a strong fragrance
throw so you want to be careful with
this one at Tom gets a headache if I
burn more than one at a time then but
more than one at a time but yeah it
smells amazing really really have been
loving that and finally let's go ahead
and talk about teas so I do have three
tea favorites and then two empties the
empties are let's see here at the wild
orange blossom loose leaf tea from
Teavana this is a blend of soothing
herbal orange hibiscus and light floral
undertones really really good enjoyed
that iced without any sweetener and then
the other one is the celestial
Seasonings peppermint herbal tea so this
is just something that I drink all the
time I am someone who does have a little
bit like a weak stomach if I'm getting
carsick or if I do it like wake up in
the morning and I just feel a little
nauseous and I can't handle like an
actual tea with caffeine in it like
green tea or black tea or coffee like oh
my
it can't handle any of that I will go
for peppermint tea I like this ice I
don't like it with any sort of sweetener
or I do like it hot so peppermint tea is
just something I always have and then as
far as the favorites are concerned I
have been loving the Republic of tea
acai green tea this is a super fruit tea
it's really really good you guys have
gone through quite a few cases of this
in the past couple of months it smells
amazing and these are unbleached tea
bags so you can find this at Whole Foods
if you like blueberry
I feel like acai is the kind of like
blueberry but a little more tart so I
really like it I only like this hot I do
not like it cold and what I like to do
is go ahead and put in some of the
Teavana Belgian rock sugar or a whole
lot of raw honey in there and it just
tastes amazing so been enjoying that and
then I also have been loving bee Teavana
poached pear cider this is an herbal
blend I only like this one I so I don't
know what my deal is for some reason
this doesn't taste good to me hot so
what I do is I make it in my perfect tea
maker is a loose leaf as you guys can
see I make it in the perfect tea maker I
do put a little bit of the Belgian rock
sugar in and then I dump it into a
couple with ice in it so that I actually
ice itself and it just tastes amazing it
definitely has that sweetness from the
pear in there but at the same time you
have like that cardamom and a little bit
of the ginger in there and it just
really tastes amazing and honestly
smells amazing and then finally I have
been loving my celestial Seasonings a
seasonal favorite caffeine free sugar
plum spice tea and I think I mentioned
this in my last teatime of live video as
well it is a plum delicious blend with
hibiscus ginger and cinnamon and what I
like to do with this is take five
different teabags I put them into my
fruit infuser like my water pitcher and
then I fill it up with cold water I
leave it overnight and in the morning
you have really good iced tea and I
don't like this with any sort of
sweetener so this is just amazing and
super super and delicious so anyway guys
those are my lifestyle favorites for the
month I really hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow for a
first impressions with all new sorts of
products so yeah I'll see you guys then
