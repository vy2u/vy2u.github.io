it's funny because you have to open up a
separate window and when I open it up
I'm watching myself back but like two
minutes ago
so it's kind of strange hi everyone hi
tell me I'm pretty you
pretty yes yes yes I can hear you loud
and clear well you guys know me every
time I record hey guys alright let's see
here love you I love you too
you're so naturally beautiful you guys I
put some BB cream on because I was a
little worried okay my face my face of
love and I have been like really really
just super super um like dull looking
skin let's see here how is your finger
my finger is much better I don't know if
you guys can see this cuz I can't see
this like okay
oh now I see it okay it is so we're
looking at two reflections of myself let
me tell ya alright hello lovely lady
have you tried the Physicians Formula
argan oil line I have tried the mascara
I wasn't a huge fan and then I did try I
think it was the pure oil but it wasn't
like a hundred percent pure so it wasn't
my favorite you were gorgeous without
makeup like I said I put a little baby
cream on okay so Punk it should twist it
okay um it's getting to meet you I know
yes do your students watch you what do
they think of your channel they are not
allowed to watch that is actually
against um I guess like guidelines you
could say at the conservatory that I
teach them so why do I look so pink
right now oh I'm very pink but yeah they
are not allowed to go over to my channel
and it's a very competitive school so
they will get kicked out you know if
they do something twice so they're not
allowed to do that which is good because
yeah I swear a lot if you guys haven't
noticed I swear I love you too Britney
thank you top drugstore cruelty-free
brands okay well on Monday I'm going to
be doing a shop and swatch okie hold on
I have to X out this thing because I'm
looking at myself and I'm like mute
stuff I cannot I don't want to know
watch my videos back um what was the
question
Oh grouchy free drugs don't yeah so I'm
gonna be doing that on Monday um I feel
like hard candy Physicians Formula I
mean kind of Physicians Formula not so
much like their foundations and stuff
but there are bronzers for sure I really
love a wet and wild right now I've been
so obsessed uh let's see here what's
your favorite part of teaching music I
just really enjoy seeing you know my
students grow like with their instrument
I really enjoy that I don't know how
else to describe it makes me really
happy but I know deep down
I'm more of a performer so yeah at some
point I'm gonna have to do some sort of
a performing gig how would the school
know if a student watched your video
well you know how kids are they have
like a nasty little habit of sharing
photos and videos and usually they get
caught like on their phones so or you
know maybe a parent sees something and
they know that that's not allowed so
it's good because I'm just like
something you know all over the place on
my channel we do not need my students
seen that because I do not swear at all
when I'm sorry I'm trying to read it and
do that at the same time I am you know I
do not swear obviously when I'm working
what was it like growing up vegan it was
devastating
no I'm just kidding it wasn't it was
fine I feel good you know I felt really
really good actually started getting
health problems and lupus when I started
eating dairy and meat just saying let's
be here thank you for being so real with
us I appreciate your views on sponsored
videos thank you yeah of course I'm just
not I'm just not there with my channel
sing for us grow like a nothing mm-hmm
literally pause Netflix for this oh my
god thank you I'm honored thoughts on
Eevee blender uh they need a new
PR team that's my thoughts like what the
hell seriously what the hell um what do
you teach
what age do you teach so any sort of age
I teach mostly the younger kids just
because kids seem to like me law and I
have that kind of personality that gets
them like wanting to do stuff so mostly
kids but I also do teach some a mature
adult students sometimes it can be a
little awkward though if hmm excuse me
it can be a little awkward if like
student is the same age as you which
sometimes happens to me so mm-hmm
oh it's not alcohol guys this is the
smart water with some of the 1,000
milligram of vitamin C NS like all I
drink and other stuff love from Dallas

them both with them okay

natural healing with us as you go

the smokey bird one or whatever I know
everybody wants the really neutral one I
look at that and I'm like that literally
looks like every single palette I have
in my collection so I wanted to go with
the smoky colors and let's see here
recommendations for a good cruelty free
foundation
I love the Josie Maran Argan narcan
enlightenment that's not it the Josie
Maran vibrancy foundation fluid I wear
the shade dynamic and it's just so
beautiful
you love that I'm all over the place I
actually am like this is literally how I
am talked about ADHD a lot of people ask
me they're like do you like act when
you're on camera try and be more bubbly
bitch no I do not know if you're any
more bubbly like it's just it's just
layer alright let's see here I ordered
the coverage foundation from the
ordinary I am on like a waiting list for
that so yeah um I used to live in Kansas
and Tennessee oh no no tornado scared
the out of me I know I know I agree
I agree horrible oh my god then I'm
scared alright I requested the elf
skincare video yes um a lot of you have
been saying I haven't been showing as
many drugstore products and I totally
agree with that I do apologize the thing
is is that hold on one sec goodness
freaking throat's closing up um what was
I saying oh come on all of it you can do
it you can do it guys I forgot what what
was I saying someone remind me please
this is literally me you don't act at
all your true personality always shows
and it's fantastic thank you so much I
literally just forgot what I was saying
um something about I don't know it's
gone now I'm sorry I don't remember a
drug store drug store products drug
store when well unicorn collection
oh yes drug store products okay okay
okay I'm back on track so drug store
products I just haven't really been
talking about them on my channel not
because I don't like a go deal
because I do um it's just because
there's not a lot of cruelty free at
drugstore brands out there um it's like
really hard to find cause like L'Oreal
15 owns everything I was like a so uh
yeah am I getting the new wet and wild
collection hell yeah I'm not getting
like that tart unicorn collection I'm
getting the Wet n Wild I'm liking that
for a fraction of the price those
brushes love it
excellent a drugstore skincare silly
goose I know sorry um okay all of your
reminding me thank you I appreciate it
this is the whole area so thank you
alright let's see here I'm such a fan I
brought you Oh
Calliope Allah for Nia how nice ordinary
uh products burnt Amaya face uh you
bought the ones for psoriasis because I
was going to say if you got like an H a
or something maybe that's why Pacifica
Cosmetics love well no wait shouldn't
say love the cosmetics I feel like their
eyeshadows I'm like their makeup needs
to be worked on but their skincare
products are very very good I have a
squirrel personality too I know people
are like you you must have just like
done like three lines of cocaine or
something I get that all the time and
I'm like no this is just who I am I'm
sorry um yes yes uh oh yes squirrel
twirl yeah
thoughts on towards upcoming stick of
foundation I have my fingers crossed I
don't that's what I have to say too tart
I'm not getting it nope do you ever play
the piccolo I do if I'm pan it is
 in Moline and that instrument
also yeah I love that you say yarn
instead of damn but we'll say
 - I see darn did I just say that
Wow it's nearly 130 a.m. here in
Scotland and you're watching me live oh
so sweet
Kareena she has
as Kareena Kapoor kaboom kaboom she has
loved us maybe that's not the right
Kareena ah my for bird baby say hi oh my
goodness I wish I could have mr. badger
here but like I said I had to put him in
his room for safety reasons because he
would stay underneath the couch and get
blown out with like a freakin tornado
and that would not be okay about the H a
serum how high is a percentage was it
like 5% um I think they have a 10% 1/2 I
don't know I don't know I just ordered a
bunch of random stuff and honestly like
the ordinary line it came out to like 40
bucks off of Beauty lish for like five
products hi from Ohio where is your
hometown
Minnesota um let's see your Minneapolis
Minnesota Clearwater Florida
the glossier sunscreen okay classy eh
you guys I need to go ahead and start
purchasing from them because so many of
you have told me that they're so good um
can you do a review on the new and
organic skin care I have never heard of
that but I will definitely check it out
are you posting that video tonight the
reason why I'm on here your best is
because the footage corrupted again it
corrupted again which was so
annoying I just don't know how to work
electronics okay do you like the
rainforest of the sea water foundation I
did not so I actually reviewed it and it
was too dark for me I got like right
when it released so it was the lightest
shade at the time it was way too dark on
my skin it actually made me very very
greasy and oily throughout the day I
prefer my Stila one so yeah I don't like
that I know a lot of people do but not
me are you bringing music Monday back
you know what I'm going to I'm going to
start combine it together with shop and
swatch my sesh Minnesota yes
glossy sunscreen is over 30 bucks for
one ounce well is it a physical sunblock
maybe that's why no judgment
oh oh that comment just disappeared I
guess mean Rochelle is on that Jeff
who showed up it's time to feed him
Alexandra's talking about her adorable
cat she sends me a lot of snaps of him
and he is so freaking cute what are your
favorite color pop cosmetics I don't
really like color pop that much you guys
I mean I feel like I have a few products
from them that I do kind of like but I'm
not a huge fan of like these super you
know shock cheeks and what is this the
like the eyeshadows - I'm just not I'm
not that into it let's see here Kaylee
I'm sorry this is like starting
- it's starting to lag a little bit um
how did sponsors get ahold of you well I
don't do sponsorships so I do not do any
sponsorships on my channel currently but
I am a member of like octa Li so I go on
there and I do get products sent to me
but it's you know in exchange for an
honest review always okay while this
thing is it stalling for you guys - it's
just going and it's like I can't read it
do you have any Pixie faves I am going
to be placing an order with them I
really do like their makeup settings
right I think it's really really
beautiful but I wouldn't say that I've
tried like a ton of their products so I
can't really say rachelle is the
thank you for taking out trash girl
exactly exactly
um let's see here mr. badger I know I'm
sorry's in the other room I know hmm
milky jelly cleanser for life what is
that that sounds amazing thoughts on the
clover palette not getting it also not
getting it I know that they were saying
that like a percentage is going to help
animal testing or something like that
and I thought that was so
backwards because it's like okay Estee
Lauder literally is the parent company
right now and yet they're gonna give a
percentage to stop that I just don't
understand so I would rather take my
money and go donate to like the Humane
Society you know what I mean ah
Aloha hi milky jelly cleanser it's from
oh it's from glossier okay I have no
idea I've never tried any glossier
products out let's see here
ooh oh they're cruelty free a wonderful
wonderful
are there any makeup brands that aren't
cruelty free that you will have a harder
time not buying from like favorite
products YSL I really love like all the
why I sell products that I've tried
except for that fusion ink Foundation
and I really love like their lip
products so that's going to be hard when
I you know go through those completely
let's see here I know you'll tell the
truth what the blush and bronzer do you
like what do you what let's see here Oh
bronzer lion I'm sorry the guy just
disappeared I'm sorry I go hard to give
you up with these ah like blushes and
bronzers I love the Physicians Formula
warmer Oh butter bronzers but they're
still looking good I'm
not a huge fan of the blushes and more
remember the Muro Muro blushes because I
feel like it they're really strange
colors I know they just released two
more shades yeah they only have like
four shades was kind of weird best
lightweight foundation probably like the
Stila aqua glow or even the one I was
wearing the other day which was the
Smashbox camera ready BB water drops
those are really nice as well love from
Bermuda nice I love the fusion in
foundation girl it sinks into my pores
like I literally see this whole mess on
my face I think of an empty clutter at -
Rochelle um let's see here
she loves high-end foundations mm-hmm
yes Rochelle does so I think I'll give
that to her is Clinic cruelty free they
most certainly are not cruelty forever
they do some pretty heavy testing but
again I don't know it's just my
conspiracy allegedly allegedly guys um
let's see here
I'm so sorry you guys this thing is like
it's not scrolling down quick enough
your favorite is you a cosmetics
products I've tried one product the rose
gold highlighter rose gold rose quartz
and I like it it's really nice um I love
that I'm getting to talk to you thank
you love that you're here thoughts on
the jeffree star cosmetics alright so I
do want to do a full video because I
just I need to get like myself into the
right mindset because right now I'm just
kind of like mmm like you I I'm
just gonna say it I am NOT okay with
some of the stuff that he's done in the
past I understand that it's in the past
but I don't feel like he's ever given a
really good apology he like apologized
on Twitter I was like really Twitter you
should have made a video on YouTube
saying that you're not racist I believe
he's a closet racist to be completely
honest and I don't know like I I just
truly believe now like I know he did you
know he said all those things and then
he brought all these african-american
women into the actual campaign for like
all these photo shoots and all this kind
of stuff it was just so crunchy to me
because I'm like it's like you're trying
so hard to act like you're not racist
but like I feel like he's slightly
faceless I'm sorry I just am NOT okay
with that and
yeah the thing about you know throwing
acid on an african-american woman's skin
you know with what the that is not
okay okay that's not okay I'm the way
that I said watched a video where he was
on stage and a girl grabbed him and he
 freaked out dude
welcome to the performers lights like
what is wrong with you you have to be
able to deal with the audience like I
just I don't understand I know a lot of
people were saying that was sexual
assault you know whatever I've had
people come up like I'll be on stage and
they like pull on my dress a little bit
or you know I mean I'm not like I don't
know what kind of music he did I'm more
you know um classical music which is I
guess that's a little more laid-back
old-school but I still have people that
come up you know they'll be giving me
bouquets and things like that and
sometimes they like shoot them
underneath my dress I mean there's
little things that happen and you just
get used to that because your performer
and he claims to be a performer and I'm
like well then and handle this like a
performer so I don't know guys I just
can't I don't know I can't bring myself
to buy anything from his line I just
can't support I can't talk about his
makeup okay it could be amazing
um it could also be a complete I
don't know I'll never know because I
just don't support people like that and
I will be making a video but I feel like
you know I get a little ranty with this
because I'm just like see pallet drama
didn't he going yes he palette as you
seen again like where's your PR
team it's like the same thing with the e
be like whatever they were like oh we
fired the person who said that to you
yeah right that was you the lady who
created the brand like get your
together you're gonna be a brand B it
classy about it looking Jared and
 fighting with everyone in
Jeffrey - I'm like you guys don't look
classy to me I'm sorry I don't like him
because of uh don't plan on buying from
his line because of this oh did you link
something what's your favorite classical
piece to play how so many so many but
like I really love Shasti Shostakovich
symphony number ten oh that second
movement yes yes yes also saying any
 about Jeffrey's asking for a drama
from him and this is true he's probably
gonna take my video down um when I do
put it up so I'm probably just not going
to monetize it so that like YouTube
knows like I'm
literally just trying to give my opinion
allegedly conspiracy okay um because you
have to be very careful but I heard that
he goes and he he takes
everything down so he might yeah hi
Erica girl Rand Rand Rand yeah I just
can't I just can't
okay I'm sorry and people might say he's
changed he's not racist anymore it
doesn't work like that
okay I'm sorry alright how do you feel
about Tati seen it she will not mention
Too Faced cosmetics on her channel
anymore that's fine I mean she's like
besties with you know was a safe packard
star it seems like she's close with
Geoffrey star now um they were like I
don't know there was like photos of them
together so I mean who knows if that's
actually like they're close but it seems
like she supports him so maybe that's
why I feel like he has a very
interesting way of getting people to
like side with him almost you guys know
what I mean I guess probably just cuz
he's a performer he's just good at
getting people to uh what the what
did I say Tara I'm sorry if you don't
like it that's totally fine we can have
different opinions it's okay
um what are your thoughts on the YouTube
beauty guru click well I'm not part of
that clique so I'm not cool like that
um but you mean like Patrick Starr
Manny MUA I I don't really have anything
to say I don't really watch their
channels I they seem a little phony they
kind of seem like they'll do stuff for
money and that's fine you know if you're
hustling keep on hustling ah but you
know I I really don't know what to say I
just feel like if you're gonna be making
that kind of money at all this kind of
stuff I feel like you should be posting
a couple times a week you know what I
mean these people post like what like
once a month I mean what is going on
here you know and they say oh I care
about my subscribers and I love my
channel do you really or you just like
it now because of the money
which by the way like the money is
right now on YouTube um I'm gonna say it
because I'm allowed to you and a lot of
people were like you're not allowed to
say this I read my Google contract I am
so uh you know a couple months ago I was
making probably about like two thousand
two thousand a month right now I think
I'm down to like 800 like 800 for the
whole month so that was like a huge drop
which I really didn't notice anything at
first
what's funny is that there's more views
my channel people are watching longer
but it's just a bad time to be on
YouTube so this will be a good time for
you guys to be able to see which
youtubers are doing it for money and
which ones are just doing it because
they really like to do it like me let's
see here do me favorite brushes videos
yeah of course I can do that um oh my
god Oh what are we seeing oh my god
because I said something wrong I'm sorry
um if you feel that way we can have
different opinions guys it's fine
holy that's terrible oh no no no
okay let me see Jeffrey is so repetitive
he says the same jokes every video I
this is the thing about Jeffrey like I
was subscribed to him at one point
because you know what it puts on a good
show he's funny he's got like
that whole I mean I can see it like
artsy he's performing he's performing
when he's on camera and I saw him too
like a what's in my bag and he was
literally pulling out nice and and
I was like that is literally me like I
was laughing I thought it was really
funny um but I just I I don't know I
just can't get over it you guys I just
don't like the racism thing is just
that's that's a big thing for me I just
I don't I don't want to go there let's
see here I will talk about it I'm just
gonna be like hopefully calm cool
collected because right now I'm gonna be
like I don't want to do that on my
stream cuz I'll probably feel bad
I shouldn't though it is just my opinion
let's see I will never watch Jeffery I
mean he's entertaining you know he's
entertaining our bone cosmetics I've
never heard of them is that cruelty-free
hmm Oh Ronny cosmetics yeah so I
definitely want to try out those
lipsticks but I'm kind of worried
because they're like glitter infused
right I really like his shiny though I
really like her um there's been a little
no no I don't even say that but I don't
want people think I'm trying to start
drama but I know that she's close with a
youtuber who apparently really hates me
like really funny hates me um I mean
this is all just initially she has like
a I don't know like a Facebook group and
I guess she was like completely bashing
the hell out of me and I'm just like
girl like we don't even know each other
like what's your problem so I actually
wrote to her am I gonna say I wouldn't
feel like that's just literally starting
drama she's not more subscribers than me
but I wrote her a little Instagram
message and she never wrote back but I
yeah I like Shaunie I feel like I don't
know maybe did you won't talk to me
because she's friends with this person I
know who I know but like you guys I mean
this was all just like someone told me
that this happened so I don't want to
like call her out by name and be like oh
yeah she did this because someone took a
screenshot of like what she had said and
it was my review on the sweet peach
palette uh you know she was just saying
like I can't take her seriously someone
who can't do her makeup and it's just it
is what it is you know what I mean like
I I tried to handle it like a good
person I went to her and I was like
that's something to say say it's me
that's not really I mean I just feel
like oh she has something to say like
I'm say it to my face you know
ah but who could hate you oh my god so
many people hate me oh my god I
know spill that tea I know I know if it
ever like comes to fruition and it was
totally true and I totally had like
hardcore evidence cuz again like it was
just one of those things where I never
saw the group myself like yes I saw her
response but I mean it's just a response
she's look she's allowed to have you
know her thoughts on me but thought it
was kind of funny because we have very
similar channels and um you would think
a youtubers you know would have more
respect for each other but their
caddy is and crazy um let's see
here
damn Rochelle who when is Rochelle fake
uh to see live fight this person go
bitch take this outside oh my goodness
no seriously I was just like almost like
this outside no I literally was just
like you have something to say come
stayed in my comment section let's talk
it out and I yeah she read it and said
nothing so that's the beauty community
everything is drama these days right I'm
like girl if you Havey can't you just
 tell me like you don't have to
go tell their people just tell me it's
fine
ah let's see here I ordered metal straws
oh I should be drinking out of one right
now but so many people were saying it
was annoying in the last video
I'm sure this looks annoying to Alexa
but I yeah it was very oh it was quite
annoying I tried watching that video
back now I know let's see here Chucky
taiyaki I guess you did it was a good
review
oh okay cash me Elsa cash me I said yeah
girl come on we can have a review battle
alright let's see here who are your
favorite most trusted Beauty influencers
on YouTube so I have them all listed out
on my actual page if you guys go to like
my profile you can see like I recommend
channels to watch so definitely
Stephanie Nicole who I found out she's
actually subscribed to me which I was
like what the I saw that the other
day she's been subscribe for like three
months I was like oh my god I just love
her you know I love her like that is my
version of like a amazing youtuber you
know what I mean I know everybody's like
oh many MUA all these people that have
like 2 million subscribers
Stephanie Nicole is the bomb
nobody will ever be able to review stuff
the way she can um she's just amazing so
her I love Tara babes another favorite
of mine I just have a lot of people that
I really enjoy watching and I do also
like watching smaller channels - do you
think the drama channels make it uh make
it work for the beauty community what is
your opinions on those types of channels
well I'm friends with Sanders and I
Prince with rich luxe I love rich what
seriously he's like my BAE
um you know again they're just putting
on a show at least like riches in my
opinion he's not trying to get too
serious about it and I'm okay with that
you know we all like to come home and
maybe gossip a little bit or hear about
like what other people are doing with
their lives they're basically like a
gossip magazine but they're reading it
to you I don't mind I mean some of it
gets a little serious and I'm
just like you know let's take it easy
cuz when you're not like you know I'm
not like a undercover agent here you
know it's most of the stuff you can just
find online but for the most part I like
drama channels like that you know I like
them I feel like people or youtubers who
hate drama channels are also a little
nervous that they're probably going to
get called out or exposed and I don't
know I feel like I'm just very honest
with you guys nobody can expose me
there's nothing to expose um do you like
Kareena kabooms drama channel I like
Kareena kaboom kaboom sometimes I feel
like she can be a little much like
watching her video on the back of thing
she was like saying the wrong prices and
talking about different stuff that she
wasn't like the
I correct information I guess it's just
because mmm my choking hmm I guess
because I have a beauty channel or a
review channel and that is why I was
like really listening to that
information but she got like a bunch of
stuff wrong and it kind of made me
cringe just a little bit but I like her
here for the tea yes I saw here for the
tea's video literally attacking oh wait
Oh attacking Casey Holmes over her
marriage it's her personal life drama
channels yeah listen I mean I've heard a
lot of things about Casey Holmes too you
know and people say no you know I don't
know I keep seeing over and over that
she's like a Republican or something and
I'm like who the cares okay like I
read a stirred I'm not Republican I'm
democratic but who cares like let her
vote prove she wants to vote for I mean
I just can't believe people literally
sit there and argue about that kind of
stuff I used to love Jackie a lot but I
have seen her be really vicious to her
fans on Instagram you know I also have
been accused of being very vicious you
know it can be hard sometimes you guys
to be completely honest you know people
just keep coming back and saying the
same thing and if it can kind of like
affect you and for me at what I mean by
a fact is like if it's like about my
hair or like my lupus I feel sad like it
hurts my feelings it's not other stuff
actually pissed and I know that
I have like a little bit of an issue
with anger stuff that is nothing new to
me um but yeah I guess I can kind of see
why sometimes youtubers lash out but I
feel like a lot of these bigger
youtubers don't say anything like
frequently enough to you know what I
mean they let all this build up in
their comments section is like would it
really hurt just to answer a comment or
two you know what I mean just kind of
funny I'm let's see here who things live
is vicious what the oh I thought
you said someone just wrote that in here
I've been told that I'm a little
aggressive sometimes when I'm troll back
the trolls um but I'm like okay if I
have the time and if you're just trying
to make me upset you're not like I just
I just don't hear enough I know that
sounds really bad but it is what it is
do you like shades of Cassie who's that
I don't know what that is does she she
has a channel uh what is your opinion on
Jaclyn heal she's very hyper like me I
feel like if I was talking to her
face-to-face there would be like no
conversation going on because
most of us are like squirrel hey you
know what I mean she's just a little too
hyper from you guys she makes me feel
out of my skin I really like watching
calm people so she's beautiful her
makeups amazing um but again not really
my kind of channel to watch just because
I prefer review based channels let's see
here that's one reason I love her live
treats us like people not annoying
fangirls yeah I'm never gonna call you
guys like hey laughing hey little
flowers oh my gosh that's so weird
like they give you pet names it's like
oh yeah I really care about my
subscriber so I'm gonna call you my
little my little fishy yeah okay mm-hmm
let's see here how about Tati you know
what Tati I've been subscribed to you
and then unsubscribe
right now I'm unsubscribed I'm just
because I'm not as into her content but
I mean she knows what she's
talking about that beautiful skin I know
she's a little she's not older but she's
a little more mature as far as beauty
gurus are concerned
uh yeah Trisha Trisha species I know I
watch her videos you guys I I yeah again
she's just a performer like Trisha
Paytas is a hot mess like who
doesn't watch her um but yeah I forgot
what I was saying I'm sorry I'm sorry
uh yeah Trisha Paytas a lot of people do
that they call their subscribers
something like my little my little
diamonds my little flower is my little
huffy puffy I don't know I just
feel like that's so stupid like I'm
gonna talk to you I'm gonna say your
names like I'm not gonna be like oh hey
hey you come over here okay you know can
you do more get ready with me sure but
those are like my most hated videos no I
really care um but people are just so
richest about it they're like you don't
know what you're doing with your makeup
and I'm like what do you mean a look at
this perfect makeup right now just
kidding not really wearing Annie um I've
unsubscribed sometimes I can't relate to
her are you talking about talking she's
very prim and proper and I'm like that
when I'm working but when I'm not I'm
just a normal girl you know and I feel
like she is that kind of girl that I
don't know like it's almost like she
would go to sleep with like a full face
of makeup on you know what I mean like
she's just she seems a little
high-maintenance and I don't mean that
in a bad
everyone's gonna think I'm throwing
shade but I think that she's just really
like a perfectionist I'm not I'm like
I'll you know mm-hmm
all right let's see here I know I'm
choking John cookin
oh yeah he's being exposed right now I
never liked him I never liked him I
thought he was always very twisty and
kind of dark and weird like I like the
drama channels where they're just kind
of having a fun time because that's what
I'm there to watch you know I'm not
there to watch some sort of
investigation three-part series on a
youtuber like what now I'll go watch the
news for that you know um can you do a
Nevada makeup review mmm sorry I feel
like I'm gonna burp evade a makeup
review do they have makeup oh my god

do when you don't make a youtube video
I'm sorry literally just burped um what
do I do I practice my flute a lot I like
watching TV I like playing with mr.
badger um I just I just like hanging out
I just like hanging out who is your
favorite youtuber definitely Stephanie
Nicole for sure Tatia tried it to sweep
his racism under the rug what did she
say did she talk about that because yeah
I'm very I'm very curious Jan beauty 89
so many of you recommended I check her
out cuz I guess she's a teacher like me
too
um do you like reddit I actually read
some of the reddit forums about me
because you guys send them to me and
sorry I'm such a dry mouth right now um
I was practicing a lot my lips like
 falling off uh yeah I like
reddit like I feel like the people who
write in the forums like they're very
smart and like they everything's so
beautifully written it's not like some
trashy
you know like guru gossip forever people
are just like I hate this gun you
know they're like no let's go ahead and
talk about things you know talk about
what they can work on sorry I just said
the C words I try not say that yeah I
try not to say that on here that is my
favorite swear word though hmm
coffee break with Danny to hyper for me
again love her but too much for me
do you watch Beauty news there are two
girls from Melbourne I think I showed
one of my photos in a video once and I
went over and yeah they have like longer
videos I'm more of like the like five
minute to ten minute kind of girl as far
as that is concerned
but we ever meet Tom let me go grab on
I'm just kidding I wish you guys I wish
I'm like all the time I'm like you want
to come on camera like you want to say
something you want to say hi to the snap
famine he's just like no so not anytime
in the future
love coffee break with Jenny she's so
fun and so cute I just she makes me feel
like I'm gonna explode and crawl
up the wall you know what I mean
I can tell she's got a little bit of
that bubbly kind of thing going on - a
little bit HD maybe possibly like me so
you just said my favorite cuss word I
know it's so bad the C word is my
favorite cuss word and I never say it
like on here or snapchat because I know
that that one's a little more you know
have you decided on the soloist versus
teaching I'm going with the teaching um
because the people that offered the solo
position are actually going to offer it
the year after so that's awesome
they want to sign me into a two-year
deal and I would be signed it with Sony
labels you guys Sony records yes yes you
can literally get a CD of me playing how
cool all right oh yeah I'd love to see a
video about the brand pretty a vulgar
like I said I have some stuff coming in
what's the C word I feel like I always
been calling my friends kunti's like
it's the worst thing ever it's a very
bad habit literally getting red in the
face talking about because I know I
should be ashamed but yeah are you going
to do more declutter I think I have one
going up in like two days
sorry Nancy best self tanner for pale
skin the one I have on right now I have
three layers on can you guys tell yes
I'm not blending into the wall it is the
Jergens mousse and I won't be
repurchasing because obviously they test
on animals or movies not owners I don't
know and I've just put that on all over
and it gives me really nice like a
yellow look to my skin so I like that a
lot
kunti's I know it's so bad I know I know
my husband watched you play flute and
said you were amazing well thank you
it's so sweet
I love that word - I know like I said my
favorite my favorite uh Wow Congrats
thank you thank you
let's see here opinion on jeans Charles
yeah you know I feel like he's a kid
he's the child like I made
mistakes too when I was that age but
again like going back to the jeffree
star thing he was like not like 16 years
old you know I mean I do personally
believe that yes when you're
like younger and when you really really
don't know any better you can say stuff
that you don't mean but at least it got
his ass on there well who's that okay at
least he got his ass on there and he
apologized or for sure like couldn't
even do that you know like really like
going why can't you make a youtube video
and I'm gonna address that but you're
fine with addressing when Kat Von D
drags you which she dragged you
see you next Tuesday you can say it like
that how old are you I'm 20 for maybe 25
on August 1st I'm as pale as you are if
not more pale cap on date luck at
foundation too heavy and cakey for me
nowadays I just I'm starting to dry out
what can I say I used to wear it all the
time when I was in high school and
college but yeah not anymore it's just
too too cakey on me let's see here I've
never used that word Lisbon oh my good I
know I know it's the worst Road ever I
know I know uh we're the same age oh
very cool
Leo baby hell yeah Molly oh he'll yeah
all right let's see here um August has
nice very cool August 3rd yes Erika two
days after me leo
yes yes you guys my brother is 4 years
old it for yourself and he's four years
older Alexander he was born a day before
me I was almost born on his birthday can
you believe that four years apart I was
like mom did you plan that August
3rd a Leo Hallie yeah
Leo kathleenlights you know what guys
I'm just gonna say it and of course
people are gonna think I'm hating on
these people I'm really not you guys are
just asking who I watch and I'm being
honest I think she's so pretty
looking when I look at her I'm like holy
 such beautiful features and the way
she does her makeup I really really like
but she's a little too nice for me I
just feel like sometimes when I'm
watching her videos like her product
fails videos it's always like you know
circling back to you well it didn't work
for me you know it might work for you
which like again that's fine I always
put that disclaimer at the beginning of
my video but I like to get into that
video and I want someone to tell me you
know hey does it stuck or not you know
not beat around the bush for 25 minutes
so I think that's just her personality
she's very very sweet and sensitive and
actually Rachelle and I were talking
about this Rachelle and Rachelle her
personality is actually a lot like
Kathleen so
I understand being the more sweet and
sensitive not me I'm not sweet
and sensitive but you know Rochelle is
my best friend you know I you know we're
we're best friends and I a I don't know
I don't know what to say guys what I'm
trying to say is I can relate to
Kathleen because like I see Rochelle um
and it's just I don't know it's one of
those things like I just I I can't do
too much of that I don't know I can't do
too much of that on YouTube you guys I
can't um I'm sure
Rochelle's probably like what the
no Rochelle is my best friend she keeps
me really nice and calm and steady but I
do like people that are fiery and I like
honesty I like honesty and not to say
that Kathleen is not honest I just I
like stuff quickly
I'm a quick-moving person everything's
fast and you know the faster I can get
things done the better so if I'm
watching a video and someone's beating
around the bush I'm just like okay just
tell me already do you like it or not so
that was what I was trying to say Bella
Fiore hell yeah girl love that last
video she did she is cruelty free so
awesome I really like her Stephanie Lang
is wonderful I know I know she's
teaching me how to blend my eyeshadow
you guys everyone's always like you
don't know hunt blend your eyeshadow and
this is the thing I I like the way it
looks so like why is it concern you if I
like it and I'm like for it to look like
it's not blended then before you to say
something you know and I know people are
saying oh well you're a a beauty guru
 now I'm not to be a girl camera
review Channel that is what I started
with and that is what I like to do I
will never do like tutorials and tell
you guys what to do and how to do it
like when I do get ready with me zits
you know I'll show you how to how I put
it on but I'm not trying to tell you do
this because I'm not I'm not talented
enough for that they are too nice Oh mmm
Kathleen she's so sweet
no and I don't mean to say like I said
like her personality is like Rochelle is
actually a lot and Rochelle is probably
watching right now like you bitch stop
talking about me but like I I just I
don't know I don't know I don't know I
just I like when people just tell me how
it is you know just get to the point
tell me what I need to know I like that
so advice to someone wanting to start a
channel just be yourself and do what you
can do like don't try and go like crazy
and try and post stuff that you think
people want to see just post
you want to post do your own thing and
people will notice that's always what
I've done with my channel and I know I
get a lot of criticism for that like not
editing and you know all this kind of
stuff but that's what makes me different
on YouTube and I think being different
is cool
she and I like that you're a real person
and do your makeup like an everyday
human it's really refreshing thank you I
think that we forget nowadays that we're
all humans you know what I mean
sometimes I feel like I'm watching
robots or like take the shade into the
crease and then it's like perfectly
blended because they fast-forward the
editing and I'm like wait a minute
how long did you have to blend that
eyeshadow I need to know okay
makeup is art I personally love to see
what others consider beautiful and yeah
for me what you know beautiful is how
are the I want to do my makeup
you know I changes all the time I do
different makeup looks a lot just
because I liked you but yeah yeah just
do what makes you comfortable you know
what I mean don't let other people tell
you oh I don't like those clumpy lashes
on you people tell me that all the time
but I always say I know like I'm gonna
keep doing them I like the clumpy lashes
okay I like a little spider like laughes
all right let's see here I don't know
how to do a makeup either I love I
shadow and if I want to wear pink and
dark green which I wouldn't I will that
is why pink and dark green yes girl I
love that that is why I love your
channel because you are keeping it real
a pink and dark green you should have a
channel I feel like all these tutorials
channels nowadays is the same thing over
and over pink and green like this girl
that is that is smart I've never thought
of that
keep on slaying sister thank you um are
you still let me see hi Delinda still
living in Milwaukee yes we're still in
Milwaukee and then we are gonna be
moving to Arizona soon do you self-tan
your face I do I do and you can tell
right now because like I'm so pink right
now so shirt this shirt is making me
look pink um but yeah yeah I put it on
my face I know a lot of people don't and
then they put on their foundation to
match but I just feel like if it's there
and it doesn't make me break out I might
as well put it on oh sorry I'm ferping
gross you might have said this already
but do you not do any sponsorships to do
companies send you PR packages um yeah I
hope you are for a few brands I already
know that like
not going to be that kind of channel
that is going to get a huge amounts of
PR because I say it like it is and yeah
usually brands aren't like as open to
that and I don't write two brands anyway
I just don't care enough to go searching
for them but recently I had Nick's write
to me BH Cosmetics you know like brands
want to work with me which is great but
right now I'm just not interested in the
sponsorship kind of thing I just don't
need it financially and I don't mean for
that to sound cocky I just don't need it
and I don't want to read a script to you
guys I'm sure I could do it if I needed
to but I don't I don't want it to be
like that so do you still have the long
hair I do but like myself is all
up but lupus has brooms here and my
scalp is horrible I hate when beauty
gurus who let me scroll up sorry cheat
on challenges like not using products as
intended or seen a full face what is up
with all those challenge videos like
some of them were fun and then others it
was like this is stupid like
people were like a putting makeup on
with knives I was like okay I unlit
early would kill myself if I did that
like literally I would hurt myself I
would injure myself I do not know how
people were doing that I know people
thought that was funny but I was
actually scared okay alright let's see
here um X Shh isn't that the
girl look like the Eevee blender thing I
don't watch her but I did watch her
video because I was watching you drama
channel they send me over there um
Nicole is one of my faves what other
YouTube channel interests you besides
beauty oh well I do follow a lot of
music channels um and yeah I like
vlogging channels - I like PewDiePie I
like some gaming channels I like a whole
lot of different stuff because I like to
do different things I like to watch
different stuff so yeah um mmm
Kelly's track she's that really

eye actually listen to books it's gonna
sound like it's sponsored audible.com no
I actually use audible and I pay for it
and I do not use anybody's affiliate
code I like to listen I am an auditory
kind of person so yeah uh why do you
think I people are oh you tube pain last
will go away let me scroll up sorry when
I had to quickly why do you think
YouTube is paying people less is because
of the ad pocalypse so basically there
was something that happened there was
some sort of extremist video and an ad
was playing on it and yeah YouTube let
that slide and people said peace out
YouTube because like who the would
want to be associated with that so yeah
the revenue has definitely gone it down
but I mean if you do it for fun if you
do it for javi doesn't matter aside from
ferrets what other types of animals do
you like every single animal I had
snakes growing up I had rats growing up
I had everything absolutely love all
animals I wanted to be a vet when I was
a child so many French ads that's cool I
never see any French ads it's
always like do you want this big juicy
burger and it's like 11 o'clock at night
I'm like yeah kinda like that that is
that those are all ads I get um YouTube
is shady I mean they're not shady they
pay really well when they're
doing well they pay really well I know
everybody's I have to quit my YouTube
support me on patreon I just hmm I just
can't I can't get behind that like I
understand but why is it so hard
for you to get like a real job like the
rest of us and yes I'm a youtuber and I
just say get a real job because
I still believe like if you're gonna do
YouTube and you want to consider it a
full-time job I want to see you posting
frequently not once a week just so that
you can like you know I don't know make
ends meet I mean I want to see I want to
see people you know posting more I want
to see people actually take it seriously
like a real job because I feel like I
have a real job and YouTube is
easy compared to a so favorite
perfume I really love the Charlotte
Tilbury scent of a dream right now

haters I know sometimes I rant a little
bit but overall I'm good with them we're
we're fine we're fine we're on speaking
terms no we're not on speaking terms
it's just one of those things where like
you get blocked if you're being a real
piece of sheet that you're gonna get
blocked if you just want to troll me
well prepare me totally think that is
all I have to say all right what do you
think of a color pop and makeup geek

declutter all of those items like I said

peak though but the foiled shadow is not
the normal like original formula that
everybody's obsessed with I don't like
that formula all right do you mind

French live what do you do to stay so

self-conscious about their body but damn
I really like I need to tone up let's
see here a new channel Oh color Popish
 I don't know color prompters
doesn't get me excited oh my god I'm
sorry I was just reading a comment that
I went ah yeah yeah safe outfit like I I
really don't I really don't do anything
special ie begin a 5 days a week but if
you follow me on snapchat you know I eat
junk food all the time in fact I have
something hot cheetos next to me right
now you honestly look like a baby here
with a fly
not in your PJs this is actually not a
PJ top but um it is very cute uh comfort
food mac and cheese anything with cheese
oh yeah anything with cheese why aren't
you a fan of the Born This Way
Foundation it was too oily for me it was
too oily I felt like it was too
connected to moisturizing and it just
started to like slip and slide off my
face now when we moved to Arizona maybe
I should try it out again because
everybody everybody keeps saying that
I'm going to dry out like a prune when I
get there I'm gonna have dry skin you
guys and you leave it I'm in veterinary
medicine I would love to see the honey
badger I know I'm sorry's in the other
room you guys I don't want to have to
walk all the way through the apartment
cuz Thomas Oh paranoid I really don't
care but he's paranoid about it so I
have to respect that um let's see here
live you should try colour-pop blotted
lipstick they aren't moisturizing ah but
it has to be moisturizing I can't like I
just can't with these like
drying lip products anymore I just can't
like I put them on and they look like
 on my lips because I play flute and
I beat up my lips on a daily basis and
like they just don't sit nice on them
you know I just can't do it I just can't
do it for dry skin yes the Born This Way
Foundation for dry skin absolutely if
you're more um you know combo to oily
it's going to be a little problematic do
you get stalkers like I love you I need
you type of stalkers I get men sometimes
saying stuff like you should pull those
titties out and I'm just like thank you
thank you and we may not be the
classiest channel but we are not like
that okay um yeah sometimes I get creeps
saying stuff like that and then other
times um I've had people say like I know
where you live I've seen you in an
elevator and it's just kind of like you
should just come up and say something
instead of being like I was watching you
in the elevator like okay that's great
I'm just one of those people like if you
see me like come up and say hi you know
what the big deal let's see here
have you tried any beliefs skincare
products yes and actually we have a box
downstairs for Tom I got him like the
whole Hungarian essence the aqua balm he
loves the aqua balm you guys he loves it
and he also loves the mmm I'm gonna keep
choking he also loves the pharmacy sleep
tight
firming whatever gel oil
the NARS lip lights are my favorite Mike
I know right I literally want all of
them all of them they're beautiful
beautiful beautiful are there others
that are similar formulas the maybelline
color elixirs again not cruelty free but
the maybelline color elixirs are very
very similar and then also the Revlon HD
matte lip colors are not truly matte
again very very creamy nice consistency
on the lips do you have a favorite dry
shampoo honestly my hair looks like
right now all the time so I don't really
have like a favorite but I haven't used
it was it the sake bomb or whatever from
dry bar it makes me look like I have
gray hair but like I don't really care
if I look like I have gray hair I just
want my hair to look decent at this
point so I like it because it just sucks
up all the oil like I could spray it on
my face right now and I'm just go push
all the oil alright let's see here what
a non cruelty free product will you miss
most when you run out the why I sell
beloved teams in oils but it's just not
worth it it is just not worth it there
are too many beautiful animals out there
alright let's see here it's nice that
you respite ooh snaps I try my best
um favorite makeup gal he's constantly
like is that Liv oh that's so sweet
thank you um let's see here how did you
and Tom meet Tom and I met on eHarmony
he gets really embarrassed like when we
say that because tom is 32 going on 33
so I guess like back in the day like you
didn't say if you met someone online but
like our generation I'm like yeah I met
him online it's like weird if you meet
elsewhere you know what I mean so yeah
we bet aren't at you harmony of it we
met on eHarmony so let him let's see
here o'clock at the house rich legs I
love you yes yes alright let's see here
have you found a cruelty-free dupe for
the Peter Thomas Roth peel pad the first
a beauty it's kind of similar they have
like these like little fixed cleansing
pads kind of similar but now I've not
found like a true dupe um mmm
any products to help cure your hair not
my hair but like my scalp it's just a
 mess like I just can't I just
can't like it there's literally nothing
I can do anymore with it I'm just like
okay listen like my hair is gross like
that's the way it is so yeah wedding
plans know Tom and I are not ready to
get married
lot of things I want to do with my life
first and he's just gonna have to wait
because I never want to be in a
relationship and then 10 years down the
road I blame him because I didn't go
after what I wanted you know and I
married him too early I want to have my
career path all set out and done so that
I feel like I achieved something at
myself because it's very important
obviously to feel good about yourself
before you look at it from like a
relationships kind of point of view so
he's gonna have to wait for that and
let's see here and he's fine with that
let's see here how long did you and Tom
date before you started living together
one year he moved to Milwaukee a year
earlier and I was still in a Manhattan
finishing up my degree he was like you
want to move out here and I was like
what kind of woman do you think I am I
am NOT going to be stopping school to
come live with you please so I came um I
came back and lived with him a year
later but yeah definitely don't ever if
a man asks you to go and like stop doing
school or something that you're enjoying
it just don't even do that I always you
know it's important to take care of
yourself first let's see here ma is not
cruelty free estee lauder oh yeah I know
I stay louder geez you are wise beyond
your years
oh you're way too sweet good to see a
girl who knows what she wants hell yeah
I know what I want and I um I put myself
ahead of our relationship and that's
gonna sound so selfish but it's like Sex
in the City Samantha she said I love you
but I love me more you know we come into
this world alone we pass away alone you
have to learn to love yourself and be
comfortable so that you're not relying
on other people and Tom and I have a
very good understanding of that in our
relationship that's cruelty free of
primers should this be a hard one ooh
wet and wild cover all cela aqua go
Becca
first light crimen filter I'm enjoying
that a lot and at the first saw the
unicorn essence I'm actually liking that
it's so weird because you know the
people like put it on their face I just
put it on my face normally but it's nice
I actually do like it um you get better
advice than 90% of other youtubers well
thank you knit + fab I'm still looking
into that I did write to them and they
wrote back and I'm a little little
concerned with their response they
didn't just give it to me straight
I don't like I said I'm just a kind of
person like just tell me how but it is
so it's makeup for a forever
cruelty-free they are not the NYX pore
filler is them and you need to check
that out your best makeup setting spray
honestly the wet and wild to the focus I
still haven't purchased it because I
have so many that I'm trying to get
through but it's amazing favorite nail
polish girl mmm look at these crappy
nails I really don't have one
I rarely paint my nails so yeah do you
ever do you reviews on Avon no no um I
don't I I don't yeah I'm not into that
kind of stuff I feel like some of that
is a little bit of like a a pyramid
scheme Ponzi scheme sort of thing and
I'm not saying that like the people that
are doing it and selling it I think they
don't know any better but I just feel
bad for the people that are left like in
debt you know from buying all the stuff
and then they can't sell it the China
Glaze is a good polish what kind of skin
do you have an foundation recommendation
I have combination skin and I get dry on
my cheeks and then oily as you can see
in my t-zone I would recommend the Josie
Maran vibrancy foundation fluid the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage and
let's see here what else have I been
loving those two are like my topic kind
of foundations Urban Decay primer potion
yeah it's pretty good hey how are you
doing good how are you
try the pixie glow mist um oh okay yeah
I'll have to try that I heard that it's
very similar to the Tasha one and I
hated the Tasha was way too oily for me
favorite cruelty free drugstore
concealer hmm this is the hard one are
there any maybe the wet and wild photo
focused I've even try that one so let me
think about that uh favorite indie
brands still haven't really gotten into
indie brands yet like you guys I'm such
a baby when it comes to cruelty free so
please go ahead and give me some
recommendations oh I'm sorry am i moving
a laptop what coverage is the Josie
Maran vibrancy so I would say it's a
solid medium coverage but you can build
it up to full what the conservatory did
you go - I went to Manus and then I did
go to Julliard for pre college as well
as Manhattan School of Music
alright will you do Oh will you miss
dior when you're full cruelty free um if
the D you are like going
gardens pink illuminator you can
actually get a dupe for that at the
bookstore the NYX eyeshadow single in
the shade oh god I don't know sex kitten
or something like that um I mentioned in
the video the other day
it's one of their prismatic highlighters
so now I won't miss it uh at what age
did you get diagnosed with lupus and my
lupus okay I suffered for many years
before being diagnosed at home yeah so I
got diagnosed around 1819 I'm actually
kind of when I had first moved out to
Manhattan I moved to Manhattan by myself
when I was seventeen so thoughts on the
professional it's just okay nothing that
special so many products similar to that
you know at the drugstore now um what's
the greatest soap cuz I need soap I
don't know I literally don't use like
regular body so I just use body washes
so do you like makeup geek you I like
makeup geek I mean I'm not obsessed with
making people I like it can you message
me sometime about your SLE I'm currently
getting a workup for ya please go ahead
you can send me a snap or you can write
to me on Instagram I'm really not the
greatest at getting back right away but
I am trying my best any pharmacy brand
for rose water mmm
promisee brand I was gonna say like
Mario Badescu but they are not to the
pharmacy I don't know I don't know let's
see here have you tried the carroty
eyeshadows they look very pigmented and
never even heard of them dr. Bronner's
soap is excellent I want to start using
that to actually wash my makeup brushes
wet in well unicorn collection nope not
doing it I just can't I just can't I
just can't do it
ah tart and you know I prove all brands
I'm sorry you said wet and wild when
well I am doing the unicorn collection
what I was going to say was torn into
face right now I just can't with their
unicorn stuff and arguing and all that
stuff not doing them but yes but and
wild for sure alright uh Hoss hair
products they are cruelty free never
tried them my hair is a mess right now
so yeah sorry I'm not the right person
to ask like for hair recommendations
because it's just it's really bad it's
really bad you should ask Michelle
though because we she'll has amazing
amazing hair alright let's see here oh I
know the lighting keeps going in and out
I can see that too it's just cuz I'm
sitting on my bed
all right I got distracted making mac
and cheese mac and cheese girl what hair
shampoo brand do you recommend I like
OGX but currently I'm using a
prescription-strength one like I said
I'm just not the right person for hair
recommendations have you tried the hydro
primer from NYX I haven't sounds good
though oh I need to move my legs you
guys in gang aunty I have not tried it
so I will have to look into that which
cruelty free makeup brand has the best
overall appeal to you wet and well when
well for sure ah botanical rose water a
needy nice boots very good to know
thoughts on anastacio makeup I mean I
think it's good I want to get those new
blush trios I wish that they would
release more stuff you know but their
glow kids are fantastic Church
is no longer my favorite brand I know I
know to face was like way up there
another like with a down there
let's see here do you have a
cruelty-free do for the CFL moisturizing
lotion in the big tub I currently don't
that is something I use when I am in
lupus flare ups and it's like this huge
big tub so I have a bunch left but I do
not have a dupe I'm sorry um let's see
here and you can still live your life
and do what you want when you're married
as long as you marry the right person oh
I know I understand that and I'm you
know there's nothing against people who
do marry at a young age it's just not
for me and I think that it's important
like I said it to you I always put
yourself first and I know some people
won't agree with that but Tom and I we
put ourselves first before our
relationship because it's very very
important you have to be you know having
good terms with yourself if you're going
to be comfortable in this world and
happy like if you want a good
relationship you have to be comfortable
with yourself so it's just not for us um
right away and that is totally fine
he'll be more around 40 me around 30 and
we're totally fine with that let's see
here sing for us I can't sing I'm not a
good singer I'm not I'm not alright I I
think it's not right for everyone what
do you mean mmm Sabrina
who's Sabrina is she the redhead
she's beautiful skin yes yes yes
have you played in a symphony orchestra
or do you prefer quintet and such I do
also
of different things but yes I have
played with some orchestras and I love
orchestral music like I said
Shostakovich yes yes yes
love that um but you know overall I
would say I just I would like to do the
soloistic um kind of thing in the future
I really like being on stage by myself
Leo over here um but yeah I mean I love
playing in groups as well to be a good
musician you have to be able to work
well with others so yes what do you
think of the whole abh subculture
palette being late what I didn't see
this hour what are you talking about
Alessandra has been subscribed to me
forever and I think she knows more about
this makeup stuff than I do I didn't
even know something was oh you sang
something and it was really good you're
way too sweet oh my gosh um let's see
here
yeah I had to take uh you know classes
in college to learn how to do a little
bit of voice stuff I am NOT trained by
any means
my boyfriend and I want to wait to get
married - um yeah yeah I mean if you
enjoy being boyfriend and girlfriend
like marriage is like what's that going
to do is just a ring on the finger you
know um I think that you shouldn't have
to have a ring to be able to show the
person that you love them and you know
you do it whenever you feel comfortable
so yeah uh it was trend mood well yeah
trend Lu does leak stuff a lot yeah yeah
uh what do you think about Fatali uppity
Leah how do you say her name she's very
calm and I really really like that but
I'm not subscribed yet I don't know why
I don't know what it is but there's just
something about it maybe she's just a
little too monotone for me um but
overall like I love like her foundation
reviews excellent excellent excellent
all right let's see here where do you
find these makeup leaks yeah I'm curious
- let me see here Oh with eight o'clock
feel like I've County goes on here for a
while um when did you and Tom move in
together um we moved in together I think
a year after dating a year and a half
almost two years was it two years I
can't remember like I said I stayed in

him here which was a big thing for me to
leave New York and come here
