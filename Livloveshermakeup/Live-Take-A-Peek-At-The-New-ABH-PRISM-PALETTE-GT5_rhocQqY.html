fortunately they don't give you like an
option to go and just look at the chat
you have to watch yourself on mute the
whole time hello I love you do hello hi
what you doing okay so guys first of all
I just ran up the steps so if I'm out of
breath you know why it's very hard being
an adult okay
but basically I went and filmed my whole
entire review on the prism palette and I
lost the footage and when I say I lost
the footage I mean I pulled the SD card
out way too quickly and I corrupt it so
I thought I would just come on here
someone said I can't see you I think
your haircut is gonna look great I
always loved your big date yeah yeah
this is my shorter layer so it's gonna
be kind of kinda around there but yeah
I'm excited
okay wait wait wait wait wait it's going
too fast here let me see I feel so bad
I'm so ADHD I start like talking to
someone and then I just yeah blue tongue
I was just eating candy yes I can't see
you if you can't see close it and reopen
oh you can see me okay greetings from
Brazil hello hello everyone well I can't
believe how out of breath I am from but
I got those goddamn snaps seriously why
is life so hard
alright someone said what oh you can't
see me either what is happy okay okay
alright so what
I do this time because a lot of people
were telling me last time I was doing it
wrong because you know everybody has an
opinion just like me so I'm gonna go
ahead and kind of like swirl back if I
see a question or something that kind of
interests me but I thought we could kind
of talk a little bit about this why do I
see a pop up of me again can you go away
girl like who are you who is this girl I
literally like I don't understand why I
can't just see the chat but I have to
watch myself back on you it's very very
distracting okay I can see you perfectly
hello guys pizza and live oh my god that
sounds so good right now I'm having a
naked smoothie
it tastes like health and then I'm
having a Perrier and also all toys
because I always have to have something
you guys know what I mean and some
flutist I feel like I always have dry
mouth let's see here hello from Bolivia
hello whoo Texas ooh that palate yes
okay so here's the palette you guys so I
thought we could talk about it a little
bit I mean I don't want to likes to wash
it out and everything because this is
really bad I mean I'm on my desktop
please tell me I don't need it I don't
think you need it I don't think you need
it if you have these subculture and you
like the subculture you don't need this
because I feel like they're actually
very very similar so here is the
subculture I did it still smoothie on it
so it's looking extra luscious all right
can you guys see this so here's the
subculture I feel so stupid doing this
this is a horrible horrible lighting but
were you doing anyway Kay bitch we're
gonna do it anyway here is the prison
palette do you guys see this dent I've
already made on this like opalescent
white kind of do a chromatic shape this
is literally almost a cream do you guys
see that these duochrome seen here are
crazy
I don't like cream stuff I was like nah
no thank you
is it working for anyone oh no is it not
working for a ton of people did I do
something wrong to you guys I probably
 up I'm so sorry um let's see here
oh is Sam here hi Sam
is it working for anyone okay there's a
bunch of people that can't see me this
is very depressing I probably my fault
okay hello from Utah well hello to you
would you like it better the prison or
saint or sinner seed and sinner well
funny you asked because I brought this
out because I was like I know people are
going to ask about this so I love the
st. in center
I just I really love the colors in here
okay now I actually have to click on the
window so I can see myself so I'm in
frame
so here's st. in center and then here is
the can I do this yes girl you
could do it you can do it here is the
prism do you guys see like there's a lot
of shades going on here that are similar
okay yeah especially like that bright
green shade like sphere and this one
which is called Exodus love that I love
that matte green color all over my lid
it looks like when I apply it but
like I'm living for it okay there's a
lot more shimmers in here and these
shimmers are super super soft kind of
like these subculture so if you are not
a fan of electric and like adorned and
those kind of shades in the subculture
so you guys you're probably not going to
like the majority of the like metallics
in here they have a lot of metallics to
do Oh Chrome's I do have to mention all
over my lid right now I feel like it's
kind of working up into my crease which
I'm not a huge fan of but I do have a
really nice kind of sticky tacky primer
on so I don't know why that's happening
but they do crease a little bit as well
but the Matteson here are beautiful
these like orange shades Eden and Saturn
I'm not usually somebody who loves like
warm tone kind of eyeshadows but they
are beautiful they're very very similar
but they go together really really
nicely so I'm liking this I mean do I
like this more than like my modern
renaissance now no I don't so I like it
more than the subculture I feel like I
like them the same because they're
actually really really similar but
here's the modern Renaissance for
reference and let me hold up the can I
do this like I needed a helper like
where's Bajor where's the answer when I
need them so here's the modern
renaissance here's the good stuff in my
teeth this is the saint and sinner kind
of similar to a few like warm tones
there but overall you guys I just really
love this palette I really really like
this I know some of you were saying that
you do not like it
okay sorry let me look at the chat are
you going to get the Fenty a beauty
palette so the Fendi Beauty palette I
feel like it looks like a kind of child
makeup like in the strange way like I
want that like I want that child makeup
it's like all bright colors there's no
mats or anything in there right that
particular palette looks a little it
looks a little weird I want the prism
though I don't have subculture either I
do have the Saint in center I feel like
if you have the Saint and sinner you
don't need the prism because the eye
looks that you're going to get
especially
you're like not very talented it I
shadow like me if you're an everyday
kind of girl they're gonna look the same
okay they're gonna look the same if
you're amazing at makeup and you're like
a makeup artist I'm sure you can get
like tons of different looks but for me
there's they look the same
those two pallets on the ice I will be
keeping both of them because I love
toward makeup what can I say but yeah
can we see Badger and Khaleesi so you
guys I didn't say anything on snapchat
yet cuz I didn't want to worry anybody
but they are now feeling good they are
not feeling good they actually have like
an upper-respiratory thing going on so
I'm not even supposed to like be in that
room with them so I'm not gonna go in
there I don't want to bother them I'm
supposed to let them like sleep 20 hours
and basically sleep this off the back to
give me medication for them but I'm
freaking out because they're like my
little children like I burst those
little ferrets okay I mean I did
anything you know all right let's see
here finally I can see your beautiful
face net well thank you I want prison so
bad I wish the formula was like the
Mario palette guys I never got the Mario
palette and like beach why didn't I get
it
how is there no mat um like even
two-face had at least two mats in there
freaking oh do you mean for the for the
prism there's a few maps in here but
yeah the majority of them are shimmers I
think they did that because the modern
renaissance is filled with mattes and so
was the subculture so you can kind of
cure them together and this goes really
nicely Wow sunlight here this goes
really really nicely with the subculture
can add the two together but uh I don't
feel like everybody's gonna love these
like - Oh crumbs in here like I said
this one do you guys see that that was
one use going in and putting it on the
inner corner of my eye and it was like
freaking hole in there okay I mean I
love honest Accio shadows okay they're
soft they're buttery I don't really have
an issue when it comes to subculture but
yeah did you get any new Farris yes I
have Khaleesi now and she's adorable but
they're both sick it makes me so sad
okay let me scroll up here so I could be
a good girl and read some of his stuff
I'm not a big fan of larger all shimmer
palette
I love the desi xkt shimmer palette I
ended up not getting that because my
order was like all something I don't I
don't know what happened basically they
just gave me my money back and I decided
okay I'm not gonna get it but then I saw
people kind of like working with them
and they seemed a little difficult
the sunlight here there we go they
seemed a little difficult like you have
to pack them on with your finger I mean
I pack stuff on with my finger but like
time-consuming no girl that does not
meet when it comes to makeup how do you
feel about the inconsistency in
Anastacio shadows so I personally don't
think the subculture was that bad
people were just really really angry and
everybody wanted to make a big fuss
about it it was a marketing fail okay
the way that they marketed it because
they said it's the sister palette to the
modern Renaissance a physicist or
palette it better be the same goddamn
formula and it wasn't and that's why
people got pissed off but I don't think
the subculture is that it's incredibly
pigmented like the most pigmented
palette I actually have in my collection
and I mean I don't see a ton of horrible
things about it to be completely honest
I'm just very careful when I go in there
big hugs from Mexico hello all right let
me scroll up a little more can you
swatch comparisons of saint and sinner
in prison okay I got really dry hands
right now but let's go ahead and take a
look all right so cap on these things
and sinner let's take ah all right well
first I guess people do the there's so
much snow over mom so much makeup all
right I think we will do like those warm
tone shades first okay why is that video
popped up again of me like why you don't
keep sending myself oh wait why don't we
take a devil as well as Sacred Heart no
we'll just take the shade of devil from
the saint and sinner palette look at
this a beam of light right now happening
like why you gotta be like this I have
you guys balancing on a trash can
because I love you so much
yeah I have it literally on a trash can
right now because it's like the perfect
height right yeah
alright what was I doing oh yes okay so
devil the shaded devil there it is this
is a beautiful but can you not like
Jesus okay devil beautiful beautiful
matte orange e color okay really really
beautiful go ahead and swatch that look
at that pigmentation yes yes yes yes now
let's go ahead and jump into the prison
palette and we will take to Saturn so
there's Saturn and we'll also go ahead
and swatch this guy which is called Eden
these are so much softer you know like
half on these shadows are really pressed
a little more firmly so there is what's
your name oh yeah Saturn and there's
Eden I feel like Saturn is pretty much
like the same shade as the Kat Von D but
little more muted and then this one Eden
is just beautiful I like to use this as
a transition because there's not really
any good I don't have anything to wipe
my hands on I just put on my pants
classy classy girl um what was I saying
God you guys tell me help me help me see
this is why I literally do like 10
minute videos because I get so
distracted clay play is amazing I love
the dark I look on you thank you I
started putting this darker shade right
here called thrown on my lower lashline
today seriously this shape right here
called thrown on my lower lashline and
it just got a little like raccoon evil I
was doing it I was feeling those raccoon
vibes ah let's see
serpentina is still on sale it is
interesting my serpentina palette I'm
gonna go how to declutter that one
because of sorry trashcan um I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter that one because
I feel like the formula started to go
really really bad like they stink they
reek they don't go on the same as they
used to and that was like a really
really good clear representation that
your makeup has gone bad when it smells
bad when it doesn't
please excuse mine maybe yours now but
when it smells bad when it does in to go
on as beautifully as it used to I mean
they go in so chunky the metal crush
formula is not chunky so I was really I
was really sad about that because I feel
like I have palettes that literally have
been in my collection for years and I
know eyeshadow palettes technically have
a shelf life but like no no no I mean
who's gonna go through a whole movie
modern Renaissance or maybe subculture
because they hit pan so quickly but
who's gonna go through a whole damn eye
shadow palette in like 12 months it's
just it's not realistic especially if
you like to hoard that looks like I do
alright your eye look is so beautiful
thank you will you buy the Laura Lee
palette no no I will not that looks so
basic and incredibly boring to me I've
never actually watched Laura Lee you
know a lot of people tell me like they
can't stand my talking and how I sound
and that's totally fine like everybody
has their own preference I'm so sorry
about this over here uh my preference is
that I just can't I don't really like
the sound of her voice
I'm very auditory person and I don't
mean that in a mean way I don't know
she's a good person or not I know
nothing about her she does very pretty
makeup she's very very pretty girl but I
just
listen to her and I feel like why would
I force myself to watch videos or you
know anything like that if I just can't
stand her voice I know I know it sounds
bad and that's why I let people say
whatever they want about like my voice
now because I get it I totally get it I
get it
I'm a collector I've never hit pan on
anything I know right I mean I hit pan
on powders because I really powder up my
face at but besides that like an
eyeshadow palette I've never panned like
a whole eyeshadow palette
well maybe Too Faced no alright okay I
don't have some culture so would you
recommend subculture or prism it's so
hard you guys because I feel like
they're similar but at the same time
they're not this guy is definitely a
little more firmly pressed you have the
same amount of pigmentation maybe just a
little a little bit less than these
subculture definitely not as powdery you
don't get as much kick up so if that's
something that really bothers you then
that's not gonna happen with this guy
but you don't get as many maps in here
and I think what was problematic with
the subculture was the map so it's
really just down to okay they're the
same sort of colors I can even you
swatch them out and I will do that in
the review video I'm filled the
whole thing today like that Gaiman last
that footage but when you swatch them
next to each other they look so similar
and it's like they're meant to be
together
but I know she started working on this
before subculture but anyway if you want
more shimmers go with the prism if you
want more mattes go with the subculture
that's that's what I'm gonna say because
I feel like if you get them on the eyes
they're gonna look somewhat similar at
least for me I have 50 palettes
my chocolate bar kit pan oh because you
dropped it yes yes I get it I get it
alright a prison better range of colors
yeah I mean it's all about like do you
can you work dual crows and like shimmer
shades into your crease are you talented
like that because I am NOT I watched
some of these people and they can
actually do that like take a duochrome
and work that into their crease I can't
do that for I can only put it on my
lid and look it already goes up into my
crease without me asking yet okay
so a lot of the shades you're like I
have to use one of the five mattes in
here for every single eye look and I
don't feel like there's a ton of eye
looks I can get with this a lot of them
just turn out dark and smoky but that
could just be because of my skill level
which is quite low all right let's see
here
it is pretty refreshing though that this
is not a warm neutral palette that's the
thing about the lordly palette I got off
topic again I was talking about Laura
Lee if that palette just looks way too
basic I love that it's cruelty free and
made in the US but I just have so so
much stuff like that in my collection so
I'm passing on that I also okay I'm just
gonna say it I don't really like who she
associates herself with associates
associate herself with I'm not a fan of
that little clique or that little group
nothing against her it's just all them
together I don't know I don't like it
hi shivers in my crease look like
on me yeah they look like on me -
okay I can't even do it
I was watching nikkietutorials and she
took like a pressed pigment and she
worked it into the crease and I was like
why like how Laura is basic that's why
it's basic okay
I don't know she's actually basic but I
don't know Irene who are your favorite
tutorial channels I'm doing a whole
video about that you guys a whole video
so that is coming very soon and then I
also want to do a video about youtubers
I look up to I don't know if samantha is
still on here but she is one of them all
right let's see here what's your
thoughts on me um oh God
oh sorry no it's called too fast
okay
wait wait I found it yeah I found it um
what's your thoughts on the Becca winter
highlight palette I got it I got it
and it got in the mail I got here
yesterday i swatched it out on snapchat
probably should have brought it out here
I don't have it here with me right now
it's it's nice I feel like some of them
are a little more chalky kind of like
the typical Becca holiday palace that
you come out so they're not identical to
the full-size shimmering skin perfecter
press formula and I know that because I
collect them I have a lot of them but
the majority of them aren't nice and
creamy and soft and the packaging is
good lord it's so beautiful okay the
packaging is I would buy it for the
packaging I know that's a horrible thing
to say that it's fine true
do you watch Tati I used to watch
talking she's super super calm unlike me
I love calling people I can't watch
people like me I'm just like I can
simply shoot this person no yeah okay
but I feel like she got a little more um
you know I feel like she kind of has
she's catering to a younger audience
right now and I feel like her content
has gotten a little
or like advertiser friendly which of
course a lot of youtubers are dealing
with D monetization on their videos like
every video for me I get it
I I can understand why you would want to
make family-friendly content but I
preferred her when she was just very
very relaxed you know sitting on the
floor doing her what was it called
makeup graveyard d clutters it was just
so fun but now I feel like it's so
professional like her quality on her
camera is like insane like I don't even
I don't understand why I just don't
understand it's too much it's too
overproduced for me personally obviously
I don't have a very high production
value with the effect
there's funds everywhere I don't have a
high production you know value level on
my channel but I also like old-school
YouTube I like watching people like
Emily Noel 83 so this really really like
HD 10k is too much for me
it's too much and I just I feel like I'm
watching television if I'm one of much
television I'll go watch television
so in nothing against her I think she's
so professional she's super calm this
little beam of light right here is
pissing me off okay okay let's go like
peace alright super professional very
good at reviewing things um but yeah I
just feel like she's catering to a
different sort of audience right now
young girl and I'm not really in that
category since I don't know I'm 25 now
and I'm not really 18 years old anymore
what's your thoughts on me Becca winter
highlight palette oh I already read that
okay so let me scroll down I'm doing it
guys I'm going back and forth I love
Emily Noel and Samantha March I love
Samantha March I love Emily how do you
feel about rich loves you know I
love ya I do love him I love drama
channels I know people are always like
how dare you how dare you like drama
channels excuse me there's a reason why
drama channels whoa do you see that Wow
Wow I love too much okay a little too
much lady there you know when you go and
direct sunlight you're like oh my god my
foundation so nice and then you're like
uh-huh psych cakey that's that's
what's happening right now anyway what
was I saying
oh yeah rich luxe I love him I love
watching drama channels because there's
a reason why they get so many views it's
because people are entertained by drama
okay we all like drama and I don't agree
with them like digging into people's
pasts but stuff that's already out there
that they want to talk about
I don't really have an issue with that I
love rich I love him so yeah um Ariel
she does actually Ariel she does
actually would that's drama channel Oh
Peter Mont I know I'd love him to you so
he is so sweet
do you ever watch Samantha Robin Dahl
Ravenel I haven't all I don't know who
that is wait wait I think on Reddit they
talk about is her username like Samantha
or something like that she's amazing at
makeup very very chill and laid-back I
like her she's like a big youtuber like
high production value but she's like
chill and like she'll drop the f-bomb
you know what I'm saying like she's not
all like yay looks like in certain memes
into the video and stuff like that
that's just not really my style
oh Mariah Leonard yes I love her Tia WA
hey Liv I'm such a fan of your channel I
feel like you're one of the very few
youtubers I can trust it would mean so
much to me if you followed my makeup and
skincare Instagram I will definitely
check it out after I get off the
livestream okay the Sun is just actually
like this all right let's see she's
awesome
yes Samantha yes yes I have seen a lot
of stuff written about her on reddit
which I love read and now I know I used
to bash read it and be like everybody
they're so mean but I feel like now I go
on there and if there's a post about me
I take it and it's constructive
criticism and I try and do what my best
there's certain things I can't change
about myself or I just don't want to
change about myself but I like Reddit I
think red him I hate guru gossip my god
some of the all there is ridiculous
but reddit is cool I like it all right I
just started watching Sam I love how
sarcastic yet I know I agree I agree
live how do you feel about the Kathleen
situation I already addressed this I
unsubscribed and I know a lot of people
were saying I live you know you've done
things in your past too that you
shouldn't have and you should forgive
her but I'll say it again I have never I
have done a lot of a lot of bad
shits but I have never ever ever dropped
the n-word ever in my life okay and I
don't care if it's with the a or with
the hard are you don't say it like I'm
getting like emotional here it's just
it's not okay it's not okay and I know
it's not me who gets to feel like I'm
victim because this is it's not me this
is not my race but it's very very
inappropriate and I just I get very
heated about stuff like this
I'm incredibly liberal and all that kind
of stuff you can know this about me so I
yeah that was a no-go for me I what is
she 25 years old she should know better
than to say something like that it
popped out of her mouth like she said in
a million times I know a lot of people
are saying just forgive her forgive her
I wasn't close enough like on her
channel to actually feel like I had that
connection going yet so I did
unsubscribe
I just don't support people that you
know feed into racist behavior it's not
okay so all right if that's unworthy and
Milani coming to all time I saw that
this morning on Jen loves reviews her
live stream so not excited about morphe

said my drugstore sucks okay all
of them when I was in Milwaukee when I
was in that hand okay I could
never find anything people are like oh
my god they found like the
limited-edition gold bar from
wet-and-wild I was like I'm excuse me
like I had to pay for that for like $50
off Amazon I mean not actually but kind
of do you recommend an eyeshadow brush
wait wait can you recommend an eyeshadow
brush set that's not too expensive
honestly I feel like wet-and-wild those
synthetic bristle brushes that you can
get for like one two three dollars at
the drugstore but again only if you have
a good selection at your drugstore
those are great do they have like the
white at the bottom and then the pink at
the top and they're just there they're
fantastic they're really a really good
quality okay I'm just gonna be in the
Sun this

lighting hold on let me just situate
myself here all right there I did not I
did not think about this clearly clearly

crazy like runny eye is just very very
uncomfortable I don't have sensitive
eyes so that was just that was a no-no
for me but I do like some of their
brushes alright I have a huge decision
to make should I keep my Becca light
cheese or highlighters or sell them in
your opinion why would you say that they
are so good if you've seen my little
collection of I call them flying saucers

dollar brushes see what and while
brushes are fantastic the elf ones and
the LA Colors have some really good
eyeshadow brushes I agree 100% I'm not a

than I do but yes those wet and wild
brushes and they clean well and they
never like get like all torn up I love
it's great let's see here oh my

off the livestream you don't have to be
here you're choosing to be here you can
go out all right let's see here
Liv I just felt like nice chair about
eating a taco I do with you it sounds so
good right now though a taco I really
want that now
alright hi Liv love you which hourglass
palette who is Denise busty Yolanda the
Hospit by Satan
oh my god I love rich luxe okay I what
word was that other one it already
went by I live I love how real you are
and how you don't talk I'm actually
gonna let people sit in my lab chat
there was a guy one time and he
literally was he wrote I'm masturbating
right now watching this and I was like
you can leave right now
okay thank you you get some real weird
people that just like show up and then
of course sometimes hate or show up and
like it's like they just keep going on
and on but mostly they just like to
stick to their little posts behind your
back probably on guru gossip people keep
sending me posts on
guru gossip lately some of the stuff on
there you guys go read some of this
stuff I mean the amount of people that
are so obsessed with small little
details is very disturbing okay
I it's disturbing
all right let's see your cover of exit
verses A Beka a place key but don't make
me choose I need to play with D Becca a
little more but right now I'm leaning
towards cover FX
I'm incredibly blown away by that
palette I am really really impressed
alright let's see here um did you do oh
the chat disappeared let me redo this
okay why does my hair look like a poodle
why do I look like a poodle poodle all
right let's see here your bottom lashes
look really full what is on your bottom
lashes so today I am wearing the Lancome
Hypnose drama which is one of my
favorite mascaras but I am finding it
quality free dupe for it at the
drugstore okay I haven't yet it's gonna
happen it's beautiful it gives really
really nice volume and length and it
makes the lower lashes really really
kind of pop but also you guys know I use
last serums right like these aren't my
natural lashes I mean yeah I don't put
folks like eyelashes on cuz I can't do
that but I do put serums on to make
them long okay so let's see here you're
so nice but swearing Wow are you trying
to be cool by swearing that ain't
working here sweetie
you know what's not working you being
here baby I mean come on if you watched
my videos before you know that I swear
so honestly just take your ass and get
the off get the off the
livestream I don't know why you're here
why are you watching someone that you
don't like go do something else with
your life girl back oh my god really
live some people are very strange yes I
agree I agree Oh what last serums help a
bitch out yes I will help you out so my
lash lash is very good what else is
really good rapid lash her go overnight
lash accelerator uh are any of these
cruelty free I don't think I can
repurchase any of these but I also have
been putting coconut oil on my eyelashes
because you know that's like a DIY thing
and apparently it works it'll do it
just gets oil in my eye and I'm
for an hour but I I would say the
discontinued I'm so sorry makeup
struggles I suck over here go
with Lyle ash if you can
Lyle ash that one has been really really
good for my lashes because they used to
be stumpy as and now they're kind
of like lumpy dumpy all right let's see
your castor oil is great for lash growth
is that for real though because I hate
when people are like oh you just need
like peppermint oil I just like douse
your body in that and like you'll have
perfect skin or it just douse your body
and like gasoline and you'll have great
skin I feel like some of these just
don't work okay so is that for
real
does castor oil actually work because
then I will try it out how long did it
take for the serum to actually work six
to eight months do not believe anybody
that says Owen you know can take a week
or so that's a lie okay it was like six
to eight months but what I noticed is
that they stayed like this so I just
apply it once a week now like I said I
don't think any of these are cruelty
free so I mean my eyelashes might like
fall out and look like after but I
do what you got to deal with lupus yes I
have this yes I totally felt like I made
it a cover photo for my face but I don't
know Stephanie's talking about Stephanie
is so cute you guys she has a channel
she is just a very very talented for
such a young girl castor oil worked from
me okay alright if it actually works for
you if you're being real with me like I
will try that but every time I see that
on like Pinterest or something there's
like a picture of a girl like false
eyelashes on she's like your little did
it and I'm like mmhmm yeah okay let's
see here what is your favorite eyeshadow
palette of all time love you and your
videos what is my favorite eyeshadow
palette I constantly change this because
I feel like I constantly changed my mind
but currently my favorite eyeshadow
palette is back mm-hmm this is the hard
one I feel like I different eyeshadow
palettes like every single week I don't
really have a favorite right now maybe
the Kat Von D st. and Center I really
really like that palette is a damn good
palette okay it's really really good um
let's see here have you watched the show
the good doctor on ABC I have not I have
not Olivia you have me screaming alright
I love your channel I love your honesty
thank you
jamaican black castor
is my go-to for my hair see I need good
oils for my scalp as you guys might have
some up going on back here
okay that's why I wear my hair up I've
talked about it but it's very sad and I
mean it's just very scarred up back
there it looks like a waffle iron like
the scar that I have from the scalp
surgery I had people asking me if it was
like a cosmetic procedure no I had like
a infection in my head like in my scalp
so and that's why I got that surgery um
yeah
do you speak more than one language we
do paÃ§o say I also speak Swedish a
little bit of Mandarin and Italian
because my mom's Italian I'm my dad's
Lea she all right let's see here touch
of products overpriced and over hyped or
good products some of them are good some
of them are not I didn't like the
luminous of dewy skin meso but I tried
that out when I was living in Milwaukee
and I was like an oily bitch so maybe I
would like it now that I'm dry as a bone
let's see here the touch of water cream
my boyfriend is currently using that as
his face cream can you believe I got him
to buy like a $78 face cream for himself
goals life goals okay he really likes it
it's super super thin I feel like if you
have oily skin you would really enjoy
but if you have really dry skin that's
gonna be a no-go
the rice enzyme powder is nice I like
the gentle line I feel like it's pretty
good but honestly I prefer Ola Henriksen
I also prefer drunk elephants you know
you're gonna go up into that price range
maybe you try you know Luna oil from see
from a day serum from drunk elephant or
go and try out you know the Luna oil
from what the Sunday Riley ok
Sunday Riley we just ate I'll see ya is
wonderful okay let's see here I know you
know 9 but I'm 21 I know you know oh
wait I'm so confused be careful with the
when it made my hair fall out oh Jesus
right I can't even imagine like putting
shampoo anyway when people say it made
my hair fall out like did it all just
fall out at once
you don't actually mean that right well
you're just casually start to fall out
because I woke up like 4 years ago and I
had long hair and literally all of my
hair was on my pillow lupus I had to
shave my head it was like really it was
bad Liv I am the grapefruit white girl
honey you are so cute you made
fanpage for me didn't yield on uh I was
gonna say Facebook round have Facebook
on Instagram that's very sweet of you
thank you I want to try a Sunday Riley
so bad but it's just so expensive hi
Tony
yes I agree it is very expensive but a
lot of their products are worth it I
currently am trying out a product that
is not word that honestly they're
cleansing products are not really worth
it because yeah they have great
ingredients so how long were you keeping
a cleanser on your skin so they're
cleansing balm in my opinion I have it
right now the blue tranquility moon
 it's not that great I feel
like there's much better options on the
market and then also there's ceramics
lip clay cleanser Tom's currently using
that because I wanted to stop using it
not that great either I would say if
you're gonna go for Sunday Riley go for
like if they are overnight retinol
treatments or they're selling acid oil
go for something that's gonna be worth
it let's see here
with so many skincare options hotcha
just isn't worth it in my opinion I
agree I agree I agree but it's good to
try it out you know works for some
people
I wash it in giant blobs of hair I was
traumatized oh my god I'm so sorry Jesus
oh no you filled a gallon ziplock bag
with your hair oh my god I would totally
do the same thing like let's just take
this back on okay go get the date
go get the tape okay yes there is a huge
lawsuit against when yeah I heard about
that
um Nikita I swear I feel like I'm gonna
burn thanks I'll break down and spend
the money when the vib sale comes around
Tony go for the UFO clarifying face oil
if you're a little more oily but also
the Luna is good I think there's going
to be a little mini coming out for $90
of Deluxe's of each you can try both see
what you like I love the salicylic acid
overnight oil it still works for me
personally down here even though I'm dry
and I love the Luna so would highly
recommend all right let's see here
Denise if you're 9 it's past your
bedtime who's this Denise person I don't
see her Denise are you 9 years old you
should not be watching me all right I
want to get an hourglass of bronzer
which is the best for pale skin I hate
to say it but like go get yourself on a
beat because sunlit bronzers because the
thing with the hourglass bronzers is
they are beautiful on the skin but if
you're gonna go for hourglass I would go
for one of the powders
one of these strobing powders or the
ambient lighting powders I know they're
all under the same umbrella but I feel
like the blushes and the bronzers aren't
like as amazing as the actual powders so
go put like a sunlit bronzer or
something from Becca or go ahead and get
yourself the positions formula more and
more butter bronzer if you do have more
of like a light or a fair skin tone
because that is amazing I have a
quart sized ziploc bag full of my hair
oh my god I'm so sorry I totally
understand I would do that - oh my god
thinks I'm oily but started to lean dry
uhm how the me I don't know how
these things happen exactly yeah if
you're leaning a little more dry and you
want more like anti-aging I would go for
the Luna oil but if you do have
congestion in your skin blackheads
breakouts go for the clarifying oil I
like having both I actually like mixing
both that is great I love the butter
brown suits my bronzer is just
everything
I just love dipping in there smelling it
I have it all over my face today which
is why I'm so proud my boys just scratch
that was cute
um Liv have you tried Charlotte Tilbury
thoughts and they sent me a PR package
and it was so luxurious I love
that they're cruelty free I love their
big fat lashes mascara very very nice
natural kind of look I like to layer it
with the clumpy mascara because that's
just my thing I like to do what else did
I try from them of the lush that kind of
looked like a boob with like a nipple it
was very strained it was like this like
I don't even know what they called him
every time I open it up and just I got
Boop that's a boom that is not a blush
uh it's called the swirl and swish like
blush is just the weirdest thing ever it
wasn't that great did it last one my
skin very well what else did I try out I
tried out an eye liner even I guess I
didn't like that much actually that they
sent over but I did really like the
mascara all right Liv what are your
thoughts on the unicorn survival kit
from Too Faced
listen to face literally is coming out
with a glitter mask and it's called it's
like something sexual it's like like
glow glow it up or like it
it's like referencing you you guys know
where I'm going with this okay and
they're also gonna be selling shoes now
like two things used to be my favorite
brand
I don't just on them to on
them I on them because I am a
customer
and has spent thousands of dollars on
their products what are you doing like
why are you doing this the glitter mask
looks so weird
and I feel like they're really targeting
a younger audience at this point you
know what I mean
so yeah survival kit no thank you
I am a unicorn I don't need a survival
kit okay okay Charlotte Tilbury if you
were my child didn't ease I'd be
extremely disappointed I can't see

because no I need to get so dark
suddenly I look so tan okay the Sun is
starting to go down so I think I'm gonna
leave in a little bit but let's continue
of this particular wait Becca complexion
crime what oh crap
okay okay because they're scaring me
some of these words I'm like wait what
Becca committed a crime alright wait
wait whoa but I haven't even heard of
the I see is it like a Isilon say poly
because that sounds like to face okay
that sounds like toothpaste
they're having like a sweet iced tea
palette probably next coming soon you
guys what the happened to the
clover palette yo the palette that they
were gonna go ahead and make and like
donate some money to like an animal
charity which is funny and laughable
considering their parent company tests
on animals what happened to that was not
supposed to release like in
August conspiracy alleged mate not a
fake I don't understand like what
happened to that like where to go last
paradise is good but L'Oreal's not
cruelty-free I know some hard to find
like drugstore mascaras and that are
cruelty free but lash princess from
essences like it's like an orgasm in a
tube okay yeah keep looking for that
online clover gate 2017 I need to make a
conspiracy video
what the happen and of course it
has to be that one palette where they go
ahead and they're gonna donate money and
now it's like not happening where to go
there we go
do you plan on reviewing the kuda desert
dust palette and now I found out who
does not I'm sorry who'da is not cruelty
free if they like sell so mink lashes
that are actually mink and minks are not
nice little animals I mean I have two
ferrets that are from the mousseline a
family minks are also in that family as
well as like Wolverines and stuff but
they're vicious they're they're wild
animals you don't just sit down on your
lap and start coming in and say hey
thanks I'm gonna go ahead and glue this
onto a band now and put it on my eye it
doesn't work like that
you'd probably bite you so I'm guessing
that to minks are dead first
okay opinion on Laura Lee palette like I
said barring shade a two-faced yeah I
shade them a lot
okay lives drama channel to face clover
conspiracy that's right
sipping the tea sipping the tea
but when I asked what happened to me
they said is coming in November I will
not be getting it I don't trust them to
donate any money
well no money goes up to the parent
company and estee lauder is very well
known for doing huge amounts of animal
testing just like L'Oreal so I don't
understand like your money is just go in
there anyway I know I have a hard time
with like the parent company thing I
don't know if eventually I'll just stop
purchasing from you know brands that are
also owned by parent company that does
tests on animals
I don't know I'm very mixed ah no Tasha
didn't know not Natasha - no no like I
said I want that kind of money I will
not live do you need help moderating and
all let me know and next time sure yeah
let you know I don't know how to add you
in right now but I don't think anybody's
being meaning are people being me I
don't see anything but anyway guys um
the Sun is here look how white I am
bitch what is this
I blend right in with the wall but
anyway the Sun is starting to set and
you know the sun's gonna come on my face
I'm gonna see all that texture ah I
don't have my ring light to take care of
everything I'm just joking obviously we
all have texture on our skin don't you
love when beauty gurus like doing
regular videos and they're like I'm
gonna do a first impressions today for a
foundation and I'm gonna say 200 feet
back so you can't see my skin I will be
using a blurring filter and yeah the
foundation looks amazing I'm like really
where's her texture where's your skin
okay anyway um but yeah I think I'm
gonna go ahead and my back hurts so bad
from sitting like this I cannot sit are
you going to visit Rochelle yes I yeah
yes I yeah love you too
and never end that live video please I
know I'm sorry but eventually the Sun is
going to overtake me and as you can see
I just blend right in with the wall you
guys won't be able to see me transparent
even with self tanner
so probably should have put eyeliner on
today do you guys see how red my
waterline is but I got like hours of
sleep that's sad
anyway guys I hope you have a good night

see you tomorrow I will have a review on
the prison palette I'm just not gonna

pissed off at the footage got corrupted

so what I'll go ahead and do is film it
kind of later on in the week tomorrow
I'm doing a video called holiday 2017
mutti releases I'm doing part 4 and I am
doing kind of what Samantha does she
does her will I buy it series now I
don't want to like directly piggyback
off of that because I have before and I
feel like that's a very very original
series of hers so I thought of doing
something called splurge or purge where
I talk about holiday releases and if I'm
going to buy them or not if you watch
this video you probably know I'm
probably gonna buy all of them but
anyway that will be tomorrow's video so
