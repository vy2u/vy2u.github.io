welcome back to look at the week where I
share with you guys the look that I have
been wearing on my face all week this
goes hand in hand with my fails in Holy
Grail and also shop and swatch my stash
so yeah let's go ahead and get into look
of the week
I have already gone ahead and put my
primers on the first item I used was the
it cosmetics number 50 serum collagen
veil primer and I put three pumps of
that all over my face I also went in
with these Smashbox photo-finish
hydrating under eye primer and I put
about a pea-sized amount of that
underneath my eyes and then I went in
with the NYC City proved 24-hour eye
base which looks like this and I just
kind of painted that onto my eyelids so
we're gonna go ahead and get right into
kind of another like primer I guess you
could say it's a CC cream this is from
Stila it is the color correcting cream
with broad-spectrum SPF 20 the shade is
fair is 0-1 and I'm gonna give this a
nice little shake and I am going to be
taking this elf ultimate blending brush
and what I'm going to do is spray it
down a little bit to quit the elf makeup
mist and sacked so I'm just gonna spray
that fresh quickly and then I'm gonna
take a little bit of that Cielo color
correcting cream and I am just going to
drop that directly on to the brush like
that and I'm just going to buff this
onto my skin I originally was going to
be using this particular product as like
my foundation this week but I realized
it had basically no coverage to it I'm
probably going to be decluttering this
it is a fail for tomorrow guys but
anyway yeah I kind of realized that how
there's no coverage to it I used to like
this a lot but right now I'm kind of
breaking out a little bit and I just
don't like it so I have been pairing
this with a foundation this week so
after I have done that I'm going to go
in with the L'Oreal visible lift blur
foundation my shade is 2:01 light ivory
I'm gonna give that a good shake as well
and I'm going to put a little dollop of
that on the back of my hand about that
much and I'm going to go back in with
that blending brush from ELF and I am
just going to buff this into my face so
I'm just going to dip it back in there
if you want a little more coverage you
can go ahead and dot it onto your face
and then go in and buff it but yeah I'm
just kinda
going back and forth up and down and
just kind of buffing this lightly into
the skin it does look a little more
yellow toned um when I put it on the
back of my hands but it actually blends
in quite nicely which is good taking it
around my eye area as well
I'm just buffing that into the skin
I hope you guys had a good week I
definitely had a good week it was so
much better and then last week Oh which
was crazy and hectic because I was
working so much but this week has been
really really nice I have the whole
weekend off which is totally totally
awesome so I'm excited for that all
right next we are going to go in with
let's see here
well actually I just take a little more
of that around my eye area kind of buff
that in just a little more and then
we're gonna go ahead and set this in
with a powder so I will be using the
Loreal infallible Pro matte 16-hour
powder in the shade porcelain and I'm
going to take this morphe flat top
kabuki brush I'm going to swirl that in
there starting around my eye area in
t-zone I am just going to stamp and
stipple this on to the skin so that we
can set everything in I was wearing a
waterproof eyeliner yesterday and I feel
like not all of it came off I still have
a little bit of darkness underneath my
eyes I have been color correcting this
week but I'm not gonna do that in this
video not color correcting with actual
color correctors but using the benefits
shy beam not shy beam dandelion liquid
highlighter which is like a light matte
pink it's a product that I'm trying to
use that before September first but I
already put it in a shop and swatch my
stash for next week so I don't have it
in front of me right now but I have been
going in and kind of putting that
underneath my eyes to brighten a little
bit and then to double set everything
because I'm an oily beast I hope you
think he might get cosmetics bye bye
pores in the translucent loose powder
version and I am going to open this up
and take a really really fluffy brush
like this from Real Techniques this is
the powder brush I'm just going to swirl
into the product and then apply this
really really lightly all over my face
just to make sure like I said that I am
completely second as I am I know I'm the
least an oily only Beast alright and you
guys know I love you doing the buffing
technique with this particular powder
but this week I just kind of been
letting like my imperfections kind of
show through since I haven't been
wearing super full coverage products on
my face and I feel like I
just didn't really need to do the
buffing technique since that's not
really the look I was going for I just
want to make sure I don't get too oily
throughout the day alright next I am
going into my physician's formula butter
bronzer in the shade light bronzer I'm
taking the same brush and I'm going to
go ahead and put this all over my face
kind of just dusting it in the areas
where the Sun would naturally hit like
around my forehead my cheekbones and
then underneath my jawline as well just
for a little bit of color and some life
so that I don't look like a dead person
okay smells so good alright so moving on
we are going to do a brush and
highlights I've been using the Becca a
Jaclyn hill champagne collection face
palette this week is that upside down no
it's right so I'm going to go in with my
me be me cosmetics blush brush I'm going
to tap into the shade amaretto which is
that one right there in the middle and I
tap off the excess and then I'm going to
put this right onto the apples of my
cheeks I really love this color so
pretty and then I think whenever I wear
like amaretto I like to use Prosecco pop
that's my highlight so that is probably
the highlight that I will used today
and then just to make sure everything
was really blended I go back in with my
powder brush and just kind of buff it
out to make sure that my blush doesn't
look too harsh because I do tend to be a
little more heavy-handed when it comes
to blush
all right next I am going in with my ELF
blending brush which looks like this and
I am taking Prosecco pop which is right
there I'm going to take a little bit
onto my chin and then down the bridge of
my nose and I'm going to dip in a little
heavier and go right on to my cheekbone
buffing back and forth to make sure it
looks nice and blended in with the skin
and then we're gonna get started on the
ice
alright so the first thing I'm going to
do is line my waterline with the
actually customer browse for us now that
I think about it I'm going to brush my
brows out with this little spooley from
elf just kind of brushing them up and
out then I am going in with the cella a
tantalizing taupe eyebrow color it's a
little retractable pencil and I'm just
going to be filling in the front part of
my brows a little bit and then we're
gonna spoolie it back out because this
is very very harsh when you first put it
on because it's so tiny the strokes are
actually kind of seating on the skin so
I'm gonna take my spoolie and really
kind of blend it here so that it looks
like it is tiny little hairs instead of
like just color deposit it on to my
brows and then to set to the brows in I
will be taking my tonyia crooks eyebrow
gel this is a water proof eyebrow gel
it's completely clear and transparent
I'm just going to put this onto my brow
so that they stay in place all day I
don't want them moving anyway my hair
stay in place stay in place and I do
like to kind of brush my brows up a
little more since I don't have naturally
super super full brows but I do like to
make sure that everything is like
completely blended so that you can't
tell where I put the eyebrow product on
I don't do a lot with my brows usually
but I have been enjoying at this
particular brow combination alright
moving on I am going to wipe down my
lips quickly because we're gonna put our
little lip tint on now so ah the lip
product that I've been wearing this week
is my wife Sal volute the looped the
looked you know this is not that a lot
this is the Daphne olive which is
basically a pop of water glossy stain I
think that's the way that they describe
it so this is in the shade 201 dewy red
and I just like to put it on my bottom
lip and then I go and then that is it so
I do notice that this starts to ball up
a little bit throughout the day but I
still like it it stays on for a long
time it is
quite glossy and pretty on the lips so I
do like that product now when you're
going to go in with eyeliner I'll be
using my smashbox waterproof kohl
eyeliner in the shade sumatra which is a
dark chocolatey brown and i'm just
putting this right onto my waterline all
right and then we are going to go in
with some eye shadow so I will be taking
my Urban Decay Naked basics 1 palette
and I am going to be taking this setting
brush from Real Techniques I'm going
into the shade wo s or walk of shame
which is that one right there and I'm
going to be applying this all over my
lid all the way up to my brow and also
underneath my eye and a little bit on
the inner corner of my eye as well just
so that we have a nice kind of base to
work with alright next I'm going to take
my BH Cosmetics fluffy crease brush and
I'm going in with the shade and Naked 2
which is that one right there I'm taking
a little bit of that onto the brush
tapping off the excess and I'm going to
work that into my crease as my
transition
all right so now we are going to move on
into the star of the show which is the
cap on D serpentina palette I've been
loving it this week it's amazing this is
what it looks like and you open it up
here are the colors we are going to be
taking this shade down here which is
called blood milk and I'm going to be
taking this Sigma tapered blending a 35
brush I'm going to tap into their very
lightly and then I'm going to tap off
the excess and I'm going to start kind
of working this into my crease very very
lightly it's just a beautiful beautiful
matte kind of red color I love this
color it's so gorgeous
so I'm doing that on each side don't
worry we will blend it out after
and these are ultra ultra pigmented
these shadows are so just use a nice
light hand then I am going in with this
guy right here which is the morphe and
200 and I am just going to go back and
forth into the crease and blend things
lightly and then I will go in with that
BH Cosmetics brush again which is a
little more densely packed and that will
help some more with lightly so there's
the BH Cosmetics back and forth back and
forth you guys know how to blend I don't
like to blend but I'll do it I'll do it
anyway that's one thing I noticed this
palette does take a little more time to
blend out because the shadows are so
pigmented but I feel like it's worth it
at the end because it's really really
nice and pretty on the actual eyes and
also do some circular motions you get
more of like a diffused sort of look
alright and then we are going to go in
with this little guy right here the
Sonia Kashuk number 116 brush and I am
going to tap into the shade Queen which
is that one right there
and this is going to go into the outer V
again it's half off that excess we're
just going to stamp that into the outer
V and a little bit into the outer crease
just so that we have a little bit of
depth and dimension
and then going back in with that
blending brush I'm going to take any
where is it that's the wrong one the
beach cosmetics I'm just going again
back and forth back and forth
I love this color though the two of
those colors together is like really
really pretty on the eyes especially if
you do have blue eyes a lot of you have
been saying that this palette really
brings out to blue eyes or at least it's
been bringing out my life this weekend I
love it
next we were taking um here we glyph
hieroglyphs yes could barely read it she
has such a funky I'm writing on here but
it's very cute
alright and I am just tapping that onto
the lid obviously as you guys can see
with my finger you can foil these a
little bit if you want to if you want to
foil it on your lid but as you can see
it's already quite high impact and very
very foiled looking without being foiled
so definitely not something you have to
do but it still looks pretty nice if you
do foil it all right and then I am going
to go in with the morphe m200 again and
I am going to be taking that Naked 2
color from The Naked basics again
tapping that off and then going right
above the crease to blend that out
yeah so early in the morning when I'm
filming this I'm just kind of like let's
all sleep while I'm blending all right
guys next two we are going to go ahead
I'm gonna take my big powder brush and
just wipe underneath because you can get
a little bit of fallout with you guys
and now what we are going to do is go
back into actually Queen and I'm going
to be taking this little Mally dual
ended brush here we have a pencil and
then we have like a blending brush on
the other side going in with the pencil
and I am taking this right underneath
that lower lash line so that we can kind
of smoke our lower lash line out and it
looks really messy at first but we will
blend it out with the other side of the
brush so just kind of slap it on there
and that sounds really bad but just kind
of slap it on there and then take the
other side of the brush and we're just
gonna very very lightly go back and
forth and kind of blend that out and
then I'm going to go into here Olaf
again hieroglyphs and take that on the
inner part of the lower lash line right
there again go and blend a little bit
and now we are going to go in with our
mascara I look absolutely insane right
now I love that when you kind of smoke
out your lower lash line it looks crazy
while you put your mascara on alright so
the first mascara we are going to go in
with is the Urban Decay perversion
mascara I'm gonna put one nice coat of
this on my lashes so I'm go ahead and
start with the lower lashes and in the
upper and then I'm going in with one of
my all-time favorite mascaras which you
guys know is my Sephora outrageous girl
you don't have q-tips on me so I'm
trying my best not to get this
everywhere so that is what it looks like
with one layer of mascara then going in
with these Sephora outrageous curl I'm
going to put on at my second layer start
with the upper ones this time
and you guys know I like clumpy lashes
so that's my disclaimer I always get
someone saying oh your lashes are so
clumpy in the comment section I'm like I
like it like that
ha ha ha I do though my for real it's
not on purpose well it is on purpose I
was gonna say it's not something that I
don't notice obviously I notice it I
like them glimpse I was thinking of
getting that mascara from is it
Maybelline it's called like the Klumps
or like the spider lashes yeah I think I
need that in my life
and I've gotta say guys that is the eye
look that I have been wearing this week
this is the face that I have been
wearing this week I hope you guys
enjoyed it this video thank you so much
