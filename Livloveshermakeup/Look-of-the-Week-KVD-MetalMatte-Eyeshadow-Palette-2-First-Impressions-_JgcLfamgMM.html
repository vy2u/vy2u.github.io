welcome back to look of the week of
where I'd recreate a look that I have
been wearing this week so I do use the
products that I shopped at my stash
board if you guys are new to my channel
I have three series that I do on my
channel on Mondays they do shop and
swatch my stash on Saturdays I do look
of the week and on Sundays I do fails
and holy grails and those all go
together so Monday I choose the product
Saturday I show you guys how they apply
to the face and then on Sunday I tell
you if I liked it or not so anyway today
we are focusing on the Kat Von D metal
matte eyeshadow palette I'm so excited I
was gonna flip it so you guys could see
the maps but anyway this is a beautiful
eyeshadow palette I have been doing a
lot of different looks with this this
week and today we are recreating the
look that I was wearing yesterday the
eye look which was kind of like a
silvery bluish look so anyway I believe
timestamps down below if you would like
to go ahead and fast forward just to the
eye look but it is look of the week so
we do get ready full face you know
casual style get ready with me style and
I do want to say it I was sent some
products from a subscriber and good
friend of mine thank you so much Brit
she sent me this Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powder in the shade
precious petals I did open it but I have
not touched it yet so I want to do a
first impressions on this today and then
also she sent me this wonderful little
wet-and-wild crease brush which looks
like that so we're gonna try those out
as well and yeah everything else will be
what I have been writing on my face this
week so let's go ahead and get started
the first thing I'm gonna do is prime my
face if you watched my shot my stash the
video you knew that or you know that I
have been using the timebomb face primer
this is what it looks like and I'm just
going to take a small amount of that and
apply it to my face I'm probably gonna
take about that much kind of like aid I
was gonna say it great that's not the
size of a grape it's the size of like a
pea so I am putting it all over my face
and on you guys oh my god I opened up
the window today it was 47 degrees out
47 degrees I was like yes actually some
places in the Midwest actually got snow
last night which makes me really excited
I mean I want there to be like fall
before there's snow but still I get so
excited this is my favorite time of year
as well as the winter I absolutely love
this time
year all right so after I have done that
I am going to go ahead and put my eye
primer on the one that I have been using
this week is actually also from the ball
I really like the two of these pair
together this is the balm cosmetics put
a lid on it
eyelid primer and it has the same sort
of consistency sort of like silicone
base I like it so we're just gonna take
a little bit of this probably about that
much just a really tiny amount and I'm
just going to Pat this onto my eyelids
and take any excess that I have onto the
under part of my eye that's sounded
we're at the under part underneath my
eye guys still a little early when I'm
filming this I actually got to sleep and
of course since it is Saturday and Tom
is not working today which is awesome
because normally he does work but he's
not so that is very cool and I take a
little bit underneath it does help with
the creasing and I really like eye
primers like this that are just really
really nice and silicone base if you
guys watched my declutter series on my
primers you probably saw the eye
decluttered a lot of tacky primers
because I've just noticed that it's not
my thing I don't like it I don't like
having to sit there and blend and blend
and blend over a really tacky
primer so anyway moving on oh god I hope
I don't get to sniffly in this we are
gonna go in and do some color correcting
and concealing I will be using my NYX
color correcting concealer palette which
looks like this we're gonna start with
that lavender shade there and I'm just
going to apply this to the areas where I
have a little bit of fine lines and
wrinkles that I kind of want to plump up
I really like lavender shades for doing
that if that makes sense I feel like
they're very lifting and also they helps
you cancel out any so lowness speaking
of sullenness I'm gonna take that yellow
shade and I'm gonna put this on my
eyelids I like this because it really
cancels out redness and it is quite
brightening so I like to make sure I
take it on the inner corner of the eye
as well and then I'm gonna go in with
that salmony color and I'm gonna take
that underneath the eye and this pan is
almost empty which is really depressing
but this is one of my favorite color
correcting products they're super creamy
as you guys can see they look like a
mess when you first apply them but they
blend in like an absolute dream and then
I'm gonna take a little bit of the green
and put it on areas where I'm a little
red alright and then to blend that in
I'm going to
this elf brush here I think this is
called the elf selfie blurring brush or
something like that it's very similar to
the Real Techniques what is it like that
you know that brush the one that
everybody uses the expert face brush and
I'm just blending this in I love the way
it blends these color correctors and
again these color correctors are
beautiful because they do have a little
bit of concealing properties to them so
they actually blend into the skin really
nicely and I do feel like they give a
little coverage let me just fix my
mirror they are hard so yeah I'm just
blending blending blending those in and
I have already if you guys are curious
apply that in my skincare so if my face
looks a little oily it is because I put
on a morula oil today alright so yeah I
have no idea if this brush is actually
available anymore if it is you guys
should pick it up it's very good alright
moving on we're gonna go into foundation
I'll be taking my Maybelline a better
skin skin transforming foundation this
is what it looks like the shade I wear
is number 10 porcelain I'm going to take
two pumps onto the back of my hand and
actually I'm going to be applying it
with that same brush so I'm just going
to go ahead and start applying none and
normally I like the way that this goes
on the most with a damp sponge but I
feel like if I moisturize my face like
properly before it actually goes on
quite nicely with the brush so let me
know down below how you guys apply this
particular foundation I feel like it's
great for those who do have combo to
oily skin because it's got a little bit
of like a mousse like texture so it
actually goes on very nicely and it
keeps you pretty darn matte throughout
the day but this time of year my skin is
starting to change I have what I
consider severe combo skin so basically
I get very very very oily during the
summer time and then very very dry
during the winter months and I've
started to notice that my skin is
definitely kind of changing over so
anyway I do feel like you have to
moisturize properly before and before
using this particular foundation but
yeah I will say I feel like sometimes
this does apply slightly streaky with a
brush I used it yesterday with a DM Real
Techniques sponge and I definitely death
Nataly preferred it alrighty
your cars out there alright moving on we
are going to go ahead and use a little
bit of concealer this is the cabin of
Quan sensual skin enhancer the shade
that I have is s02 this is what it looks
like and a few of you were asking how I
like to use this I this week I've been
using it to kind of highlight my face so
I just need the smallest amount and I
just put it on the areas where I do you
want to kind of highlight so you know
it's a weird product because it is a
very very very thick so you have to be
quite careful but I think it's still
pretty good you can use it as a
foundation a concealer really whatever
you want but I don't know guys
it's kind of a weird one it is kind of a
weird one and again with that same brush
I am just going to go ahead and stipple
it on to my face I do like the way that
the Kevyn Aucoin again applies with a
damp sponge probably should have done
that today but I wanted to use a brush
because you know it's good to change
things up I have so many foundation
brushes you guys and I feel like I
rarely rarely use them so trying to get
in the habit of kind of pulling those
out more often so that they're not just
you know sitting there but I do prefer
the way sponges apply foundations for
the most part I just deal all right
so I'm just kind of stippling making
sure that's blended you have to be
really careful with the sensual skin
enhancer because they are so freakin
thick it's a weird product eyes it is a
weird
product alright moving on I am then
going to go in with this brush here this
is the morphe pointed foundation brush
and I am just going to go over those
areas and stipple so that we don't have
any sort of streakiness going on and
then with the same brush I will go ahead
and set this in and I'm going to be
using my handy dandy where is it
Rimmel stay matte pressed powder in the
shade zero zero one transparent to set
everything in so same brush I like the
way that this more
the foundation brush goes around the eye
area so I'd like to set my foundation in
with it it does take a little longer
since it is smaller but I like it I
really like morphe brushes I don't like
the makeup I do like their brushes that
is one thing that I will give to them
all right
setting in that foundation I've been
going a little heavier this week as you
guys can probably tell color correcting
concealing and a pretty heavy duty
foundation but i've liked it i think it
looks good it looks nice on the skin i
like the way it comes off alright moving
on we are going to go ahead and put on
our bronzer and our blush and also our
highlight and i'm excited to try out
that new highlight can't wait so what i
have been using for blush and bronzer
this week is my Bobbi Brown Bobbi to
blow a face palette so we're gonna take
the shade in the middle called bronze
and I'm going to take this fluffy brush
from um where's this firm I got this
forever ago who recommended this I think
it was Emily Noel 83 this is from why
can't I remember what this is from hmm
oh yeah the up and up collection I'm
sorry from Target it's the up and up
collection from Target I really really
love this brush I've got it years ago
after I heard emily noel eighty-three
raving about it and it's a really really
nice little brush so i am taking that
and just bronzing up my face quickly and
then i like to go back in with that
powder brush and just stipple over it
because I do find that this bronzer can
go on slightly splotchy it's actually
technically a shimmer brick so it's
whatever you want it to be but for me
with my skin tone it is a bronzer
alright
I've done my lips and then we are gonna
go in with that beautiful wild rose
shade right there and I am going to go
ahead and take my ELF
what is this angled blush brush I'm
gonna pick that up and we are going to
use this as blush and again if you do
have light enough skin if these do show
up as like blush and bronzer on you
so really cool I feel like this
particular holiday palette is so so so
versatile I really like it a lot it
gives like a little bit of glow but not
too much and then this week I have been
going in with that gold shade which is
technically the more like highlighter in
the palette then going back with that
powder brush stippling over anywhere
making sure it's not streaky looking but
yeah I've been going in with this gold
shade this week and using that as my
highlight and the brush that I have been
using is the elf blending brush I liked
how it really gets in there and then
just put it right onto the cheekbones
but like I said today we were gonna try
out this Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powder and the sheet is
called precious petals this is what it
looks like stunning it's stunning
I'm gonna take my Sigma tapered I've 35
brush yeah f-35 brush I'm gonna tap in
there we are just gonna go ahead and
start applying this oh it's so shiny I
love that yes girl yes yes yes ooh would
you see that glow girl oh my god it's so
like smooth and creamy too oh yes yes
yes yes yes yeah I feel like I never
used to be someone who would say
something like Yas but now we do oh my
god do you see that glow whoo girl that
is beautiful and I like how it's not
darkening up too much on my skin it is
more of like a rose gold shade I don't
feel like it's darkening up too much but
I still I'm gonna go in with that powder
brush again and just tap over very very
lightly to make sure everything is
properly blended you also can do the
buffing technique at this time to make
sure everything is properly blended in
but oh that is a beautiful highlight
Thank You Britt you're the best
alright moving on we are gonna go ahead
and let's do our brows so what I have
been using for brows this week is this
little guy right here this is the model
launcher brows in the shade taupe so it
has a spoolie on one side and then a
little like triangle shaped
like a retractable liner on the other
side it's kind of similar to the
Anastacio Beverly Hills define aren't
you guys just see how I moved that
freakin foundation god dammit
it's got like kind of like that Anasazi
Beverly Hills brow define our thing
going on on the other side and I never
thought that I would like something like
this that has that little like angle but
it's actually so easy to do your brows
quickly so I like to just fill in the
front part right here and then that's
usually it I don't do much with my brows
I'm a no-fuss kind of brow girl but I do
like how easy this is and I feel like
the color is a little more on the warm
side but if somehow it looks good in my
brows I don't know I like it I like it
and then I just spoolie it out on the
other side one more time and if I'm
gonna have a really long day like if I'm
working I have been going in with my
Maybelline clear mascara which I'll show
you guys it looks like this a little
spot there it looks like this but today
I'm just hanging out at home so I'm not
going to do that but there is a little
tiny spot here I want to fill in no more
but yeah I really like this time so I
think I got this in at my boxycharm this
month glossy box one of those and I like
it I like it a lot
alright moving on let's go ahead and get
into eye shadow alright so we are going
to go into the metal mask palette this
is from Kat Von D here it is and we are
going to recreate the look I was wearing
yesterday so the first thing we're gonna
do is take this shade right here called
bone and I'm gonna take my fluffy crease
brush actually no why don't we do hmmm
let me take this aqua sealer this is
weird but I like it this is the aqua
sealer rainforest of the sea brush from
Tarte so it is meant for concealer but
this fluffy side I really really like to
just tap all over like a color and just
kind of deposit it so I'll take it a
little bit underneath the eye and then
I'll just tap it all over and this will
help so that the blending process is
quicker especially when you are working
with more bright colors you know you
obviously have to blend a little more so
that things don't look too splotchy but
I really
it's like deposits color on I know it's
a concealer brush but hey it's makeup we
can do whatever we want right and this
is actually a beautiful color this bone
shade if you do have fair skin and you
want to highlight and actually set in
your concealer you can do that as well
so you can take it down and do whatever
you want all right moving on let's go in
with this little guy right here this is
actually you what screw it let's take
our crease brush from wet-and-wild I'm
excited
alright so this is the wet and wild
crease brush I've never tried this
before first impressions time I'm so
excited oh my god it's so cute
did we see it it's got like an ombre
pink thing going on we're gonna go ahead
and take this shade right here called
suede and I'm gonna work that into the
crease as my transition so we're just
gonna go back and forth oh my god is so
soft yes what in a while well done well
done
and I'm just kind of putting it directly
into the crease and if the little gets
onto the lid as well that is totally
okay because we are going to Pat one of
the foiled shadows on there anyway and I
really like peering this particular
shade the suede shade with the cooler
tones in here because it just helps them
to blend quite a bit and it gives them a
little bit of warmth I feel like when
you're just straight up wearing the blue
eye shadow it can look a little 70s or
80s or just kind of dated you know but I
really like this particular suede shade
and we will go back in with an actor all
right that was nice I like that and you
guys see this has a little crevice here
so that you can put your finger in there
awesome alright moving on we are gonna
go right into the shade as that we're
gonna put in our crease which is called
velour which is a beautiful beautiful
blue color I'm gonna be taking my sigma
e35 blending brush which looks like this
I'm gonna tap in there very lightly you
guys tap off that excess and very very
carefully we're gonna start working this
into the crease now you're gonna see
that it's going to start to deposit
color kind of all over the place it's
totally okay if it gets down onto the
lid just keep blending back and forth
just keep blending and I'm kind of
lifting up my brow like this but I
really can try and deposit it right into
the crease because let's be honest we
don't want this bloop color all the way
up to our brow and if I'm just leaving
my face like this it is going to get up
there so again on the other side
worry we will continue to blend putting
that right into the crease like I said
it's totally okay if it starts to get
down onto the lid and I love the shade
it is so so so so pretty yeah I think I
snipers getting all right next we're
gonna go in with the morphe m5 11 brush
and i am just going to start blending
this so back and forth motions a little
bit of circular motions but mostly just
back and forth and we're gonna make sure
that it's really really blended out on
the inside or the hollow of that eye
because that is where we want the most
depths and here with this particular
shade you are gonna have to spend a
little more time blending so just be
aware of that I feel like any time you
are wearing colored eye shadows like
this you can expect to spend you know a
little more time blending them out so
back in forth motions and little
circular motions as well but making sure
that I don't bring it all the way up to
the brow because we don't want things to
get too dark too quickly because then
you have to go in and kind of you know
wait things out alright so back and
forth back and forth and I will say
these colors and I said this in my
review they stain your brushes they
stain at your fingers so that's
definitely something to be aware of
alright just more up back and forth
motions and like I said totally okay if
it gets down onto the lid as well
usually when you have a blending brush
like this when it's kind of big you are
going to get a little onto the lid but
it doesn't matter it's totally okay
because the whole eye look is going to
be mostly blue all right so now I'm
doing little circular motions as you
guys can see and I love this color it's
so so so pretty it kind of matches my
robe all right just keep blending just
keep blending alright and then we are
going to go into the shade and ignite
which is this one right here it is one
of the foiled shades I'm gonna take it
on to my middle finger and I'm just
going to tap this on to the lid and I
love this shade I think it's so so so
pretty so again tap that onto the lid or
which is why it doesn't matter if
velour shake got onto the lid since
we're just packing this on over it and
this is this is I would say like a step
up from the velour shade double or she'd
looks a lot darker in the Panth and it
does when you actually put it onto the
eyes and I just like the way that the
two of those look together so again
we're gonna go back in with that wet and
wild brush again we're gonna take that
shade suede which was our transition
we're gonna go in there and then like I
said I like to just concentrate this
right on the top area on the upper
crease I guess you could say and I just
like the way it kind of blends in that
blue shade I really I think it looks a
lot better than just having blue all the
way up to your eyebrow to each their own
if you would like blue all the way up to
your eyebrow no problem but this is what
I was wearing yesterday and I did get
away with wearing this to work so next
we're gonna go back to that aqua sealer
brush and I'm gonna go back into the
shade of bone this time I'm taking it on
the other side and I'm just packing
right underneath it's a lid and the
reason why I'm doing this is just I want
it to the wrong color the reason why I'm
doing this is just to make sure that we
still have lightness underneath the brow
if I say the lid I'm at the brow and
then I'm gonna go into a morphe m200
brush this is just a nice clean brush
and we're just gonna go back and forth
this is a very very fluffy little crease
brush and I like to just use little
wispy motions and kind of blend it in
circular motions and just do a little
bit at this to kind of clean up any sort
of harsh edges because that can happen
quite quickly when you are working with
colored eyeshadows all right moving on I
am going to take this elf elf this
starts a little pencil brush here and
we're gonna go into the shade watt which
is right here
beautiful beautiful foiled eyeshadow
again and we're gonna take this on the
lower lash line and it gets messy pretty
darn quickly but don't worry we will
blend it out so you really want to kind
of pack it on there and then we will
kind of smoke it out a little bit so
it's okay if it just looks like a harsh
line underneath your eye it's all about
blending guys
you know I don't like to blend but here
I am saying it right so putting that on
the lower lash line and then we're gonna
go in with the Sonia Kashuk number 116
brush and I am just going to go ahead
and blend that back and forth underneath
I really like this we're kind of smoking
out that lower lash line I think it
looks nice and I like the way that the
Ignite shade kind of paired together
with that lighter blue and then the
velour shade I like to the side look I
thought it was nice and like I said it's
not so so in-your-face that it's like oh
my god like I still was able to wear
this to work I guess it depends on where
you work but I was still able to so
alright and then after that I'm going to
go back in with that big fluffy up and
up brush and I am obviously going to
pick up any sort of fallout we may have
had it's a little more tricky when it
comes to actual fallout for a soiled
eyeshadow because you really have to
pick it up but it's okay alright and
then I'm gonna go back in one more time
with that morphe brush and we're just
gonna go lightly back and forth in that
crease area making sure there are no
harsh lines and then we are going to go
ahead and put some eyeliner on so the
eyeliner that I have been wearing this
week is from Smashbox whoo from Smashbox
this is the always sharp waterproof coal
liner in the shade Raven I forgot to
show this in my eyeliner declutter video
I'm keeping it if you are curious and
we're just gonna go ahead and put this
right on to the waterline I really like
how dark and black it is it's very nice
and I do like the way that the squares I
feel like it's pretty much like
comparable to the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencils which are my faves
so alright I'm moving on I know it's
starting to get smoother girl it's
starting to get sniffling all right
we're gonna go ahead and put on our
mascara the first mascara I'll be using
is my Lancome Hypnose drama Anna this is
a very wet and could be mascara
and I absolutely adore it so I'm gonna
put that on it to you my lashes just one
layer and then I'm gonna go in with my
NARS audacious mascara which is like a
new favorite of mine I'm really really
into it I think it's beautiful all right
and then like I said the NARS audacious
mascara which I feel like this wand
looks like it would hurt so bad if it
got in your eye but in reality guys it's
super soft and flexible it's awesome and
I just realized I did not curl my lashes
which is not a good idea with these
mascaras because they do weigh the
lashes down they're very very wet
formulations so I feel like the only
time I can get away with not curling my
lashes is when I'm working with a super
super dry mascara but whatever and what
it is so there they are and if that is a
little too clumpy and clumpy for you you
can always go in and kind of separate
that but that is it guys so I would say
first impressions wise on that wet and
wild crease brush I love it so far and
the highlight is so beautiful it just
looks like your skin is wet like it's
gorgeous and I feel like that rose gold
shade it's not it's a little dark but
it's not darkening up on the skin to the
point where like it looks like it's not
a highlight I feel like there is enough
gold in here that it is very very
reflective and beautiful so if you do
have fair-skinned you could probably
still get away with that I just realized
we forgot to do our lips so let's go
ahead and do those um what was I using
this week I was using all of these
retractable lip pencils from bite Beauty
the first shade that I used the shade
that I used yesterday was called tort
today we're gonna use cafe which is more
of like a nudie color but all the shades
are really really beautiful so I'm just
putting that on and I like the way that
color looks with the blue I really
wanted to wear like aubergine today and
then do a blue look but then I was like
come on is that very wearable I feel
like that's not very wearable so anyway
guys that is it this is look of the week
this is the makeup that I have bring
