happy Saturday today I have a look at
the week for you guys which is why we're
up close and personal I'm still wearing
my PJs this robe is just so comfortable
I don't want to take it off
Oh today we will be featuring in the new
lorac pro 3 eyeshadow palette so I am
going to put a time stamp down below
since this is look of the week and I
will be using all of the items that I
shopped and swatch my stash with and
we'll be putting on my whole face of
makeup with you guys but I will time
stamp if you would like to fast forward
to just the eye look so yeah let's go
ahead and get started I am just going to
pull my hair back with my little
headband here and we're just gonna get
right into it so the first item I'm
going to use is my face primer and I
will be using the Becca backlight
priming filter and if you guys can see
the little mark here it's because this
is an item that is in my current project
pan so that is why I'm trying to do
little markings of where I am with the
product so I'm going to take three pumps
of this primer and I'm just going to
apply that all over my face well I just
wanted to say I know that like I've been
really bad with look of the week I am
the queen of starting new like new
series on my channel and just like not
you know going through with it I will be
back with me like Monday and I'm trying
to make this a consistent thing as well
I think it's because there's just been
so many new makeup products to review I
just get sidetracked and I forget about
you know this series that are like a
consistent thing on my channel so I
apologize about music Monday and about
look of the week I am getting back to
them it's just hard when there's all
these new products releasing because of
course I want a review for you guys and
things like that and I don't remember
but I think last week or the week before
I put up like two or three reviews on
what was it Saturday or Monday which was
supposed to be shop and swatch my stash
or it was supposed to be look of the
week and that's just because there were
so many new products so anyway after we
have done that we're gonna go in with
our eye primer I'll be using the
benefits Air Patrol BB eyelid primer
just gonna take the lid off I'm going to
do one little click and I'm going to
apply this to both sides of my
and then I'm just going to blend that in
with my finger and I'm gonna take any
sort of excess that there might be and I
am just going to put that on my under
eye as well do you guys do that too
anytime you have extra primer I just
kind of bring it underneath my eye and I
really like it with this particular
eyeshadow primer because this actually
has like color correcting sort of
pigments to it and it's very hydrating
so it's got that yellow tone so I
definitely don't mind bringing that
underneath my eyes dark circles are not
too bad today because they did sleep in
but they're pretty bad during the week
anyway how did you guys um how did you
guys did you guys have a good weekend is
what I'm trying to say multitasking yo
do you guys have a good weekend please
let me know down below I'd love to hear
from you guys alright next we are going
to use the Tasha luminous dewy skin mist
and I'm just gonna give this a good
shake and then I'm going to spray a few
pumps with this all over my face just to
give a little extra moisture and to
prime our face just a little more that's
what I've been doing with this product
lately I want to talk about this
tomorrow in the fails and holy grails
because I've already mentioned this as a
fail on the past couple weeks I'm really
just trying to get through this product
and I find that when I use it as like a
setting spray it's just got too much oil
in it and it really just makes my
foundation break down everything in my
face just break down so I've been using
it kind of like after my primers to go
in and just add a little extra moisture
and then I like to just kind of tap it
in after so that it's not just like
sitting on top of my skin if that makes
sense I think this is a really nice
product if you do have dry skin but if
you don't have dry skin and like don't
even bother alright next I'm gonna go in
with my L'Oreal Paris visible lift blur
concealer in the shade 301 fair there's
only a little bit left here so I'm just
you take a little on the back of my hand
and we're gonna cover these little areas
where I have some hormonal breakouts it
is that time of the month and oh my god
there's like barely any left in here but
it is that time of the month
and I definitely do have some stuff to
cover so we're gonna go ahead and do
that so I'm going to be taking this
little tart - dual sided brush right
here let me take the shorter
right here and we are just going to put
this right on to the areas where I have
those little pimples we're just going to
cover them and then I will take the
other side to blend that out and I like
to do this before my foundation or I've
been wearing a tinted moisturizer this
week because it does dry down even
though it looks like it's a good color
match it dress does dry down a little
darker if you guys can see like on my
hand I like it because it actually has a
lot of great tones in it it's kind of
like a color correcting concealer and
I'm going to take the other side and
just buff in circular motions to blend
that in so it does have like a lot of
great talents but at the same time I do
like it it's a beautiful concealer this
sits beautifully underneath the eyes as
well if you would want to use it that
way alright and then we're gonna go in
with our foundation I've actually been
using like I said a tinted moisturizer
this week and the one I've been using is
the bare minerals complexion rescue
tinted hydrating gel cream with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen and my
shade is opal 0-1 I'm gonna give this a
good shake because it does have
sunscreen in there and you don't want it
to separate we're gonna take a nice
little glob of that on the back of our
hand about that much and then I'll be
going in with this Real Techniques what
are you called sculpting brush I
actually like using this for foundation
it's very very dense and nice so I'm
just gonna dip in there and then we're
just gonna start applying this to the
face and I kind of just use swiping
motions I don't find that I need to like
do circular motions that much because
this is such a light coverage product it
really doesn't put down a lot of color
or a lot of coverage at all it truly is
a tinted moisturizer maybe even less
than a tinted moisturizer but it is in
my project pan I do want to use it up
and it is the summertime now basically
and I do find that I don't like to deal
with really really heavy products on my
skin during the summertime so this is
like right up my alley for this time of
year so as you guys can see that really
didn't cover much but this is what I've
been doing all week and probably wasn't
the greatest week to like take this
product out because like I said do you
have me period but
okay I've been going really really
natural with the face so it's alright we
will be going in with like a powder
foundation and a second but after I have
blended that in completely I'm going to
go ahead and highlight my face with my
benefit to dandelion shy beam and I'm
gonna take this on you know my what is
this not the bridge in my notes down the
bridge of my nose on my Cupid's bow on
my chin and then in a little v-shape
underneath my eyes and on my eyelids and
I have to be careful with this because
like the little brush is so flimsy and
it kind of deposits too much product
down at once if that makes sense please
can I just open you why can't you just
open okay there we go umm so I'll show
you guys that's a little wand it looks
like it's like a very very flimsy so I'm
just gonna put a little bit on to the
chin as you can see it goes on so
streaky because the little wand in here
really kind of sucks a little bit like
this it's just such a little flimsy wand
that's okay anyway I'm not gonna do too
much of a triangle I'm mostly just gonna
take it where I do have a little bit of
excess blue tones and then a little bit
on my eyelids as well for some color
correcting and this is just like a
peachy highlight and I find that like I
really have been enjoying like really
glowing lately so I don't really use
that as a highlight so I like it for
kind of color correcting and concealing
so I'm just going back to that sculpting
brush and I am just blending this in
just doing stippling motions now because
it is so densely packed this brush it's
actually really good with like the
stippling motion I mean I don't get any
streaking and I like that it's angled
because you can get right underneath the
eye do you guys have this brush what do
you use it for I know most people use it
for contouring like cream contouring but
I find that it's a little too drastic
like I like a nice subtle contour for
the most part and I find that this just
really packs the contour on there so
actually prepared for the foundation and
I'm trying to get away from using so
many little SpongeBob's I am currently
out of Real Techniques sponges like both
of mine got dirty and I had
them and I'm not laying myself buy any
for maybe a couple more weeks because I
really want to use some of my brushes I
have so many brushes you guys I'm gonna
do a brush collection video but yeah I
need to use them alright next we're
going to set in our face with the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 16 hour
powder and my shade is the latest shade
I'm going to go in with my Tarte to err
buffer foundation brush I'm just going
to swirl into the product and then I am
going to stipple this onto my face
really concentrating around on my t-zone
where I do tend to get oily throughout
the day as usual you just realized I
forgot to bring my spoolie out here so
we're just gonna pass on the brows today
because the product I was going to use
was my brow drama but it does not look
good unless I can hold my lashes out I
knew I was forgetting some sort of tool
or brush I was like what am I forgetting
it's just bully so I'm just setting my
face in and as you guys can see this is
a little dark on my skin tone kind of
annoying because it is the lightest
shade but anytime I'm setting my face in
I like to use a powder that's either
lighter than my skin tone or just
completely transparent because then I
feel like I go in with like bronzer and
contour and everything just gets darker
and darker and because this is a little
dark on my skin tone I will be going in
with a powder foundation now this may
sound crazy like wow really taking that
face but again we're only wearing a
tinted moisturizer and this is a little
dark on the skin so I am just going in
and kind of lightly going over the areas
that need a little more coverage like
where I'm breaking out around my
cheekbones my nose especially and we're
just touching up with the tarte
confidence creamy powder foundation in
fair neutral I do love this powder
foundation and honestly when you do have
combo to oily skin like I do you can
never have enough powder girl just
really you could never have enough
powder all right
okay really read around my nostrils all
right next we are going to go ahead and
let's see here we are gonna go in with
our blush and this week I've actually
been using bronzer as blush I've been
using my lorac take me to tenth eco
palette so this is what it looks like
and I am going to take this BH Cosmetics
angled blush brush it is dirty I
apologize I hate watching videos when
people use dirty brushes it really
scares me I don't know why anyway I will
be using this I'm going to go right into
tan Antoniou and then I'm gonna tap off
the excess and put this onto the apples
of my cheeks and I really been liking
this as like my blush this week because
it's so bronzy and kind of glowy and
pretty and I'll do anything to glow when
you're fair-skinned like I am they're
like yes I will do anything to have a
tan I've been using I'm self-tanning
products the past like week and a half
and a lot of you have been saying you
love the way my skin is looking so thank
you for that I really do like the way
that the tan is looking as well it
definitely got a little washed away last
night it did exfoliate my body in the
shower but it's okay alright so after we
have done that I'm going to go back in
with the air buffer foundation brush and
just go over to make sure we don't have
any harsh lines just stippling over
really quickly alright next oh my god
it's getting hot with this robot getting
these lights are so bright alright next
I am going to go in and take my Josie
Maran Argan enlightenment and luminizing
veil which looks like this and I'm going
to go in with my Lexi 522 tapered
highlighter brush I'm going to swirl
into the product and I'm going to put
this on my chin I'm gonna take it down
the bridge of my nose little on my
Cupid's bow and then I'm going to buff
it in to my cheekbones
I love this highlighter it's definitely
a Holy Grail for tomorrow feel like I
always give you guys a little sneak peek
of what's a fail or Holy Grail for the
week in these videos alright next we are
gonna go in with our eyeliner like I
said with my few eyebrows because I
forgot my spoolie so they're gonna look
a little a little cranked up a little
weird but that's okay and I'm going to
go in with my eyeliner I'll be using the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
the shade faint I'm gonna put this on my
waterline quickly and I know it always
looks like I'm blinding myself people
are like oh my god be careful with that
eyeliner can't help it it's just the way
I look when I'm putting it on alright
and now mine just came so freakin hot I
don't wanna take this out though because
I'm just wearing my little pink eyes
alright we are going to curl our
eyelashes for ten seconds each 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then I'm
going to take a little bit of this
garden a skin active micellar cleansing
water and the waterproof version I'm
going to shake this up a little bit take
Asia Sato cotton round and I'm gonna
wipe my lips down make sure there's no
foundation on there hey Mon we are going
to let the oils kind of sink in there
for a second then I'm going to put on my
blistex deep renewal lip balm this thing
is lasting forever I have a tiny little
bit left and I'm like can you just be
gone already and I'm just going over my
lips well we do our eye shadow we'll let
that sink it and now we're going to go
into it is so beautiful we're just gonna
do a nice really quick subtle eye today
we're gonna be taking the shade a
terracotta right here and we'll be going
in with C let's take our morphe m5 13
brush I'm gonna tap in there tap off the
excess and work this into my crease it's
kind of going to be our crease color and
our transition color I love the shade
Terra Cotta gonna work that up a little
more and I like that this palette has a
lot of cool tones and
lot of warm tones I'm taking it along my
lid as well I just think it's so so so
beautiful so gorgeous ballad I'll link
my review down below if you'd like to
see it okay I'm just working that into
my crease taking it on to the upper part
of my lid then I'm going to blend that
out with the shade pink dude again tap
that off and kind of work above the area
that we just did it's going in circular
motions then going in with the shade
Blanc I'm gonna take that right
underneath my brow for a little bit of
lightness and now I'm going to go
underneath my lower lash line with my
morphe m4 3-1 I'm going to take the
shade terracotta again we're gonna go
right underneath the lower lash line
very lightly just love this warm kind of
mustardy shade oh my god I almost just
poked my eye out lovely
all right and then I'm gonna go in with
the Urban Decay 24/7 blending brush I'm
gonna take again pink noon and we're
gonna blend that in underneath the lower
lash line love those two colors pick out
their the Terracotta and the pink nude I
think it's so pretty and fast and this
is what I've been wearing like all week
and then we are going to take this
little jump when asked a dual sided
brush here and I'm just going to tap
into the shade light gold and I'm gonna
put this onto my lid love the shade a
little bit on the inner corner of my eye
as well
and that is it for that quick little all
up now we are going to go in and put on
the Lancome what is this exactly you
know what wait a second let me go back
and just blend everything together
quickly with my Sigma e35 know how I
feel about blending so I'm always just
like oh just believe it but I mean hey
if we're doing a get ready with me I
might as well put in the effort right
just making sure everything is blended
and then we're taking the Lancome this
is the super enhancing a mascara base so
let me see if I can open this this is
what it looks like she's got little
fibers on it and you're going to put
that on our upper and lower lashes and
then we're gonna go in with these super
sizer fibers a mascara and we're just
gonna put one coat of that on our lashes
and I'm sorry we hear noise above us so
we live an apartment that has 20 no I'm
sorry we live in a building that has 30
floors and we're on the 20th floor and
ten floors above us like from 20 all the
way up to 30 is condos and then we're in
like the last set of apartments and
there's like people working on their
condo above us and they start working oh
and here's the covergirl super sizer
fibrous mascara they start working on it
and they're like doing their own like
like they hired people from the outside
to come in and like work on the weekends
and like there's all these drilling
sounds and whatnot and I know it's not
somebody like that has an apartment
building because again they have condos
above us but anyway my point is they
start working at like 7:00 a.m. and they
start like a drilling away and I'm like
what the hell yo like sometimes I'm not
even awake at 7:00 yet and they just
start drilling and it's so loud and
annoying so anyway if you hear anything
that's what they're doing and I swear
they've been working on this condo for
months now I've been hearing this sound
every single morning
for like four months that's crazy
but again they're allowed to do whatever
they want because it's not an apartment
up there alright so after we have done
one coat of the super sizer fibers we're
gonna let that sit for a second I'm
gonna going with our lip color I'll be
using the Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick
in the shade 450 Gentlemen Prefer pink
beautiful
just gonna hook that on our lips
I love this shade isn't that pretty and
now we are gonna go in with a little
q-tip and I'm just going to run and make
sure that I run this underneath and on
my leg to make sure I did not get any
little mascara crumbs because you guys
know me oh we get crumbs
they're always there and I just probably
those together alright guys so this is
love of the week it's been pretty
natural and like this week but I have
really been enjoying this makeup I love
that lorac whoa but I do really love
this lorac pro 3 palette I think it's so
beautiful like we used what three
eyeshadows and that look was so quick
and I feel like it looks put together
but um at the same time you know it's
like it's very casual obviously my brows
did not get done I'll go ahead and do
those now before I fill my fails and
holy grails
but yeah this was a look of the week
thank you so much for joining me guys
and I will see you tomorrow from fail
from Holly Brown and also I'm going to
