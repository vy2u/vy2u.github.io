happy saturday today I have a look at
the week for you guys which is why we're
up close and personal I'm still wearing
my pjs this robe is just so comfortable
I don't want to take it off Oh today we
will be featuring the new lorac pro 3
eyeshadow palette so I am going to put a
timestamp down below since this is look
of the week and i will be using all of
the items that i shopped and swatch my
stash with and we'll be putting on my
whole face of makeup with you guys but i
will timestamp if you would like to fast
forward to just the eye look so yeah
let's go ahead and get started i'm just
going to pull my hair back with my
little headband here and we're just
going to get right into it so the first
item i'm going to use is my face primer
and i will be using the becca backlight
priming filter and if you guys can see
the little mark here it's because this
is an item that is in my current project
pan so that is why I'm trying to do
little markings of where I am with the
product so I'm going to take three pumps
of this primer and I'm just going to
apply that all over my face well I just
wanted to say I know that like I've been
really bad with look of the week I'm the
queen of starting new um like new series
on my channel and just like not you know
going through with it I will be back
with music monday and i'm trying to make
this a consistent thing as well i think
it's because there's just been so many
new makeup products to review i just get
sidetracked and i forget about you know
the series that are like a consistent
thing on my channel so i apologize about
music monday and about look of the week
i am getting back to them it's just hard
when there's all these new products
releasing because of course i want to
review for you guys and things like that
and i don't remember but i think last
week or the week before i put up like
two or three reviews on what was it
saturday or monday which was supposed to
be shop and swatch my stash or it was
supposed to be um look of the week and
that's just because there were so many
new products so anyway after we have
done that we're going to go in with our
eye primer i'll be using the benefits
air patrol BB eyelid primer just going
to take the lid off I'm going to do one
little click and i'm going to apply this
to both sides of my
lids and then I'm just going to blend
that in with my finger and I'm going to
take any sort of excess that there might
be and I am just going to put that on my
under eye as well do you guys do that to
any time you have extra primer I just
kind of bring it underneath my eye and I
really like it with this particular
eyeshadow primer because this actually
has like color correcting sort of
pigments to it and it's very hydrating
so it's got that yellow tone so i
definitely don't mind bringing that
underneath my eyes dark circles are not
too bad today because I did sleep in but
they're pretty bad during the week
anyway how did you guys um how did you
guys did you guys have a good weekend as
what I'm trying to say multi-tasking yo
do you guys have a good weekend please
let me know down below I'd love to hear
from you guys alright next we are going
to use the Tasha luminous dewy skin mist
and I'm just gonna give this a good
shake and then I'm going to spray a few
pumps through this all over my face just
to give a little extra moisture and to
prime our face just a little more that's
what I've been doing with this product
lately I want to talk about this
tomorrow in the fails and holy grails
because I've already mentioned this as a
fail on the past couple of weeks I'm
really just trying to get through this
product and I find that when i use it as
like a setting spray it's just got too
much oil in it and it really just makes
my foundation break down everything in
my face just break down so I've been
using it kind of like after my primers
to go in and just add a little extra
moisture and then I like to just kind of
tap it in after so that it's not just
like sitting on top of my skin if that
makes sense I think this is a really
nice product if you do have dry skin but
if you don't have dry skin then like
don't even bother alright next I'm going
to go in with my L'Oreal Paris visible
lift Blair concealer in the shade 301
fair it's only a little bit left here so
I'm just need to take a little on the
back of my hand we're going to cover
these little areas where I have some
hormonal breakouts it is that time of
the month and oh my god there's like
barely any left in here but it is that
time of the month and I definitely do
have some stuff to cover so we're gonna
go ahead and do that so I'm going to be
taking this little tart to dual sided
brush right here let me take the shorter
side right here
and we are just going to put this right
on to the areas where I have those
little pimples we're just going to cover
them and then I will take the other side
to blend that out and I like to do this
before my foundation or I've been
wearing a tinted moisturizer this week
because um it does dry down even though
it looks like it's a good color match
address does dry down a little darker if
you guys can see like on my hand I like
it because it actually has a lot of
great tones in it it's kind of like a
color correcting concealer I'm going to
take the other side and just buff in
circular motions to blend that in so it
does have like a lot of great talents
but at the same time I do like it it's a
beautiful concealer this sits
beautifully underneath the eyes as well
if you want to use it that way alright
and then we're going to go in with our
foundation I've actually been using like
I said a tinted moisturizer this week
and the 1 i've been using is the bare
minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream with broad-spectrum
SPF 30 sunscreen and my shade is opal 0
1 i'm going to give this a good shake
because it does have sunscreen in there
and you don't want it to separate we're
going to take a nice little glob of that
on the back of our hand about that much
and then i'll be going in with this real
techniques what are you called sculpting
brush i actually like using this for
foundation it's very very dense and I so
I'm just going to dip in there and then
we're just going to start applying this
to the face and I kind of just use
swiping motions I don't find that I need
to like do circular motions that much
because this is such a light coverage
product it really doesn't put down a lot
of color or a lot of coverage at all it
truly is a tinted moisturizer maybe even
less than a tinted moisturizer but it is
in my project pan I do want to use it up
and it is the summertime now basically
and I do find that I don't like to deal
with really really heavy products on my
skin during the summertime so this is
like right up my alley for this time of
year so as you guys can see that really
didn't cover much but this is what I've
been doing all week and probably one of
the greatest week to like take this
product out because
I said do you have my period but okay
I've been going really really natural
with the face so it's all right we will
be going in with like a powder
foundation in a second but after I have
blended that in completely i'm going to
go ahead and highlight my face with my
benefit dandelion shy beam and i'm gonna
take this on you know my what is this
not the bridge in my notes down the
bridge of my nose on my Cupid's bow on
my chin and then in a little V shape
underneath my eyes and on my eyelids I
have to be careful with this because
like the little brush is so flimsy and
it kind of deposits too much product
down at once if that makes sense please
can I just open you why can't you just
open open there we go um so I'll show
you guys with a little wand looks like
it's like very very flimsy so I'm just
gonna put a little bit on to the chin as
you guys can see it codes on so streaky
because the little wand in here really
kind of sucks go a little bit like this
it's just such a little flimsy wand
that's okay anyway I'm not going to do
too much of a triangle I'm mostly just
going to take it where I do have a
little bit of excess blue tones and then
a little bit on my eyelids as well for
some color correcting and this is just
like a peachy highlight and I find that
like I really have been enjoying like
really glowing lately so I don't really
use that as a highlight so I like it for
kind of color correcting and concealing
so I'm just going back to that sculpting
brush and I am just blending this in
just doing stippling motions now because
it is so densely packed this brush it's
actually really good with like the
stippling motion I mean I don't get any
streaking I like this angle because you
can get right underneath the eye do you
guys have this brush what do you use it
for I know most people use it for
contouring like cream contouring but I
find that it's a little too drastic like
I like a nice subtle contour for the
most part and I find that this just
really packs the contour on there so
actually prefer for the foundation and
I'm trying to get away from using so
many little sponge bobs I am currently
out of Real Techniques sponges like both
of mine got dirty and I had to
them and I'm not laying myself by any
for maybe a couple more weeks because I
really want to use some of my brushes I
have so many brushes you guys gonna do a
brush collection video but yeah I need
to use them all right next we're going
to set in our face with the Loreal
infallible Pro matte 16 our powder and
my shade is the latest shade I'm going
to go in with my tart to air buffer
foundation brush I'm just going to swirl
into the product and then i am going to
sniffle this on to my face really
concentrating around my t zone where I
do tend to get oily throughout the day
as usual I just realized I forgot to
bring my spoolie out here so we're just
gonna pass on the Browse today because
the product I was going to use with my
brow drama but it does not look good
unless I take all my lashes out i knew i
was forgetting some sort of tool or
brush i was like what am I forgetting
it's just fully so I'm just setting my
patient and as you guys can see this is
a little dark on my skin tone kind of
annoying because it is the lightest
shade but anytime i am setting my face
in i like to use a powder that's either
lighter than my skin tone or just
completely transparent because then i
feel like i go in with like bronzer and
contour and everything just gets darker
and darker and because this is a little
dark on my skin tone i will be going in
with a powder foundation now this may
sound crazy like wow really taking that
face but again we're only wearing a
tinted moisturizer and this is a little
dark on the skin so i am just going in
and kind of lightly going over the areas
that need a little more coverage like
where I'm breaking out around my
cheekbones my nose especially and we're
just touching up with the tart
confidence creamy powder foundation in
fair neutral I do love this powder
foundation and honestly what you do have
um combo to oily skin like I do you can
never have enough powder girl really you
could never have enough powder all right
okay really red around my nostrils all
right next we are going to go ahead and
see here we are going to go in with our
blush and this week I've actually been
using bronzer as blush I've been using
my lorac take me to 10 t go palette so
this is what it looks like and I am
going to take this BH Cosmetics angled
blush brush it is dirty i apologize i
hate watching videos when people use
dirty brushes it really scares me i
don't know why anyway i will be using
this i'm going to go right into tan
antonino then i'm going to tap off the
excess and put this onto the apples of
my cheeks and I really been liking this
as like my blush this week because it's
so bronzy and kind of glowy and pretty
and I'll do anything to glow when you're
fair-skinned like I am your leg yes I
will do anything to have a tan I've been
using I'm self-tanning products the past
like week and a half and a lot of you
have been saying you love the way my
skin is looking so thank you for that I
really do like the way that the tan is
looking as well it definitely got a
little washed away last night it did
exfoliate my body in the shower but it's
okay alright so after we have done that
I'm going to go back in with the air
buffer foundation brush and just go over
to make sure we don't have any harsh
lines stippling over really quickly
alright next we got a skin hot with this
robot dating these lights are so bright
alright next I am going to go in and
take my josie maran argan enlightenment
in luminizing veil which looks like this
and i am going to go in with my lexy 522
tapered highlighter brush going to swirl
into the product and i'm going to put
this on my chin i'm going to take it
down the bridge of my nose little on my
Cupid's bow and then i'm going to buff
it in to my cheekbones
I love this highlighter it's definitely
a holy grail for tomorrow like I always
give you guys a little sneak peek of
what's a fail or holy grail for the week
in these videos alright next we are
going to go in with our eyeliner like I
said when I your brows because i forgot
my spoolie so they're gonna look a
little a little cranked up a little
weird but that's okay and i'm going to
go in with my eyeliner i'll be using the
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil in
the shade fate I'm gonna put this on my
waterline quickly and I know it always
looks like I'm blinding myself people
are like oh my god be careful with that
eyeliner can't help it just the way I
look when I'm putting it on all right
and now my fine just getting so freaking
hot I don't want to take this out so cuz
I'm just one mile of high caste alright
we are going to call our eyelashes for
10 seconds each 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 then I take a little
bit of this garden a scan active
micellar cleansing water and the
waterproof version I'm shake this up a
little bit take a she sado cotton round
and I'm going to wipe my lips down make
sure there's no foundation on there hey

of sink in there for a second then I'm
going to put on my blistex deep renewal
lip balm sting is lasting forever I have
the tiniest little bit left and I'm like

just going over my lips well we do our

really quick subtle I today we're going
to be taking the shade terracotta right
here and we'll be going in with see here
let's take our morphe and five thirteen
brush I'm going to tap in there tap off
the excess and work this into my crease
it's kind of going to be our crease
color and our transition color I love
the shade terracotta you know work that
up a little more and I like that this
palette has a lot of cool town
a lot of warm tones and taking it along
my lid as well I just think it's so so
so beautiful so gorgeous ballad I'll
link my review down below if you like to
see it again just working that into my
crease taking it on to the upper part of
my lid then I'm going to blend that out
with the shade pinky dude again tap that
off and kind of work above the area that
we just did going in circular motions
and going in with a shade Blanc I'm
going to take that right underneath my
brow for a little bit of lightness and
now i'm going to go underneath my lower
lash line with my morphe m43 1 i'm going
to take the shade terracotta again we're
going to go right underneath the lower
lash line very lightly just love this
warm kind of mustardy shade oh my god I
almost just poked my eye out lovely
alright and then I'm going to go in with
the Urban Decay 24-7 blending brush I'm
going to take again pink noon and we're
going to blend that in underneath the
lower lash line love those two colors
fig out there the Terracotta in the pink
nude I think it's so pretty and fast and
this is what I've been wearing like all
week and then we are going to take this
little Jeff when asked a dual sided
brush here and I'm just going to tap
into the shade light gold and I'm going
to put this onto my lid love the shade a
little bit on the inner corner of my eye
as well
and that is it for that quick little I
look now we are going to go in and put
on the Lancome what is this exactly you
know what ways I could let me go back
and just blend everything together
quickly it's my sigma e35 know how I
feel about blending so I'm always just
like I'll just leave it but I mean hey
if we're doing a get ready with me I
might as well put in the effort right
just making sure everything is blended
and then we're taking the Lancome this
is the super enhancing mascara base so
let me see if I can open this this is
what it looks like she's got little
fibers on it and you're going to put
that on our upper and lower lashes and
then we're going to go in with these
super-sized or fibers a mascara and
we're just going to put one coat of that
on our lashes and I'm sorry hear noise
above us so we live in an apartment that
has 20 no I'm sorry we live in a
building that has 30 floors and we're on
the 20th floor and 10 floors above us
like from 20 all the way up to 30 is
condos and then we're in like the last
set of apartments and there's like
people working on their condo above us
and they start working oh and here's the
cover girl super size of fibrous mascara
they start working on it and they're
like doing their own like like they
hired people from the outside to come in
and like work on the weekends and like
there's all these drilling sounds and
whatnot and I know it's not somebody
like that has an apartment building
because again they have condos above us
but anyway my point is they start
working at like 7am and they start like
drilling away and I'm like what the hell
yo like sometimes I'm not even awake at
seven yet and they just start drilling
and it's so loud and annoying so anyway
if you hear anything that's what they're
doing and I swear they've been working
on this condo for months now I've been
hearing this sound every single morning
for like four months it's crazy but
again they're a lot to do whatever they
want because it's not an apartment up
there all right so after we have done
one coat of the supersize or fibers
we're going to let that sit for a second
I'm gonna going with our lip color i'll
be using the revlon super lustrous
lipstick in the shade 450 gentlemen
prefer pink beautiful
just gonna hurt that on our lips
I love this shade isn't that pretty and
now we are going to go in with a little
q-tip and I'm just going to run and make
sure that i run this underneath on my
lid to make sure i did not get any
little mascara crumb because you guys
know me oh if your crumbs they're always
there and i just totally clump those
together alright guys so this is look of
the week it's been pretty natural and
like this week but i have really been
enjoying this makeup I love that would
rock whoa what was that but I do really
love this lorac pro 3 palette I think
it's so beautiful like we used what
three eyeshadows and that look was so
quick and I feel like it looks put
together but um at the same time you
know it's like it's very casual

go ahead and do those now before I fill
my fails and holy grails but yeah this
