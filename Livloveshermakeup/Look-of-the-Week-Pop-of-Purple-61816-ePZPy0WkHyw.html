welcome back to look of the week I have
all of my skincare on right now so if my
face looks a little oily that is why
don't worry it's washed but I do have
the josie maran argan oil on right now
anyway we are here to create a look of
the week and my favorite look for this
week has been using my NYX ultimate
shadow palette in the brights version
and I've been wearing a pop of color
underneath the lower lash line pretty
much every day but my favorite one has
been combining this purple with this
purple right here and that is what we
are going to do today I will include
what is it a time stamp yes sorry I will
include a time stamp down below where
you guys can fast forward to just the
eye look but yes since this is look of
the week we will be starting with the
whole face so let's go ahead and get
started
the first item I'm going to be using is
the Garnier 5 second blur skin renew
instant smoother as my face primer and
I'm almost out of this so I really need
to kind of shake it and get it out there
or even take about that much and we're
going to apply this to the face I'm so
excited that it is the weekend finally
guys I have not been getting a lot of
sleep this week I mean I feel like I say
that every week I really I really just
don't sleep ever um no but I really have
not been getting that much sleep this
week so I'm really excited to be able to
sleep in and just kind of rest and relax
and you know just have a good time have
a good weekend all right after we have
blended that in we're gonna go in with
our eyeshadow base and the one that I
will be using today is the elf eyeshadow
base let's see if I can open this
because that 1385 second blur has tons
and tons of open please
has tons and tons of silicone in it so
my hands are slippery there we go this
is the elf eyelid primer in the shade
shear this is just the $1 version and
I'm going to put this on to my eyes and
then any excess I will go ahead and take
underneath my eye as well because it
kind of adheres and makes sure that all
the shadows
and the concealer that you put on
underneath go on really nicely love this
eye primer I know a lot of people don't
but I personally do I think it works so
nicely I'm just tapping that in it's
such a beautiful day right now I'm
looking outside and I'm like oh so
gorgeous
what has the weather been like where you
guys are we've been having some storms
like at night like we'll get like these
big lightning storms but there's like no
rain or anything it's literally just
like lightning storms which is really
strange but there have been some really
beautiful day it's like during the
daytime it's beautiful in it nighttime
it's been storming but that's okay I'm
sleeping then so I don't mind all right
guys now we're going to go in with our
base I will be using these Smashbox
camera ready BB water drops in the shade
fair and I'm going to take one dropper
full of these and put it on the back of
my hand and then spread it onto my face
so one dropper full and I'm just gonna
take this product and I'm going to put
it on my skin first and then we're gonna
blend it in with a sigma 3d HD kabuki
brush and I have been really enjoying
this foundation this will be a Holy
Grail for tomorrow I always give you
guys a little sneak preview of an item
that will be a Holy Grail this is
definitely one of them and this may look
like I'm putting a lot of product on but
in reality you guys this blends like so
easily and it is a water foundation so
it gives very light coverage but I just
love the consistency of this I love the
way it makes my skin look hold on let me
just move my camera a little bit or no
I'm you're sorry I love the way it looks
on the skin it's just absolutely
beautiful so here is the 3d HD kabuki
brush from Sigma and we are just going
to go ahead and blend that in and it
doesn't give tons and tons of coverage
as you guys are probably seen right now
but it does have SPF 30 in it and I feel
like it is lighter on the skin than a
lot of BB cream so I personally really
really do like this and I have been so
into using really lightweight products
like this during the warmer months right
now and I'm really trying to do it like
use these
I know products because I always say oh
no I would only use that product during
the summertime and then I don't do it
and then I'm like really really girl so
anyway I am just a blending that in with
my Sigma brush taking it down my neck
where I still have some active breakouts
my skin has gotten a lot better this
week I have been well I'll talk about it
a little bit tomorrow what I have been
including back into my skincare routine
but last week it was really really
broken out and now I'm just left with
some scarring so that's unfortunate and
from me with my fair skin tone
unfortunately that scarring does stay
around for a little bit because they I'm
so fair it's very red and noticeable bye
it is what it is all right so I think I
have everything blended to my liking now
we're gonna go ahead and go in with our
concealer I will be using the Tarte
rainforest that they see aqua sealer in
the shade fair I'm gonna go ahead and
give that a good shake because it is
like a serum or what would you call it
water concealer so I'm just putting that
on the areas where I like to highlight
my face underneath my eyes on my eyelids
so such a fat little chunky brush you
guys see how big this is the applicator
it's like huge so it's nice because it
you know puts down and deposits a lot of
products like exactly where you want it
but at the same time it's like oh that's
a lot of product on my face but that's
okay because this is a very very
lightweight product so then I am going
to take my Real Techniques miracle
complexion sponge and I'm going to take
the pointed end and we are just going to
blend that in mine is damp and I've been
putting these little sponges like when I
use them in the morning I love really
invigorating things like I don't know
like cold water on my face in the
morning or like peppermints like face
washes or things like that so I've been
running this under really like ice-cold
water in the morning and I feel like
when I put it on my face to blend out my
concealer or whatever or during the day
it just feels so freakin good
like in the morning kind of wakes you up
a little more alright once I have
blended that in we are gonna go ahead
and set all of these products in since I
am an oily based
so I will be taking my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder and of course
my charts err buffer foundation brush
I'm just going to swirl in there and
then we are going to stipple this all
over our face to set everything in so
that it's not moving around I've had
some major issues lately with my
concealer and my foundation moving
around so it's really important that I
set them in really really well a lot of
you were saying like you get through
powder so quickly and I'm like yeah
that's because I need a lot of powder it
trust me it's not an impressive thing
that I get through powder so quickly
because I go through them so fast you
know it's like it's not hard for me what
I'm trying to say anyway I was going
through my empties Ben this morning and
we're only like halfway through the
month and it's already filled to the
frickin tippy-top you guys like to the
top and I was gonna try and organize
things so that I could have like handles
at the bottom of the bin and then I
could have I don't know like skin care
in the middle makeup at the top and they
have them all organized out like in
layers basically in the bin and then I
pick up the bin and it starts just like
mumbling everything up and jumbling them
up so so much for that but the candles
do remain at the bottom so I'm gonna try
and make my empties videos a little more
organized so as I'm going through them
I'm kind of like okay now we're gonna
move into skincare or what now we're
gonna talk about the candles I use that
for things like that or so I don't know
we're gonna try and do that but we'll
see how it goes but yeah my bin is like
completely overflowing already and I'm
like how is this possible it's like June
what like the right in the middle of
June it's just ridiculous
all right after we have done that we are
not going to go ahead and bronze our
face but first let me take a little
makeup remover wipe and kind of wipe
down on my hands cuz they're getting
dirty and my lips as well it's that
funny I'm looking in the mirror right
now and I see Cinderella going like
right in the reflection like judging me
you judging me yeah girl she doesn't
mean ah anyway oh I'm sorry I'm also
wearing this big chunky headband this is
what I wear when I do my makeup so I
figured I might as well just wear these
in my look of the
videos because I always try and pull out
like cute headbands to wear for you guys
but honestly they just don't pull my
hair back enough so I'm like oh whatever
let's just be real right okay what is
that what is that that's gross
alright guys oh my eye is already
watering a little bit over here just
ignore that
alright we're gonna go in with some
bronzer I'm gonna be taking the wet and
wild color icon bronzer with SPF 15 in
the shade 7:39 ticket to Brazil which
looks like this and I'm going to take my
large stippling brush from BH Cosmetics
I'm going to swirl into the product tap
it off and then we are going to just
kind of bronze up the forehead a little
bit it's just kind of messily and it
doesn't matter because we will be doing
the buffing technique in this video so
the blush and the bronzer don't have to
look flawless and then I'm gonna go
right here near my cheekbones underneath
my jaw line just kind of warming up of
the face a little bit and like I said we
are doing as the buffing technique so
everything will be best already to
perfection at the end and now we are
going to go ahead and take the Too Faced
love flush long-lasting 16 hour blush in
the shade baby love and I will be using
my what is this Lexi 504 large angled
brush I'm going to swirl into the
product actually I'm just going to kind
of tack the product cuz it's so
pigmented tap off the excess and put
that on to the apples of my cheeks I
love this shade it looks a lot more
peachy on my cheeks and I had a
subscriber asking me about that last
week they were like does this look
really peachy on your cheeks because
they were like it doesn't look so nude
on mine and I think if you do have fair
skin it does look a little more peachy
on the cheeks I will agree after I've
done that we're gonna go ahead and do
the buffing technique with Zee bye-bye
pores
translucent powder from it cosmetics and
I'm going to be take
this morphe flat-topped powder brush
right here
so i am just going to pick up some of
this loose powder and we are just going
to buff away of the skin and the thought
concept behind the buffing technique is
that after you have done like your blush
and your bronzer and everything you just
buff your face in with a translucent or
loose powder or me not a translucent yes
a translucent powder and it can be loose
or it can be pressed and when you do
that you're just blending the blush and
the bronzer together and it just looks a
lot more seamless and also if you do
have oily skin like I do or your combo
too oily like mean it really really
helps because it gives a little bit of
extra you know protection against your
makeup breaking down throughout the day
all right now we're going to go ahead
and go in with our highlight now if you
do want your highlight to look a little
less like in your face you can of course
put it on and then do the buffing
technique but I like a wham-bam
highlights let me fix my mirror again
sorry it's kind of going crazy
alright so we are going to go ahead and
take our regular baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade peach glow
which looks like this and I this is like
a baked shell a sort of formulation so I
do like to use some sort of a buffing
brush I guess you could say so this is
the lux II 512 small contouring brush
and I am just going to dip into this
product and then I'm really gonna kind
of buff it into my skin I am hitting the
points where I naturally would have
liked my highlight which is on my chin
down the bridge of my nose and my
cheekbones but I'm really kind of making
sure I buff it in so that it's not
looking you know too weird sometimes it
can sit on top of the skin
if you don't buff it in properly and
that's just with this particular
formulation it's different with like
powder formulations but the big delay
formulation I feel like you really do
have to kind of buff it in so I'm just
going in circular motions kind of
bringing it down to the apples of my
cheeks and blending in circular motions
and it looks so pretty when you do it
like that so that is why I feel like if
I just take like my Sigma tapered
highlighting brush or something and I
just like tap-in it and then do it it
just sits on top of the skin so if you
do have these and you're wondering why
it looks like it's sitting on top of the
skin try really buffing it in in
circular motions it works a lot better
all right after we have highlighted we
are going to go ahead and do our brows
so I will be using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills perfect brow pencil in the shade
taupe I'm going to use this side to
spoolie out my brows first oh my god I
just dropped a little cap of course oh
the beauty room is such a mess you guys
I really need to deep clean in here it's
really hard when you have like all white
everything because it gets so dusty you
know you can't really tell like but it
gets hard with like the jewelry tables
and things like that because you
basically know I'm using D obviously the
pencil side but what happens is that you
know it gets all dusty and it's hard
because you don't want to move
everything and have to clean it so you
dust around it but then your jewelry
starts to look gross so I just like to
use my little Swiffer dusters and try
and get in between everywhere that I can
alright so I'm just filling in little
areas that look slightly sparse to me
I've been losing like eyebrow hair this
week I don't know you know how sometimes
your eyebrows just kind of shed and it's
like really like why that's what's been
happening to me alright and then I am
just blending it out with the spoolie
side again and I'm not going to set my
eyebrows in with any sort of gel or wax
I haven't been doing that lately and I
kind of like the overgrown sort of not
perfect brow look I've never really been
into the super sharp dramatic brows it's
just not my style to each their own
all right and now let's go ahead and put
art now we won't put our lip product on
yet let's do I guess we'll go into our
shadows so what I want to do first is
actually curl my lashes I'll be using my
Revlon lash curler I'm just going to
curl them for 10 seconds 5 to 10 seconds
on each side kind of pumping the wands
like this and then we are gonna go in
with our two eyeshadow palettes that
we're both drugstore this week because
I'm really trying my best because I have
so many drugstore
so many high-end palates I'm really
trying my best to alternate each week so
next week I'll be using my peanut butter
and jelly palette it was time super
excited about but today we're going to
be taking the make up a revolution ultra
a professional eye shadow palette in the
flawless matte version which looks like
this just some gorgeous colors in there
we're going to take this lighter shade
down here with the BH Cosmetics fluffy
crease brush and I am just going to be
applying this all over my lid all the
way up to my brow bone and underneath my
eye as well and then we're gonna go in
with one of the many transition shades
in this palette and we are going to take
the same brush I guess I will take this
pinky color here today and I am just
going to take this into my crease and
onto my lid and we're not doing much lid
work at all because we're having that
pop of color and it still has to be work
appropriate for me and I can't do like
tons of color on the eyelid and then go
in with color on the lower lash line
because that's what I've been doing all
week it's just subtle in the crease and
then you know pop of color on the lower
lash line if I wanted to work with tons
and tons of colorfulness they might be
like okay you are a musician but that's
just a little too much color alright so
after we have done that I am going to go
in to the next bright scarlet this is
the ultimate eyeshadow palette inna
brights and does not just make you happy
looking at it
I'm just happy when I look at it it's so
pretty
and I am going to be taking it anymore
see let's see here what are you and four
three one brush I'll have everything
linked below I'm going to dip into that
dark purple shade and I'm sorry guys
none of these shadows have names so I
can't give you any names but I am just
putting this onto my lower lash line and
it can be a little messy but you do want
to keep it slightly precise because we
will be going in with another light
purple color underneath it so we don't
want it to be too crazy sometimes I just
take color and I throw it on my lower
lash line because I know I'm going to
blend it
but we're taking even more color so
we're just doing that on each side and
then we're gonna go in with our eyeliner
as well as loving some of the colorful
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils
this week but before we do that we are
going to go in with the Urban Decay 24/7
blending brush and I'm going to take the
light purple shade which is right here
it's like a beautiful lavender color I'm
going to go into that tap off the excess
and then blend this together on the
lower lash line so that we have sort of
like a nice pretty pop of purple
underneath that's not too in-your-face
or outrageous it's kind of subtle but
it's very very pretty right now we're
going to go in with our eyeliner but
first I'm going to take my Real
Techniques powder brush and just run
underneath because you can get a little
bit of fallout with these so now I'm
gonna take the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
from urban decay in the shade delirious
which is a purple and I am putting this
on to my waterline kind of building up
the color because they really do want
that purple to show through because it's
so pretty
who else loves the color purple let me
know your favorite color down below
alright moving on we are now going to go
ahead and go into our mascaras the first
mascara I will be using is the Smashbox
x-rated mascara volumizer I've been
enjoying this a lot this week I've been
having really clumpy lashes this week
and loving it so I'm just taking one
layer of this on to my lashes hold on
let me fix my mirror one more time so
I'm taking one layer of this on my
lashes and this is a really really wet
formula but I love wet formulations for
mascaras and it's okay if it gets a
little crazy on the actual lid we will
clean that up
so when layered this my only complaint
is that this wand is freaking huge you
guys and you can see that it's starting
to get everywhere it's like it's
Masey but I do like it I like it because
I like the formulation then we're going
to go in with the myths of manga Rock
mascara and we're going to put one layer
of that on as well and this is a really
really clumpy black wet formula and you
guys know I love this mascara so we are
doing it that and I like the word I like
the way that these two pair together I
actually think they look quite nice I
guess my only complaint is that they're
so wet and you know they really do kind
of they can get clumpy very very quickly
is what I'm trying to say all right now
we're gonna put our lip products on I'm
gonna let the little areas that I did
get some product let those dry down
first I'm not gonna try and wipe them
where at while they are wet so we're
gonna go in with the NYX soft matte lip
cream in the shade Istanbul I'm going to
apply this to my lips oh babe please
there we go
and then I'm gonna let that dry down and
then we are gonna top it off with a
mixed applause this is the mix of butter
gloss in the shade apple strudel I love
this shade you guys please open why why
me is that happen to you guys to where
your hands get all oily while you're
doing your makeup and then you can't
open that's what's happenin so this
is apple strudel which is a beautiful
kind of coral color and I am just
topping that matte lip cream with this
and I really like that color combination
right there I think that's a very very
very pretty
alright next we are gonna go back in
with that fluffy brush I just realized I
forgot my q-tips so we're gonna go back
in with the BH Cosmetics fluffy brush
and try and clean up those little areas
where we did get mascara blotches
because this is me this is my life and I
always get mascara blotches everywhere
you just want to make sure that you
don't do it a toughy dry down because if
you do it while they're still wet they
won't pick up and dust off easily
alright guys so that is pretty much it
this is a look of the week this has been
my go-to look I really like that pop of
color
on the lower lash line I think it's
really pretty without being overdone and
I really like the kind of clumpy pretty
lashes as well as that lip combo so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you for joining me and I will see you
guys next week four of my other loop of
the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
