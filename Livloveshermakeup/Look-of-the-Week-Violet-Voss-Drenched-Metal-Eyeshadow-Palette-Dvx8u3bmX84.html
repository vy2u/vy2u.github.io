channel I hope you were all having a
fantastic weekend so far my hair is so
greasy and dirty right now I'm just
gonna put it out there right away it is
so dirty I should have washed my
favorite last night but I didn't so I'm
sorry
I haven't even put dry shampoo in it
because they feel like there's no point
it's just a hot crazy mess um anybody in
today's video I have a look of the week
for you guys so I am doing like it get
ready with me video before you guys
putting on the makeup that I have been
wearing it this week and we are
featuring this little palette right here
this is the violet Boss Pro eyeshadow
drenched metal eyeshadow palette and I'm
going to go ahead and put a time stamp
in the description bar it will be the
first thing you see I'll put a little
time stamp if you just want to go ahead
and fast-forward to the actual eye look
but I will be doing my full face of
makeup with you guys using the products
that I shot my stash for this week and
then tomorrow in my files and hologram I
will see you will know if it was a well
good product for the week or a bad
product for the week so anyway let's go
ahead and just get right into it I'm
going to pull my hair off my face with
my little bow what is this my little bow
headband and love this thing got it from
forever 21 and we're just gonna start
and I am going to prime my face and then
my eyes so for my face primer I'm going
to be using my Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer and I am just going to
put this all over my face I put it
underneath my eyes on my eyelids
everywhere it just comes in like a
little cystic form like this and you
guys it's so cooling and it feels so
nice on the skin it's funny because oh
it's not fun when that little chunk
comes off but um make sure you don't
press too hard because I am pressing way
too hard right now um but what did I
want to say this product actually
released I think exactly like a year ago
like around May or June and like this
product first came out and I remember
getting it and it's just so nice so if
you do get those little clumps you can
just rub it in completely into the skin
if you press too hard like I do it will
start to flake off a little bit but it
doesn't matter it will all blend into
the skin
but anyway I really really enjoy that
primer that will definitely be a Holy
Grail for tomorrow because I think I
talked about that in my favorite primers
video I'm just obsessed with it
alright next we're gonna go ahead and
grab our eye primer and I will be using
my Maybelline master Prime long-lasting
eyeshadow base in the shade 510 is a 505
no 5 times and I'm just going to apply
this to my eyelids from the bottom part
of my eye all the way up to my brow if
you guys hear a noise outside I think
there's some sort of parade or something
going on because I hear people screaming
and it's a little too early for people
to be eating cheese and drinking beer
here so I think I think there is some
sort of a parade going on and I'm just
tapping this into my eye and taking any
sort of excess underneath my eye as well
and onto the inner corner of my eye I
just did my nails like last night and
for some reason they already started
just like falling apart and cracking and
looking like crap I swear to you I'm so
bad with my nails like I don't even know
why I have a nail polish collection
because I'm just so crappy at doing my
nails I need to start going and getting
gel manicures again I did that
throughout like well not throughout all
four years of college during pre-college
I did that during college I wasn't
actually allowed to wear nail polish
because it was distracting when I sneak
my flute my teacher didn't like that um
but when I was when I was in pre-college
I used to always get like a gel manicure
every week and loved it and I wish I
couldn't start doing that again I mean I
then I'm just lately I don't know like
on my day off the last thing I want to
do is go get my nails done I would
rather like go out for a walk or
something I don't know alright next
we're gonna go in with our base and I
will be using the covergirl plus ol a CC
cream tone rehab foundation in the shade
1:05 ivory and I'm taking two pumps of
that on the back of my hand or actually
on to the inner front of my hands back
of my hand this is a regular part of my
hand
and I am just blending this in oh my
gosh I hear like motorcycles outside and
stuff it's like way too early for this
shit I don't know what's going on anyway
I I'm just blending this in with my
fingers I'm taking it underneath my eyes
all over my face and I like to
personally just blend the CC cream with
my fingers I feel like it really melts
into the skin and looks the best like on
the skin when you to blend it in with
your fingers so I'm even taking it on my
eyelids just because it is color
correcting and I do like it quite a bit
and sorry if I keep looking into the
viewfinder I just want to make sure that
my life is the focus right so making
sure that is just completely blended I
find when I use this product was like a
Beauty Blender it just soaks up a lot of
the product and it's weird because it's
kind of like a Lucy consistency you
would think that that actually wouldn't
happen but it does so anyway you guys
know my favorite way of applying
products this was my Beauty Blender or
my Real Techniques sponge but not with
this product I really like this my thing
that I look like a ghost I'm looking
into the viewfinder right now like girl
looking good looking good alright next
I'm just gonna wipe off my hands and
wipe off my lips since I always do I
wanted those people I just take my face
products over my lips because I'm like I
don't want to just avoid that area is
just too much just too much work can't
be bothered
alright so I'm just gonna let that set a
little bit and then I'm gonna go in with
my concealer I'll be using my amazing
cosmetics hydrate concealer and my shade
is ivory yes
ivory I'm just going to take this
underneath my eyes a little bit where I
have some blue tones they're not too bad
today because it is Saturday and
although I'm filling this really early I
actually got a lot of sleep
I fell asleep really early last night so
I don't have too many balloon tones but
then I am going to take it and put it on
any little spots that I may have I've
had my period this week so there are
spots they are there and then I just
blend this in with my fingers as well
because it's so creamy and hydrating
and easy to just blend in so might as
well just take your fingers right so I'm
just tapping that in underneath my eyes
for a little extra brightness and
coverage and I really do like this
concealer it's very nice it doesn't give
like super super super full coverage or
anything like that but it sits
beautifully on the skin and sometimes I
just think when it comes to concealers
especially when you have them underneath
your eyes it's all about just having
like having that area look nice like I'd
rather have that area just look nice
than super super super like covered
because honestly sometimes like the
thicker the product the like older look
when you put it underneath your eye area
and the cakier it gets and you guys know
what I mean
like no matter how old you are you
struggle with that issue even when I was
18 and didn't have fine lines and
wrinkles if I would take out my under
eye area just look like crap so anyway
just blending that in with my fingers
and once that is completely blended I'm
going to set everything in with my
essence all about Mac's fixing compact
powder and I am just going to take my
let's see here
just gonna take my Tarte to ear buffer
foundation brush I'm gonna go into the
product and then just stipple this onto
my face starting around my eye area and
t-zone where I am the oiliness and just
kind of really concentrating a lot of
product in that area like stippling it
on not really like blending in circular
motions or anything really just stamping
the product onto my skin to make sure
that this is not budging throughout the
day because as the weather gets warmer
like my skin gets more and more oily
because I am combo skins so I just want
to make sure everything is set
especially because we are using that
kind of hydrating concealer as well my
kind of hair looks so dirty I have been
I I know I've been talking with a few of
you like on Instagram about my hair and
like why I've decided to go ahead and
cut it and all that kind of stuff and
it's so funny because I've been getting
a lot of emails of people being like
don't cut off too much because you might
regret it you guys I am the girl who
actually shaved my damn head
when I was a freshman in college so
don't even worry about it okay I have
dealt with like I'm not dealt with but
I've had super super short hair so
literally cutting it to my shoulders
it's like nothing
it literally means nothing to me like I
still feel like that's really relatively
long even if I were to cut it to my chin
and do a bob again I feel like that
would still be relatively long so don't
worry I'm not gonna feel like I made a
huge mistake because I have had all
sorts of color of hair and also all
sorts of length so I think for the past
like four to five years I've had pretty
relatively long hair and I'm just really
sick of it and I'm one of those people I
like change
I do like change when it comes to my
appearance when it comes to other things
I don't like change I'm just like no no
thank you
um but when it comes to my hair I
definitely like change and I just feel
like every like four to five years I
changed my hair up
so anyway I'm just gonna take this
little wipe and rub underneath because
the what is it karma girl clothes Soleil
CC cream it don't swim like a little
pink and when I take it down my neck
it's very very noticeable like
apparently like I'll paint the line
which I hate but anyway so yeah don't
worry about it if you guys are like oh
my god you're gonna hate it like cutting
into your shoulders or short or things
like that I have dealt with much shorter
hair literally like having an inch of
hair but cut straight up buzz cut so
don't even worry about it I am NOT
stressed out whatsoever about cutting it
I'm actually just a very very excited
alright moving on I'm going to put on
this blush from the balm this is the hot
mama blush and this is what it looks
like and I'm going to be taking this bra
of blush with this brush this bra I'm
gonna be taking this blush with this
brush that this is the Lexi 504 large
angled brush and everything will be
linked below in the description bar all
the brushes I'm using and all the tools
and the products of course but anyway I
have been loving it these Luxy brushes
that I have been getting in my
subscription boxes like I think I got
this one
my boxycharm at the highlighter brush I
got like in my Ipsy bag they have been
like on a roll as far as like I don't
know the Lexi brand just in general has
been on a roll as far as like reaching
out and collaborating with subscription
boxes and you guys know I'm subscribed
to like every single subscription box
cause my body's marks each arm
everything so I think getting all of
these brushes and I have been loving
that like absolutely loving them I think
I talked about them a little bit in my
fails in Holy Grails but if I did like a
monthly favorites video these brushes
would be in there they're really really
nice quality so anyway I'm just taking
this and kind of putting it on to the
apples of my cheeks it has a nice little
amount of Sheen to it so I'm kind of
just putting it over here to like up on
my cheek bone all right moving on I'm
gonna go back in with that tarts brush
really quickly and just kind of stipple
over to make sure there are no harsh
lines because I tend to be a little
heavy-handed with my blush and I don't
want it to be like china doll status
where it's just like boom color all
right now with that Lexy brush I was
talking about this is the 522 tapered
highlighter this is like perfect it
reminds me of the Sigma one but it's a
little more fluffy and I'm going to take
my hourglass ambient strobe lighting
powder in the shade brilliant which is
just a very pretty sort of golden color
and I'm just going to tap into this put
this on my chin of course on my Cupid's
bow down the bridge of my nose and also
on my cheekbones and I'm just doing one
even layer this is the kind of highlight
that you really can build up if you want
to but I have just been liking it really
really nice and subtle this week it's
just this is like one of the prettiest
highlighters that were honestly so
anyway I'm just putting that on to my
cheekbones it kind of on to the apples
of my cheeks as well that's another
thing I like about this brush it is very
fluffy so if you just want like right on
your cheek bone you might not like this
because it is it's not really dense but
it just it poof's out everywhere so it
really kind of takes up a lot of space
but I like my highlight to kind of go
down here onto the apple of my cheeks so
when I'm smiling you can see it and then
all the way up to my cheek bones so
love that all right moving on let's go
ahead and do our brows quickly I'm gonna
take the Maybelline brow drama cram
pomade I believe this is the lightest
color it's a called taupe or blonde or
something and I am just filling in the
front of my brows right here and you
have to be really careful with this damn
crayon because it is like super super
pigmented I mean any sort of pomade
thing is and I basically put that on and
then I split it out so that it obviously
looks a little more natural I've never
been a fan of the super super defined
brows I like really thick brows but not
for them to be super super crazy like
sharp-looking and I just feel like it
doesn't work on my face honestly
which is why I've never been a huge fan
of like pomades but I really like this
one because once you comb it through it
actually looks relatively natural so and
that's all I've been doing to my brows
this week now we are gonna go ahead and
what shall we do I wanna boy stur eyes
my lips so that they're ready for the
lip surgence I'm gonna put on it so I'm
taking my blistex anti-aging treatment
deep renewal lip protectant sunscreen
I'm almost out of this shall we make a
bet to see if I can get this into my Mei
empties video do you guys think I can do
it it has like maybe half an inch of
product left there I go through so many
lip balms honestly but I was hoping I
could make this into the empties video
for the buns I don't know though if I'll
be able to do it it seems like a little
goes a long way and by the way that
empties video will be up on I think
Wednesday yeah I'm pretty sure it's
Wednesday alright so next let's go ahead
and start fussing around with their eyes
a little bit I'm gonna put on my
eyeliner first I'm gonna be taking the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
the shade roche and I was joking around
with one of my subscribers the other day
about this she was like did you just say
that the name of that product is Roche
and I always like yeah it is and she was
like that is like so weird and I feel
like this color is actually kind of
similar to that of a cockroach so that
makes me feel even more incredibly like
insecure about holding this eyeliner and
and I mean it's just such a gross name
like Roach really I don't like that but
I feel like urban decay is really out
there with all of their names so it is
what it is so anyway I'm just putting
that right onto my waterline I'm not
going to tightline I'm just doing it on
my waterline and then I am going to go
ahead and it's on my finger I am going
to go ahead and missing something but I
guess we're not we're just going to ice
so I'm going to be taking this fluffy
crease brush from BH Cosmetics to talk
about this all the time you see it in
pretty much every tutorial and we're
gonna go into the viola bus drench
Meadows palette so we're going to be
taking this matte color right here
called secret which is like the perfect
transition shade and we're just gonna be
working this into the crease so that we
have a nice base or transition color I
think the only thing that's really
missing in this particular palette is
like a matte brow bone color or just
like an all-over lid color that helps
with blending but I think it doesn't
really matter because when they have a
nice transition shade like this this is
gonna help with the blending process and
also on top of that these are so creamy
and like foiled and just amazing to
blend out so it really doesn't matter in
the long run you don't really need like
a base color but sometimes you know it's
nice and palettes do offer like a back
to brow bone color just so that it's
easier to blend it out alright moving on
we are going to go right into the morphe
and 513 brush and I am going to be
taking the shade in here called huntress
which is this deep kind of cool toned
warm toned Brown it's like a mixture
it's perfect
and I'm just gonna take this right into
the crease and back and forth emotions
wouldn't shield wiper wiper motions
whatever they say and I'm just going
back and forth back and forth I love
this color it's so beautiful what's that
beautiful all right doing that on the
other eye as well where's my tea did I
bring my tea now
I think I forgot my teeth you guys I
have a tea I'm gonna talk about tomorrow
my thousand Hamid is and it is so good
they're the Skinnygirl cake cops I think
it's like the what's-her-name
like Bethany or something she's like
somebody who was on like the Real
Housewives of New York or something she
like invented the line and they have
these little like cake cups that are
teas that are all-natural that are going
with us
okay BH Cosmetics just the fluffy crease
brush again going back and forth to
blend hunters out in the crease anyway
I'm drinking the mojito mint one right
now I forgot to bring it in here you
guys it's so good it's so good it's so
good seriously love it alright just
blending it back and forth back and
forth back and forth back and forth and
then I am going to be taking C here I'm
gonna take this little morphe brush
right here it doesn't actually have a
number on it it's just a flat little
brush that you can do like lid work with
but I'm actually going to take the shade
forbidden down here and I'm gonna put
this on my lower lash line so just
stifling into the product there and then
we're just going to run this onto the
lower lash line I really like this like
warm berry color like yes it's giving me
life oh it looks so strong just all out
of minutes we'll go ahead and blend that
out but I love this color I love it it's
very pretty in the outer V as well if
you want to do the outer V very very
pretty I like these colors together
hunters forbidden and live in I'm gonna
put living on my lid in a second and
then we're gonna go in with the Sonia
Kashuk 1/16 brush and I'm just going to
take this and blend that lower lash line
so that it doesn't just look like a hot
mess and a hot line just a stark line
right on lower lash line so just going
back and forth and then I'm going to
take that shade live in I'm gonna put
that on to my finger and I'm just going
to tap this onto my lid I just love this
color is so beautiful it's like a burnt
sort of orange color I love it
I'm all about that life
just putting that right onto the lid
then I'm going to take this shade right
here called kisses and just onto my
finger again I'm gonna put that on the
inner corner oh so beautiful these are
so freaking boy I look like they're
gorgeous gorgeous all right and then I'm
gonna go ahead and take my fluffy crease
brush again and just blend everything
making sure there's no super SuperDuper
T harsh lines look at that shade living
isn't that beautiful like yes I'm all
about it I'm all about it I'm gonna take
a little more of that actually I wanna
make sure it's really showing up pretty
oh I feel like this warm I look doesn't
really match my doesn't really ranch my
shirt today but that's okay that's okay
it's okay all right and then one more
time actually I'm gonna take a sigma e35
brush whoa what was that was that my
hand that's the color of my hand
it looked so red what's the hug alright
and then I'm gonna go back into the
shade secret again and I am going to
actually put this right above where I
put the shade huntress and I'm just
gonna go back and forth for a little
added warmth not that there's not enough
warmth in this look already but come on
the warmer the better right back into
the fluffy crease brush back and forth
motions circular motions and then I'm
going to dip into the lighter shade in
here which is called poppin I'm gonna
take that and I'm going to put that
underneath my brow I do you like this
shade it's got a little bit of like a
duochrome to it so when you tilt your
head it actually turns like a different
color it's pretty cool
you kind of want living and huntress to
blend together so yeah alright let's go
ahead and I'm gonna take my Samantha
Chapman or Real Techniques
they both make these right now this
one's just by Samantha Chapman I guess
anyway my Real Techniques powder brush
I'm just taking any sort of you know
color that fell out and you sort of fall
out and I'm just wiping that away and
then how I feel like I totally how I go
pretty far haha it's really early in the
morning when I'm filming this so I'm
sorry if I'm super low energy alright
I'm just gonna curl my lashes for 10
seconds on each side with my Revlon lash
curler and then I am going to go ahead
and put my mascaras on and I have been
of course layering mascara this week as
always and the first one look at the
packaging I talked about it in my shop
and squash my stash but I love that this
is the Physicians Formula sexy booster
cat eye collection mascara in the shade
black and I'm just putting one layer of
this on my eyes and being really careful
cuz this wand is gigantic as you know
what it is so big like I literally said
like oh my god and I'm like a very
fast-moving person as you guys probably
know like a very impatient and just fast
and sometimes I literally get this into
my eyeball okay right into the eyeball
and then I am going to go ahead and
layer on top of that see another huge
brush which I'll probably poke an eye
out with look at this thing oh my god
looks like a medieval torture tool this
is the extra life sculpting mascara in
black onyx from Laura Mercier and I'm
just putting a layer of this on top and
I love this mascara it really does
sculpt the lashes and it really clumps
them up real good so if you do like
those clumpy lashes you'll love this if
you hate clumpy lashes do not get this
do not get this get the Physicians
Formula one that's a great base mascara
and I asked you guys if you wanted to
see a video on like mascara pairings and
a lot of you said yes so that video is
coming soon
by the way I said on Instagram I was
talking about how I have video ideas
written out until the end of summer
literally I just want you guys to know
when you give me video ideas and if I
respond to you and say I put it on my
list it's on my damn list and I cannot
believe that I have so many ideas all
the way through the end of summer so I
have all my video ideas written out it's
crazy alright and now we're just gonna
finish off this look with the tarte
wonder at lip surgence lip creme this is
what it looks like so beautiful it's
like a hot coral shade and I'm just
putting this right onto my lips and I
like the way that this pairs with the
eye look cause it's all just warmth you
know uh-huh gotta love that warmth right
alright guys so that is pretty much it
let me make sure I don't get any
lipstick on my teeth but this is the
look of the week I hope you guys enjoyed
it if you have been watching my channel
this week then you know I've been
playing with lots of different eye looks
with that by Lovaas palette but today I
thought I would just do kind of a warm
look I really like the way that this
looks it's just a very kind of smoky and
warm and it doesn't require tons and
tons of blending which you guys know and
he doing I just hate doing I feel like
I'm the only like um totally like beauty
channel who's like oh if I just hate
blending everybody's like blend blend
blend and I'm like I don't want to blend
um anyway this is the look of the week I
absolutely love this about vos palette

see you tomorrow from a files of
colorado's and we will talk about if
