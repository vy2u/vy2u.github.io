video is going to be the long awaited
review and swatches on the new at lorac
mega pro 3 palette it's actually perfect
timing that I am getting this up today
instead of one I got it about a week and
a half ago because today it is available
to everyone and currently when I add
this into my bag right now on Sunday at
1:39 p.m. it still is available so
anyway this is new it is exclusive to
Ulta and it is a $59 palette I wouldn't
recommend going ahead and jumping on
this right after seeing this video and
live swatches if you are interested
because these palettes do sell out hella
quick so anyway like I said it was $59
this is a limited edition Pro artistry
palettes that is packed with 32
eyeshadows in all matte in shimmer
shades you need to create the hottest
look straight from Hollywood so anyway
here is the outer packaging for the
lorac of mega pro 3 this year really
really nice I love what they did with
the packaging it's not super super
amazing because of like the color but
overall I think it's really cute what
they did I'm gonna show you guys the
color in a second it's a white palette
which I feel like it's gonna get so so
so dirty but I do like what they did
this year they did it do some new kind
of packaging and I think it's really
really nice so that's the outer box and
then here is the actual palette so when
you look at it it's just like oh my god
this is like my aesthetic like I love
this you have rose gold and also whites
but honestly this thing is gonna get so
so so dirty but let's be honest I feel
like all of my lorac palettes the pro
formulation they have this kind of like
weird texture going on here I feel like
they all get dirty no matter what the
color so it's not so much the color is
probably more just the actual
consistency like of the packaging but
overall I would say that this is
definitely going to get very very dirty
but in the meantime it's still nice and
crisp and white and beautiful so they
lorac mega Pro 3 has the same exact
packaging as last year's mega Pro which
was the lorac mega pro 2 I do not have
the lorac mega pro 1 to share with you
guys I was not able to get my hands on
that unfortunately but I really do love
the lorac pro formulation I do have the
lorac pro 3 and the lorac Pro just the
original one and then obviously the mega
pro 2 so same exact packaging very very
nice and sleek these are great for
travel in my opinion and this year
like the pilot is a lot more sturdy
which is awesome so you do open it up
you have a nice sized mirror and you can
bend this back you don't have to I
personally do because I like to prop
this up I do feel like it pops up quite
nicely but I feel like the spine is a
lot thicker this year and it's a lot
easier to work with so here are all of
these shades that you are getting you
are getting a nice selection of matte
shades and ask those shimmer shades and
overall I'm just going to give you guys
a quick little rundown very quickly
obviously quick click look like but
overall I think this is a beautiful
palette if you are interested in the
colors I would jump on it for $59 you
are getting a nice amount of product in
here I personally love the lorac Pro
formulation if you are new to the
formulation it is absolutely the most
insane buttery blendable gorgeous
formulation you will ever tip your
finger in orange or brush they go on to
the eyes absolutely stunning
like beautiful just stunning they look
stunning when they're on the eyes if you
are someone who doesn't like to spend a
lot of time blending and you just can't
 be bothered like me most of the
time the lorac Pro formulation is
absolutely something that you need in
your collection now you don't
necessarily have to have this particular
palette I do feel like there are color
similarities with the other two little
lorac Pro palette but I would say this
is quite different than last year's mega
Pro I do still prefer at last year's
mega pearl because it had a lot of cool
undertones in there just a lot of cool
tones in general and I am someone who
does have a fair complexion with a cool
undertone so I still do prefer last
year's palette I know a lot of people
actually didn't like last year's palette
and probably the odd one out when I say
that that I really like it
but then again I'm the odd one out a lot
of the time I prefer like you know with
the chocolate bar palette I don't even
like the original one I like the
semi-sweet so I feel like I'm kind of
just like all over the place I never
really fit in with the crowd on which
one people like the most but I would say
that I still do prefer my mega Pro from
last year if you are someone who pulls a
very strong like warm undertone you're
really gonna love the mega Pro 3 because
there are some gorgeous gorgeous warm
tones in here and for the most part even
though there are some cooler tones on
this side for the most part they are the
majority of them are warm toned if you
love those like you know cinnamon apple
gorgeous a pumpkin spice sort of
cranberry tones
gonna be the pallet for you it doesn't
go as red and as pink as say like at the
modern Renaissance palette or even the
Holy Grail palette from violet boss but
overall these are really nice and
neutral warm tones and I do think it's
beautiful
there are definitely some color
similarities I would not say that it's
that similar to last year's mega Pro
which again I feel like this one was
very very unique here are the two of
them side by side if you guys are
curious definitely more cool tones here
I liked this one better because you do
get more pops of color if you have last
year's do you need this year's I don't
think so I think this one is a lot more
unique and special but if you do have a
warm undertone and you really do like
these colors then yeah you should pick
it up now as far as comparing it to
these little guys are concerned I don't
feel like it's super super comparable to
the lorac Pro 3 now you may look at it
and be like are you serious Olivia it
looks like identical but I really don't
feel like it is I feel like some of the
shades towards at the top of this like
the matte shades at the top of this do
you kind of line up with some of the
warmer shades over here but for the most
part I actually think the most
similarities that I personally see are
with the original lorac Pro palette so
if you do have this little guy right
here which is the original lorac Pro I
don't think it's absolutely necessary
for you to pick up this mega Pro 3 I do
think that there are some really similar
shades here you are getting some of
those nicer like darker tones over here
you are getting some of those gold and
warmer tones underneath as well and then
you are getting a huge arrangement of
nice transition shades and also some
nice like brow bone shades which I feel
like this palette has as well so I just
wanted to say that really quickly I feel
like if you do have the original lorac
Pro palette I don't think it's
absolutely necessary for you to pick up
at the mega Pro 3 but it's still a
really nice palette to have and
obviously you are getting more shades
and more shadows in here but still to
this day I feel like a lot of people
love this particular palette because you
have everything in here that you
couldn't need so overall comparing it to
in the mega Pro from last year I still
prefer the mega Pro from last year I
like the pops of color in here I like
the overall shade selection and I do
like the undertone in there but this is
still a really beautiful palette this
year I absolutely adore it as the
formulation is exactly what you would
expect from a lorac Pro formulation and
it's very buttery and very very smooth
very creamy very blendable and overall
just a really nice pallet so let's go
ahead and start to so watching that we
are going to start over here at the
first shade that we have is called pink
cream and this is what pink cream looks
like it is a matte and there is pink
cream swatched on the back of my hand
very very beautiful I mean actually that
we have here is called tan and tan is
another maps and it basically is just a
really nice transition tan kind of color
there is tan alright so then actually
that we have is called pecan pecan has a
little more of a cooler undertone than
tan and I would say it's about a step
darker so there is pecan alright so the
next shade that we have is wallet and
walnuts definitely a little more of a
warm toned brown shade kinda reminds me
of the cognac shade with a cognac or no
burlap or something from a last year's
palette but there is the shade right
there and if you guys didn't know the
lorac Pro formulation I swear to you the
mats are like creamier and butter like
more buttery than their shimmer shades
which is ridiculous like I don't know
how they do it this way this formulation
is the bomb alright so the next thing
that we have is called dusty mom and
this is what it looks like it's a nice
transition shade as well and it is a
little more on the pinky or purpley side
so there is dusty mauve sorry that one
didn't really come off very well
dusty mob is beautiful I really like
that as someone with a cool undertone I
think it's beautiful then we have violet
gray which again is kind of like a step
darker than that shade and it is also a
matte there it is the next shade that we
have is eggplant and eggplant is really
beautiful it's got more of a purpley red
undertone and I will say with these
matte shades if you are not like
familiar with the part this particular
formulation they do have quite a bit of
kick up but it is because they are so
soft and buttery there is eggplant
really really beautiful shade let me get
to that bottom swatch off completely so
that we can do one more and then the
last shade in the top row is called dark
navy and dark navy is just exactly what
it says it is a dark navy color it has
maybe a little more of a purpley
undertone than Abel
ich undertone and there is dark navy so
that is the first row next will will
build new this next Lily moving on to in
the second row and the second row starts
with the shade called CREP I love this
shade it's so beautiful really nice to
have all over the entire lid so we're
going to do with the second row first so
we have crip then we have toffee and
then we have missed so here is CREP here
is toffee and here is missed CREP is
definitely a really nice just creamy
color toffee is another matte shade and
it is very very beautiful I like it a
lot it has definitely a little more of a
warmer undertone and then we have the
shade of mist which is a silver so there
is CREP there is toffee and then there
is mist very very pretty the next shade
that we have is called vintage and
vintage definitely has more of a topi
cool undertone and it is a matte so
there is vintage and here is a vintage
swatched really really beautiful right
there again a really really nice
transition color very very perfect we
have the Hickory shade which is also
really gorgeous it is a cool toned brown
shade here is Hickory it's super super
pretty and then we have a maple which is
a little more a warm toned I love the
shade and I love the names of this
valance they're very like fall related
in my opinion so there is maple and then
we have bark and also jet-black bark
definitely has more of a cool undertone
and then jet black is obviously a jet
black so there is bark and then there is
jet black Jeff black has a little bit of
patchiness but it's nothing crazy I feel
like they probably do the best black out
of any black I feel like a lot of the
times with black eyeshadows they are
super super grayish like I have like a
gray undertone or something like that
and I really like this palette because I
feel like it is a true black color
alright moving on to the third row we
are now going to go into this one down
here so we have this row right here and
we are getting into some of these
shimmer shades which again the shimmers
are just a soft and buttery as
which i think is amazing I feel like no
other brand can really put together a
formulation where the mattes are just as
soft as the shimmers and just as
blendable so the first shape that we
have here is called snow and it is a
beautiful opalescent cool toned white
color here is snow very beautiful I'm
sorry these are kind of staining my
hands then we have the shade kava and
calm eyes really gorgeous it's kind of
like a champagne e color very very
pretty again with that shimmer finish
not as opaque as some of the other
shimmer shades in here but still pretty
good then we have cider which is one of
my favorite colors it's a beautiful warm
toned brown shade and it's just got a
whole lot of pigment it goes on like a
foiled shadow absolutely beautiful there
is cider and then the last one we have
in this Row is Bellini and Bellini feels
a little more crispy to the touch in my
opinion I feel like once in a while with
this pro formulation you do get a shadow
or two that maybe it's a little more
chunky or doesn't feel as soft and
buttery but for the most part they're
still really beautiful
alright the next sheet that we have is
called a brown sugar let me really rub
this down so I can get all of those
little a little aftermath off I feel
like they sometimes stain the hand so
really really get it off alright there
we go alright so the next day we have is
brown sugar which again is a really nice
warm toned brown shade very very buttery
and smooth very gorgeous then we have
Sequoia and that is another gorgeous
kind of reddish brown color you know
these two together you guys I die I die
look at this yes so this one right here
like I said is brown sugar yes brown
sugar and then Sequoia look at that oh
yes love the next two shades are a
glacier and then we have deep fog and
then we'll move on to the last row so
here is glacier which is kind of similar
to mist and then we do have deep fog I
don't know why they put like these two
really silvery colors in here I don't
feel like people tend to reach that
often for silver eyeshadows but I could
be wrong maybe it's just me so there are
those two shades but yes I do feel like
this shade right here is kind of similar
to mist and I don't think either of them
are that pigmented and creamy I just
wanted to put that out there
moving on to the last row we are going
to start with a matinee
yes too late and then end with licorice
so here is Thule and here is licorice
again licorice is kind of similar to
that a jet-black shade it does have a
little more purple in it and it is a
shimmer finish but I just wanted to put
that out there so today is a really nice
beautiful cool toned iridescent sort of
pinky color I really do like the shade
very very beautiful there is true lay
and then the next shade that we have is
called pink bronze and this one again
it's very very pretty kind of similar to
cider but has a little more of a pinky
undertone there it is
next we have the shade let's see here
rust and rust is really gorgeous reminds
me a little bit of Sequoia but a hat
definitely has more warm undertones in
it definitely a little more orangie
orangie reddish shades there it is and
then we also have a rose quartz which is
beautiful I feel like everything has
been named rose guards lately this is
absolutely gorgeous I love this shade it
definitely has more of like a topi
undertone but still really gorgeous on
the lid look look at the shine on that
yeah yes girl
alright and then moving on we have let's
see here olive and olive is really nice
I like the shade because it's different
it's just a really nice all Ivy green
color but it does have a little more of
a brown undertone and then we also have
dark roast so here is all Evan here is
dark roast love that olive shade there
is olive there is dark roast and then
the last three shades we have or I'm
sorry the last two shades we have our
pomegranate and also licorice
pomegranate is just that pure gorgeous
kind of Reddy color and then we have
licorice which again is that black shade
but it has a little more of a purple
undertone I really don't like when a
black shade has like a strong like ashy
undertone so I probably won't reach for
this one that often but it does make for
a really nice liner shade so they're
they are really gorgeous colors again if
you were someone who loves those really
nice like fall kind of colors I think
you would love this palette if you have
a little more of a warmer undertone that
pomegranate shade is a little more
disappointing and then I thought it
would be I honestly thought
quite good that's not wrong but you
don't even I feel like I really thought
it was going to be a good one and I feel
like it is a little more on the shear
side but overall really gorgeous colors
nice warm tones I don't have too much to
say if these are the kind of colors that
you enjoy then yeah I feel like you
should pick this up I feel like you
would like it and can you guys see how
dirty this is getting just from
squatching yeah that packaging no but
overall I think it's a beautiful palette
if you like things Rock pro formulation
and you like these colors go ahead and
pick it up if you are not that
interested in these colors and you do
have the original of the rock or the
lorac uhm you know Becca Pro - I would
just stick with that one I do prefer my
lorac mega Pro - but overall still a
really nice palette so thank you so much

a lot longer than I thought it would but
I still want to do live swatches for you
