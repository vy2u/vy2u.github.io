this video I have a quick little review
and swatches for you guys on the new
lorac pro 3 palette I was able to get
this early as an Ulta platinum member
the other day and of course I payed for
fastest shipping most people got theirs
yesterday I actually got my the day
before I think you have good luck with
shipping so that is when mine showed up
so if you are wondering my mind looks a
little worn down and kind of used it's
because well I have been using it for a
few days now so anyway this is the new
palette this is $44 on the altar calm
website and will be available for
everyone to purchase on June 12th online
and in stores on June 26 on the all
TOCOM website it does say go pro with
lorac pro palette 3 it says the third
edition tula rocks original best-selling
pro palette this pro artistry palette is
packed with eight shimmer and eight
matte eyeshadows in all the soft and
feminine shades you need to recreate the
hottest look straight from the red
carpet it says lorac the velvety smooth
shadows are infused with soothing
botanicals and are ultra pigment to to
perform wet or dry so you can use to
shade shadow line and define your eyes
it's just like a pro and the shades that
you get in here are Blanc canvas quill
taupe pink nude clay terracotta dark
brown and jet black on the top row and
the bottom row has light gold almond
pearl medallion light pewter amethyst
rose Bron rose bronze dark mocha and
truffle so anyway here is the actual
packaging as you guys know if you are
familiar with the lorac palette in
general their pro palettes definitely
have this sort of like packaging to them
here I have the original Pro palette and
then this is the mega pro 2 palette they
all just have this really sleek
streamlined packaging that I'm a huge
fan of because it makes them really easy
to store and on top of that it makes
them really really easy to travel with
which I love doing so I really love the
color on this is just a beautiful sort
of peachy nude color and you open it up
you do have a little mirror here and
then here are your eyeshadows so you get
eight matte eyeshadows on the top and
eight shimmer shadows on the bottom one
of them does have
bit of a chunky grit to it and the shade
is called medallion I tried putting that
on my lid today and I was just not happy
happening I was getting a lot of like
Fallout and I decided to go in with
light pewter instead so if you guys are
curious I threw together this I look in
like two minutes today and what I used
was terracotta as my transition shade
then I went even with dark mocha in my
crease and then I I started with
medallion all over my lid it was really
gritty and gross it's probably the worst
I shadow in this palette the only bad I
shadow so I decided to go in with light
pewter all over my eyelid so really
really fast little look that I created I
also put a little bit of dark mocha on
my lower lash line this is just such a
wonderful beautiful beautiful palette I
already love the lorac Pro formula I
honestly think it's one of the best
eyeshadow formulations that you can get
on the market here is the original the
lorac Pro like the first edition I do
not actually have the lorac pro 2 it
never really interested me which is
interesting because it does have really
really nice cool tones in it and I do
have a cool undertone but I just never
picked it up I probably will eventually
and then of course here is the lorac
mega Pro 2 which is also beautiful I
just think the lorac Pro formulation is
just like I said one of the best on the
market it is so creamy and buttery and
smooth and just a beautiful blendable
everything that you could want in an
eyeshadow you can get in the lorac Pro
formula so I have to say the reason why
this review is not going to be too long
is just because it's the same exact
formula as I'm used to when it comes to
the pro formula it's absolutely stunning
I think the matte shadows in here are
just to die for absolutely to die for
the mattes feel just as creamy and
blendable and gorgeous as the shimmer
shades do and I feel like you can't say
that with a lot of eyeshadow palettes
sometimes you get those really beautiful
sort of foiled eyeshadows that go on so
nicely and then the mattes are just kind
of chalky and gross that never happens
with the lorac Pro formula so I just
have to say overall these are absolutely
outstanding inside of the actual
packaging you do get a little tiny wrap
behind the scenes eye primer I
like this eye primer I've gone through a
few of the little sizes and also a large
size I'm wearing this one today with the
eyeshadows I personally think that these
eyeshadows perform really really nicely
with any sort of eye primer I've tried
them with my Maybelline eye primer also
my ELF eye primer and like I said today
and we're in the lorac one you don't
really need to use like a glitter glue
or anything like that because these are
so smooth and creamy and blendable
there's really not a shade in here
that's super super chunky except for
that medallion shade it just has a
little bit of grit and actual then you
don't junk the glitter in there um but
if you are worried about fallout and
things like that you could try using it
with a glitter glue because these are so
pigmented and soft and buttery you do
get a little bit of fallout but it's
nothing crazy or intense so overall I
think it can be used with any sort of
eye primer if you are familiar with the
lorac pro formulation then you can just
use whatever eye primer that you like to
use with it I think it really can be
used with anything honestly and I'm just
loving the actual shades in here I think
they're absolutely beautiful as someone
who does have a fair complexion like
myself um I just think these are really
really nice on my particular skin tone
the one thing that I'm a little worried
about is that most of the shades that
you're seeing in here are kind of in
like the medium tone range if that makes
sense you're just getting a lot of
neutral shades especially over here in
this area and this area too so not so
much in this area but in the middle and
towards like left over here you are just
getting some really average sort of
mid-tone shades and I think it's really
beautiful and unique this does remind me
of of course the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette I no longer have mine you guys
know I'm not a fan of those Naked
palette um but this does kind of reminds
me of that palette it has a lot of rosy
tones I wish I could compare this to the
unzipped palette but I don't have either
of those so at some point I'm going to
need to go in store and kind of check
out the unzipped palettes and see if
we're getting some similar colors over
here but again this is a completely
different formulation again never tried
the unzipped palette so I don't know
what the formulation is like with that
particular you know with those
particular palettes but what I do know
is that the lorac Pro formula is the
best one that I have tried out of all of
the formulations that lorac releases it
reminds me a little bit of the lorac
nude necessities palette which they did
released I would say maybe four or five
months ago some of the shades in here
are kind
similar you're just getting a lot of
like neutral shades so towards the top
of this pallet or towards the left side
over here I guess the right side for you
guys you are getting some really really
similar sort of shades that are kind of
like beautiful transition shades and I
do like this particular palette my only
complaint was that this is definitely
not everyday friendly for every single
skin tone this is really only good if
you have I would say fair to light maybe
even medium skin tones and I guess
that's my issue with this palette as
well I'm worried that this will not work
for every single skin tone
obviously these deeper darker shades
over here like dark brown terracotta
truffle jet black dark mocha these are
going to work for every single skin tone
but for someone who has a really really
deep complexion these shades over here
might not show up on you so that's
really my only complaint overall the
formulation is beautiful it's exactly
what I expect from the lorac Pro formula
and from the lorac brand in general and
the only shade that's really a mist for
me personally on my skintone is
definitely that medallion shade so let's
go ahead and get right into the
swatching I'm just going to start with
the top row so we have the 8 max here
I'll start with Blanc and by the way if
you guys are curious I've talked about
the wear time on the lorac um you know
Pro eyeshadows before but they were an
incredibly incredibly a long time and
especially if you do have a primer on
whether it be behind the seeds primer or
any primer that you want to use they
really wear all day they're incredible
alright so the first two we have there
our Blanc and then we have canvas so
Blanc pretty much blends into my skin
right now I do have self-tanner on if
you guys are curious probably like a
look at the old Anne Olivia I do a self
tanner on today so it's kind of blending
in with my skin tone which is often that
never happens and then we have canvas
right here in canvas is just kind of
like a beautiful muted yellow shade both
matched super creamy very very beautiful
really really like the two of those
shades I did use a little bit of Blanc
underneath my brow bone today and I love
that they of course included like a
matte highlight color in here or a matte
brow bone color in here because those
are my favorite to pop right underneath
my brow the next two shades we're going
to swatch our cool taupe and pink nude
cool taupe is just exactly what it
sounds like a cool taupe sort of color
it actually has a little more in my
opinion a little more of a I don't know
it has a little bit of like a warm
undertone it's hard to explain but it's
still really really beautiful so here is
cool
tope let me see if I can blend that out
a little bit and then we also have light
pink which i think is beautiful I can't
try to do this module didn't really work
out though here's cool taupe I don't
know what happened with the top one I
think my hand was still wet from wiping
it and then we have pink nude which I
think is really beautiful this is like a
perfect transition shade for Anne I met
my palest obviously right now I'm not
but when I met my paleis I think this is
a beautiful transition shade it's just a
beautiful peachy light pink color and I
think it's stunning my grotton's watch
that and again these are all in sort of
like the mid-tone range let me see if I
can do a better squash than that these
are all sort of in the mid-tone range so
they're a little hard to swatch to be
completely honest because it's kind of
hard to show up I mean they don't show
up really really well so there is pink
nude the next one we have here is clay
and clay is similar to thinking but I
have a little more of a cooler undertone
and definitely a little more toe penis
to it but it's still a beautiful
beautiful color so there it is beautiful
love and if you guys do think that the
pro formula is like a little bit on the
powdery side I highly recommend using
just a primer that has maybe a little
bit more of a tacky formulation to it I
don't honestly think that the behind the
scenes eye primer has too much tackiness
to it but you definitely can find one
that has a little more grip if you're
looking for that and then here we have
terracotta which is what I used as my
transition today it's just a beautiful
beautiful color I am failing miserably
as much as today I'm sorry guys but it's
just a beautiful warm tone sort of like
camel color so here we have clay and
then we have terracotta right underneath
it really really beautiful love those
two shades a lot and the next two that
we're going to go ahead and swatch our
dark brown in jet black and I really
like that they have this jet black color
here it's beautiful definitely have like
a strong cool undertone in there and
it's perfect for kind of like stamping
on over eyeliner if you want to do that
but first we have dark
which is just a cool-toned dark brown
shade absolutely beautiful love this so
here is cool Brown and I just love the
way that these go on there's no skipping
there's no issues it's just a beautiful
formulation I feel like you can't say
that with like matte shadows all the
time and of course here is jet-black and
it's just beautiful it's just
straight-up jet-black alright guys so
here we have a gang of dark brown and
then here is Jeff black and let's move
on to the shimmer and shall we so we're
going to start with light gold which
looks like this and it's beautiful
actually it's more of a peachy undertone
to it in my opinion and I really really
think it's beautiful
and then the next shade is almond pearl
and almond pearl is gorgeous it has sort
of like a petal undertone I know that
sounds weird but like a pinky petal II
undertone I think it's beautiful so here
is light gold just a beautiful
opalescent sort of light gold shade kind
of reminds me of Becca's moonstone
shimmering skin perfecter then we have
almond pearl which I said is sort of
like a I guess if I show you guys you
can kind of see the difference so here
is like gold and here is almond pearl
almond pearl has more of a cool like
pinky undertone but it's still so
beautiful and I'm loving all of these
sort of dopey gray colors so here we
have light gold and then we have almond
pearl beneath it beautiful love the
sheen too on these shimmery shades
they're absolutely absolutely stunning
and I'm just always amazed that lorac
can pull it off like they always have
such a consistent formulation I can't
believe that the match are exactly like
the shimmers like it's just amazing to
me now we have the one eye shadow in the
palette that is just a complete fail for
me personally and it's medallion and
Dalian just feels so weird it feels
rough it looks gritty it's strange it's
right there and it definitely has chunks
of sparkle and it's just totally totally
a Miss in my opinion so there is
medallion I'm just going to swatch it by
itself because it does not deserve to be
with the other ones you guys it's just a
total this and it's
well upsetting because normally these
Pro palates are just every single shade
is perfect it's the perfect formulation
but that one was a real mess all right
the next one we have is light pewter and
I just love this shade this shade is
beautiful so here it is it's just a
beautiful glossy light taupe color with
tons and tons of iridescent
to it absolutely stunning had a little
more of a pinky undertone look at that
oh god beautiful oh my god
stunning all right the next one we have
is amethyst and amethyst is just a
beautiful kind of amethyst or eye color
you how that gorgeous purpley reddish
tone in there it's stunning
love it beautiful beautiful beautiful so
at the top we have light pewter and then
we have amethyst right there really
gorgeous just love those tones in there
I feel like they did a nice job of like
recreating sort of like a rosy tone eye
palette but it's not too rosy tones you
know like if I were to hold it up to
like a naked3 dupe or even just like The
Naked 3 palette in general I have a
naked 3 dupe somewhere I thought it was
over there but I don't you would see
that this actually has more neutral
tones than pink tones so I really like
it now we have rose bronze rose bronze
is very similar kinda wings with
medallion pewter and almond pearl mixed
together if that makes sense you're
still getting that beautiful sort of
rosy tone in here and I will say a lot
of these shades are kind assembler not
gonna lie however I just think this is
beautiful and it's it literally just
shows up differently on the eye it may
come out like when you're watching it
and it looks like it's really really
similar to a lot of the other tones in
the palette but it looks different
there's a different definition when you
have it on your eyes now we have dark
mocha which is beautiful this is what I
have on my lower lashline and in my
crease today it's a beautiful sort of
cool toned light brown shade I would say
cool toned light brown with morte open
it because this is such a Toby palette
so here we have on the top of rose
bronze and then underneath a dark mocha
and then the last shade is called
truffle and I do like
I prefer jet black because it is jet
black trouble has definitely um sort of
like a gray undertone to it so it's not
exactly a black color it's like a black
but okay it's like a black with a gray
undertone and then it has silver shimmer
in it you guys will see once I swatch it
there it is it's still very very intense
and beautiful but I just preferred jet
black because if I'm gonna put a black
eyeshadow on I want it to be black
alright so there are the last three
colors in the palette so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review and swatches I hope
it didn't go on for too long I was
trying to make it nice and quick and
short to sell those already have 15
minutes and I was trying to make it nice
and quick and short because I am
familiar with the lorac pro formulation
I think it's beautiful if you are
familiar this is the same formulation I
would recommend going in store checking
out the colors it's not as pinky toned
as it looks on the website so maybe go
in store check it out if you like those
mid-tone kind of pewter II sort of dopey
colors you're gonna absolutely love this
palette if you're not into it if you
have really deep skin tones definitely
go in store check it out first do since
watching but I'm really a fan I think
it's beautiful on fair to light skin
tones and I couldn't be happier so thank
you so much for joining me for this
review and I will see you guys my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
