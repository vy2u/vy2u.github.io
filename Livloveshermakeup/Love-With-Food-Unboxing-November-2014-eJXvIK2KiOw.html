the love with food unboxing for the
month of November if you guys don't know
what love with food is it is a monthly
subscription box that you can purchase
for $10 a month and every time you
purchase a box for $10 a month they do
go and help a child and hunger who's in
hunger in the US so you are basically
getting a box full of organic and or
natural snacks each month and you are
also helping a child in hunger so it's
really nice little box to have so this
is what the box looks like and I haven't
looked inside yet I just opened up the
over wraps so let's look in here the
first thing here it says baby it's cold
outside says tasting box so this just
shows what you get in the box for the
month which is pretty normal for
subscription services and then the next
thing is let's just start with the food
so the first thing I see here is by
Leakey or Lackey and it is called red
rice crackers rice oil salt and nothing
else and this is a hundred calorie pack
looks like that so those look really
yummy and I like that there is literally
just three ingredients that's pretty
cool also having a hundred calorie pouch
those are really nice for snacking so
excited to try that the next two things
I see are guy Leone Belgian chocolates
so this one is in milk truffle and this
one is in dark praline so that's what
those look like and they look delicious
and the next thing in here is fruit
bliss a soft dried mini figs all natural
and preservative free non-gmo 8 plus for
healthy snacking so those are just
little dried figs
and those like yummy and they they feel
kind of like a like a fruit snack you
know and dried figs are good so one
pouch is 137 calories that was very
exact
but that is nice and under 200 calories
for a little snack like that the next
thing in here is slit seed form a
tortilla chips non-gmo gluten-free vegan
rice bran oil chips happen sinful sweet
heat so I'm guessing this is some kind
of like cinnamon or some kind of yeah
cinnamon chip and it says no artificial
ingredients no trans fat non GMO
ingredients antioxidant rich rice bran
oil of gluten-free and vegan so those
look really yummy one bag is 220
calories so that's a nice alternative to
tortilla chips or just regular chips in
general the next thing I see here are
digging Jane baking company smart
educational snacks states and capitals
so this is pretty cute I guess if you
have a kid or something they probably
like that it says that one let's see
point 8 ESS oh yeah this little bag is
100 calories too so that's nice to have
to kind of look like they're like little
animal crackers the next thing in here
is all-natural jurors rupees
gourmet milk chocolate peanut Buster so
that sounds delicious
excited to try that the next thing in
here is whole spiced Napa Valley
all-purpose salt seasoning and a few of
the ingredients are sea salt sugar
celery chili onion turmeric garlic with
your acid so that will be nice to use
I'm excited to try that out I love
spices I love putting spices on food so
that would be really nice and the last
thing in here is a soft baked biscotti
in Midnight which is double chocolate
espresso so that looks absolutely
scrumptious
I love biscotti they're really nice just
dipping into coffee or tea so that looks
really delicious and let's see the
calories in here one cookie is 150
calories so pretty good I'm excited to
try that and then there's a few coupons
or little code things down here so it
says give the gift of
with food this season cute little
picture and it says give your loved one
a love with food snap subscription this
holiday save $10 on any subscription
with the code holiday 14 December boxes
will arrive between 12:15 and 1223 and
you must order by 11:30 2014 so I'll
show you guys that coupon code again in
case you want to get $10 off holiday 14
is the coupon code and let's see what
else is in here it says Luke Toth
Netflix for women's fashion and it looks
like this is a $25 gift card so that's
pretty cool I'm guessing that's like a
purse thing and then they have the guy
beyond which were the Belgian chocolates

order by using the code chocolate 10 so
that's nice and the last thing in here
