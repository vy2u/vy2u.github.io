my channel I am back to film a video for
you guys today but everybody's favorite
headband
everybody hates this headband but the
reason why we're you guys is so I don't
get foundation in my hair so we are
doing a first impressions on two
different foundations today the first is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation I'm going to be applying this
to the left side of my face and on the
right side of my face I will be applying
the YSL fusion in foundation both of
these are extremely pricey which is why
I thought we would do a side-by-side
comparison this is part one which is
application and then part two will be
eight hours later now it is quite late
in the afternoon when I am applying this
it is actually already 1:00 to 51 in the
afternoon I have two day off today so I
won't be checking you with you guys
until probably after 10 o'clock tonight
if that's a little too late for you you
can just watch the check-in in the
morning but yeah anyway let's go ahead
and jump right into it starting with the
Giorgio Armani foundation by the way I
want to say really quickly at purchase
these foundations about two to three
months ago they've been sitting in my
question for awhile I am well aware that
they are not cruelty free but I just
want to put that out there they have
been in my collection for a while now so
these are money foundation this is one
it fluid ounce and it will cost you $64
which is crazy
I did pick up these seed number two and
I believe they have about fifteen to
twenty different shades which they
should this is a very very popular
foundation so that you have an extensive
sort of shade collection it's supposed
to give you this a really nice beautiful
look to the skin it's supposed to be
really good for those of you who do have
more normal or dry skin I'm definitely
more dry at this time of year so we
shall see how the con go and then dy
itself used name I gotta she'd be ten
course one which is the lightest out of
eighteen love this packaging this will
cost you $60 and you do get 0.8 for
fluid ounces so not even the standard
foundation amount and it says racy arm
the hybrid light smooth texture of this
foundation melts into the skin very
seamlessly even soft matte coverage it
don't have a steam technology that
ensures make-up that stays comfortable
and flawless all day long because an
applicator applies the ideal amount of
foundation for the hand or to the face I
didn't even seen what the applicator
looks like it's a total fusion with the
skin for the freedom of unclip the I'm
compromising color alright
on and just jump right into it guys I
will be doing this so that everything is
nice and even so we are going to be
applying a primer all over the face and
then I have two little DM Real
Techniques sponges here so that we don't
cross contaminate anything and I'm going
to try those out as you have the essence
all about Matt 16 compact powder handy
just in case I do want to go ahead and
set these in but let's just build them
on shall we so I'm going to zoom you
guys in a little bit and we shall get
started so let's go ahead and put on our
primer I will be using the Bobbi Brown
vitamin enriched face base which has
been a current favorite of mine I just
really really enjoy it the way that it
prolongs aware of my makeup so let me
think about that sized amount and I'm
going to apply this all over my face
this is what my skin is looking like
currently I definitely have a little bit
of Darkness from my last lupus flare up
I am going to take this around my eye
area as well you guys because I do like
to test out my foundations for the first
time around my eye area to see if they
can double as a concealer but yeah this
is what my skin is working like I've
been having these little itchy things
right here going into my hairline that
are causing a little bit of hair loss
which I know is gross but if you know
what those are this little rash here
definitely let me know if you are a
fellow lupus person a fellow loop loop
on the anyway let me go ahead and apply
this I'm sorry I didn't mean for that to
sound offensive my friend how smooth
this and that's what we call each other
loop loops so anyway let's go ahead and
rub that in I'm going to let that sit
for us topping and like I said we're
going to be using it the Real Techniques
sponges on either side of our face hi
bad day
I see this ruborous you know the other
side of the story's looking to be like
what the why am I not in here right
now with you alright so I'm just going
to press that into the skin and make
sure it is fully absorbed and which time
should we start with I think I want to
start with the luminous silk side so
let's go ahead and keep this out as a
packaging
beautiful beautiful beautiful frosted
glass bottle as you guys can see a nice
little lid here and it does have a pump
so I am just going to pump this out onto
the back of my hand it is super super
liquidy like I said the shade I got is
number two and I think I'm just going to
dot this on and then we will go ahead
and apply it to the skin I should have
done this on the other
and so that I'm not reaching over but
let's apply that amount first and see
how it goes I know that looks like quite
a lot it might be but it seems like this
is more of a liquidy foundation so I'm
going to apply it with a damp sponge do
you see that looks like really good
coverage I am I like it I like it really
good shape match really really good I
don't even know what they have a shade
at number one let's keep it so right in
the middle I don't even know if they
have a shade at number one but this
feels really beautiful on the skin
alright so there is about one layer to
gray see the difference I know I went a
little far all over it okay but that
looks stunning I think it looks really
really pretty on the skin alright I am
going to apply a little more so that I
can kind of go around the eye area but I
love that just one layer of that look so
beautiful like what I'm staring at my
skin my girl yes yes yes yes all right
I'm gonna apply a little bit around my
eye area so we can see if that will take
care of Abbey dark circles even I slept
in today Anna you take the pointed side
and just lightly tap that in oh oh oh my
god see I'm going broadly free and now
watch me fall in love with this
foundation I'm gonna have to find you
guys to do all right let's see here what
is that what's that what's good alright
that looks absolutely stunning
absolutely stunning I don't even know if
I want to go over that with another
layer but I'm going to build it up over
here where I do have a little bit more
discoloration goodness gracious that
looks beautiful like I hope that's
showing up on camera the way it's
showing up in real life it looks insane
alright let's just build it here
oh it's building beautifully as well to
see that wow wow wow wow very impressed
all right so that is what it is looking
like on that side of my face you can
definitely see a difference between the
side that does not have any foundation
and the side that does that looks
amazing
it's going to be hard for the Y yourself
to compare but we shall see if it can
and I'm gonna let that just go ahead and
sit down completely let's go ahead and
going on the Y itself shall we so here
is the YSL love this packaging I love
why I fell packaging in general does
that not look beautiful
I'm a half time quilty Purdue for you
guys alright so here is the packaging
yes yes yes beautiful um oh okay it
comes off like that as you guys can see
and I'm guessing you just twist it does
have a little bit of sunscreen in it and
it you see chemicals come block what you
Jerry it's like a little glass
applicator do you guys see that
alright I guess I am just going to apply
that oh my god first thing I thought it
was getting dark applicator okay looks
like I should be putting it on to my
hand but it's okay let's just try it out
this way first Lou this is like really
weird I do not like this application
okay alright let's go ahead with the
other advanced sponge and it lets blend
this one in okay so it seems a little
lighter than my skin tone whoo super
heavily fragrance holy well girl
that is very very very heavily
fragranced right blue also very
beautiful
okay yeah not sitting on the skin as
pretty as the side can you guys see that
it looks like it's like a little oh oh I
don't like the way that's sitting on the
skin at all okay I'm going to try taking
a little bit on the back of my hand now
and I just spotted on and then we can
see if it will build but that that
doesn't look nearly as pretty awesome
right
my fave goodness this one is definitely
more of like a water foundation I can
see that instantly but okay compared to
the luminous silk side like no that
doesn't look good at all
close up from far away I don't think you
really can tell but this one seems to be
a little more on a yellow tone side this
one seems to be a little more on the
pink tone side as far as color is
concerned okay all right that looks a
little better can you guys see like over
here with the luminous silk it's like
it's looking okay in my nose points but
it just seems really seamless and then
over here you see a little bit of
blotchiness a sponge application is
always my preferred method but that
looks a little blotchy for a sponge
application let me see if I can build it
up around at my eye area I'm just going
to go like this is the weirdest
applicator I don't like it at all now
let's take the pointed side see if we
can help those dark circles definitely
lighter coverage on this side I feel
like I'm building a lot more but like no
cut one pump a couple one pump over here
on this side we look beautiful with the
luminous silk this one just seems a
little not as pretty on the skin it
still looks good like I'm not going to
say it doesn't look good I will still
use it but it is dry over here over here
and not dry dry dry here not dry here I
think you can visibly see which
foundation is on which side all right I
so that is what it is looking like with
both the foundation hopefully you guys
can see Geoffrey preferring the Armani
luminous silk side it seems like it has
set feels like a nice really soft kind
of finish and this one feels actually
pretty dried down I'm going to go ahead
and set it in with powder to see how it
can last throughout the day so I'm going
to take this Buki buffing brush from it
cosmetics as well as my exes all about
Matt 15 compacts powder and let's go
ahead and set in the eye area first I'm
just going to apply too much because I
love the finish that's going on over
here and the finish is not too bad over
here as well they actually look you look
pretty close like almost
again but ooh peopIe see that look at
the dryness here with the YSL all right
I'm going to be a little careful with
you why South Side's it seems like the
powders really kind of clinging on to
that but I I really like this those
looks really good over here
all right you think that will do it for
powder set in but young you can see
right here this is causing a lot of
dryness on my skin over here dry over
here not dry at all very interesting
alright guys so I'm going to go on with
my day I will be back in about eight
hours and I will let you guys know how
this wears on my skin it currently is
exactly 202 in the afternoon so I will
see you around 10 o'clock okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
