thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day as always I am here to
talk about that was weird it looked like
I had wings for a second and then I
realized it with my sleeves okay um
anyway I am here to talk about a really
really fun collaboration that I'm doing
today with my friend hailey if you guys
don't know who Haley is I'm going to
link everything you need to know about
her in the description bar will be the
first thing you see I will link her
Instagram her channel her video and also
the collaboration video that we collab
don a few months ago I love hailey she
is so sweet and she's just really really
got like a great personality she's kind
of quirky and I really like that about
her I love that about her I love
watching her videos and she really
brings out like my sarcastic side and
kind of I feel like well we're talking
whether we're facetiming or texting we
kind of bring out like each others like
more sarcastic or like funny side if
that makes sense so I feel like any time
we're talking we're always laughing and
those are like the best kind of
friendships right the people who can
laugh with each other so I really really
enjoy your I encourage you guys to go
over check out her channel and tell her
I say hello ang on let's get right into
the collaboration so he wanted to do a
collaboration she reached out to me was
like do you want to collab on high-end
products that are worth the hype or
worth the money I was like what a great
idea and as I was going through products
and kind of picking them out I realized
that these were products that I talked
about a lot on my channel already
whether I've talked about them in a top
five series video or I've talked about
them in like my fails and holy grails I
was just like him like a lot of these
I've already talked about I consider
high-end to be any sort of brand that's
sold at sephora just like how I consider
drugstore products you know I consider
them drugstore because they're sold at
the drugstore however there is a little
section of sephora and ulta where you go
in and you realize that you're not in
the high end section anymore you're
literally in the luxury section I'm
talking Chanel Dior you know why a self
stuff like that and I thought you know
what I don't talk about brands like that
very often on my channel first of all
because I don't own a lot of products
from brands like that but second of all
I also one of those people I love
getting a good deal on products I don't
like to spend tons and tons and tons of
money on just one product I'd rather get
lots of like smaller products if that
makes sense
but I thought it would make more sense
for me to kind of talk about luxury
products so I'm going to be sharing with
you guys five luxury products that I
think are worth the money are worth the
hype and um yeah I hope you guys enjoy
this so let's just get started the first
product time when I talk about is from
Dior I recently reviewed this this is a
little like pouch it comes in it's so
luxurious this is the dior diorskin nude
air glowing gardens illuminating powder
in 001 glowing pink not only does it
have gorgeous gorgeous packaging this is
a very very pricey highlighter but let
me tell you it is worth it this has
quickly become one of my all-time
favorite highlights I love the color is
a beautiful kind of like pastel a light
pink shade and it's just got a wonderful
formulation it's very very pigmented and
it lasts all day on my skin it feels
like a baked it's kind of like a bait
gel a sort of formulas you're getting a
little bit of like that pigmentation
from like a wet product but then you're
also getting like the powdery touch with
that makes sense so it's kind of like
baked July and it's gorgeous absolutely
gorgeous as you guys can probably see
let me go ahead and swashb on the back
of my hand I love that there's no
skipping with it and I feel like it is
because it does have a little bit of
like that um cream formulation in there
i feel like its a mix it's not i'm not
saying it's like color pop eyeshadows
that are like half cream half powder but
you can tell it's got that like Jill a
sort of finish so you get a little bit
of like the vibrancy that you would get
from a wet product mixed in with a
powder and I feel like it's just
beautiful it doesn't skip on the skin it
doesn't look chunky it just blends
seamlessly into the skin it's absolutely
gorgeous and in my opinion it is worth
the money I am actually going to go
ahead and pick up the second one as well
they have one called nude air flowing
gardens i believe and that one looks
gorgeous as well so if you're not into
the pink ones you can also pick up the
nude one I think that would look really
really gorgeous on people who have like
darker skin tones or maybe tan skin
tones but I think that this is also a
very Universal universally flattering
shade so that is my first pick very very
pricey but I do think it is worth the
money alright the second product I want
to talk about a lot of people are going
to be like in it now like this is kind
of a controversial little palette here
this is from our glass and i will say i
do have two products that are from our
I personally consider our glass to be a
luxury brand because the amount of
product that you get for the price that
you pay he's like luxury from me in my
opinion a lot of people think they're
just like high-end but you don't get a
lot of products like whether it be there
ambient lighting powders or even this
eyeshadow palette you're not getting
tons and tons of product however I just
feel like for the price this is like a
$58 eyeshadow palette I consider that
luxury so anyway this is the modernist I
shadow palette in the shade obscura a
lot of people did not like these I don't
even think I enjoyed this the first time
I picked it up I did a review on it
about a year ago and I wasn't that
impressed I thought that it was a little
muddy I wasn't really liking the looks
that I was coming out with it I felt
like all of the shadows kind of got into
one another but i have to say i noticed
that any time I want like a nice little
like chocolatey smokey eye sort of thing
going on and I don't necessarily need
tons and tons of different like color
definition or variation I just want
something that's like brown smokey all
over my eyes I reach for this all the
time in my opinion it is worth it they
are very very buttery and they almost
blend away if you you really can / blend
these shadows that's what I mean they
almost blend away on the skin if you sit
there for too long and blend and blend
and blend which can be a bad thing it
can also be a good thing as you guys can
probably see the art quite powdery
however the colors are not very
different from each other and I like the
way that I like I don't know I just like
the looks i get with it I can put that
kind of gold shade all over my lid I can
put this like in the outer V this is my
crease that on my brow bone is just one
of those pallets that I realized I reach
for actually a lot and I do think it is
worth the hype and worth the money even
though you don't get a lot of product in
here but again luxury alright so that is
the second product that's our what I
want to talk about is from why asal and
I actually recently duped to this
product in a Dukes the video go figure
but this is the two she clocked blur
primer from YSL the reason that I love
this so much is just the whole concept
of it I know that sounds horrible but I
feel like when you get into luxury
products it's kind of the way things are
packaged the way they smell the way you
feel when you use them and I feel
luxurious and beautiful when I use this
I don't know how else to describe it it
comes in this gorgeous glass bottle and
as you guys can see I really have used a
lot of this you get a lot of product in
here you get one fluid ounce which is
quite a bit I did do pits on the other
day and I said that they may glean baby
skin instant pore eraser was very very
similar and honestly it is I feel like
the texture is absolutely the same I
feel like they cover the pores the same
but there's something about this primer
the feeling of like taking it out
putting it on my skin the scent the pump
everything about it makes me feel really
really lovely and luxurious and I know
that some people are going to be like
well just because you feel good when
you're using it doesn't mean it's worth
the money but if you are someone who
really enjoys putting on makeup in the
morning and you enjoy the whole process
of putting yourself together that is
something that actually kind of sticks
out and that would be something that you
would enjoy so that is why I am
mentioning this like I said the
Maybelline Baby skin is a dupe for it
you don't get as much product in here
you get more in here I just like the
scent butter on this I feel like um I
just feel very womanly and wonderful
what I do then I feel like I'm gonna get
hate for that but it is what it is and
it is definitely one of my favorite
luxury primers and I do think it is
worth the money alright the next product
I want to talk about is again from our
glass and this is a product that i
recently reviewed as well this is the
ambient strobe lighting powder in the
shade brilliant it looks like this again
i'm considering this luxury because this
is pricey and you don't get a lot of
product in here this is basically very
very similar to the ambient lighting
powders except it's more of a
highlighter it's a very very beautiful
subtle luminous highlight though and i
absolutely love it i love the shade
called brilliant it's a little bit of
like a golden like lit from within sort
of color and i think it's absolutely
stunning on the skin and i don't know
what it is there's just something about
this this is the first highlighter that
I warned where my boyfriend has actually
turned instead Wow what's on your
cheekbones or what's on your skin okay
girls I've said it before but when your
boyfriend or your
notices that you know there's something
nice on your skin or he actually even
notices that you're wearing makeup
that's a big deal um and I really do
feel like my skin looks very very nice
and like put together when I'm wearing
this even if I'm having breakouts or
anything like that I tend to get
breakouts in this area so anytime I put
this around this area and maybe I have
some uneven texture going on or
breakouts I feel like the fact that this
kind of has like that ambient lighting
powder like base in it it kind of just
does that soft focus sort of effect but
it also highlights the skin but it's
never too much like you can't overdo
this product I just absolutely love it I
think it's fantastic and it's definitely
definitely worth the money in my opinion
if you were not a fan of the ambient
lighting powders you may like these more
because this is more of an actual
highlighting powder I think a lot of
people um don't really know how to use
the ambient lighting powders and for a
long time I didn't know how to use mine
either I was like doing this is high
don't you sit underneath my eyes what
are you the dorsum I'm all faced with it
if you are looking for something that
truly is like a highlight from the
hourglass brand these strobe lighting
powders are great alright and then they
last thing are the area in the last
thing yeah alright the last thing that I
want to talk about is another product
from wyoss ow I mean look at the
packaging look at the packaging why I
sell just sucks me in with that
packaging this is the effect nia there
but this is the pop water glossy stain I
did a whole review on this I got this
last summer it was pricey this was like
thirty five forty dollars and I'm like
wow for like a lip stain really but it
is the best lip stain I have ever worn
it tastes amazing it smells amazing it's
gotten a wonderful wonderful little
applicator look at this little doe foot
applicator it's like completely like
slanted one waist you can get it right
on your lip right into the little
crevices I love the formulation i love
the where time i think the color is
gorgeous this is what it looks like it's
just a beautiful kind of rosy color i'm
definitely going to pick up more of
these the shade is 201 if you guys are
curious but it is beautiful and these
just blend how gorgeously on the lips
and they're not sticky they feel a
little tacky but they're not sticky and
then once it's completely set into your
skin you're left with a or into your
lips you are left with a beautiful
stained that looks like that and you
guys it's
smells like roses and if you are new to
my channel you know I am obsessed with
anything rose so I think that probably
is a big part of it as well but overall
I think the packaging is beautiful you
did get quite a good amount of product
in here and I love the color I love the
way it lasts on my lips and i love that
it actually leaves a stain and the stain
lasts all day long so in my opinion
these are definitely worth the hype
worth the money so anyway those were my
top of five picks for luxury products
that are worth the money or are worth
the hype I hope you guys enjoyed this
video like I said Haley is doing her
video on high-end products oh gosh
high-end products that are worth the
hype or worth the money so she's
probably going to have like my products
are very very expensive I feel like all
of these were over what like forty five
fifty dollars but she is going to have
you know products that are like you know
just better priced in general because
it's going to be more it's going to be
high end so it's going to be like to
face brown and things like that but it's
not going to be as pricey as these items
like hourglass do you or why I style
things like that so if you do want um
you know to see what her favorites are
definitely go check out her channel and
yeah thank you so much for joining you
guys I hope you enjoyed this video and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
