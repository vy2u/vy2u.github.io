am continuing my makeup collection 2015
video series here I have all of my
concealers foundations and powders I'm
going to be going through these three
today and then just emptying them into
this bin because actually I will be
moving soon so these videos are the
perfect excuse to start actually taking
all my products and putting them away to
get ready to move I normally have them
set up differently i have like nice
cabinets i put them in but i thought you
know what this is a great way i can
start doing these videos get all the
stuff together put them in the bins they
need to move and all I should be good to
go in about a month when I head out of
here so anyway that's my excuse to
continue doing these makeup collection
videos so like I said this will be my
concealers foundations and powders so
let's just get started I'm not even
going to try and go through just the
foundations than just the concealers
than just the powders I tried doing that
earlier today with my eyeliners brow
products and mascaras and it was just
too overwhelming I'm just gonna go it
was hard to find them in the crowd so
I'm just going to take random ones show
you guys what it is and pop them in the
bin so the first thing I have here is
the elf moisturizing foundation stick
enriched with antioxidants and
anti-aging ingredients this is in the
color honey next I have this
bareMinerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream the color i'm in is
opal 01 and i really really like this
product i have a covergirl outlast stay
fabulous foundation in 805 and i also
have one in 8-10 i have the mac face and
body in white this is like a nice white
mixer foundation for any foundations
that might be too dark on my skin I have
the bobbi brown what is this Bobby Brown
extra SPF 25 tinted moisturizing balm in
alabaster that's my color it's really
really moisturizing a nice I have this
very well-loved essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder I've been loving
this lately more than my tone correcting
powder from ELF which is crazy because
that's like my go-to but lately I've
been
this a lot I have an elf mineral
foundation here it is in the shade fair
I have a Revlon Photoready airbrush
foundation in 0 1 0 vanilla I have the
new l'oreal infallible Pro matte in 102
shell beige I have the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage foundation this is
newer to me I'm really really happy with
it I love it in the color fair beige I

use a lot of that porcelain one as you
guys can see the other ones are a little
dark I have this gosh cosmetics CC cream
illuminating foundation in 01 porcelain
moisturizing and I love this I behind
this a lot it gives a really really nice
no makeup kind of look on the skin I
have a Revlon nearly naked foundation I
got this a like a long time ago but man
I really need to get back to using this
because I do love it my color is 110
ivory I have an eel messica rich liquid
foundation in RF 100 again this is one
of those white mixer foundations this is
a really heavy duty coverage foundation
so it mixes with anything that's also
full coverage really well to lighten up
the foundation or just to get extra
coverage to a product this is the cover
girl what is this advanced radiance
foundation of 105 ivory really love the
formula
very nice I have the wet and wild come
correct a celebrity concealer this is
really really good my shade is a 111
fair this gives really really heavy duty
coverage i highly recommend you can get
that at the drugstore I have this Revlon
Photoready BB cream I have almost used
this up as you guys can probably see
there's a big dent in there it's on this
last leg of the race I guess you could
say it is in the shade Oh 10 light pale
and it really does doesn't give a lot of
coverage because it is a BB cream
however it really is quite moisturizing
and like that um I have the covergirl
ultra smooth hair smoothing foundation +
applicator throughout the applicator
hated it 805 Avery ivory is my shade
however I have found that if i use this
with my Beauty Blender it actually is
sort of nice so I'm okay with it I just
think it's so gimmicky I have this true
navy blue davia you don't even know this
is like a powder foundation in the shade
oh it's sorry it's a triple seaweed
pressed powder and quiet and still and
it's nice it's a little dark for me but
I do like it I have the Revlon
age-defying with DNA advantage cream
makeup in 05 fresh I read don't really
like this but of course I'm going to use
it up it's just very very low in the
coverage area not enough coverage I have
the cover girls cg smoothers hydrating
makeup in 705 ivory this is a newer
product to me and I absolutely love it
it's really hydrating it gives good
coverage I have the it cosmetics bye-bye
redness it's basically like a concealer
it's a little dark on my skin however i
do find if i wear it under foundation it
works so i like that i have the
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous concealer
this is in the shade does it say I don't
think it says it just has a number but
this is the lightest shade and it's okay
it's alright at this tiny little
concealer stick from hard candy and it's
so little it's just like a little I
haven't even used it yet it's like a
little pencil one so i don't know i
think it's in the lightest shade
I have the dream bb-8 and one beauty
balm with 2% cells so it's acid in it
from Maybelline I like this a lot it
really keeps my skin nice and matte and
it has 2% salsa look acid in it so if

set your makeup so I like it I have the

it that much I haven't tried it as a
foundation yet I usually just use it as
a concealer but it's really really thick
and heavy coverage I have the Olay seven

really nice it's like a i like to use it
on my under eyes as my concealer and
also has a lot of moisture in it I have
a hard candies hard candy CC correction

dark the shade is fair but it's super

just really really good products one of
my favorite formulas is this cover girl

last but not least i have another
l'oreal visible lift in 143 soft ivory
so anyway those were all of my
concealers my powders and my foundations
i'm in a box the subway now because like
i said i'll be travelling and I just
thought this was a great way to put
everything out on the bed from its
normal storage place which is usually in
cabinets and you know I have nicer
storage but I don't just put in a bin
but I thought this would be great
because then I can just go through
everything and then put it right in the
bin to pack it up to move so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this part of my
makeup collection 2015 I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
