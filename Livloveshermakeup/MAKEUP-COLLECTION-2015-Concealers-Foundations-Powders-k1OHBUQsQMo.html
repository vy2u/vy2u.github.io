I'm continuing my makeup collection in
2015 video series here I have all of my
concealers foundations and powders I'm
going to be going through these three
today and then just emptying them into
this bin because actually I will be
moving soon so these videos are the
perfect excuse to start actually taking
all my products and putting them away to
get ready to move I normally have them
set up differently I have like nice
cabinets I put them in but I thought you
know what this is a great way I can
start doing these videos get all the
stuff together put them in the bins they
need to move and I should be good to go
in about a month when I head out of here
so anyway that's my excuse to continue
doing these makeup collection videos so
like I said this will be my concealers
foundations and powders so let's just
get started I'm not even gonna try and
go through just the foundations than
just the concealers than just the
powders I tried doing that earlier today
with my eyeliners brow products and
mascaras and it was just too
overwhelming I'm just gonna go it was
hard to find them in the crowd so I'm
just gonna take random ones show you
guys what it is and pop them in the bin
so the first thing I have here is the
elf moisturizing foundation stick
enriched with antioxidants and
anti-aging ingredients this is in the
color honey next I have this bare
minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream the color I'm in is
opal oh one and I really really like
this product I have a covergirl outlast
stay fabulous foundation in 805 and I
also have one in 810 I have the Mac face
and body in white this is like a nice
white mixer foundation for any
foundations that might be too dark on my
skin I have the Bobbi Brown what is this
Bobbi Brown extra SPF 25 tented
moisturizing balm in alabaster that's my
color it's really really moisturizing
and nice I have this very well loved
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder I've been loving this lately more
than my tone correcting powder for
elf which is crazy because that's like
my go-to but lately I've been using this
a lot I have an elf mineral foundation
here it is in the shade fair I have a
Revlon Photoready airbrush foundation in
a-10 vanilla I have the new L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte in 102 shell beige
I have the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation this is newer to me
I'm really really happy with it I love
it in the color fair beige I have
another L'Oreal infallible Pro matte and
this one is in 101 classic ivory this
one is my match the other one's a little
darker I have the Laura Mercier silk
creme moisturizing for most moisturizing
photo edition foundation in ivory I have
the NYC smooth skin parfait 5 and 1 BB
cream instant matte I have this
concealer this is the l'oreal visible
lift blur concealer it is in the shade
301 fair i have the of personal blend
Fondation SPF 15 and it has 4 different
shades you get porcelain fair light and
beige I use a lot of that porcelain one
as you guys can see the other ones are a
little dark I have this gosh cosmetics
CC cream illuminating foundation in oh
one porcelain moisturizing and I love
this I beret this a lot it's gives a
really really nice no makeup kind of
look on the skin I have a Revlon nearly
naked foundation I got this at like a
long time ago but man I really need to
get back to using this because I do love
it my color is 110 ivory I have an ill
Meza rich liquid foundation in our f-100
this is one of those white mixer
foundations this is a really heavy duty
coverage foundation so it mixes with
anything that's also full coverage
really well to lighten up the foundation
or just to give extra coverage to a
product this is the covergirl what is
this advanced radiance foundation of 105
ivory really love the formula up there
very nice I have the wet and wild come
correct celebrity concealer this is
really really good my shade is a 111
fair this gives really really heavy-duty
coverage I highly recommend you can get
that at the drugstore I have this Revlon
Photoready BB cream I have almost used
this up as you guys can probably see
there's a big dent in there it's on this
last leg of the race so I guess you
could say it is in the shade oh one o
light pale and it really does doesn't
give a lot of coverage because it is a
BB cream however it really is quite
moisturizing I like that I have the
covergirl ultra smooth hair smoothing
foundation plus applicator throughout
the applicator hated it 805 Avery ivory
is my shade however I have found that if
I use this with my Beauty Blender it
actually is sort of nice so I'm ok with
it I just think it's so gimmicky I have
this true Davey blue day via if you
don't even know this is like a powder
foundation in the shade
oh it's sorry it's a triple seaweed
pressed powder and quiet and still and
it's nice it's a little dark for me but
I do like it I have the Revlon age
defined with DNA advantage cream makeup
in oh five fresh ivory don't really like
this but of course I'm going to use it
up it's just very very low in the
coverage area not enough coverage I have
the covergirl CG smoothers hydrating
makeup in 705 ivory this is a newer
product to me and I absolutely love it
it's really hydrating he gives good
coverage I have the it cosmetics bye bye
redness it's basically like a concealer
it's a little dark on my skin however I
do find if I wear it under foundation it
works so I like that I have the
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous concealer
this is in the shade does it say I don't
think it says it just has a number but
this is the lightest shade and it's okay
it's alright at this tiny little
concealer stick from hard candy and it's
so little it's just like a level I
haven't even used it yet it's like a
little pencil one so I don't know I
think it's in the leg of shade
I have the dream bb-8 and one beauty
balm with 2% salicylic acid in it from
Maybelline I like this a lot it really
keeps my skin nice and matte and it has
2% salicylic acid in it so if you are
prone to breakouts it's nice I have this
so Susan concealer quad hadn't used it
yet I have the L'Oreal visible lift
serum absolute sunscreen broad
protection program all a plus vitamin C
foundation in 145 classic ivory this is
a reoccurring favorite of mine you will
see quite a few of these in my
collection I absolutely love this
foundation I have the Milani powder
foundation in a 1 shell I haven't really
used that one yet it's really it looks
really nice it looks like it might be a
little dark but it's very very pretty
and smooth looking I have the bare
minerals mineral veil this is just like
kind of like a leaves almost kind of
like the high definition powders that
you can set or you use it after you have
kind of set your makeup so I like it I
have the Kevin a Quan Zhen xual skin
enhance enhancer and this is in the
shade so2 it's nice I haven't really
played with it that much I haven't tried
it as a foundation yet I usually just
use it as a concealer but it's really
really thick and heavy coverage I have
the Olay 7 effects eye brightening CC
cream this is really nice it's like a I
like to use it on my under eyes as my
concealer and it also has a lot of
moisture in it I have a hard candies
hard candy CC correction cream with SPF
15 it's really really dark the shade is
fair but it's super super orange so I
like to mix it with a white mixer
foundation another CC cream is the it
cosmetics CC cream really really nice a
good really really great coverage this
is in the shade does it say anywhere
fair there it is really really nice
really liked this product
I am using quite a lot of it up I have

light I believe it is yeah fair slash
light they're really really heavy duty
coverage and just really really good
products one of my favorite formulas is
this covergirl plus ol a CC cream tone

this is the fact that it's a little bit
too dark on my skin but the actually
consists the actual consistency is so
nice i absolutely love this if you're
looking for a good formula check out
this covergirl + al a CC cream I have a

pick up the first shade they have in
Eric's it's really good I have the Mac

really good I've been liking that a lot
um a Revlon nearly naked powder in o10

translucent no in oh five light / pale
this one's a little better than the
nearly naked the nearly make is a little
too dark I have another one of the

foundation from Kat Von D in light 44
right yes like 44 and another Kat Von D
locket tattoo foundation also in light
44 the two if I mix like light 44 and
light 42 together I get the best color
match like 42 is a little too light and

like this it's in the shade oh one it's
a really nice color match if he grows
our tail if some of you girls are fair

with this another one of those kind of
powders that I like and actually like
the best out of all the ones I own is
the NYX HD studio finishing powder this
is a recent purchase
it's an SF p01 I love this one even more
than the elf one and even more than this

crystal this is the translucent crystal
light reflecting setting powder so that
one's good but honestly in my favorite
is definitely the next one it's so good
to me I have the elf press mineral
foundation in the shade warm yeah
the NYC smooth skin BB radiance powder
in the shade Oh - horn beige I have is
the Maybelline age rewind the lifter
with a primer inside this is okay it's
really really light coverage I almost
use it as a primer the NYX above and
beyond full coverage concealer pot it's
good I do like it I have two of the elf
high definition under-eye setting
powders it's really nice it has like a
pink tint to it with sparkles so I have
two of those it's my little backup one I
also have the elf eye brightener this is

in the color buff it's got a little bit
of a yellow undertone really really nice

rewind in the brightener formula with
the pink I love this summer the Tarte
smooth operator yes smooth operator like
HD kind of powder haven't tried this one
yet
we'll have to see how that one is with
the other ones like the Knicks and the
NARS one have the Revlon each defined
with DNA Advantage concealer it reminds
me a lot of the Maybelline fit me
they're very very similar I like them
both I have the Neutrogena three-in-one
healthy skin concealer for eyes it has
concealer eye cream and sun protection
of it I do like this it's a nice light
weight to concealer founder the eyes I
have the L'Oreal true match in which

a little yellow but I do like it I have
the benefit fake up concealer and
probably when I

get a full-size I really really like
this I have the Rimmel match perfection
concealer in 125 fair I like that a lot
and last but not least I have another
L'Oreal visible lift in 143 soft ivory
so anyway those were all of my
concealers my powders and my foundations
I'm in a boxes away now because like I
said I'll be traveling and I just
thought this was a great way to put
everything out on the bed from its
normal storage place which is usually in
cabinets and you know I have nicer
storage for it I don't just put in a bin
but I thought this would be great
because then I can just go through
everything and then put it right in the
bin to pack it up to move so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this part of my
makeup collection 2015 I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
