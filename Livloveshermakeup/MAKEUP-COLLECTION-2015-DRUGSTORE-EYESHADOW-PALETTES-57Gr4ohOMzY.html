palace that I have currently as of March
2015 and I'm going to share them with
you guys if you watch the video right
before this you would have seen my high
end I shadow palette collection and I
stated in that video that I consider
anything that is bigger than a duo to be
a palette because that's just how I
organize things and that's how I
remember them I do have a whole bucket
filled with just a shadow singles that I
will also do a collection video on but
that's just the way I like to organize
things I know that that bucket of
singles is only eyeshadow singles
everything else is in my palette drawers
so let's get started this is the low end

wasn't sure whether to put this in high
end or low end sometimes my palettes get
mixed up in the two drawers this is my
makeup geek Z palette with the
eyeshadows in it they are like not very
pricey that's why I wanted to put them
in low-end because they're very
affordable but they act like they
perform like a high-end so i wasn't sure

this one's actually supposed to be in
the hype out the high-end palette

the two drawers mixed together so that's
supposed to be in the other one the mix
