today I am continuing my makeup
collection 2015 and today i am doing
mascaras eyeliners and brow products so
I have everything laying out here on my
bed I'm just going to go through them
and show you guys what I have so let's
start with some mascaras I have the tart
lights camera lashes mascara I really
like this it's a good one i have the
maybelline the falsies volume Express
also a really nice mascara I have the
covergirl full lash bloom this is okay
this is a semi new product it's pretty
good it has a nice um rubber bristle
brush which i really like i have the
l'oreal miss manga voluminous mascara i
really really love this mascara it tends
to get a little clumpy but it looks so
beautiful on the lashes i have the
covergirl bombshell volume step one and
two I just find that this takes a lot of
time like who has time to do two
different steps when they want to do
their mascara I'd rather just layer two
mascaras but I got it anyway and i will
use it up i have the physicians formula
organic where this is in the pink tube
this is supposed to be the one that like
um I guess is like a false lash effect I
don't really notice a false lash effect
when I use it however it is relatively
new to me so maybe if i keep using it i
will like it more i have the l'oreal
shocking extensions waterproof
telescopic shocking extensions this is a
really really nice mascara i love the
telescopic line but they do so really
really like this one it's a waterproof
formula stays on all day i have another
little tart lights camera lashes right
here a little baby one good for
traveling another lights camera lashes
as you guys can tell i really like this
mascara i have a semi new one this is
from Laura Mercier this is the sculpting
lash mascara I love this really really
good I have the Smashbox full exposure

like the natural mascara wands i prefer
rubber and this one is a natural wand
but i will use it up I do like it I have
the two-faced size Queen this is like a
huge brush it's amazing I really like it
not like i don't like applying it as my
first coat but my second coat of mascara
it really adds a lot of volume i have
let's see here a covergirl clump crusher
this one is in is this brown or oops i
think this one is brown no very black I
have a very black one and then i also
have a brown one i like both of those a
lot those are really nice um I have a
Jordana best / extreme this is
definitely one of the best mascaras you
can get at the drugstore I highly
recommend it's got a hair on it and one
of my favorite of all time mascaras is
the Sephora outrageous curl mascara this
is an amazing mascara i highly recommend
love it I have a mascara primer this is
the Urban Decay subversion thicker
longer stronger lash primer this is a
nice primer I also have the tart lash
primer this one is called like multiple

use it up because it was like 20 for
dollars um I have a little small size of
the what is this Oh Kat Von D immortal
lash this is kind of nice it has like a
really nice rubber bristle brush and I
thought it would give me a lot more
volume and length than it does but it's
ok i have the Jordana best vol extreme
this is nice for volumizing I do like it

they're real from benefit this is one of
my favorite another favorite mascara of
mine definitely in my top three another
favorite of mine in my top three is the
better than sex mascara from to face
this is amazing I have this little duo
from spoiled rotten I think they're
called or simply spoiled cosmetics it's
like a two part system one is like the
actual let me see

actual like fibers and then the other
one is the mascara it's like a two part
system it works pretty well I definitely
like the fibers I have a little mascara
