continuing with my makeup collection
2015 this is going to be my primers and
my setting sprays so basically I'm going
to be doing my eye primers my face
primers and my makeup setting sprays so
let's get started the first thing I have
is the Beca ever matte poreless priming
Perfector this is a really heavy duty
Matt primer so if you have dry skin this
will not work for you if you're really
really oily this will work really well
for you and if you have combination skin
you should only use it in the areas that
you need it the next thing I have is the
elf hydrating face primer says it fills
in fine lines moisturizes and nourishes
with vitamins a c and e I like it a lot
it's really nice I also have the elf
poreless face primer and it says it
fills in fine lines and reduces the
appearance of enlarged pores it's really
nice it's like they do for the Smashbox
photo finish so really nice I have the
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
anti-aging formula this is one of my
favorite eye primers I just love the
formula it doesn't dry out my eyelid
it's really nice I have the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion in greed it's
got like a gold tint to it it's not so
very nice um I have this what is this
it's just a makeup base i use this as a
I base it's nice it's in doesn't say the
color or the brand so I don't know but
it's nice I have the Korres or coors
Greek yogurt primer I don't like it it
does not smell very good but i will use
it up i have the aimer smart shade CC
luminous primer this is really nice it
does do a little bit of color correction
and yeah I have the Smashbox photo
finish primer water I like this a lot I
don't really use it as a primer anymore
I did for a while but now I just use it
to set my makeup and it lasts all day
really really like it um I have a makeup
forever step 1 mattifying primer I
haven't used this yet it was just a
little deluxe size sample i got from
sephora i also have this one which is
the step one but this one is these
loading primer haven't tried this one
either sorry guys I don't know yet if
this is any good or not one I have tried
already is the Smashbox photo finish
pore minimizing primer this is really
really nice it really does cover up
pores I just want to get that take off i
need to use google or something but
really really like this one that's
similar to that is the Porefessional
from benefit love this it's amazing at
covering pores I have the Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray it's cooling
and hydrating really really love this I
have the Too Faced shadow insurance
original formula this is an eye primer I
really like that I have the Too Faced
shadow insurance glitter glue which is a
really heavy duty eye primer it really
makes everything stick really well like
glitter or even just your regular
eyeshadows love that I have the Garnier
five-second blur skin renew instance
smoother I use this as a primer and its
really really nice it's kind of like
similar to like the professional and
things like that another one that's
similar to the professional is this
lore'l youth code texture prefecture
poor Vanisher it's really nice it has a
little bit more of a creamy texture but
it really feels just lighter and it's a
little a little more watery I guess I
have the l'oreal magic perfecting base
this one's really really thick but it
also has that kind of silicone e pour
filling ingredients one that I've really
been liking is the wet and wild coverall
primer this is really nice it does not
have any of those silicone kind of
ingredients but it really does um make
my makeup last longer it says that it
refines pores feels fine lines brightens
complexion even skin tone I don't know
about all of that but I just know that
it really keeps my makeup on all day i
have the napoleon perdis parties
autopilot pre foundation skin primer
this is really nice very very
moisturizing and it smells really good I
have the NYX matte finish long lasting
setting spray I like that a lot I also
have the dewy finish from next love that
a primer I've been loving as you guys
can see I'm already like running low and
i got this about a month ago is the
two-faced hangover RX primer really
really love that it smells like coconuts
and it really is really milky and
texture and very hydrating I have the
NYX eyeshadow base in white I have the
Chanel ultra correction line repair i
use this after primer after like my face
primer apply it over areas where i tend
to crease another product i do that with
is this Revlon age-defying wrinkle
remedy line filler I'm running low on
that one so I have a backup and this is
just really really good for um putting
on areas after you prime your face
putting on areas that tend to crease and
I have a little sample of the hourglass
mineral veil primer love it I'll
probably end up purchasing a full-size
again I have gone through a full size
it's really beautiful beautiful finish I
have a lorac behind the scenes I primer
I shadow face I have two of the benefit
stay flawless 15-hour primers right here
they're good they're a little tacky like
they feel a little sticky on the skin
but that's really what makes them stay
all day um I have the elf glitter primer
glitter eye primer it's good i also have
the elf eyelid primer just the regular
one in the color nude i think is it nude

lot i also just have the original
formula of the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion I have the the balm put a
lid on it eyeshadow primer really like
this a lot I also have the Milani
eyeshadow primer very very good I have
this one from la splash cosmetics it's a
base or a sealer on top I use it as a
base it's nice it's kind of sticky I
have the tarina tarantino oops tarina
tarantino dull skin eye primer
it's also nice the little drawing i have
the professional license to blot this is
like a pre foundation thing that you put
on areas that your oily don't put it on
over your foundation that says you can
but I don't recommend it i recommend
putting it on an app I'm sorry don't put
it on after you applied foundation i
recommend pre-dawn before i have the
benefit that gal brightening face primer
it really is nice it does brighten up
the face it has like a pink color to it
I have a little small size of the becca
ever matte poreless priming Perfector I
have the cover FX calming primer this is
nice I wouldn't purchase a full size
though I have a small one of the
professional I have the elf hydrating
under eye primer this is it's not
necessary but it's nice for days where
you're really really dry under the under
eye and the last thing i have is another
two faced shadow insurance I primer so
those are all my primers my eye is my
face and also my makeup setting spray I
