is going to be my face palettes
collection I have all of the products
out here in front of me
the reason for that is because honestly
my Alex series 9 door does not hold all
of my face palettes very well and
everything would be stacked on top of
each other I don't have one of those
like perfectly organized makeup
collections so I thought it would be
easier for me to do it this way there
will be a few collection videos where
I'm also on camera I have packed up I
think 5 or 6 face palettes if you didn't
know we're moving but besides that this
is my entire face palette collection so
yeah anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into it I'm going to give you a
mini reviews along the way so the first
item I want to talk about is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills a moon child
glow kit this is what it looks like this
is probably my all-time favorite glow
kit it's very difficult because this is
not like the normal formula from Anasazi
of Beverly Hills it's a little harder to
work with in my opinion however I just
love the way that this looks on my fair
skin you guys I seriously do so this is
really really beautiful would highly
recommend checking it out it is now
permanent which is awesome if you do
want to get into like the holographic or
doom chromatic kind of craze this is a
really nice palette to work with because
you have some lighter options like blue
ice and then also pink hearts and Lucky
Clover has a little bit of a green shift
to it I'm going to show this in my
battle of the holographic slash a duo
chromatic highlighters for you guys on
Tuesday alright moving on we have the
sweet peach glow kit from Too Faced this
is what it looks like so we have a
bronzer as you can see a little blush or
blush topper they call it and then also
we have a highlight this highlight is
identical to the new little heart
highlight the oh gosh what's the shade I
think it's called ray of light if you
were looking at the new Too Faced
highlighters and you already have this
particular palette you already have that
shade they are literally just the same
exact thing just repackaged so I'm not a
huge fan of this you guys I don't know
if it will make it through another
declutter series I find this to be very
very orange e this is not very pigmented
I don't know why it's a blush topper
instead of a blush and then this guy
right here I just like so I'm not like
huge on it it's not my all-time favorite
palette but I do like to have it for
travel and also inside of my purse
alright here we have the hourglass a
2016 holiday palette this baby is
gorgeous we have one of the ambien
lighting strobing powders here we have a
blush a bronzer another blush and then a
strobing powder or just their regular
ambient lighting powder this is gorgeous
I love this palette but I'm a huge
sucker for the hourglass powders in
general this was very expensive for a
small amount of product but I knew
exactly what I was getting because I do
have the Year befores palette as well so
I love this I think it's beautiful if
you do have fair skin this would work
for you if you are medium to deep in
complexion this is not going to show up
on you but overall I really really love
this and the packaging is gorgeous
alright let's go ahead and move on to
this guy this was one of the best like
palettes in my opinion that released for
the holidays and I believe this is like
$25 right now on the Sephora comm
website it is the blushed bronzed and
ready to glow a face palette so you have
a bronzer you have a highlight you have
a deep warm toned blush and then a cool
toned blush you get huge pans in here I
hope you guys can see that they are
super super silky and buttery and by the
way I have reviewed pretty much all of
these so I will go ahead and you know
throw those up in the cards or link them
down below in the description bar I
think I'm only allowed to throw up like
six cards but yeah I have basically
reviewed all of these so if you want
swatches and stuff like that and I can
make that happen but yeah these are
beautiful super super finely milled
gorgeous really really happy with that
palette all right next we have the lorac
unzipped cheek palette this is coming
back I believe in summer 2017 or fall
2017 on the top you have two different
matte blushes then on the bottom you
have two shimmers these are my favorites
this one is a dupe for a maxim bask and
unimaginable is gorgeous on a fairer
skin so if you wanted to find this for
$25 it will be back at Ulta I believe
sometime in the summer or in the fall it
is really beautiful they are very finely
milled and they look gorgeous on the
skin and very very long wearing I was
kind of surprised I don't know why I
just thought that they wouldn't be
because they were so like finely milled
alright moving on we have the
kathleenlights makeup geek palette so I
do not like this really when I first got
it I honestly thought I would declutter
this I am in love with it now it really
really just has to be used with like the
perfect brush so what I do is I really
love the shade right here which is
called starlight at night
eight and then this one is sunlight and
what I do is I really pick it up with my
Sigma f30 five tapered highlighting
brush and then I just apply it to my
cheeks I don't tap off the excess it's a
little bit of like a big Chalet formula
but it still has like a powder and a
powder right next to it I don't know how
to describe it but I do have a review on
it with swatches and everything this is
a beautiful palette and I definitely
want to do a video for you guys all
about a product that I used to not be so
crazy about that I'm now into or I could
do you know products that I used to love
that I now hate all right moving on we
have the Kat Von D alchemist holographic
palette this is not going to look like
much in the pan but these do look
beautiful when you swatch them they are
very similar to a lot of the shades in
the moon child glow kit I did a review
and swatches in comparison so again I'll
throw that up in the cards for you but
yeah really really like this you do get
more product in the moon shell glow kit
and it is permanent so I would recommend
that one over this but this is really
cool if you are wearing a black base on
your eyes you can put this on and it
basically transforms as the eyeshadows
as well which is so cool all right here
we have the Tarte a 2016 blush wheel
color wheel so this has like a little
separating flap right here this was for
a holiday at 2016 and basically you have
the warm tone aside over here you have
one highlight and then blushes and then
you have a little flap and then you have
the cool tone side this was something
from Tarte that I was very very
impressed with and I just have to I mean
I just I love the Amazonian clay blushes
but only when they're the good ones like
these ones sometimes they put together
palettes really really quickly and
they're not as good I'm talking to you
this one big blush book too not as good
but this was really really fantastic if
you can still get your hands on this I
would highly recommend doing so it is so
so beautiful
alright I do have the Too Faced cocoa
contour kit over here I've had this for
years it is my second favorite
contouring palette I really like it for
my fair skin so that is a really good
one and then my all-time favourite
contouring palette is the it cosmetics
you sculpted for face and body this
shade right here called light contour is
stunning on fair skin and I just really
really enjoy this they are so so so
buttery you guys like I cannot even
explain how buttery alright next we have
the elf blush palette in door
but this is what it looks like this has
gone through many declutter videos with
me and it remains in my collection it's
beautiful I just don't like the scent on
these it smells really cheap but you
have to kind of bury shades down here
and then you have like a light pink and
kind of like a nudie color these are
very very pigmented you guys seriously
if you have a darker complexion this
will look great on you I also do have
the light version which I will show you
guys in a second but yeah definitely
would recommend checking out those
studio blush palettes all right I have
the anastacio Beverly Hills Sun dipped
glow kit this is gorgeous
I do have these Suites already packed
away but really really loving this so
far I like these three shades a lot
right here and this one right here is
also beautiful so this shade which is
called summer and moonstone are
definitely true highlights on me and
then bronze I can use as an actual
bronzer alright next we have the Sephora
collection this is their illuminate
palette and this is what it looks like I
want to do a comparison of this against
the Nicole Guerrero glow kit over there
for you guys I'm going to be doing like
a battle of the what am I going to do oh
yeah the Anastacio beverly hills glow
kits i'll probably include this or
something like that but yeah this is
really really beautiful you guys it's
definitely not as good a quality as say
like a regular glow kit in my opinion
they're not as soft and buttery but you
still get a lot of product in here a lot
of different colors and a lot of these
are actually like color dupes for like
the back of highlighters and also
obviously honest hacia beverly hills
highlighters and i love the packaging on
this so would recommend checking that
out it is very much worth the price
alright my all-time favorite face
palette you guys yep the Becca Jaclyn
hill champagne collection face palette
I'm in love with this you have two
different blushes you have a luminous
flush is that what it's called and then
you have let's see here Pomplamoose and
ooh amaretto this one right here a
champagne pop and Prosecco pop I love
this I won't talk about it too much
because I know you can't get this
anymore but it is beautiful love the
packaging I mean I'm not even subscribed
to Jacqueline Hale but still you know
what that was a great palette
here's another palette from Becca and
Jacqueline Hale this is their palette
that they came out with the year before
the champagne collection so this one had
let's see here blush copper yeah
champagne pop and also pearl Annette
really really gorgeous you guys really
enjoyed that
not as good because I feel like you got
more banging your buck with this one but
again both of those were limited-edition
you can't get them anymore so I won't
talk about them too much here is the
hourglass 2015 a palettes you have a
bronzer two different blushes you have
an ambient lighting ambient lighting
strobing powder in the middle and then
you have two of their ambient lighting
powders on each side love this love this
love this I have made quite a dent I
don't think you guys will be able to see
but I have made quite a dent in this it
is beautiful I love the formula on the
hourglass powders I just I just do and
these strobing powders in the middle
there are one of my favorite
highlighting formulas so yes really
really really enjoy that alright moving
on we have the Bobbi Brown Bobbi to glow
shimmer brick palette for holiday 2016
this has three different shimmer bricks
in it gold bronze and also rose really
really gorgeous again won't talk about
it too much because I know that it was
limited edition but I like to use this
as a blush this is a bronzer and this as
a highlight all right so we have the
viola Foss Pro highlighting palette I
know they are releasing a new one as
well but these are really really nice
they do have a little bit of texture to
them they kind of her mom remind me of
like the glow kit formula they have like
a little bit of like thickness to them
if that makes sense but really really
gorgeous and foiled on the skin alright
moving on we have the Tarte what is this
Tartus blush palette I love this one
this is like the perfect formula that I
really really enjoy from them so yeah
you have a nice arrangement of shades
there I'm sure you could find all of
these in like a similar color in
full-size if that makes sense
I know these were limited edition but I
feel like Tarte always consistently
releases the same shades kind of but
yeah these were beautiful really really
love that formula when it is the good
like true quality formula it's amazing
they last all day they don't like have a
bunch of kick up they're just really
really good products you guys all right
I have the elf shimmer palette right
here I used one of them up for a project
pan and then this one I have hit quite a
bit of pan on it's nice it's not my
favorite like cream highlighting kind of
palette I don't love cream highlights
but it's still pretty darn good I do
like to wear this when I am wearing very
very minimal makeup I just kind of tap
it on it to a my skin and all four
shades are a true highlight on me all
right here is the elf blush palette in
light this one is really nice if you do
have a light or medium complexion like I
said
very finely milled they do feel a little
scratchy till the touch it but they go
on beautifully they've been blend
beautifully and they have a huge amount
of color payoff so love that
here is the elf illuminating palette
these are definitely do for the
hourglass ambient lighting powders this
one especially in light and this one I
think mood light or maybe a cereal light
these are beautiful very very silky and
buttery and you definitely can get like
a bambam highlight in your face kind of
thing if you want to so I would highly
recommend checking it out if you are
someone who really likes subtle
highlight or if you kind of want to
build it up on the skin it still works
really well alright here we have the
lorac take me to tent eco palette it has
tan Antonio tan Diego combo Tim Lucas
and tanta Cruz these are so beautiful
very very finely milled and buttery
again kind of similar to the lorac
unzipped blush palette the two on top
are matte and then the two on the bottom
are shimmers I really love these two
shades right here so yeah I don't know
if this is still available but I do
enjoy it and then here we have the
volume one of the Tarte
what was this this was the skin twinkle
lighting palette now I did not like the
second volume that they came out with
but this one was pretty darn good this
this thing right here this was a total
mess this was like sandpaper it's
basically like a setting powder you
really have to kind of gouge it out to
make sure that you can really get in
there and actually use it it's a little
too yellow tone for me but these two
highlights are very silky and buttery
and beautiful so I prefer this formula
over the new one that they released and
then we do have the new nicole guerrero
glow kit I have been loving this I know
some people have been having issues with
this I personally have not my two
favorite shades are kitty cat and
Forever Young and yeah it's just
absolutely beautiful I would highly
recommend applying it and then going in
with a fluffy brush to pick up any sort
of glitter if you're getting glitter
particles the only one that I notice in
my palette that has a lot of glitter is
the shade daydreamed and finally we have
the tarte big blush book too and now
this is not the normal beautiful blush
formula I'm used to unfortunately it
probably it's like on the brink of being
decluttered in my next declutter that I
do probably next year but I want to try
them out as eyeshadows these are just
very very powdery and not what I know
and love from Tarte so kind of
disappointing with that and it was $60
so yeah that was kind of a bummer but
yeah I don't know I would be careful
when these
like big blush books or whatever come
out it seems like you're getting a lot
of bang for your buck but it's not the
original formula so that is it I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
