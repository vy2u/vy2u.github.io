my channel happy Sunday I have another
make up I was gonna say declutter nope
already did that makeup collection video
for you guys a two day if you did watch
my makeup declutter during the fall you
know that I think I've decluttered about
what was it 15 to 20 highlighters so
this is what my collection looks like
now now I do have 14 others that I have
already boxed up since we are moving
very soon those are basically just
duplicates of certain products and I
will tell you which ones they are
like my all-time favorite highlighters I
do have backups of so I did go ahead and
pack those up so - like twelve or
fourteen extras but yeah this is my
current highlighter collection it is a
lot more manageable I know it still
looks probably insane for the average
person but I feel like a lot of people
on YouTube especially if you're a
collector you do have this amount here
and yeah I just love being able to shop
my stash every single week and you know
pick out a different highlighter so let
me show you guys what I have the first
one is probably one of my all-time
favorites it is the Dior glowing gardens
what is this like a big shield a kind of
highlight is this is in the shade
glowing pink and unfortunately this was
a limited edition but they did a release
a permanent collection that does have a
shade very similar to this I believe
this shade is called 0-2 so this is that
typical kind of baked Chalet formula so
you have kind of like a hybrid between a
cream a gel and a powder basically
everything that you then put into a
highlighter that is what is in here it
is absolutely beautiful I love this
particular shade and yes I really enjoy
that all right here I have the lorac
what is this not the colorsource I think
it's just called the highlighting oh let
me look
illuminating highlight in the shade
Twilight so this is really interesting
um I feel like this is a little dark on
my skin sometimes I just use it more as
like a blush topper but has a beautiful
shift to it you guys see that really
nice kind of gold shift and it looks
amazing on the skin it reminds me a
little bit of our glasses dim light but
like a more like a vamped up version so
if you do like that kind of coloring I
think you would enjoy this alright do
the next one I have here is from Bobbi
Brown this is the a Bobbi - glow shimmer
brick I'm sorry this is not a summer
break this is just the afternoon glow
highlighter it is a beautiful kind of
rose gold shade again it is a Baker's la
fórmula I love baked shalay formulas
and this is so like
intense and in-your-face I remember when
they released this they did not release
any shades lighter than this this was
the lightest one but I still use it I
still use it as a highlight and blush
topper so I really love that here we
have of course a Becca's arosa quartz
what kind of highlighting collection
video with the C without me showing this
this is probably one of my all-time
favorite highlighters I do have a backup
of this I ended up buying a duplicate
when they first released so this is what
it looks like it's a gorgeous gorgeous
color I nicked it right there which is
sexy but yeah I feel like this would
work for a lot of different skin tones
pretty much everybody and no matter what
undertone you have it's going to work
because this is a neutral Undertown it
doesn't Lena more cool toned or a more
warm tone so it's really really
beautiful love that and then another a
Becca highlight right here is a
moonstone and moonstone is definitely
more a yellow base but I still think
it's really beautiful opal is too dark
for me so I reach for this one a lot
more and I actually prefer this over
pearl I don't know why because this
house like a warm undertone but for some
reason it gives a little bit of life to
my face so I really love that and then
of course the new one that released
which is called a prismatic amethyst
this is just oh my god look at it look
at it I feel like I need a backup of
this one as well it's a really really
gorgeous kind of like opalescent white
shade with a lavender shift to it I feel
like this would look good on a lot of
different skin tones as well my friend
Sonora has a very deep complexion this
looked a little ashy on her she didn't
like it she does like the rose quartz
one though so if you have more of like a
fear to light complexion I think this
would be really really good alright
moving on I have my over Rodeo Drive
highlighter this is what it looks like I
love this baby it's a typical kind of
powder formula but it's super super soft
you guys and I just found out the over
his cruelty free which is awesome so
yeah I really do enjoy that and I want
to get the shade blissful which is more
pinky toned as well here I have the jus
a a rose quartz highlighter this is what
it looks like it is a big jewel a
formula as you guys can see he had a
little bit of hard pan there as usual
with the big jewel a kind of products
but yeah this is gorgeous as well I feel
like I kind of prefer this over Becca's
rose quartz but only because it is a big
Chalet formula I like the shade better
for the Becca but this one's a little
lighter it has kind of like a unit
Dustin's
silvery undertone to a new Becca one is
just like a
pink color and it is darker than my
complexion but I can still pull it off
all right here I have the Clinique hefty
highlight stick and this is what it
looks like again I do enjoy that it's
probably one of like the cream products
that I actually enjoy as far as
highlighting is concerned alright NARS
Copacabana love this it's a liquid
illuminator I also have super orgasm
which I will show you guys in a second
but yeah these are beautiful I like
mixing this into my foundation it's a
beautiful kind of like pinky whitish
silvery color so if you do have a cool
undertone I think you would enjoy that
as well here I have the wet and wild
precious petals a big delay yes
eventually from the drugstore
highlighter my friend actually sent this
to me and I love it it is beautiful it
is darker than my skin so I kind of just
buff it in over my blush but it is so
intense and beautiful you guys I love
this alright moving on I have it this
little guy here this is actually a baked
bronzer but it comes off as a
highlighter even on my skin tone this is
from hard candy and the shade is called
Tiki and I really enjoy this a lot some
people say that they get ones that are
kind of like rough to the touch
I've had this one for three years and
it's really soft and buttery and I love
the way it looks on my cheeks so I do
enjoy that of course I have some of my
Laura Geller baked gelato swirl
illuminators I have all three shades I
think she has five shades out now but I
have three different shades this one
right here is everybody's favorite it is
gilded honey which is like a true gold
really really beautiful especially if
you do have like a tan complexion I feel
like this looks amazing
alright I also have this little wet and
wild Fergie I know that they just
continue this but this is the center
stage collection highlight indie shade
let me look um let's see Hollywood
Boulevard normally I know all the names
of my products because I just I like to
get through them and I'd like to know
who they are but yeah this is Hollywood
Boulevard it is darker than my
complexion so again I kind of use it
more as like a blush topper I feel like
they should have shown the rest of the
blush toppers in this video but I'll
show those in the blush video but yeah
it's really really beautiful very very
creamy and I'm glad that they
discontinued that Fergie line alright
here I have my new custom I want to say
custom every single time these are the
cover FX custom enhancer drops in the
shade halo they are really really
gorgeous you guys it is definitely one
of those like holographic kind of things
a very strong purpley and blue undertone
so if you're not into that you probably
won't like this but I was really
surprised at how natural you can get
these to look you can mix this in with
like foundations that are a little too
warm toned for you and it will cool it
down I don't know I'm really into these
so I think I want to pick up the shade
celestial as well as a blossom which is
one of their new shades here I have a
little laura geller this is a baked
highlight and I do not know the name of
this this is an important female which
is a really really nice kind of I would
describe it as like a rosy toned gold as
you guys can see super super gorgeous
look at the reflection on that damn but
yeah these are really really beautiful I
bought these because I heard emily noel
eighty-three raving about this one right
here which is called a french vanilla so
I did go ahead and pick up a little trio
of them is this one French oven on no
this is golden rose I have no idea what
there was french vanilla
this is golden rose this one has a
little more of like a champagne tone to
it and then French vanilla is a really
really nice kind of neutral yellow shade
and it really is just the perfect kind
of barely-there
highlight so I do enjoy those I have one
of my all-time favorite highlights here
this is the Laura Mercier this is the
match or radiance a baked powder
highlights in 0-1 this is amazing it
looks like it would be like crispy to
the touch and it wouldn't give a lot of
glow but I am telling you right now this
gives you the glow of like a baked shell
a kind of highlighter it's amazing
absolutely stunning on the skin you need
this if you do have a Sarah complexion
another thing that you need if you're
about fair complexion is definitely one
of the hourglass ambient lighting
powders and either mood exposure I think
it is no that's the blush booth light
which is like the yellow toned one or
this one which is called ethereal light
this is mark cool toned I love this for
setting underneath my eyes I can build
it up as a highlight I feel like these
powders are just so like you know you
can multitask with them which I love so
really enjoy that here I have of course
a mary lou manizer can't forget about
her I'm not as crazy about her anymore
you guys I just feel like I have so many
good highlights now that she's just kind
of like mad but remember when like mary
loumanizer was like the only highlight
anybody ever talked about kind of funny
alright here I have the Too Faced
candlelight glow duo and I have hit some
major
harpeia on these I need to go ahead and
duct tape this but yeah you have a pink
on one side and then a golden on the
other side the pink shade is super super
firmly pressed so I just like to mix the
two together but yeah really really
beautiful here I have the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter in a moonstone
in the liquid version again I like to
mix this into my foundations that's
mostly what I do with liquid
illuminators unless they have like a
really strong color like this guy right
here and this is the Stila all-over
liquid illuminator in the shade rose
gold I like to use this actually more as
like a blush topper as well and
basically I just apply it with a damp
Beauty Blender or a beauty sponge and I
use Beauty blenders you guys know what I
mean damp a little spongebob and I put
it over like a powder blush and I feel
like it looks really really nice so I do
enjoy that speaking of that we do have
NARS is super orgasm over here and these
names are just everything this is super
orgasm and it's pretty orgasmic looking
look at that it's like this beautiful
like sunset kind of I don't even know
you have like a dark peachy shade with
like gold iridescent super super
beautiful again I like to use that more
as like a blush or a blush topper all
right over here I do have that new
highlight from and makeup forever this
is the profusion in 0:01
this is their new bootleg kind of
gorgeous pinky iridescent highlight and
it's right up my alley really really do
enjoy back over here I have the wet and
wild girls bar my friend sent this to me
I love it it is a big Chalet formula and
I believe the shade is called Goldilocks
I can actually pull this off on at my
skin tone which I really adore and yeah
it's super beautiful all right here I
have Urban Decay's powder highlighter in
the shade Ora and I never knew why the
packaging was like this apparently you
can pick it up and then you like rub
your brush here instead of having a
mirror I don't know if I like that but
it's kind of cool so this is what aura
looks like it is a cool toned pink shade
I recently tried out their new liquid
illuminators or highlighters they sucked
but these are quite good alright I have
another Dior highlight right here this
one is in the shade zero let me see zero
zero one so this was the collection I
was talking about that's not permanent
so the pink shade that is in this one is
called 0-2 so if you want this more kind
of like peachy goldish color you can go
for zero what is it again zero one if
you want the more pinky one you can go
for 0-2 you'll be able to see when you
get on to the actual sephora.com website
they have a bunch of different shades
which i think is awesome and I wanted to
show you guys where'd I go I can't even
find it that gorgeous gorgeous
wet-and-wild what was it like the
baekchul a precious petals highlight is
like an exact dupe for this so I'm gonna
show that in my next dupes video but
yeah really really beautiful
alright here I have the Lancome
highlight sub teal this reminds me of
like color pop like was this package at
color pop like what is this it's indeed
0-6 I got this any sephora favorites kid
I just like it kind of like isn't Oliver
bronzer kind of thing I don't know this
may not make it through my next
declutter all right I have one of the
new at Too Faced highlights of this
particular shade is called
what does this want to keep forgiving
you light up my life this was the only
one I really really truly loved blinded
by the light I just felt like I had to
build up so much and it was just getting
annoying and then also the other shade
which is called ray of light it was just
too it's too similar to the sweet peach
glow kit so anyway I'm returning those
or I'm gonna give them to friends but
this one is beautiful I love it I would
like to put it on top as like again a
blush topper and I think it looks really
good
alright here I have a rainbow
highlighter I have swatched it once I
have never worn it on my face it's just
kind of like a collector's item it is
from Wet n Wild and this was sent to me
by my friend as well so very very
exciting
another laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator this particular shade is
called ooh do I not know oh it's peach
glow peach glow really really beautiful
and especially if you do have more of
like a warm undertone I think that's a
really nice one right here I do have one
of my favorites another one of these
first let me just let me just let's do
this guy so this is one of my favorites
this is charming pink from laura geller
again the baked gelato swirl illuminator
formula you can see I've used quite a
bit of this I prefer this over I'm
filled with honey and the peach one just
because this is like perfect for me I
just I love like cool toned pink you
know like white kind of silvery
highlights it's just totally my thing so
really enjoy that and then at the Tarte
exposed highlight ah Tarte why do you
have to be so inconsistent because this
 is so good I really wanted the pink
one as well I believe it's gonna be in
the alter 21 days of beauty sale which I
know so many of you have been asking me
to do a video
on that I don't think I'm gonna be able
to do one this year but I promise to do
one for the Sephora Spring Sale but yeah
this is a beautiful beautiful very very
smooth Dometic home like kind of a
highlight I can't really describe the
texture because it's not a big Chalet
but it's also not powder it's just very
very special and I really do enjoy that
it never emphasizes like fine lines or
wrinkles no matter no matter how much
you put on it just looks amazing
alright I do have a little opal what is
this yeah it's Becca's opal right here I
mix it into foundations when I need to
darken things up here I have a little
Smashbox color wheel this is in the
shade starburst and I bought this
because the Emily Noel 83 it's really
pretty it's more of like a bronzer on me
but it's technically a highlight so I
thought I would show it in this video I
don't really like this I'm pretty sure
I'm going to declutter this this is the
vintage by Jessica Liebeskind live skin
I got this in a boxy charm it is a rose
gold highlight it looks amazing but as
you can see it's a very very textured
and it emphasizes my pores like crazy
now what's funny is that I recently got
this little duo right here in a boxy
charm and it's from the same brand but
these are so smooth and creamy they're
like a big shell a formula so I'm like
listen why do this when you can do this
these are really gorgeous so this shade
is called I believe I think it's
strawberries and chocolate so really
really pretty they are a little deeper
than at my skin but and they still work
for me and just because a highlight is
deeper than your skin tone does not mean
it you can't glow with it all right here
is Urban Decay's a powder highlighter in
mashite sin this is just a beautiful
true champagne color of course I have my
oh yes my all-time favorite this is the
hourglass ambient strobing lighting
powder in the shade incandescent light I
have three of these yep the other two
are already boxed up I love these I also
have the shade of brilliant light right
here and this one is more like gold
toned as you guys can see oh yeah so
this one's more gold toned and then this
one's more pinky and I just love these I
really really love them all right here I
have the up lighting powder from
Clinique this is a new shade 0:02 nude
and I do like this I feel like it's very
similar to the hourglass powders but
this you get like what like eight grams
of product in here I feel like I'm gonna
estimate that that's about 8 grams you
get about 8 grams of product in here and
honestly I like a little goes a very
long way
way cheaper Clinique is a you know
although I won't be purchasing from them
further because they do animal tests I
will say they really have good prices
you guys ever noticed that when you're
at Sephora Clinic has like good prices I
feel like their foundations are like $20
and that little guy right there was only
22 I think all right next I have this
little makeup forever sculpting duo and
the reason why I'm showing it in this
video instead of the bronzer videos
because I never use the bronzer it's a
big Chalet formula and this highlight
right here oh yes it is so beautiful you
guys like so so so beautiful I
absolutely adore that and yeah I should
have gotten the pink version as well I
think they have like a zero one but that
one's in zero two here is one of my
favorite drugstore highlight so this is
the vivid baked highlighter from
revolution and makeup revolution I feel
like it isn't makeup evolution or
revolution I've heard people say it
differently but yeah this is a new shade
golden lights very very pigmented very
similar to the Too Faced duo that I
showed you guys actually I'll probably
hold onto this in my next declutter and
let go of it your face alright and then
over here we have one of my favorite
little secret gems this is the Josie
Maran Argan enlightenment aluminized
veil and it doesn't look like much at
all and it looks super dark this is
amazing it will give you like the most
beautiful glow from within it kind of
reminds me of the clinic up lighting
powder but I just it's stunning you guys
you should pick that up for real
and then finally I have my Illamasqua
powder highlight in the shade oh my god
and it is a true kind of champagne shade
so I will go ahead and throw up in the
links right now if you guys want to see
like a battle videos between these I
have done a battle of the pink
highlights I have done a battle of the
champagne highlights where i swatched
everything out and then I have I done a
gold highlights yet I guess that one's
on the list now that I can't speak that
ones on the list now so anyway that is
the guys those are my highlighters that
I currently have for 2017 I'm so happy I
feel like I can actually make the rounds
through this collection I felt like last
year was just ridiculous and I was
reaching for the same thing over and
over which I tend to do and I feel like
I shouldn't be doing that you know I
shouldn't be like getting too many of
like one thing if I know that I really
only like love my hourglass strobing
powders that exposed highlight but I
don't know
trying to you know switch up my
highlighter weekly and it's fun it's fun
to try out different stuff it's fun to
shop your stash so anyway hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm blabbering I'm
gonna Gail and I will see you tomorrow
