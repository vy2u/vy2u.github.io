have another collection video for you
tonight at this time we are going
through some of my eyeshadow singles as
well as miscellaneous brow products my
eyeliners and also of course my mascaras
all of these are currently open which i
know is horrible I do have I think 17
right now that are in a different drawer
that have not been opened yet they're
basically just like back up some of the
ones in here so i just want to let you
guys know I do keep ones that are not
open yet but yeah all of these are open
which is horrible don't do that because
mascara goes bad pretty darn quickly I
just can't help myself I want to always
have a new NOS dará every single week
before shot my stash I totally love
mascara so anyway I am going to start
just like kind of putting them up there
in that little allure beauty box we just
might give you guys quick little review
on each one so the person we have here
is from benefit this is the very real
mascara it does have a rubber bristle
wand and it's kind of like a little
medieval torture device except a little
ball on one end and then it's just
really like spiky basically it's
wonderful you guys this is a wonderful
wonderful mascara we're highly highly
recommend checking that out if you are
looking for length here is the covergirl
clump crusher I believe this is in me
block of brown at version I believe like
this version it's very very like natural
looking I feel like this is a very
natural mascara in general so if you
want to look even more naturally to go
for the brown version this is also a rep
reversal wand and I really feel like it
helps to just get rid of all sorts of
clumps now i do like clumpy eyelashes
but sometimes I don't and you know if I
have like a performance at a church or
something I never want to look too
overdone basically so I do wear
something like this or if I'm playing at
a wedding or something I really enjoy
using this and very minimal makeup all
right I do have to fear from the alte
brand I recently have just kind of
jumped into the Ulta brand since they
are cruelty-free you guys know I love
these sephora collection but they do
tests on animals so i have been very
interested in trying out some of the
stuff from Ulta these are just ok this
is the B plus drama mascara it is a
natural bristle wand and I thought like
it was quick gloopy I didn't really like
the formula and then this one is the
legendary length this is a river whistle
wand and it's nice the shade i got was a
black brown I feel like it gives a
little bit of volume but not too much
length even though it's called legendary
length all right here we have B lore'l
what is
voluminous feline mascara I don't like
this by itself that I do like it to pair
together with other mascaras so it's
pretty darn good my all-time favorite
favorite I'm lash primer this is the
Urban Decay subversion lash primer by
the way sorry I cut myself this is the
subversion alas primer a thicker longer
stronger this stuff is amazing it's like
the only last primer that I like a
little benefit they're real tinted lash
primer right here this is really nice is
basically just like a brown at mascara
with the same sort of wand at the
original formula my all-time favorite
mascara is the Sephora collection
outrageous curl mascara won't be
repurchasing since these sephora
collection does test on animals but this
has the tiniest little wand it is a
rubber crystal worn it really just gives
amazing amazing volume curl and also
linked so it's kind of like a trifecta
sort of product all right I have another
clump crusher this one easy in black
like I said if you enjoy that this is
the Charlotte Tilbury a full fat
laughter this will send to meet for it
PR in exchange for an honest review I
think it's just okay I don't think it's
worth like it like $32 price tag I don't
think it's worth that but it gives you
very very natural fluffy looking
eyelashes so if you like the look of
like natural like oh you know this is
just how my life is look then you may
like that but I'm more of less than ours
audacious kind girl I just like to clump
them up real good so speaking of the
North audacious is amazing i'm going to
get 8 full size of this and when i run
out of the little trial size it is just
so good you guys i really really enjoy
this formula i guess i shouldn't say the
formula that's why I'm sorry I take it
back I do not enjoy the formula i love
the wand I want to keep the wand on
that's maybe I won't purchase a
full-size the formula is actually very
very connected and very wet so I noticed
that it starts to travel all over my
eyes throughout the day I feel like it's
really bad when I master it is super dry
or super wet I can't do this like during
the summertime so i'll probably just
feel the wand out of there i do have a
few of the lancome hypnose dramas love
this master you guys it is so friggin
good but won't be reports playing
anymore because they do tests on animals
it smells amazing it has a really nice
stands out natural bristle brush it
gives just beautiful beautiful
definition and volumes alright here i
have the iconic clap I
comment laughs I don't even know I don't
like this I'm going to be decluttering
this when i do my next declutter video
it is a rubber bristle wands and I have
like three little balls on it but he
couldn't know and I'm talking about
right it's like boom boom boom and it
looks like it would be so cool but it
literally did nothing for my lashes so
yeah not a huge fan of that I do have to
layer that when I'm wearing it because
alone a little bit of nothing are you
having little Tuesday's better than sex
mascara here you guys will see a full
size in my empties video this month I
already popped it in the bin this is the
wet and wild and max volume applause
mascara this is a really really nice
like every be friendly kind of mascara
and it's only 399 so if you enjoy back I
do not like this cover girl so lastly a
mascara you guys will probably see this
in a product sales video coming up soon
the more I'm use this the more I'm like
my gosh I just keep poking my eye out
and I was thinking of clipping off a
little ball like at the end of the wand
because I just keep injuring myself but
I also think the formula is not that
great I find that it goes on very wet
but then it starts to flake throughout
the day on that my cheek so another huge
fan of this I love the covergirl super
sizer but this was just not that great
all right I do have the bomb cosmetics
mad lash as well as the amoeba lean at
the falsies push up drama this is a dupe
of for this guy right here which is the
laura mercier extra lap sculpting
mascara very nice perspective product
there as well let's see here I have
these L'Oreal telescopic carbon black
this has a eppp little wand and it's
great speaking of little ecbc ones this
is the clinic bottom lash mascara the
main one is just as good at just how
they're really very tiny little wand
here is the diorshow mascara I hate this
it's just like a really fluffy wand and
it does nothing for my lashes a little
like a what like twenty thirty forty
dollar mascara no all right here is the
Smashbox what is this photo finish last
primer I do not like this to have a very
cool one but it does not compare to the
Urban Decay's on that I have here is the
Loreal voluminous a butterfly mascara I
feel like this I think I don't like it
more when i use it when i was in college
i don't know if my lashes are just
getting crappier or what but it doesn't
work as well as i remember but it is
pretty good all right next I have a via
Bobby Brown a smokey eye mascara this is
really good i do enjoy this bobby brown
those tests on animals so i'm not going
to get a full size but it's a really
nice
natural bristle wand and it was very
densely packed it's got a nice formula
not too dry not to what really like that
here is the ACOG medic superhero mascara
not the biggest fan of those you guys I
do have to pair it together with the
very west mascara like your Lancome
Hypnose drama or like being ours
audacious because this flakes on you
like crazy kind of like the toothpaste
better than sex and then finally the
Urban Decay perversion master a really
nice wet mascara it goes together really
nicely with the cosmetics all right over
here I'm not gonna show I mean I I don't
even know how I'm gonna show you guys
that's okay so I just have some random
singles in duo's here if you guys watch
them my declutter a videos in the past
few years I got rid of so many singles I
just never reach for them but this is
the color molten GOI like to use that as
an eye base as a few little caviar sixth
here from Laura Mercier some Nick's
prismatic shadows the Loreal infallible
shadows those are gorgeous and more of
the knicks my stila glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadow i want to get all of
these one of my favorite brow products
which is the brow drama from maybelline
i do have this little liquid eye shadow
here from covergirl I have never even
tried it and I've never even tried this
little guy from Clinique I just I don't
reach her this stuff is often my
favorite brow pencil as of right now is
the Revlon Colorstay in the shade of
blonde and I have another one of the
Loreal infallible eyeshadows and then
underneath that i have negative three of
these in my collection currently this is
the chic naturals maybelline single
indeed linen i used to use that all the
time in college so i bought like 16 of
them and not its interested ok here is
the beauty of basics i don't know this
was just a little single that I got in a
beauty subscription box I do it love
steal a kitten especially as a highlight
so I do like to hang on to that and then
some of the best eyeshadows you guys
seriously singles of these guys right
here these are the polio crushed
eyeshadows this particular shade is
called to do really eclipse and then the
other one is called i got i remember
it's a funny name xenons you go to
remember that oh my god it's all so old
but yeah these are beautiful is very
very pigmented kind of like a foil
finish and then i have an old-school
Urban Decay eyeshadow here this is so
old-school let me show you guys you
literally like oh wait again
okay can't get it but it's a beautiful
beautiful deep blue color it's like it
looks like a midnight sky or something
I've never found anything quite as
beautiful so I do keep that and then I
do happy forever 21 cream I shuttle this
is really good to shade of called
shitake and I do have some glitters back
there as well as my little mac equal
litter here and you shade Rose I just
look at this because it's so pretty I
think I've ever even music and then
towards the back even further i do have
a Maybelline duo right here eyeshadow I
have a little Hello Kitty set with a
bunch of different eyeliners in it that
I use a for travel and then I have some
ver al product bes camara BTW you will
see any product sales video tune they
are from covergirl and they are ship
there is the revlon colorstay a brow
pencil wait no its brow Fantasy Island
like I said the other one gap no this is
brow fantasy also really good and then I
do just have two rails cancels back here
I'm not huge on browse guys like when I
find something that works i'm like great
it works and by the way the glitters
that i do have that clear are from
bhcosmetics okay now let's go ahead and
talk about eyeliners i do have a few
kind of like gel potted eyeliners tart
and makes some great little clay pops
and this one right here is in the shade
mint and then this one is in rose gold
and i know i talked about her being
inconsistent all the time but this is an
example of a good product from them here
i do have the evil akiza's ease by yves
this is a conditioning smudge-proof a
gel liner haven't tried this yet got it
in a subscription box I'll let's see
here if you have this little gel
eyeliners here again from a forever 21
they make really good cream eyeshadows
and gel eyeliners and then a double
black and brown cream eyeliner from her
cosmetics alright and then here I just
have my pencil liners this is only half
of them the other ones i did already
pack because they're basically just
doubled if you've been walking me for a
while you know as you like the lung comb
what are these these are the drama
liquid pencils these are quite nice we
gave about three or four of those now
but my all-time favorite formula of
eyeliner for sure is the Urban Decay
24-7 glide on eye pencils I think I have
every single shade probably not in here
right now
I do have pretty much every single shade
I just love these they're so good at
staying on the waterline I know some
people say this doesn't work for them
but for me it works I can get it off at
night which I enjoy and then also I do
love the Smashbox kohl liner pencil 0z
Ali sharp this one is indeed Raven and
then this one has been a favorite of
mine for a while this is indeed sumantra
we also have this one right here with
susan b shades storm if i were to
recommend any eyeliner formulas i would
recommend the lancome as well as the
Urban Decay the mixed slide on glide on
stay on and definitely a Toronado
eyeliners were pretty darn good as well
if you want something cheaper but yeah
it would see that kind of mix up the
majority of my eyeliners I just I just
pay I'm obsessed like these urban decay
bonds guy so I just pretty much buy
those so anyway back to be before this
video I'm going to have not put this
little guy that's down there I hope you
guys enjoyed it this little installment
in my collection series thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you
