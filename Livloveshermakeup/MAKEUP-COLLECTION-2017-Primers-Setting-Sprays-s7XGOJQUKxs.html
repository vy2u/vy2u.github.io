my channel today's video is going to be
my primary collection as well as my
setting sprays for 2017 I have my little
Alec series 9 drawer right here and I
will be going ahead and doing a beauty
room tour for you guys soon as well as a
perfume collection I have the rest of my
perfumes down there so I will talk about
those items all of this little stuff
that you guys see behind me in my videos
I will talk about that when I get to
those videos but yeah I thought I would
walk you guys through my primers I have
started to pack up a lot of my makeup if
you didn't know Tom and I are moving we
are moving in like a 90 days so I was
even like I don't know I was
contemplating whether or not to do
makeup collection videos but a lot of
you were requesting that basically this
is long story short a lot of you are
requesting them and a lot of you were
asking if I would go drawer by drawer
this year so that is what I am going to
do you guys know me I'm super super fast
and quick and of course I just want to
film it all in one sitting but this will
be easier in that way I can also give
you guys many reviews so anyway this is
my Alex series 9 drawer I have let's see
here primers and setting sprays also
eyeliners and mascaras bronzers setting
powders face pallets let's see here are
two drawers of eyeshadow palettes there
will be lots of good stuff for you guys
to see these are gonna be a little
spread out I don't really know I'll
probably throw up like two or three at a
time but they will be spread out over
the next couple of weeks just because I
do have so many videos that I need to
film for you guys so I hope you don't
mind but yeah let's go ahead and jump
right into it so this is the top a
drawer I have some face primers right
here and then I have my eye primers
right here more face primers that didn't
fit I have my setting sprays and then
also some little like random primers so
I want to say I did a huge declutter
this year if you have not watched any of
my declutter videos you might like to
watch those when I declutter I really
declutter so I'm very happy with the
size of this collection as of right now
normally before this my primer drawer
was taking up like 2 different drawers
so it was this one and the second one so
I'm very happy with this I feel like
primers do kind of go bad quickly
especially if they're like very very
liquidy so I'm very very happy and
hopefully I'll be able to get through
all this stuff so I do just store these
in little subscription box like lids I
guess you could say and I just like to
do it that way I don't know I'm not into
purchasing all that super super
expensive like acrylic stuff I do have a
few pieces that you guys will see
but they are mostly like they were from
the dollar store I think yeah I think
they were from like Dollar Tree or
something so anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it right here I have
some face primers the first one is the
YSL 2 sheet claw this is a really really
beautiful silicone based primer would
highly recommend if you do have dry skin
normal skin and also combination skin
and then right here I have the Becca
backlight priming a filter this is not
something that I'm a huge fan of it is
any current project pan as you guys can
see it and for me personally I think
this is great if you do have more like
normal or dry skin but I just think it
leaves a little bit of an artificial
like cast to my skin it just looks very
very shiny and unnatural so I'm not a
huge fan of it would not repurchase this
little guy right here was sent to me for
PR I will tell you guys when items were
sent for PR I would say 98% of my
collection I purchased with my own money
but I will always tell you if something
was sent so this is the pure no filter
what is this called
blurring photography primer I don't like
this when I do at my next declutter
video which will probably be sometime
next year this is gonna go maybe I need
to play with it a little more I could
possibly use it as a highlight because
it has a really strong like gold shift
but also you guys can see the packaging
like broke and now it's like squirting
out everywhere and I just think that's
really gross alright I do have the balm
cosmetics time balm this is a really
nice silicone at base to primer very
very similar to like the maybelline baby
skin so yeah I do like that but I would
recommend purchasing them maybe
Maybelline maybe yeah the maybelline
baby skin because it is cheaper here I
have the Stila aqua glow perfecting
primer this is great for those of you
who do have oily or combination skin
this is not going to do it much as far
as hydrating or really like smoothing
out pores but it will help to keep your
foundation on it's one of those makeup
extenders that's very very tacky and
then I do have the coverall primer from
wet and wild I feel like this is a dupe
for the it cosmetics what is it primer
veil the white one the pink one I'll
talk about in a second but the white one
so I decluttered the white one and I
kept this one I think it's awesome and
it is currently in my project pan it is
more of a makeup extender as well here I
have the milk makeup water cooling stick
this reminds me so much of the Stila
aqua glow so I don't know which one is
more pricey I think the Stila is I would
highly recommend picking this up again
if you do have combo or oily skin this
is great
all right here let's just grab the guy
in the wrong little wrong little drawer
this is the maybelline baby skin it's
just a very very silicone face primer I
like it it is very very thick and I
don't really recommend for those of you
who do have dry skin I feel like this
starts to ball up on dry skin but for me
personally I do like to use it in my
t-zone all right as far as eye primers
are concerned I have this little guy
here this is the Urban Decay anti-aging
a primer potion this is new to me
let's see here I also have this little
tart guy here I'll probably declutter
this next year as well I'm just not
getting too much use out of it it is the
CC clay primer and it's kind of like a
stick and I don't know what it is I just
feel like it's getting very very dry I'm
gonna have to add some oil or something
like that I have the Too Faced shadow
insurance as well as the glitter glue I
prefer the glitter glue my all-time
favorite primer is the Maybelline master
prime in the lightest shade and then I
do have the benefit Air Patrol that is
my second favorite and then I have these
two little guys here these are great if
you want to kind of fill in fine lines
and wrinkles they are from Revlon and
they are called the age-defying wrinkle
remedy line filler I like to basically
tap that in underneath my eyes after I
use all my primers and setting sprays
before I go in with my foundation and
then also around my smile lines and then
I do have this little guy here I
recently went through one of these in a
project pan but this little guy is not
finished so this is a different one it
is the Smashbox photo-finish
hydrating under eye primer I kind of
think it's not worth it it just reminds
me of like a nice moisturizer so yeah
and then I do have this essence I hurt
stage this is a little too dark for me
but I can mix it with the Kat Von D
lock-it concealer in white out now I
know they do have a pink version so I'm
gonna pick that one up it is very very
good though and then here is they put a
lid on its eyelid primer from the balm
this reminds me a lot of the face primer
they are pretty much the same exact
thing it's just very silicone base if
you do have like aging eyelids and you
need a little bit of smoothing that
would be great alright I have a
full-size of the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face paste and a little mini
here I also have the L'Oreal magic
perfecting base I prefer this over a
benefits Porefessional I know a lot of
people love the professional but this
one works better for me would not
recommend if you do have super super
super dry skin again it's very very
so I don't think you would like that let
me just move these guys up but if you do
have dry skin you would love the Bobbi
Brown vitamin enriched face base it's
beautiful it's kind of like a
moisturizer I would describe it as a
moisturizer and primer in one all right
here's the it cosmetics feel of the
moment primer I adore this it is amazing
absolutely beautiful my all-time
favorite primer very very silicone base
and hydrating all right to look move on
to this little guy here so I just have a
few little like the luxe sizes and
things like that so this is the Laura
Mercier radiance primer I do not like
this I don't think it does does anything
for my skin really does I cannot speak
today you guys
I don't be like this does anything for
my skin actually I don't feel like it
hydrates I don't feel like it's very
comparable to the back outline it's just
really really right now I will say it
does have a little more of a natural
Sheen to it compared to the Becca but
I'm just not super impressed this was
sent to me by amazing cosmetics it is
the line smoothing primer this thing is
tiny and it's like $40 so I would not
recommend it but amazing cosmetics did
comments on my other video when I had
said that they were not cruelty free I
guess they are and they are a really
great brand they were very very sweet
they have always kept me on their PR
list even though I feel like I'm always
bashing makeup so that just goes you
know to show that they are a good brand
here is the Mac prep and prime my friend
sent this to me I haven't tried it out
yet
I have the benefit that gal this is just
a brightening face primer it has a
little bit of like a pink to it it is
quite nice here is the calming primer
from cover effects it's okay not
anything too special I love this I want
a full-size of it it is the amici a
diamond tart soft focus I'm trying to
read under the beautify nur based primer
in the illuminating a version really
really good prefer this over the Becca
backlight priming filter for sure
and then I have a few like primer oils
this would be Milt I make up sunshine
oil I've used it kind of like I would
use the Smashbox primer oil which is
this little guy right here you can mix
that into your foundation you can also
just use it as a primer and then I have
the custom what is that no cover effects
what is that radiance drops as well
again same kind of thing here just an
oil alright I do have this little primer
here it is for oily skin and it is
called the mattifying emulsion MT sheer
pore refiner complexion whatever
right again so I can't give you my
thoughts this smells like but I did
use it up it is the Korres Greek yogurt
primer nothing special do not recommend
this other guy right here is so good
though this is the napoleon pep d and
this is the what is it called autopilot
pre foundation skin primer it's really
really nice like a excuse me like a gel
moisturizer choking on my own spam all
right and here we have some setting
sprays i do have a few in my shop my
stash a drawer currently i have the pixi
now I think it's just one I have the
pixie spray but this one right here was
sent to me for PR it is the skin de
Naevia post makeup recovery spray I
don't use it after makeup I use it as a
setting spray because it just doesn't
work after makeup and then here I have
the NYX matte finish and also the dewy
finish setting sprays these are awesome
honestly guys I do not buy high-end
primer sprays or setting sprays anymore
I do have this little sample the Urban
Decay I used to buy these all the time
these are filled with alcohol you'd be
much like better just going with
something that's not filled with alcohol
but also something that's at the
drugstore you can usually get these buy
one at 50% off buy one get one 50% off
and then also I have all three of my ELF
setting sprays I have the regular
version the matte version and the
illuminating version obsessed love these
I have been using the regular one this
one right here since I was I think a
senior in high school so yeah absolutely
adored that so anyway guys those are all
of my primers up next we will go ahead
and go through this little guy right
here which is my eye shadow single as
well as no brow products eyeliners and
mascara drawer so anyway that video will
probably be up around the same time as
this video maybe a double
upload but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
