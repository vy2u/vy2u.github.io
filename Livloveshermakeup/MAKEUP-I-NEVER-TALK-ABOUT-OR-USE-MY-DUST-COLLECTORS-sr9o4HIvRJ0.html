channel today's video is going to be all
about dust collectors and no I am NOT
talking about my Swiffer Sweeper I am
talking about products that as I was
unpacking them here in Arizona some of
them literally had dust on them and that
is how often I reach for them aka never
and I don't think I'd even shown these
products really on my channel unless
they were in lengthy clutter videos so I
thought it'd be fun to walk through them
let's go ahead and start with talus the
first one I have here is from Bobby
Brown I feel like I've shown this energy
clutter video but that was it I'm having
a really hard time letting go of this
palette and I just don't need it
but this is called the Telluride I tell
it and I think it is really really
pretty as you guys can see but there's
not a whole lot going on here I think I
paid around $60 for this which is why I
wanted to keep it in my collection but I
just don't feel like I need it there are
such a neutral colors in here I don't
even feel like this is really an
inspiring palette in any way shape or
form but you get one glitter and fuchsia
shade let's take our two shimmers a
couple of maps and I never reach for it
like I said so I absolutely should be
clutter this but yeah I don't think you
guys have ever really seen that unless
it was been in declutter video next we
have another palette here this is
actually from Laura Mercier and the
gorgeous palette you guys I need to be
reaching for this and this is called the
artist palette for eyes and cheeks as
you guys can see the packaging is so
pretty it's got a little like scratchy
sort of texture you open it up you have
a nice little mirror and then check out
the colors in here they may look very
uninspiring to some but I think this is
like a cool toned eyeshadow lover's
dream you have a bunch of maps you have
some shimmers in here I love that deep
and nice shade as you guys can see that
it would be perfect in midnight blue and
crystal beige is absolutely beautiful
they feel creamy they feel buttery
someone needs to tell me down in this
comment section to go ahead and actually
use this palette because it is stunning
and then the blushing there is very
neutral a very very pretty again I have
absolutely no issue with it so I don't
know why I don't reach for those more
often alright let's go ahead and talk
about some highlighters which I feel
like I really don't talk about I really
don't use the first one is actually a
highlighting palette from violet boss I
love this when I first got it now I did
try it out about a week ago as I was
unpacking stuff and I notice that it did
actually cause a lot of texture on my
skin throughout the day maybe it's just
because my skin has changed so much
while I've been down here at Arizona but
this is the pro highlighting powder trio
and this is what
look like on the inside you have a
really nice kind of pearly color you
have eight goals and then something to
have like a little more of like a kind
of like a dim light sort of color into
it so sort of similar to like the
ambient lighting patterns in life from
our glass the shades are called moon
gleam star glow and unicorn luster
they're beautiful they're a spoiled a
finish they go on really really wham-bam
in your face if you have a little bit of
thickness to them so you have to be
careful that you don't get too much fall
out especially if you want to use these
on your eyes as well so the colors are
gorgeous as you guys can see and like I
said I used it the other day and I felt
like it just didn't look as good on my
skin so this is something I am
definitely contemplating going ahead and
decluttering which I will be doing a
declutter series for 2017 as well for
you guys and then here we have something
that I remember Emily Noelle 83 raised
about a couple of years ago I ended up
picking it up and I really don't use it
often it is called the fusion life soft
life highlighter from Smashbox and this
is what it looks like and I think it's
so pretty it's got all these little
corners of color not borders but I've
got these little stars or little pizza
bezel slices of color in here as you
guys can see and when you mix them
together it's just this really beautiful
golden sort of Sheen with like a little
bit of like a kinky undertone it doesn't
really inspire me compared to like these
highlighting powders over here but I
feel like you could also dust this on as
like a light bronzer so you have a
little more of glowy skin and tan skin
while I'm down here so I need to try
this again I just feel like there's all
these good products that are just
collecting dust in my collection and I'm
like seriously alright let's talk about
some blushes the first one I have here
is from it cosmetics a lot of people
love this particular blush this is
called BCC radiance ombre blush and
usually sugar plum which like I love
that name I love the way that this looks
as you guys can see it's a really nice
frosted sort of berry color you have a
little bit of like this golden sheen of
running through it though now when I
wear this I notice that it's just a
little too cool tone for my skin I love
how it swatches on my skin but once I
actually get it onto my cheeks for
whatever reason you guys it kind of
looks like I have a bruise on my cheek
so I don't know I have to try that one
out one more time now that I'm here in
Arizona I feel like I'm wearing more
warm tone shades so maybe that will be a
base coat BB did Daisy clutter pile we
shall see and the next
you have the laura geller what is called
baked gelato vivid swirl blush so you
guys know I talked about the
highlighters all of the time this is one
of their blushes this is gorgeous
why don't I reach from this more often
you guys it has that beautiful beige
delay consistency and look at that you
can see the pigmentation on that it is
wild I mean this is a gorgeous blush I
feel like there's quite also double as
an eye shadow so I really need to go
ahead and reach into my collection to
try that out some more also this little
elf blush right here this is called
flush this is one of their ones dollar
blushes you guys beautiful cool tone
blessed with a little bit of a silver
iridescent running through it super soft
super creamy super buttery I feel like
this would actually layer beautifully
with it the plum berry shade so there is
the elf and there's the plum berries
look at this pigmentation gorgeous
clothes own blushes I need to reach for
these more often and then also the other
day I tried this guy out and I was like
why don't I reach for this more often
this is a Physicians Formula happy
booster glow and mood boosting warm up
blush so that is what it looks like the
shade is just called warm it is the
perfect coral if you do have like a fair
complexion I really really am digging
the shade now it definitely doesn't have
a huge amount of pigmentation but it's a
really nice blush topper as well so
there it is
love this I think it's beautiful and I
really like how it is very very finely
milled as well alright let's talk about
a bronzer that I rarely reach for I
actually used to love this bronzer and I
still really do like it it is the elf
golden a bronzer I described
fingerprints all over it but this is
what it looks like on the inside a
little similar to the layout of each
home correcting powder and cool but
obviously these are very warm shade so I
used to wear this particular highlight
right here like all over my face it's a
gorgeous glowing highlight but I feel
like right now with the color that my
skin is I could mix these together with
a brush and just put it all over my face
and I would get a really really nice
glow and I just feel like it's a very
very good bronzer like the three or five
dollar price tag so I need to reach for
that more and finally guys we have some
lip products so the first one is from
julep this is actually a lip oil which
is right up my alley I do have it on
currently and I have to say it not a fan
of this probably will go when I do bi
elliptic cutter this is called covet and
it is a tinted lip oil treatment now
normally with lip oils I like something
that has a little bit of thickness and
moisture to it this one literally just
feels like a really really lightweight
oil which some people might like but I'm
not really big in that also it has a
very very
strange artificial scent to it like it's
almost like it smells like syrup or
something so I don't really like that
and then this guy right here this is
Coby covergirl Oh sugar lip balm I got
this in like a little Ulta bag it was a
free purchase or free with purchase sort
of thing and the shade is called spice
now they roll up like a lipstick as you
guys can see I tried this out the other
day again when I kind of thought in my
collection and I remember people talking
about how it smells a lot of Lexi Fresh
treatments lip butters but people are
also saying that they are identical or
that they are a cube for each other in
my opinion the consistency is completely
different the pigmentation is completely
different so I don't like these as much
I don't think they're very good and yeah
those probably will go in my declutter
video when it comes to lip so anyway
guys those are my deaf collectors let me
know what makeup in your collection is
currently collecting dust and go ahead
and get your Swiffer sweepers out and
dust off that dust but anyway that's it
for today's video guys thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you tomorrow
