my channel happy Saturday today I wanted
to talk to you guys all about makeup
products I am glad I did not buy now I
have seen that Lauren made Beauty as
well as my friend Samantha March here on
YouTube do video similar to this so I'm
gonna throw their videos up in the cards
if you're interested in this topic if
you like other videos like this I would
highly recommend you guys check out
their channels or at least those videos
but yeah let's go ahead and jump right
into it I'm not really one of those
people that regrets a lot of things
especially when it comes to makeup I
don't have deep regrets when I declutter
things I don't have deep regrets when I
don't purchase things there are some
items where I'm like dammit I wish I
would have purchased that but it's not
like it's the end of the world for me
however there are products where I have
my eye on them initially and then after
I'm like I'm glad I didn't purchase
those because I feel like I can find
something similar in my collection or I
watch reviews and I'm like oh my god I'm
glad I didn't buy that product so that's
what we're gonna be talking about today
let's go ahead and jump right into it we
are going to start with the Kat Von D a
metal crushed highlighting a trio now I
love the Kat Von D and metal crush i
shadow formula in general I love my
metal matte palettes I love the singles
but she hasn't quite a few of those the
only problem with those is they shatter
quite frequently but besides that a
beautiful formula for eyeshadows but
when they put it into their highlighters
or into the highlighting formula it
seems like it didn't really come out the
right way I actually went in store and
swatch these out at Sephora for some
reason I thought these were going to be
like an online exclusive but it turns
out they had some at my local Sephora I
had already done a video when I was in
Hawaii talking about you know if these
products initially really got me excited
but I'm not gonna purchase them anymore
and I'll go ahead and throw that video
up in the cards but yeah I wouldn't
store i swatch these out and it was like
a goddamn glitter bomb and it's so funny
because the metal crush formula for
eyeshadow it's not like that in any way
shape or form and then of the metal
crush eyeshadows that I can think of
besides like tinsel in the metal matte
palette the original one have a glitter
infused into them so for me I was just
kind of like what you doing why are you
doing this Kat Von D it was just one of
those moments where I was like this is
not what I expected this is not what I
want and I knew immediately I was like
well I'm glad I did not purchase that
palette because
I would not have liked that I also saw
quite a few reviews of people saying
that these just went on totally totally
disgusting onto the cheeks like you know
the glitter really emphasized texture
and things like that
if you're younger or you don't have a
ton of skin problems I could see you
liking this or if you just love glitter
I could see you lovin the palate but for
me I was very very happy that I did not
take that one out up next to me will be
lorac mega pro 3 as well as the lorac a
desert sunset palette so from Mia I was
incredibly happy I did not pick up
especially the lorac mega pro 3 I'm a
lover of cool toned eyeshadows and I
love that kind of watercolor effect that
was going on with the colors but when I
saw this two watches and when I saw the
reviews and I saw the fact that that
thing went on sale literally a month
after it released I was very happy I
didn't pick it up all of these colors
are blended together like crazy I saw
some of the best makeup artists on
YouTube literally use this palette and
the eye looks were just money it were
just absolutely money they didn't look
good and you know these people are
incredibly talented and I'm thinking oh
my god with my skill level like are you
kidding it's all just gonna look like
one big muddy to mess on my eyes so I'm
very happy I did not pick that baby up
and then when it comes to the lorac
desert sunset palette same sort of thing
the color selection was absolutely
beautiful with all three there was one
that was kind of like a forest II kind
of color then you had like the beach one
which had some warmer tones and some
nice rich oranges and then you had some
other one and it was also very pretty
but you know I saw so many reviews on
this and people were saying they're
incredibly powdery they're not like in
the original lorac Pro formula which if
you have dipped into the lorac Pro
formula you know that kicks up a
ton of product like that is the very
messy eyeshadow formula however these
ones I guess just kind of blend away on
the eye and that's not very typical for
the lorac Pro formula I at least feel
like although they are very powdery I
can build them up really nicely I guess
these ones like you have to spend hours
building things up or you know hours
me I'm one of those people I like to put
my makeup on quick in the morning you
know I don't reach for my lorac Pro
palette when I want to do something
quick I reach for those when I'm going
onstage or if I want something a little
more like official on my eyes when I'm
okay to build the colors up but in the
morning I prefer something that has a
little more pigment that's why I really
like the subculture palette I know a lot
of people say I hate the subculture
palette it's so messy it's so hard but I
feel like I can put that on quickly as
long as I don't use too many of the
darker shades that I have to spend a
 ton of time blending out on my eyes
I can get a really one and done quick
look with high pigmentation and rich
color on my eyes very very easily in the
morning so I was happy that I did not
pick up those desert sunset palettes and
also I told you guys I've had some back
and forth with lorac on their
cruelty-free status so if you guys
didn't know I reached out to three
different reps and they all gave me
different variations on if they are
cruelty free or not I don't like that I
don't like that either your cruelty free
or you're not excited a million times so
that definitely rubbed me the wrong way
so I don't purchase much from lorac
cosmetics just because I don't
understand how you can say oh we are
cruelty free oh no we're not cruelty
free or we are cruelty free I'm just
kind of like get your story straight
alright guys moving on to two story book
a cause of medics I am just happy I
didn't purchase anything from them
initially I had my eyes on the
Witchcraft and Wizardry palette as well
as the Mean Girls palette they were like
a lot of palettes that we're catching my
attention but you guys are brought to
you at my eyes a really sketchy behavior
that goes on with the brand apparently
they don't get like full permission to
actually make these palettes or at least
there's some of them that they don't get
full permission they also take an
incredibly long time to ship things out
apparently some of you told me that you
don't even get your orders and then
other people were telling me that they
rarely do erase talks then I understand
that you're an indie brand but you've
been featured on huge ass channels and I
just feel like you should be able to get
your together you know if you're
being featured on Geoffrey Starr's
channel you know you should be able to
have some people that you can go ahead
and hire to help you ship things out
quicker and like I said I want to
support indie brands I want to support
especially cruelty-free indie brands but
it's just one of those things where a
lot of you were bringing to my attention
some very sketchy behavior with them now
I'm one of those people like I know a
lot of people hate makeup revolution
because
they copy you know Kat Von D and they
copy a bunch of different brands I never
thought about it too much it never
bothered me that much but now that I
think about it more you know if I were
to have like a video of me playing flute
and then somebody just blatantly ripped
it off and stole my video but that would
probably make me upset too you know
flute is my art you know and that duck I
put a lot of time and effort into that
and I think it does kind of rub me the
wrong way now when brands like that do
you blatantly just go and rip things off
so I'm not completely against purchasing
from brands like that but when it comes
to storybook cosmetics I just thought it
was kind of interesting but they don't
even get permission to make some of
these palettes like you have to do that
it just doesn't seem right you know
you'll get in trouble so that is we'll
definitely a brand that I'm not going to
be purchasing from and I'm very happy
that I haven't purchased anything from
since you guys brought it to my
attention that they're pretty
shady and then my flea guys we have the
Abeka lightwaves highlighter palette so
again I mentioned this in the video that
I did when I was in Hawaii and you know
I'm so glad I didn't purchase this I've
so many becca pellets that looks so
 similar because I love that guy
I love their face powders you know
they're proud of products like their
blushes and their highlighters all that
kind of stuff they make those products
excellent but I need something different
from Becca I have so many different face
palettes from them and this particular
palette had I believe prismatic amethyst
in it which I have a full-size of it had
a orange kind of peachy highlight which
looks basically similar to or identical
to the champagne dream flashes Bellini
light chaser highlighter I have a
full-size of that and then I believe
they have like a darker kind of golden
shade and again I feel like you know I
have a full-size of Prosecco pop and
chin big box tone for me and this was
just definitely a palette that I'm happy
I didn't pick up I haven't even hit pan
on those products you know I have all my
little Becca products behind me
I even even keep it on those products so
God you know what's the point of having
a trio like that especially when the pan
sizes were rather small so I'm really
trying to take a step back especially
with brands that I'm very loyal to like
uh Nastasia Beverly Hills an hourglass
and you know Becca it doesn't mean I
have to have every single limited
edition a product that they release I
don't even like one
these limited edition products let me to
kind of set my pisses me off so I'm
telling myself you know if the colors
are already very similar to the other
palettes or if they're just literally
re-purposed colors like you don't need
it so I'm really trying hard to tell
myself that so anyway guys that is it
for makeup I am so glad I didn't buy
please let me know down below if you
have any products that you are very
happy you did not purchase um I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow for my files
and having rails bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
