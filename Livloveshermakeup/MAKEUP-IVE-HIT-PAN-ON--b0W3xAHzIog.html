hit pan on I'm very excited I have not
actually filmed one of these since 2016
I think people get the idea that because
I'm not like an anti consumerism channel
and because I do recommend products I
just buy buy buy and I don't declutter
or I don't hit pan on things and
honestly it couldn't be further from the
truth
i declutter a shit-ton and on top of
that I do pan a lot of stuff so let's
jump right into it let's start with the
lorac Pro palette I currently am panning
these shades mauve as well as sable I
have big pan on those I have small pan
on pewter a garnet as well as deep
purple and I've completely used up white
as well as cream white and cream were
what I used to kind of set in my
eyeshadow base and mauve and sable I
love using on stage as crease colors and
then pewter garnet and deep purple one
of the things I love about the lorac Pro
formula is unable to use the shimmers in
my crease they have the same sort of
formula or the same feel to them as the
mat so those are all of these shadows
that I have panned in here I'm thinking
of maybe going ahead and doing a pan
that palette just because I'm so close
on this guy but as you can see when I do
the close-up there are a ton of shades
in here that honestly don't even have a
dip to them I am really really attracted
and drawn to this palette for specific
uses especially when I'm on stage so
that is the first item that I am
currently panning at the lorac Pro
palette up next we have the Too Faced
and natural eye palette this is the
old-school one in cardboard packaging
before it turned into and they
change the colors as you guys can see I
am currently panning heaven as well as
silk Teddy and I completely used up nude
beach if you take a look to the right
you can see that Velvet Revolver
push up as well as honeypot have quite a
dent in them and thence expresso erotica
and cocoa puffs barely touch so this was
something I used when I was in college
and for a while there I was like should
I be using this on my eyes anymore this
is a very old palette but I haven't had
any issues with it whatsoever when I was
in college I liked the lighter shades
which is why I always used to go for the
middle row as well as the lighter shades
over here so if I do a pan that palette
for this one as well I'm guessing that I
should dip in a little more to expresso
and cocoa puffs as well as erotica
possibly so that is the progress that
I'm making
that little guy that is the only one
that has carried over into this year's
makeup I've hit pan on
I am currently panning both my Becca
backlight as well as first light primers
I have a ton of little dashes on here
because they've been in a lot of
projects I'm not the biggest fan of
these you guys when I do the close-up
you will be able to see that there are a
lot of open edges here there's really
just product towards the bottom as well
as the top so at some point I'm gonna
have to go ahead and just shake them out
and get them onto my hand when I apply
but the backlight honestly is okay for
dry skin as well as normal skin in the
first light is meant more for combo
oilier but I find that both of these
leave an artificial cast on my skin so
after I pan these and use them up I
actually will not repurchase I really
enjoy a lot of products from Becca
cosmetics but these are not one of them
debating I'm showing you guys all of the
powders that I'm currently panning but I
thought maybe that would be a little
repetitive I have about six tone
correcting powders that I'm currently
panning from elf as well as three from
essence so I thought I'd show you guys
that the non cruelty free powders that
I'm currently panning I'm trying to get
through these so that's obviously I can
have a nice clean cruelty-free
collection these are both from L'Oreal
they are the infallible Pro matte 16
hour powder in the shade 100 porcelain
they're super dark even when I am self
tan but I'm making a nice amount of pan
on both of these I know that I'll be
able to use them up I usually use them
as a light contour I also am okay with
going ahead and using them as a
transition shade so like I said a little
too dark for my skin tone kind of a
shame that they don't have anything
lighter than the porcelain shade it does
oxidize throughout the day I do enjoy
the infallible Pro matte foundation I'm
not gonna pretend like I don't I do
enjoy that and I'm gonna show you guys
that next but the powder is just really
not that great you guys so working on
though a ton of makeup setting sprays
here some of them are completely empty
one of them is kind of half filled
obviously you can't really hit pan on
this kind of stuff but I wanted to show
you that I do use products up as well so
this is the Milani make it last setting
spray it's completely empty so I'll
feature that in the next empties video
the NYX do we finish I did finish off as
well as the elf makeup mist and set I've
been using this since I was a teen I
loved it if I were to go ahead and pick
one of those I would pick the Milani I
thought it was a really really good
product unfortunately it is very very
very pricey for what it is now if you're
wondering what my all-time favorite
settings fray is it is the Smashbox
photo finish primer water I absolutely
love this and I have about this much
left as you guys can see it
I have another backup from the Ulta sale
so that is really good but yeah this is
definitely my favorite it is
alcohol-free as well as fragrance free
also Emma currently is kind of panning
some tarts foundations which I will show
you guys when I do my updated project
pan but this is the it cosmetics your
skin but better CC illumination you guys
can see a very very slender right now
because it doesn't have any product
really left in it this shade is called
fair and I personally will not be
repurchasing this I'm just not really
supporting it Cosmetics right now I'm
trying to use all of the products that I
have from them and not purchase any new
ones just because I feel like they
really are not inclusive brand and I
don't know if I want to support that so
that is the it cosmetics that I'm
currently panning and then here is the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte you guys
can see some dashes this was a great
foundation even on dry skin I know it's
not cruelty free but I'm always gonna be
honest with you guys it's a great
foundation really really long wearing
good shade match the shade that I have
right here is 101 classic ivory kind of
funny how this matches me really well
when I'm not self tan to get the powder
is way too dark it does not oxidize
throughout the day I was never a fan of
pro glow but I've had this for many
years I repurchase a ton of times it
will be said when this runs out and I
can't repurchase so L'Oreal any day now
if I can become cruelty free but you
know it is what it is and yeah I am
almost done with that the elf shimmer
palette I believe I featured one of
these also in the 2016 version it is not
the same one I really like this during
the summer time on my eyes as well as on
my skin when I'm wearing like a light
tint so it could be like half a pump
with the CC cream or maybe the Tarte
tinted moisturizer which I'm currently
panning I really really do enjoy these I
just kind of slide it right onto my
cheekbone down the bridge of my nose and
on my eyes they are not very long
wearing but as you can probably see I am
currently panning all four shades I
don't have a specific one that I love
the most they tend to be a little oily
as well so if you do have oily skin this
might not be for you but I like this in
2016 and I still like it now and then
here I have another product from L'Oreal
this is the visible lift color lifting a
blush a very very cool line the visible
lift line this was something I thought
that they should have expanded on they
had a great
Foundation and concealer and they did up
actually discontinuing those but this is
a gorgeous gorgeous color you guys it's
like a true rose gold not a lot of wear
time again it is a cream product which
I'm normally not drawn to but I really
do like the color currently it is not a
blush for me I'm self tan so I have been
using it as a highlighter and I hope to
make progress on that we have the Bobbi
Brown SPF 25 tainted moisturizing balm
in the shade fair
I am currently hitting pan on this as
you guys can see I will insert a
close-up so you really can get a good
look it's a very very thick a cream and
this is like a $70 product it's crazy
only works for you as my dry skin
obviously would not repurchase
unfortunately Bobbi Brown is not cruelty
free but I wanted to show you that I'm
patting that and as far as primers are
concerned I have the vitamin enriched
face base here from Bobbi Brown which I
loved oh my god if you have a
cruelty-free
dupe for this please let me know really
really great because it's prolongs aware
of your foundation as well as
moisturizes and also kind of blurs your
pores so there's just a tiny little bit
of that left and then here we have the
L'Oreal I think it's called the magic
perfecting base it's kind of rubbed off
it basically is just a very very thick
benefit Porefessional sort of product so
I use it on at my pores trying to use
this up trying to pan it $15 for this
tiny little thing by the way and then
here is the baby skin primer this is
from Maybelline I have just a tiny tiny
little bit of this left which is really
really exciting and then I also have the
NYX hydro touch primer I would have
loved this but unfortunately it has way
too much fragrance in it and the
fragrance is quite irritating to me it
smells like it men's aftershave so going
ahead and using it that up and then here
is a eyelid primer that I am starting to
pan or I've started to make a bigger
kind of change on so you guys can see
this is the put a lid on its eyelid
primer and this is from the balm
cosmetics next we have the Too Faced
Born This Way naturally a radiant
concealer and you shade very fair it
isn't good concealer but unfortunately
the shade is not light enough it only
matches me when I unselfish and like
currently you guys can see the little
streaks in here of where I have gone
ahead and started to actually pan it
eventually I will take the stopper out
and I will finish it off and I think I
would possibly repurchase and then here
we have the NYX color correcting
concealer
I love this almost as much as I love my
Urban Decay color correcting fluids I
especially love the yellow and pink
color correcting fluid from Urban Decay
but this one also has a really nice
consistency I know a lot of people have
not been into color correcting recently
but I personally do color correct
especially when I'm going on stage I
will take this salmony shade and I will
go ahead and put that underneath my eyes
I use the bronzer or contour sometimes
and not really like a cream contour kind
of girl it'd be purple I like to use to
lift my fine lines and wrinkles I like
to use the yellow underneath my eyes for
brightness the peach underneath my eyes
for brightness and then the green for
redness on my skin so I really do enjoy
this and I am currently panning one two
three four five out of the six shades
and then here we have the Urban Decay
vice lipstick palette this is the junkie
version I love these lipstick palettes
you guys I love them I am only panning a
one particular shade and what I do and
be close up you will see it you can only
see the pan at a certain angle but it is
the green color which is called junkie
now I did a video talking all about my
love for unusual makeup even though I
don't wear it very often but I
absolutely adore that shade junkie it is
green with a gold shimmer to it and
finally guys we have the it cosmetics
bye bye redness cream this again is one
of those products that I'm trying to use
up and would not repurchase for now
Cosmetics is just kind of on my radar
right now as being a little bit of a
inconsistent brand and I'm not quite
sure I want to support them like I said
so anyway that is what the cream looks
like I like to mix this together with
the Kat Von D lock-it tattoo concealer
because this is too dark for my skin but
the other one is a little too light to
have the shade whiteouts and they mix
really really nicely but just know that
if you are very very fair complected
it's not necessarily a universally
flattering color and that's what they
say it is a little too dark for you if
you're super super fair so anyway guys
that is it those are makeup products I
am currently panning I hope you guys
enjoyed thanks again and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
