have another video for you guys today
and this time I feel like I should be
wearing makeup for this video because
we're talking about makeup but I don't
feel like wearing makeup today but
anyway we are talking about foundations
and powders that are meant to be
together exactly or probably about five
or six months ago on my channel I did a
video called makeup soulmates where I
talked about foundations and primers
that are really really nice together
like they pair perfectly they are a
match made in heaven
and I thought I could make a series idea
out of this I can do blushes and
highlights today we're gonna do powders
and foundations so we're talking about
foundations that really pair nicely with
powder so that it doesn't look cakey on
your skin you know when you put on a
foundation then you put on a powder on
top and suddenly everything looks worse
these are actually really good pairings
that make it look very very natural and
beautiful on the skin so I have eight
different parents to talk about let's go
ahead and jump right into it
so the first pairing that is made in
heaven that I want to talk about are the
elf tone correcting powder and the Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation so this is
the Double Wear State in place makeup
the shade that I wear is one and one
I've renewed if you are curious this is
a very full coverage foundation and I I
find that it pairs beautifully together
with the elf tone correcting powder now
normally I love the cool version because
I do have a cool undertone they also do
offer a warm version but also if you do
have dry skin they have this version
this is called the shimmer version so if
you do not want to set in your whole
entire face you just want to set
underneath your eyes or in your t-zone
you can do that really really nicely
with the shimmer version as well it's
not like a highlight or anything like
that it's just a very finely milled
powder so because this is so full
coverage I find that this powder just
glides on beautifully on top of it and
it really really keeps it looking and
gorgeous all day long so and this is the
first little pairing that I want to talk
about the second pairing that I want to
talk about is great for those of you who
have really really oily skin I wore this
a lot during the summer time it is the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 16 hour
powder paired together with the
covergirl clean and mattes of BB cream
for oily skin so although this is a BB
cream it has really really full coverage
the shape that I wear is 510 fair if you
are curious I feel like the two of these
paired together beautifully if you are
very very oily this will keep you matte
all day long I promise you you barely
have to touch up throughout the day
maybe with a few little like blotting
linens or
but they're called but for the most part
this will keep you completely mad all
day long I love the way that this powder
goes on top of this sometimes I find
that this powder starts to look very
kinky paired together with other
foundations looks paired together with
other foundations but with this one it
looks really really beautiful so that is
the second little match made in heaven
that I wanted to talk about the third
one I want to talk about is actually a
powder foundation paired together with
kind of like a I guess I would call this
almost like a CC cream this is the
covergirl CG smoothers hydrating makeup
the shade that I wear is 7:05 ivory this
is absolutely beautiful very very
hydrating it doesn't give that much
coverage I would say light to medium
maybe buildable medium coverage but I
really like to pair it together with my
Tarte confidence creamy powder
foundation in the shade of fair and
neutral what I do is I will apply this
at with like a dampened beauty sponge I
let it completely set on my face and
then I go in with a buffing brush and I
will buff this on top and it just looks
absolutely amazing if you do want that
beautiful beautiful hydrating finish but
you still want a little more coverage
the two of these go together absolutely
insanely perfectly well alright the next
little pairing that I want to talk about
is the Clinique could be on perfecting
foundation paired together with the
Revlon nearly naked pressed powder so
the one I have here is zero one zero
fair I have hits a major pan on this
baby this is a beautiful beautiful
drugstore powder and you guys will
notice the majority of these powders are
from the drugstore I don't like to
always purchase super super expensive
powders because they do go through them
very quickly because I do have combo to
oily skin but this is very finely milled
I do find that it does tend to darken up
a little bit on my skin but they do have
a translucent or transparent shade that
you can pick up now the Clinique beyond
perfecting really is a wonderful
wonderful full coverage foundation that
you can actually layer and because this
is so finely milled I feel like it pairs
really really nicely with this
foundation so this is a great little
pairing as well the next one I want to
talk about is probably one of my
all-time favorites because it does
involve my all-time favorite foundation
which is the josie maran vibrancy
foundation fluid if you guys are curious
I do wear the shade a dynamic oh and by
the way in the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation I wear the shade
zero-point-five breeze but this a
vibrancy foundation fluid goes together
perfectly with my essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder
I feel like because this does have that
argon oil infused in there sometimes it
can look a little more glowy on the skin
and I really need something to kind of
just even it out and give just a little
bit more of a matte appearance to the
skin and I feel like the essence all
about matte 16 compact powder does that
absolutely beautifully and I feel like
it does almost give a little bit of
coverage as well even though it is
translucent and transparent I don't
really know how to describe it unless
you have used it yourself but it's
absolutely beautiful paired together
with the vibrancy foundation fluid even
if you do have dry skin and you want to
use this you can use this underneath
your eyes or just to set in your t-zone
it's wonderful and I think the two of
these together are a match made in
heaven
alright the next one I want to talk
about is kind of one that I feel like
I've talked about a lot and I feel like
a lot of people do pair these together
it is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation the shade that I wear is
one-zero-one classic ivory paired
together with the Rimmel stay matte
transparent powder so this is what the
Rimmel stay matte looks like again I
have hits a major pan on this baby I
love the way that the two of these go
together I think they are absolutely
beautiful this does not give a
completely matte appearance to the skin
I feel like the finish is more of like a
Demi matte and again with this powder I
feel like it's kind of a Demi matte
appearance it does not completely like
white out or completely mattify your
face the way that the all about matte
fixing compact powder would or even the
tone correcting powder from ELF
I feel like these just go really really
nicely together and it gives a really
nice and Demi matte appearance to the
skin so I love the two of those together
and if you want a little more lighter
coverage a really really awesome
appearing right here is the Laura
Mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation or really any sort of water
or serum foundation the shade that I
wear is shell by the way this paired
together with the Laura Geller
what is it called balance and brighten
foundation so the shade that I wear is
porcelain so again it kind of like the
covergirl and at the tarte powder I feel
like these just go really nicely
together because this is a very very
light aqua kind of luminous finish on
the skin but then when you pair it
together with a powder foundation and
you buff this and on top you are setting
in your foundation but also you are
giving a little bit of extra coverage
now this is more of like a luminous
sheen on the skin and this is also semi
luminous so I think they go really
really beautifully together and this one
does pair very nicely with these steel
Oh glow perfecting foundation as well
and the final little match made in
heaven that I want to talk about is the
NARS a velvet matte skin tint with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen in the
shade that I wear is called Terran wave
a light 2-0 paired together with the
Catrice cosmetics prime and five
mattifying powder so I just recently
found that these went really really well
together
I feel like the Catrice cosmetics eye I
don't like this as much as I like the
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder these are owned by the same
company this is like three dollars and
49 cents of this is like $7.49 I don't
feel like it keeps me as matte
throughout the day but if you do have
more dry skin or normal skin or
sensitive skin I think you would like
this a little more than the essence all
about Matt the essence all about Matt I
feel like if you do have very dry skin
it kind of kind of clogged your pores a
little bit because it really does keep
all of the humectant this inside so
basically once you said in your face
with this you're going to be matte all
day long so this lifts your skin breathe
just a little more and I really like it
paired together with the NARS because
again just kind of like this one right
here which is the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte I don't feel like this is
completely matte I feel like this gives
a demi matte appearance to the skin so
it's a very beautiful pair together with
this powder and I feel like they bring
out the best with each other so anyway
those are my eight little pairings match
made in heaven or whatever you want to
call them I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
