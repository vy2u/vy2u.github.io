you on my channel and welcome to another
anti ahah but where I share with you
guys some I'm not gonna buy this
month and now I want to say before we
get into it I am trying to have like a
little more of like a natural look with
my brows this week so today I did not
put any brow product in and I'm like
holy Shi Who am I I literally do not
feel like myself unless I have a defined
brow now so there you go what happens
when you start wearing makeup but if I
look a little funky
you know why but anyway let's go ahead
and just jump right into it let's talk
about some products I'm really really
not interested in purchasing and the
first product I will not be buying is
taught to use pepto-bismol bright pink
pills I will not be buying these no
matter how pretty they are in the beat a
little frosted glass bottle is that
plastic is it frosted glass I hope it's
frosted glass for that price you
take two of these vegan all-natural kind
of capsules every single day and within
three weeks you are going to see more
hydration blah blah blah blah blah and
all this kind of stuff go watch talk to
use video if you want to see an in-depth
full take on what you're supposed to see
she really has a lot of claims when it
comes to this particular product now I
want to say really quickly I am somebody
who has been treating up my lupus
homeopathic lis for the past nine months
and I have not had a single a lupus
flare that is by taking as supplements
and vitamins and I think it's
amazing what natural medicine can do and
what vitamins can do for you however I
think the most disappointing part about
this was that a lot of people were
excited for talk T to be releasing some
sort of E beauty line or makeup line now
I have watched all her videos even the
52 minute video that she released the
other day which homegirl that we usually
watched 50 two-minute videos okay so I
set my ass down and I got all the
information just to make sure I'm not
like you know I want to make sure I have
all the insight I can understand that
she's having a hard time right now too
because people are just attacking
everything that has to do with halo
beauty and I don't think that's quite
appropriate and if there is one thing
that I gave a talk to you full credit
for it is the fact that she is
incredibly professional and she never
comes across in like a snide and snarky
way like I do sometimes so I will give
that to her and I do think it's
unfortunate that people are attacking
the people that she works with they're
attacking the brand in general as well
as like her own mother and things like
that all that is inappropriate
and should not have anything to do with
the actual capsules however
I think a lot of people were expecting
something a different I think it would
have been great if she released a makeup
products like a palette or even like an
eyeliner or something like that first
and then she kind of did the beauty
pills later on I think a lot of people
are just mostly shocked said she's
coming out with a beauty supplement and
again I feel like a lot of these
ingredients I know she keeps talking
about how but they're really really
special and you can't get them anywhere
else the truth is you can't find these
ingredients elsewhere and you can find
them for probably a fraction of the cost
so well that's just my opinion
I will not be purchasing these let me
know if you're gonna buy them down below
alright up next let's talk about the
Urban Decay Naked petit Heat palette I
know that I'm kind of behind on this
because this released like ages ago but
you never got too hot talked about it it
basically has 5 different amount of
shades you have a lid crease and liner
shade you have a demi matt highlighting
shade a mirror perfect travel sized
pocket palette basically a $29 many of
the Urban Decay Naked heat palette you
guys know I'm not into the naked line
however stupidly enough I do actually
have the petite one not the petite one
and the Naked basics one and two
palettes now when you guys see an
upcoming a declutter you will see that I
actually let those go out of my
collection because I rarely reach for
them I feel like these kind of shades
especially because they're supposed to
be basic because they're called the
basic palettes are aggressively basic
and you can find other sheets at the
drugstore as well as different brands
you know from flower beauty's Sonia
Kashuk I mean the Sonia Kashuk on
neutral palette is so damn similar to
the Urban Decay Naked basics 1 palette I
really reach for the Naked basics one
because I love at these Sonia Kashuk so
I just don't think that I need this I
don't really feel like you guys need
this however if you're someone who likes
warm tone eyes you really only wear this
game I look every single day you want
mostly Mac's I mean this could be
something maybe you decide you want to
pick up but honestly I don't think it's
anything special so passing over natasha
Jeannot know is releasing a tropics
palette it includes 15 beautiful
eyeshadows a mix of shades which remind
me of sand palm trees Sun beans oceans
okay that's all trend boot ones
Instagram words okay she thinks that
reminds her of oceans and shells and
tropical flowers I doesn't really mind
me of the and not at all actually I like
the bottom row the bottom row is pop it
you see some Purple's some blues a
really really cool it looks like the
litter press shade but I know that her
glitter press shades aren't necessarily
glitter there's like
pigmen it is still 129 dollars
and at the limited-edition it will be
available on March 8th I saw that she is
also releasing a petite or a little mini
of the natasha to known a sunset palette
however when I looked it would appear
that the amount of product that you get
in there is not even worth of the amount
that she is selling it for which was
around like the 40 or 50 dollar price
range so I'm gonna pass on both of these
you guys I just feel like Natasha Genoa
is way way way too pricey and everybody
has their limits when it comes to makeup
and this is just a little too high in my
opinion I know that I'm more than
willing to purchase from hourglass and
different luxury brands but that's
because I really enjoyed their products
I even never tried anything from Natasha
de Nonna and I kind of worries me to
invest $129 and then not like it I know
I can return it but yeah there's
something about that price I still can't
get over so thank you for the tags but
no I will be passing already up next we
have a new palette from violet box I
feel like they have really really been
pushing the palettes especially now that
they are at so far Ella's just my
opinion this is the like a box palette
it has 20 different shades and it will
retail for $45 it will be available at
Sephora it's coming soon online only and
again incredibly basic and I'm just not
drawn to this because I already own
three of violet boss palettes I'm sorry
for a violet boss palettes the problem
with violet boss palettes is that you
get a palette that either has 20 or
about 40 shades in it depending on what
size you get and it's got a very
finished in there it's got every shade
so if you already have one violet boss
palette chances are you don't need
another now I do have the drenched metal
I have the holy grail I have the right
or die palette as well as the Laura Lee
palette and there are so many
overlapping shades and again it's one of
those things when you come out with a
ride-or-die palette there literally has
like 42 different shades all sorts of
different finishes it's like a rainbow
of colors I mean why do you think of
other stuff you really don't I think
that's the point so I would say if
you're already happy by Lovaas palette
chances are you probably don't need this
especially if you already do own it the
drench metals palette which is a little
more on the cool tone side and has some
cool tone kind of you know tsumuji dark
gray colors as well as some yellows and
if you own the Holy Grail I mean I feel
like Queen and work and quite a few
shades in here as well are going to be
very similar and if you own
chances are every single one of these is
going to be overlapping shades so for me
I don't need this and I'm sure you guys
don't need it as well we have a powder
from Becca cosmetics I thought this was
the under eye brightening setting powder
but no this is for your face it is
called the new Hydra mist a set and
refreshed powder I feel like that's such
a mindfuck like Hydra miss set powder I
don't know it just doesn't sound right
to me I can't imagine this being that
you know hydrating on the skin obviously
it is a powder it does have glycerin in
it which is great it does Rito for $38
but again I feel like these kind of
powders that becket us release a lot of
them are basically just overpriced
silica powders you can get silica
powders everywhere including the $5 HD
setting powder from elf cosmetics which
I talked about the under eye brightening
setting powder I did a review and demo
I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
cards but I really don't think you guys
need this this is a very very large
price for what they are actually giving
you and you know I'm very loyal to back
up I'll let you know and I think
something is gonna be a little gimmicky
and in my opinion this is gonna be a
little gimmicky so yeah I will be
passing on that and finally colour-pop
has released 12 new super star loose
pigment shadows they are $5 each love
the price point really enjoy color pop
as a whole for the most part however
 I can't do pigments and I know so
many of you were tagging me in this I
can't do loose litters I cannot do
pigments I have the Stila glitter and
glows for a reason honey it's because I
will up my eyes okay I don't know
the right brush to use they always end
up on my eyeball like I will be putting
a glitter on and I see glitter on my
 eyeball I'm not cool with that
I'm just not cool with that you know I
can't hang with that I don't have enough
scale for that and I think that if you
are like expertise if you were
great at makeup and you want to foil
down your brush and you want to make
these work I think it would be awesome
but for me personally I feel like the
shades are just pretty darn basic you
can get these in their pressed shadow
formula as well as the super Shop a
formula depending on if you prefer a
cream or powder and they look they look
messy yeah they just look really really
messy so thank you for tagging me in
those but I will be passing I feel like
especially if you are a beginner and
makeup or even if you're at like my
level which is really not that high
you are definitely going to have some
issues with these loose pigments love
the price point like I said they will be
available on March 8th but yeah passing
on those so anyway guys that is it for
this anti call those are some products I
will not be buying to let me know down
below if you're going to purchase these
products or not and I will see you
tomorrow for a mystery video
