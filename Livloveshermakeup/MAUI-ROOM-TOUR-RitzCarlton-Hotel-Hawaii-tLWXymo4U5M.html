today's video is going to be a room tour
of our hotel in Maui a lot of you have
been asking where we are which resort
we're at and I thought I would just go
ahead and show you our room we are not
affiliated with this brand or this
company or this hotel in any way shape
or form this is the Ritz Carlton Hotel
and it is in Maui so I'll show you guys
at the outdoor area so right here
back in slide let me show you guys kind
of what our room looks like so over here
we do have some of Tom's things I'm sure
he doesn't want me show you guys these
things so I will just show you my cute
little purse I got this from justfab.com
also not affiliated
I just I'm on there like per
subscription monthly they give you like
a new purse for 3995 so yeah I have that
there and then tom has a bunch of his
vitamins as you can see he is a doctor
after all he does like to take his
vitamins here is a quite interesting
lamp over here and then we have some
artwork I guess you could say here is a
little chair and then over here again
some more of Tom's staff he just kind of
threw everything right here and we do go
ahead and celebrate his birthday the
other night with some cupcakes as well
as some booze and some Evian so yeah
that is what is going on over there and
then right here as you guys can see I
have one of my cameras and then here is
the bed I was just lying on this so if
it looks like it is a little worn down
that is why and then there is a little
daybed over here I've been charging my
computer over here and as you guys can
see and then here is Tom's side of the
bed all nice and neat and then my side
looks like a hot mess
so over here again some more artwork and
then here are some of my shows ease both
of these I think both of these are from
nope those are from Charlotte Russe and
then those are from JustFab and right
now I have a socks on and then here is
my luggage it got really really beat up
on the way over here and then underneath
that I have a pile of laundry that I
really need to do and this thing is
amazing you guys if you are someone who
always struggles with a camera reach it
always struggles with trying to get your
iPhone charger to be like on your bed
and you need this Tom got this for me a
couple of months ago it's an extra-long
chrome charger from Amazon loved it
anyway here is my side of the bedside
table I have some of my medications as
well as some earplugs because Tom snores
restless leg cream because I do get
restless leg syndrome from my ADHD and
then this is private ham and he's
adorable we're gonna put him
right there yes so anyway yeah that is
kind of like the bed area and kind of
just like the living room area I guess
you could say it's really beautiful
we've just been keeping the door open
all day long cause it's just so stunning
and then when you walk over here you
guys can see it isn't it really nice
like hardwood floor which I love and
then it's carpeted here and this is
where as the actual like a dresser not
dressers but the closets are so this is
Tom side and then under here we have our
refrigerator which I love to have it
when I am traveling because I like to
stock up on food so I have snacks later
and then this side is obviously mine all
right now over here we have something
that I have become quite obsessed with
this is the nespresso oh my god I think
I need one of these you guys these are
so incredibly good they're like the
Keurig but I don't know these tastes are
really really good
they come in a little pot of format just
like the Keurig and then obviously we
have some teas and stuff there but yeah
this has been amazing and look at this
little machine it is just so cute so
yeah anyway that is what you see when
you first walk in and then if you turn
right here we have a double door that
leads you into the bathroom which is my
favorite place because I love
his-and-her sinks and look at this like
yes love that so anyway there I am but
yeah here I wanted to show you guys I
have some of my stuff out and then over
here is some of Tom's stuff and it's
just beautiful I really really love this
bathroom I appreciate luxurious
bathrooms there is my razor and you guys
know I love taking baths so yeah that is
what it looks like over there all the
doors are mirrored which is awesome and
then here we have a tea shower which
again is super super nice and kind of
modern so really really liked the
bathroom area I think that is absolutely
stunning and yeah it's pretty much it
guys so that is our room tour I hope
that you guys enjoyed this definitely

this resort look how messy that bed
looks I totally ruined it but yeah let
