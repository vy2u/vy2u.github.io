my channel today's video is going to be
my first ever anti hoe I'm so incredibly
excited I love watching kimberly-clark I
love watching everybody that does anti
hauls and I thought I would go ahead and
start doing these once a month so that
is why it says May 2017 anti haul I have
10 different products to share with you
guys that I sure as hell am NOT picking
up and yeah 13 different photos so 10
different products 13 different photos
all 13 photos are from Sophie's or trend
mood ones Instagram I will go ahead and
link her Instagram down below I did DM
her and asked if I could have permission
to use her photos in this video she said
yes so thank you so much Sophia but yeah
I'm gonna share with you guys some shit
I'm not gonna buy so let's go ahead and
jump right into it the first item I will
not be purchasing is the new k'kaw
collection from Kylie cosmetics now the
reason why I won't be getting this and I
just have to say it in this videos
because I do not support the Kardashian
clan okay I don't like them I don't like
them at all I feel like they are very
very full of themselves their image all
this kind of stuff it really rubs me the
wrong way to be completely honest and
you know all four of these lipsticks are
literally named after Kim like it's
Kimmy Kiki Kim and Kimberly I'm like
really like how much more self-centered
can you be okay like I'm sorry I just
don't understand this family sometimes
but yeah so basically I won't be picking
these up because of that you will never
ever see Kylie cosmetics on my channel
because I do not support the Kardashian
clan as a family now you may be asking
where you've been talking about it in
this video then what's the point a lot
of people were asking because this is
like a new formula they were saying like
maybe you would like it live maybe you
want to try it out well these shades
don't really speak to me now I'm not
more I'm not really like a new kind of
girl I'm sure if you are a nude lover
you can look at the four of these shades
and say they are very very different I
look at them and I think they look very
very similar and although they are like
a glossy formula I'm just not into it
they look like they're kind of sheer as
far as swatches are concerned and yeah
overall like I said just don't support
to the Kardashian clan so I appreciate
you guys being sweet and saying you know
maybe this is a formula that you might
like from the Kylie cosmetics collection
but for me you guys you're just never
ever going to see Kylie cosmetics on my
channel alright next we do have the new
of Isla Voss what is this called I think
this is called the rose gold
highlighting palette you guys can see it
looks pretty darn dark in the pan when
you look at it down here the swatches
look lighter and then up here obviously
the swatches look a lot lighter so
there are probably two or three shades
here that I think I could pull off on my
complexion I love rocking a dark
highlight okay I like wearing them as
blush toppers eye shadows all that kind
of stuff but for the most part I'm just
not that drawn into this now I really do
like violet vos as a brand I'm normally
not into like those instafamous kind of
brands but let me tell you they have
some really good quality products I did
pick up their original highlighting
palette and I adore it to pieces so
although I don't want to get this one
just because the color selection doesn't
speak to me I would not like you know
say that I'm not going to get future
highlighting palettes from them I just
feel like this one is not good for my
particular complexion all right moving
on the next item that we have here is
the new Too Faced glitter bomb palette
are you fucking serious alright guys so
I just have to say it right away I know
two-face has gone so downhill I've been
saying it for months now I do truly feel
like it's because Estee Lauder has
bought them out next Tuesday we will be
talking about a two-faced as well as it
cosmetics and Tarte cosmetics were going
to be talking about like what has gone
on with them since the parent companies
bought them that will be next Tuesday's
video so I hope you guys enjoy that one
yeah basically I feel like two-face has
gone downhill since the Estee Lauder you
know bought them out and I just feel
like their products right now are really
untrustworthy there's been so much drama
with them lately as well and I mean I
don't want to get all involved in that
kind of shit but I'm just kind of
sitting here like I don't want to buy
your stuff anymore and on top of that
you know one of the worst formulas in my
opinion from Too Faced are those glitter
infused two shadows so the fact that
they literally want to make a whole
entire palette with that glitter infuse
kind of formula I'm just like hell no
for me now if you love glitter you love
that kind of stuff that's great I love
those new like Stila glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows but I just can't do
this they look like they're gritty they
look like they're chunky I hate it I
already look at it I'm like I can't do
this so yeah although the packaging does
look like old-school two-faced and it
kind of reminds me of the layout of the
pretty rebel palette that is definitely
something that I am passing on alright
moving on we have the Urban Decay
afterglow palette now I'm not gonna lie
to you guys I almost picked this up and
i almost reviewed it for you now you can
see there is a light kind of cool toned
blush in here - champagne sort of
highlights and then a nice kind of like
bronzer well it would be a bronzer on me
or like a kind of neutral blush for
other skin tones I was just looking at
this and I was like okay I really wanted
I love the afterglow a tower powder
highlighter formula I love the afterglow
blush is really really good if that is
what is in this palette and these colors
draw you in then go ahead and pick it up
I'm sure it's going to be good quality
but for me personally I'm just like girl
like how many freaking you know
champagne highlights do I need in my
collection I have so many neutral
blushes I have so many cool tone pink
shades I'm telling you right now I don't
need this and I bet your ass you don't
need it okay you don't need it we don't
need it
moving on alright next we have the green
tea matcha toner stick from milk makeup
so I like milk makeup I feel like
they're very innovative they're cruelty
free they seem like a cool hip kind of
brand you know what I mean
my issue with this is like how
unsanitary does that seem I'm not even
getting right now like think about it so
they're saying that this particular
product is going to be great for those
of you who have acne prone skin
inflammation and that makes sense matcha
green tea is really good for all those
kind of things now the thought concept
is that you're rubbing this on your face
and then you're closing it up and then
you're waking up the next day you're
rubbing it on your face unless you're
literally wiping off and D sanitizing or
sanitizing the area after each use and
like losing product I don't know how
this is going to work I feel like it's
very unsanitary I don't know if you guys
have thought about that but this is just
something that I'm like really like
really really I don't know I can't go
there
I did see they also have like a stick
cleanser if they ever make this into a
liquid form I would be interested in
trying that out I normally don't see
green tea cleansers or green tea toners
on the market so I think it's very cool
but the stick form I'm just kind of like
Mariner very unsanitary in my opinion
alright next we have the lorac Pirates
of the Caribbean collection a lot of you
were asking me if I was going to pick
this up honestly no the only shades in
here they really really draw me in are
the blue shade and that kind of like
burnt um what is the front kind of
coppery red shade now the packaging is
gorgeous but when I think of Disney the
kind of Disney like you know collector's
items that I would like are like
princess related okay I love a Disney
Princess stuff not that I don't like
parents Pirates of the Caribbean I love
the music score I played the music
school I love all that kind of stuff but
for me personally this is just not
something I think is that unique I know
that they were reaching out to a lot of
different Beauty vloggers with smaller
channels bigger channels if they had
reached out to me I guess I maybe would
have accepted for the PR and to see what
it's like but I feel like I would have
ended up decluttering it so it's just
kind of pointless
I don't know maybe I would have said no
if they would have asked but I just feel
like I look at this palette and I'm like
I'm really not excited by these shades
now a lot of people are saying that it
is very similar to the pro formula which
is awesome but I feel like you can get
all of those kind of shades in your mega
pros or in your regular Pro palette so
you don't need it I don't need it let's
move on alright next we have the nuts
cosmetics digital dust highlighters girl
girl I almost bought these I almost
bought these okay and then I had to stop
myself and say nope you have pearlized
highlighters that look like that you
have champagne highlighters and then
that deeper shade is not going to work
for you I was like I can use it as a
planter no no Olivia so basically I
really wanted that champagne color right
there you can see the swatch in the
middle it looks amazing and right here
you can see it just looks beautiful you
know I want these facial a beige today
basically I can tell right by looking at
it it's a big shell a kind of product
now I just like I said the only reason I
really don't want this is because of the
color selection another thing is they
are quite pricey I think they're like
$38 apiece which is like way up there I
have not tried anything from melt
cosmetics yet I do want to go ahead and
try out one of their little stacks like
the rustic or something like that I'm
sure that these are good highlighters
quite a few of you picked them up and
actually sent me snaps and I was like
shit I want it now
but I'm not going to get it because I
just feel like I have shades like this
if they had done more unique shades
maybe I would have picked them up but
yeah I'm not gonna get those next we do
have the Jacqueline Hale morphe
collaboration so I don't have a picture
of what the inside of the palette looks
like but there was like this cake thing
that released a few months ago I don't
know there's fucking drama around
everything surrounded with this palette
now I personally don't watch a
Jacqueline Hill here on YouTube it's not
because I don't like her nothing like
that you guys she is very talented she's
very beautiful
the reason why I feel like I can't watch
her it's just because I'm hella hyper
okay she's hella hyper she makes me feel
really really extra hyper and that's
just not something that I like I really
enjoy watching um not so much tutorials
on YouTube I prefer more like empties
videos favorites videos so more like
review kind of channels and then also I
do prefer people that are a little more
calm than me just so I can calm myself
down when I'm watching and now I'm not a
huge fan of morphe makeup I've talked
about that before I feel like their
eyeshadow palettes stink they suck like
literally they stink like when you're
putting them on your face you're like oh
my god what is that fucking smell and
then also you know I had a lot of
rotation from my Jacqueline Hill
favorites palette I actually got a
really bad like pink eye kind of thing
going on okay and it's not because my
makeup wasn't sanitized there was some
sort of rash irritation going on so I
did not like that I did not like their
concealers I just don't like morphe
makeup in general so I'm not going to
pick this up and also I have to say the
color selection just looks very very
bland to me in my opinion kinda reminds
me of like the lorac palette lots and
lots of neutral shades which is kind of
like her signature thing but then some
like pops of blue and greens in there I
don't know it just doesn't really speak
to me so that's why I am skipping on it
all right moving on and here we have the
new Lancome matte - juicy shaker's you
can see here that sophie has I think the
shade is called like Rose spritz or
something like that in her hand I feel
like that's from the Jaclyn hill pal
what should I just say rose friends I
don't know which one it is I think it's
called
I don't know now I'm looking at you know
what it might be beige vintage I'm
looking at the swatches now but yeah
this is what they look like I did try
the original lip oils out I got these
shaded cherry symfony because I'm a
musician and I had to get that one they
look very very cute but you guys are the
lasting power on these absolutely stuff
I'm talking about like reapplying them
every 15 minutes or at least for the lip
oils the original ones
now these swatches make me really want
to try this product out again I won't do
it because I'm not going to purchase
Lancome anyways since I'm cruelty free
now or working on being cruelty for you
but you can kind of see here with the
darker skin at the medium complexion and
then the light fair complexion they look
very very pigmented but then I had a few
friends that actually picked these up
and said you know what you have to
reapply them literally every 15 to 30
minutes so I don't know what's going on
with that formula not into it not
picking those up alright and lastly you
guys we have the new Urban Decay
shapeshifter palette so normally Urban
Decay really excites me with their
packaging and just like with their
overall presentation of products but
lately they really haven't been I don't
know why like the past two like I said
the afterglow palette and then this one
really don't get me too excited so here
we do have a double-ended brush which I
have plenty of those in my collection
and then you have two different palettes
so one of them is for deeper complexions
one of them is for lighter complexions
um they are a powder blush a powder
highlight - bronzing shades and then a
mirror in-between with color correctors
on the other side I do not like mixing
powders and highlights together I like
that there is a separator there but for
me I just prefer having liquids in a two
of you know what I mean I feel like they
stay better they don't get all dried out
and gunky and gross and that's pretty
much the only reason why I'm not getting
these I feel like also the color
correcting trend is done Urban Decay
released some of the best color
correctors I've ever fucking tried okay
the Urban Decay color correcting fluids
are amazing and they're saying that
these are those and like more of like a
pressed kind of version I don't believe
it I feel like they can't be as good I
just I just personally don't I think
there might be a concealer or two in
here as well but overall those don't
really excite me I think the actual face
palette the afterglow excites me a lot
more than this does um but yeah
definitely not going to pick that up so
anyway guys that is my very first anti
haul I hope there wasn't too much
reflection on this next time I will go
ahead and I will print off a photos but
yeah I hope you enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow for my review
swatches in comparison on the new Becca
Chrissy Teigen palette bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
