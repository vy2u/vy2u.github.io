channel today's video is going to be at
my May and June of 2018 I was gonna say
empty no this is a favorites
video I normally don't do monthly
favorites but because right now I am in
the process of moving and every single
video that you see until July is pre
filmed content I thought I would go
ahead and do some sort of a favorite
since I haven't been doing my fails and
holy grails now once we are moved across
the country my boyfriend and I I will go
ahead and start up fails and holy grails
again for you guys but a lot of you have
been asking for a favorites video
recently what have you been liking what
have you not been liking I'm not
actually sharing any fails in this video
it's all products I love so let's go
ahead and jump right into this
we're gonna start with a page of blush
from Milani any shade a delizioso pink
and it is gorgeous I used to be
a huge fan of a really really cool tone
blushes but I feel like I've been
reaching more so for like peachy nude
kind of blushes I jumped back into this
it has sort of like this satiny finish
to it and it's absolutely beautiful on
the cheeks now recently I found out that
hence actually discontinued my favourite
self-tanner so I went and picked up the
loving tan self-tanner which I felt like
was gonna be a bunch of because
so many people promote it but it
actually works really really well and I
find that if I have that really really
deep all of you tan complexion going in
with a pull tone blush is beautiful so
I've been loving the Milani baked blush
moving on to a shampoo and conditioner I
don't know if you guys have noticed but
lately I have been wearing my hair down
a little more because my scalp is
completely healed my have lupus since I
was 18 years old which is an autoimmune
disease that attacks the hair skin and
nails and I wasn't able to use regular
shampoos and conditioners for a very
long time because all of last year I was
actually using something that was
prescribed to me by a doctor so I
finally have a really really nice good
healthy scalp going on so I picked up
Saki bomb
nourishing conditioner as well as Saki
bomb nourishing shampoo and I got these
at Sephora now I really didn't know what
I was gonna think of these I'm the kind
of girl that normally when it comes to
shampoo and conditioner I would just go
pick something up at the drugstore to be
completely honest but I find it very
very difficult to find good cruelty-free
products when it comes to hair care at
the drugstore now I will say this can
wear your hair down a little bit
especially the shampoo it's not one of
those shampoo
that lathers up really really nicely so
if you're looking for that this is not
the product for you but the conditioner
is beautiful I really like the smell
kind of smells like cardamom which is
the typical sort of Drybar scent but
these are really really good and they
are a cruelty free option all right guys
up next I have one two three four five
different touch of glam Beauty
highlighters here I have been really
really enjoying pairing these together
especially the kind of rose gold tone
ones so this one right here is called
pocketful of roses and then this one is
very similar it's called peach passion
my friend sent me two of these and then
the others I did get from PR from Amy
herself amy is a indie makeup brand
owner and she has a lot of products on
Etsy as well as her own shop so this one
right here is called by knee diamonds
which is sort of like the wet and wild
mermaid highlighter you get that sort of
a white vibe with like a green undertone
I really do like it paired together with
pot of gold which is supposed to be a do
before trophy wife from Fanta Beauty so
I've really been enjoying those but my
two favorites have to be these guys
right here this first one is called a
reflect storm I think that's what it's
called
reflect storm yeah and it is just a
gorgeous kind of mid-tone pinky white
color i really enjoy colors like this as
far as highlighters are concerned I have
a video talking all about my favorite
pink tone highlights I'll go ahead and
throw that up in the cards let me know
if you want an updated a video and then
here is flawless flawless has just a
little bit of a deeper tone and it's a
little more of a mid-tone pink these are
buttery they're creamy they
smell good and I love supporting indie
brands so I really have been enjoying
those highlighters yum this is actually
a rollerball and I hate roller
balls you guys but I went into store
trying to find a full-size of the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana French grey
so many of you were telling me because I
love bourbon and I love rose and I love
nirvana black and Nirvana white you said
you will really really like this scent
and I have to say I love it this
is gonna be like my go-to fragrance for
the summer time but unfortunately they
do not have a full-size of this in bus
tour in Phoenix which was really
interesting because that's a pretty pop
in store and they usually have
everything they did not have the fluid
ounce like the one fluid ounce version
or the 1.6 or 1.7 so if I were to
describe this scent to you guys so this
was a point Brooke if you guys were
curious I would say it definitely has
that sort of like tea leaf sort of send
same time it's a little powdery and you
definitely have floral undertones which
is why I feel like it would be
really nice and fresh for the spring and
summertime Nirvana bourbon is one of my
go-to fall fragrances Elizabeth and
James is a cruelty free as well as a
hundred percent vegan fragrance company
and I feel like if I were to get rid of
all my perfumes that I have right now I
have old
Tory Burch and coach fragrances that I'm
still getting through it takes me a
while to get through perfumes I would
honestly be okay with replacing them
with all Elizabeth and James fragrances
because they are that good and they are
that distinct and different so I really
do like this I am for sure going to go
ahead and pick up a full-size of it let
me know if you have tried that out and
then here we have the Too Faced
chocolate gold palette and this guy
right here has a lot of lids as well as
like shades that you can smoke out on
the lower lash line but you also have
rolling in the dough so bougie cocoa
truffle and decadent which are matte
finishes so you can create a whole
entire eye look with this palette it
really doesn't look like it when you
just look at it by itself but they are
beautiful they're not like the softest
and buttery of sort of shadows but they
stay on all day long they don't crease
and I finally don't have to use an eye
primer with these so I absolutely adore
at the chocolate gold palette from Too
Faced from Becca I have been getting
back into my sunlit bronzers these are
basically the more expensive version of
the warmer butter bronzers from
Physicians Formula I can't handle that
really strong coconut fragrance this is
something to look into the first shade I
have right here is called Capri coast
which is a little more cool tone these
do have a shimmer running it through
them and this one right here definitely
gives that very very bronze look to my
complexion and then here is the bullies
and it definitely leans a little more on
the neutral side so you don't get too
many warm tones or too many cool tones I
have no idea if you'll be able to see it
on camera they look pretty darn similar
because this is the first and second to
light a shade but they are a little
different and I actually like building
these together on my cheeks as well as
just all over the outer perimeter of my
face so I've been getting a lot of use
out of those I just remember looking at
my collection behind me and just
thinking hey I really haven't reached
for those bronzers recently and I feel
like right now is the perfect time to
reach for some bronzer and get myself
all bronze and tan so love those
and then here we have a cleanser from
Burt's Bees this has quickly become a
top cleanser in my collection which is
funny because I normally don't fall in
love very quickly with cleansers I
absolutely adored the best e-jelly
cleanser from drunk elephant and that is
my number one if this is current
my number-two it is from the royal jelly
line and I'm really interested to go and
check out not the eye cream or anything
like that but like the face cream or
serum from the line now they say it's
for normal to combination skin and I can
see why this is actually a foaming
cleanser that is going to get the dirt
in the ground and the off your face
I love it for double cleansing I
wouldn't necessarily say it nourishes
the skin but it's amazing for double
cleansing it's not gonna strip your skin
to the point where you feel like you
just went in with a really harsh
cleanser and you get out of your face is
all dry but it also is nice enough to be
able to get rid of the debris that the
cleansing balm didn't get rid of so I
really do enjoy this but loving that if
you do have dry skin sensitive skin
you're sensitive to fragrance this is
something to look into absolutely I know
that I have mentioned that I feel like
viola Foss is a very very overpriced
brand and I a hundred percent stand by
that but I've been wearing this out
of this palette recently I really really
like this because we have been packing
up the apartment I wanted to keep up
some sort of palette that had warm tones
and had shimmer finishes that have
mattes that had all sorts of different
things to choose from you have cool
tones over here smoky tones over here I
just got some on my hand
you got warm tones got foil finishes
yeah shake your okay guys and this is
one of those really really great
palettes if you just need a palette
that's gonna do everything so
I've been using the crap out of this I
know a lot of you have been saying oh my
god I love your eye makeup it's looking
really good you're blending looking
really good a pallet right here had
probably the best formula that I've ever
seen bye old boss come out with so I
felt I needed to mention it because I'm
wearing this a lot on my eyes and
finally we have a foundation as well as
they mix in that I've been very very
happy with this is the Burt's Bees
goodness glow as a liquid makeup I do
have your really really light shade it's
one zero one zero ivory it's way too
 light from me currently but I
have been mixing it together with the
Becca shimmering skin perfecter liquids
in either a moonstone or pearl not that
that really darkens things up if I need
to darken this foundation I will
absolutely go in with my NYX HD
foundation mixer in warmth but this is
one of those products that is very very
much not highly rated I have a video
coming up for you guys very soon talking
about how we make low rated beauty
products work for me everything works
differently for different people
but I love this and the only thing I
will say about this is that it does not
stand a chance
as far as where time is concerned this
is one of those foundations that after
five hours you're gonna start to see it
separate sort of on the skin so what I
like to do is to pair it together with a
makeup extender I just make sure with my
dry skin to really really moisturize
ahead of time I will go in with a sticky
or tacky primer and then I will
immediately go in with this and I don't
like to use a brush I like to
specifically go in and it Pat it in with
a very very damp sponge and I really
really enjoy it I feel like the makeup
extender helps it to wear a little
longer but I don't think that your
foundation is gonna look great after
about seven hours of use so this is not
like an everyday friendly foundation
especially if you work long hours like I
do and it is nice for like date night
and things like that it is a very very
pretty look to the skin and I know that
because it does have very very natural
ingredients that's probably why it
breaks down very quickly but I actually
have been enjoying this I would stay
away if you do have combo oily skin this
is gonna slip and slide all over your
face but then like I said I have been
mixing in some of the Becca shimmering
skin perfecter liquids I find that this
is the perfect mixin that doesn't make
it look like I have a plastered on face
Harper's just looks a little more like
skin a kind of mimic skin sort of glowy
appearance to the skin without it
looking like I said too artificial so I
really do enjoy these I will add one to
two pumps into my foundation I mix it
together on the back of my hand and then
I go ahead and apply it with a damp
sponge so anyway is falling
off the ground rather than guys those
are at my current favorites I hope you
enjoyed this video I know I don't
usually do favorites all the time but a
lot of you wanted to know products that
I'm loving and a second love allathee is
so thank you so much for joining me and
I will see you guys on the next video I
don't know what day this video is going
