channel or should I welcome myself back
to my channel
I have been I guess out of commission
for the past five to six days because I
have been sick with a head cold and now
if you're wondering why I look so
beautiful and greasy is probably so
because I'm not over my head cold so
anyway I just wanted to let you guys
know that's why I had been gone I did
not going to Lucas or anything like that
it wasn't too severe I just literally
lost my voice for a couple of days and
there was no way that I could have
filmed so anyway today we're going to
talk about my August 2017 beauty returns
please please please go and read my
disclaimer down below disclaimer
disclaimer down below in the comments
section I'm going to pin to the top if
you have something to say about this I
just feel like I have everybody to
return a product if it doesn't work for
me and there are definitely different
steps that I go through before I return
a product like I see if I wanted to
clutter it to a friend yada yada yada
but yes I do make Beauty returns and I
understand that a lot of these returns
just go straight to the garbage I used
to work at Sephora I understand where a
lot of this stuff goes so please don't
think that I'm ignorant or I don't know
what I'm talking about I do but I still
think that it's a very real video and
just kind of me sharing with you guys
what happens with these products and why
they're no longer in my collection so I
thought today I would share with you
guys the ones that I have returned to
Ulta and Sephora this past month
so the first two items I actually
returned to Ulta they were from bare
minerals the first one is the complexion
rescue tinted hydrating gel cream in the
shade vanilla you get 1.18 ounces of
product injur for $30 and the second was
the bare minerals translucent light
invisible powder duo you get 0.3 1
ounces of product in here for $32 so I
remember somewhat liking the bare
minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream when I was in at
Milwaukee the one thing I didn't like
about it was that I felt like it left my
skin very very greasy and now the reason
why I left my skin very greasy was
because it does have chemical sunblock
in there and it does have an SPF of 30
and it just so happens that this
particular formula just leaves me very
very greasy I should have known it
better I just thought because I was
living in the desert now but maybe my
skin would react a little differently to
it but unfortunately it's sort of
breaking up around my nose area and in
my t-zone almost instantly after putting
it on even if I would set it in with a
powder I even tried putting a powder on
first and then putting this on top I
just can't get this to where an
incredibly long time throughout the day
it's just not worth it to me so that's
the reason why I returned that guy and
then as far as the translucent light
invisible powder duo is concerned I'm
sure you guys can see why I wanted to
pick this up it looks very similar to
the hourglass ambient lighting powders
but unfortunately these are not similar
in any way shape or form the only thing
that this looked okay for was just to
set in my foundation and basically such
a set my whole entire face and honestly
I don't want to spend $32 for a powder
when I'm just using it to set my faith
in usually I would reach for my ELF tone
correcting powder and coal or Mae
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder which are about 399 a piece I go
through powder like I go through water
even down here in the desert to set my
face so I just don't think that this was
worth it
it had one side that was like warm matte
and in one side that had more like a
glowy powder and they definitely did not
have the same sort of consistency as
hourglass powders are definitely not a
multi tasking powder like the hourglass
powders are I feel like the hourglass
can actually you can set your under eye
you can set your whole entire face you
can highlight you can do so many things
with it and unfortunately these were
just really dry and chalky and I was not
a fan or even ice products that I did
return with the Kat Von D locket powder
foundation I did get the shade like 45
you get 9 grams of product here for $35
I did return this to Sephora and I
should have known better I was
not a fan of the Lockett line anymore I
used to use it all the time when I was
in college and also in high school maybe
college I don't even know if I was out
in high school but not only when I was
in college I loved the foundation and a
lot of you were recommending the powder
foundation to me because you said if you
do buff it into the skin with nothing
else really on your skin it looks really
beautiful and it gives you a nice kind
of medium amount of coverage and this
unfortunately no matter how I used to
did look very very cakey on my skin it
emphasized fine lines and wrinkles
it was incredibly dry like just
incredibly dry all over my face and it
did not work for me so I did go ahead
and return that the next item I did
return to Sephora would be NARS radiant
creamy concealer you get six ml of
product in here for $30 now I held onto
this for a while I actually picked this
up back and the so for a vib sale and
this would probably look like six months
ago during the springtime before
obviously NARS decided not to be cruelty
free anymore so I picked it up
I really thought that maybe I would go
ahead and give it to a friend because it
didn't work for me but unfortunately I
do not think that this would work for
any of my friends skin type and this was
actually very very drying concealer I
know it is been Holy Grail for a lot of
people but for me it actually emphasized
texture and a lot of fine lines
underneath my eyes it really creates
very very much throughout the day I
definitely prefer my chart shape tape or
you know my naturally radiant creamy
concealer from Too Faced I definitely
want to try out the urban decay one next
but I'm just so shocked that this
particular concealer is so many people
totally grill because it did not work
for me whatsoever it doesn't work for me
down here in the desert it didn't work
for me when I was up in the Midwest it's
just not working for me so that was not
me a concealer that I was like goodbye
because that was $30 for only 6 ml of
product like buff that and then finally
guys we have the Beca lush list color
bomb in the shade of black viola if you
do get 0.01 ounces of products in here
for $22 I ended up purchasing three of
these and I tried them all out I did
keep two of them I really like the
strawberry shade in the almond shade but
unfortunately the black violet shade was
very very patchy so these darker shades
that you come from the Beca lush lip
color balm line or color selection the
darker ones definitely look a lot more
patching on the lips if you're someone
who deals with a lot of dry Chappy's
issues lip issues like I do with
references like I do then you're not
going to like the darker shades but I do
feel like the lighter shades fade a lot
more reasonably and they look a lot more
pretty on the lip so unfortunately this
one just didn't look good it was just so
pasty throughout the day when it would
start to fade we got in my lip line
which drove me crazy so anyway guys
those are these five products that I
returned for the month of obvious please
let me know down below if you picked up
any product that did not work for you
did you see Connor right did you return
it I would love to know and I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
