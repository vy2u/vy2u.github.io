to my channel today I'm going to walk
you guys through my current Sephora love
list now I like to do these videos
usually about every 6 to 8 months or any
time there's a big sale going on and I
believe with me blocks go through what
I'm currently eyeing and kind of what is
on at my wish list so let's go ahead and
start with this first guy right here
this is the charts Amazonian clay
12-hour blush 8 is a full-size for $29
in the shade part a and now this was a
250 points work as well as the birthday
gift that they gave out this year
alongside a tiny little charges and lip
paint and if you got this little select
sized blush this little deluxe sized
lippy and honestly this blush is amazing
it's like the most perfect pinky muted
Mabi color and I really really want a
full-size so that is the first item the
next two items are actually from Barrett
minerals
I'm usually not a fan of fair minerals
but you guys know I am obsessed with the
bare minerals skin longevity vital power
infusion it is instead of like a serum
or essence it does retail for $58 but
honestly it is so beautiful on the skin
I love what this does for my skin it
really helps a lot with texture so that
is a serum that I am iron currently and
then I've heard really good things about
the bare minerals bare skin pure
brightening serum foundation this is a
broad-spectrum SPF 20 in it it does
retail for $30 and it seems to have
about 3 star rating oh the sephora.com
website but as you guys can see how's a
little allure ml with that means I mean
this doesn't really make a difference
but it has about a 3 to 4 star rating
and then I believe on the ulta.com
website has like a five star rating so
I'm not really quite sure what's going
on with this I would love to go and
store and get a sample of this and try
it out because I have really been into
those more lightweight foundations
lately and alright next we have a bunch
of concealers the first one is one that
I have had on my list wherever this is
the Stila aqua glow serum concealer now
so many of you kept telling me don't
pick this up don't pick this up don't
pick this up but honestly and this has
been on my love list for what like eight
months now I thought I need to try it
out I'm so interested in it I really do
like the lighter foundations and lighter
concealers and I do love the Aqua glow
serum foundation so I think I'm going to
go ahead and give that a try and then I
have heard very good things about the
bare minerals their skin complete serum
coverage here under concealers retails
for $21 I probably get about the third
to lightest shade and I've heard really
good things about that as well I just
really like those naturally radiant
super creamy concealers that aren't
full-coverage so I'm looking into that
and then this guy right here is from
Tarte is the Amazonian clay waterproof
12-hour concealer that says retail for
$25 I actually use this in my full face
of samples challenge video I'm back in
like May or March or whatever and I
really liked this for spot concealing I
definitely don't like it for underneath
the eyes I prefer something that has a
little Joe put applicator or something
that comes in like a pen form like this
it's actually paint underneath my eyes
but this was great for spot concealing
and the shade fair light neutral matched
me perfectly so I would like to get that
for spot concealing and then this guy
right here is the urban decay naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer I
can actually go up and take this off of
the loveless after I do this video it
looks like urban decay is going to be
sending back to me so I'm very excited
I've heard amazing things about this I
love the Naked skin line I love their
color correcting fluids I also really
really love it the Urban Decay Naked
skin at foundation so very sighs you
tried that out and the next we have the
Smashbox camera ready BB cream for eyes
this is the broad-spectrum SPF 15 you
guys know I love the cool alright fine
little antivirus popping up there this
is basically a BB cream for the eyes I
do love the water BB cream in the shade
of fair so I was thinking of picking
this out to only $25 or so you don't
feel it gets really bad actually all
these are very very simply priced in my
eyes the only one that's super expensive
is we still are one for 27 but I yeah I
would say that this is definitely
something that's interesting to me again
anything was like the words aqua or like
lightweight coverage or just like
radiant coverage really really are going
to be excited right now
alright next we have two products here
from Smashbox or another two products
here from Smashbox this one right here
is called the halo hydrating perfecting
powder it does retail for $49 I've heard
this is beautiful on the skin so I'm
looking into that and then I thought I
would try out a foundation from Smashbox
I really haven't tried many foundations
from Smashbox if you didn't know they
recently went curl sea breeze so I
thought this would be the perfect time
to go ahead and maybe try out their
hydrating foundation my friend Jessica
really really likes this for her dry
skin if you studio skin at 15 hour
hydrating foundations I'm looking into
that next up we have a few products here
from Becca Becca has been oh my god it's
just been like my go-to brand lately so
I definitely want to try out the new
velvet blurring that primer and I want
to try out the soft light blurring
setting powder it's like this beautiful
light pink color as you guys can see and
I just think it looks so freaking
gorgeous the outside you have
shade right here which is called golden
hour but pink haze looks amazing it's
supposed to add vibrancy to the
complexion I thought maybe I could use
it for baking underneath the eye you
know whatever
so I'm looking into those two guys and
then here we have a new product from it
cosmetics this is called the secret
sauce
clinically advanced miraculous
anti-aging moisturizer those retail for
$68 but look at that packaging that
packaging is beautiful and I did like is
the what was it called that other cream
that they have it cosmetics confidence
in a cream or I should say I liked it
when I first started using and then
after a while I wasn't crazy about it
the scent and stuff friend it bothered
me but this one looks like it's going to
be a little better if you do have a more
normal skin more normal oily combo skin
I've heard this is a lot more
lightweight than the it cosmetics
confidence in a cream so we'll see about
that and then next up I do have the
karez golden crocus ageless background
elixir serum this stuff is amazing if
you want to use it kind of like a primer
in the morning it leaves the most
gorgeous glow on your skin to both my
friend Rochelle and I are obsessed with
this stuff we have two little deluxe
sized samples it does retail for a
whopping at $98 so I would probably save
this before the Sephora sale but that's
definitely something that's been on my
list it's obviously just one of those
products that I would use when I want my
skin to look good like I'm not going to
be wearing foundation I don't notice a
huge difference when I wear it as far as
like skincare benefits are concerned but
there's something about this I know that
sounds so silly to buy a skincare
product just because how it makes the
skin look but like it gives us instant
gratification sort of glow and it's very
hard to describe less you've actually
tried it but yeah I'm interested in that
I need another Sunday by the Illuma
sweeping a nice oil so I thought I would
get the smaller one for 55 I've gone
through about four or five full sizes of
this love that the best I made cosmetics
brightening setting a face powder I've
heard such good things about these so I
thought I would go ahead and pick up the
lavender one Bethany is a clothing free
brand ex ology this is a new vegan brand
at Sephora this would be natural lip
color cram and these do retail for $26
apiece and the one that definitely sold
to me the most would be shade of
boysenberry
so our name is called a chance it's a
boysenberry with a tilt of silver so I
think that was pretty cool and then as
far as this guy is concerned this would
be drunk elephant to the littles
collection you get there two different
cleansing bars you also get there on be
Hydra intensive hydration jealousy from
a day serum the virgin
marula oil the TLC frameless by call
experiment get the physical sunblock
right here and the retro whipped creme
so I thought this was a good and deal
for you know $90 for those little deluxe
sizes might not sound like it but it
really is when you think about how
expensive freaking sundae Riley and
drunk elephant are and then next to that
I have two cleansing balm I have tried
to be a cosmetic / makeup I loved this
so I would like to get a full-size of
that and then it'd be Sunday Riley it
was real expensive it was $50 and it's a
pretty small container but I poured good
things I heard it does have a kind of
like exfoliating beads inside of it it's
a blue moon tranquility cleansing balm
let me know if you've tried both Aziza
which one you would recommend alright
and moving down here we have the used to
the people fresh pressed superfood skin
kit is $54 and I recently found out this
was a cruelty free and I believe a
piquant brand it is a 3-piece kit with a
cleanser map and full-size beast cream
enriched with antioxidants and superfood
and honestly I feel like these are going
to smell really bad but it just looks so
cool I would love to try these out let's
see here this is a green tea spinach
vitamins each per version each pro
version age prevention age revenge and
cleanser we've got a kale spinach map in
the McHale spinach green tea hyaluronic
acid day cream and I feel like that
looks like a really nice time like jelly
consistency or like a really nice gel
creme consistency I don't know used to
the people definitely have caught my
attention I feel like that is not a bad
deal for $54 all right next up we have
anthem this is the certified organic
base foundation as well as the certified
organic dated blush I've been very
interested in these I will probably get
a darker shade of the organic based
foundation it looks like right here I
had fair shades Barrett saved but I
would probably go ahead and get the
shade license I have them self-tanning
and then for the blush of this
particular shade right here which is a
nice kind of berry color really spoke to
me it's called rose they also have
copper which would be beautiful in
deeper skin tones and peach will be
great if you're super super too old but
yeah Rose looks really really nice to me
and then here we have the Korres
pomegranate balancing cream gel
moisturizer I love a lot of products
from Korres I've never tried it they're
a pomegranate
lime so I thought I would try that guy
out the CIA London Khloe
Morello pretty fun and fearless
eyeshadow palette I really like the
shades in here the nice cool tone kind
of colors
I mean I feel like I have shades like
this in my collection but I'm very very
interested to try out more c-hawk a
eyeshadows I actually really really do
like the little palette that I have from
memmer which I believe it's called like
the grunge or some piece like this
grungy it would be Olivia Palermo
collection it has these nice grungy
fall-like colors so very interested in
that next up we have the Josie Maran at
juicy mango whipped argon oil self panic
body butter how yabby kale yeah that was
amazing because this sounds amazing like
I want to eat this it says here a
luxurious lightweight body butter that
gives instant caramel color that
develops into a long-lasting medium can
in as little as four hours it sounds
amazing excuse me it looks like it has
horrible not horrible reviews but not
the greatest so I need to go double
check the reviews but just sounds
amazing
I really love the Josie Maran body
butters they are a little on the
moisturizing side like a little too
moisturizing sometimes but very oily but
I feel like that smell the scent sounds
amazing this is a vegan product I've
always been into the more vegan kind of
self tanners like the hemp ones I'm
interested in that next up we have the
Urban Decay Velvet Iser so many people
are saying just mix in your powder with
any sort of foundation it's the same
thing but I'm still pretty interested in
this guy Josie Marans here argon milk
intensive hydrating treatment i am
currently going through the intensive
creamy oil but once that's done i want
to purchase this guy and then finally we
have two han nutrition supplements i
started to start up on kind of
supplements again now that I'm playing
with my lupus trial when I was on my
little trial I was not allowed to be
taking any sort of supplement but no I
am allowed so a moody bird is really
nice PMS symptoms and then our to
prepare has a lingonberry extract in it
just reminds me of like my Swedish
heritage it Sonoma does Swedish and I
don't know I ate a lot of them
lingonberry on top of my mashed potatoes
growing up so yeah this was really
really interesting to me and that just
excuse me sorry guys it's all Lola sec
this still looks really really
interesting to me and I think would be
nice for my hair and again noting the
guy benefit this is currently what does
that mic before a loveless I want to
know what the is on yours let me
know down below and I guess I'll see you
guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
