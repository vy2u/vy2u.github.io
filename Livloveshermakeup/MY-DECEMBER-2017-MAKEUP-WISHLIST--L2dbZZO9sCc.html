on okay hey guys how's it going welcome
back to my channel today I have my
December 2017 make up a wish list to
share with you guys and I have here with
my little fat man mr. B mr. bata yes in
all his glory and all his little Sneaky
glory anyway so today like I said we are
going to be talking all about makeup
products that I would like to pick up
during this month now I have already
gone ahead and placed an order for a
couple of these items I feel like I'm
getting this video up a little on the
light side but anyway without further
ado guys let's go ahead and jump right
into it are you sleepy so we are gonna
go ahead and start with the new cover FX
shimmer veils and these are supposed to
be crease proof shimmers for the eyes
and beyond so you can actually use them
on your face like your skin as well as
your whole entire body your lips and
your eyes they're also lip safe which is
awesome and these are $28 apiece which i
think is pretty damn high but these are
not the glitter drops that I was talking
about in my anti haul these are actually
a different sort of product so they're
supposed to be like a smooth shimmer and
they kind of remind me of like the Stila
glitter and glows so I want to pick up
at least two of these and then I will do
some sort of a review whether it be on
my snapchat my Instagram or on here and
I will talk about what the difference is
between the Stila glitter glows and the
cover in fact shimmer glows or
shimmervale as they're called so the
shades that we have here are halo as
well as celestial magic amethyst so Leia
as well as moonstone and the two that
I'm really drawn to of the two darkest
which are Soleil and moonstone so I
definitely want to go ahead and pick two
of those up I believe they release
pretty darn soon so I'm very excited for
that up the next guy do we have the new
diamond highlighter from the chocolate a
Soleil I'm sorry chocolate called
collection from Too Faced now I did talk
about these in a will I buy a video and
I told you I wanted to purchase it after
I did the chocolate gold bar review a
lot of people were asking me if I
changed my mind I did not change my mind
I actually already purchased this so it
is on its way like I said I will include
it in some sort of video whether it be a
review or a shop my stash or something
like that whenever it gets here but I'm
super excited because I feel like this
is gonna be really good quality and the
chocolate goal that Palin ended up
really really surprisingly I thought
that was great excellent quality so I'm
very excited about this collection and
yes I already went ahead and purchased
the diamond highlighter
guys we have the new a metal matte mini
palette from Kat Von D I'm surprised a
lot of people aren't liking this so far
I've seen a quite quite a few reviews on
Instagram as well as snapchat and as
well as YouTube and it seems like a lot
of people are saying that the mattes are
incredibly hard to blend I've always
thought the Kat Von D maps are a little
harder to blend in general but I still
want this because although it does have
a few overlapping shades from the
full-size metal matte palette I've
always wished that the metal map was a
little smaller and then I could travel
with it it's not travel friendly it's
very long and linear and it's super
super skinny but super long like I said
it doesn't really fit into my purse it
doesn't really fit into anything so I am
still gonna go ahead and pick this up I
love these shaded Doce or Dolce I'm a
heading full size of that thunderstruck
shade as well and both of those actually
shattered so I would love thunderstruck
and do--she and in this particular
palette and although they do have some
overlapping shades in here I still feel
like I'm gonna use this a lot so yes I
will be going ahead and picking up the
Kat Von D mini metal matte palette it
does retail for $39 and it is currently
in store at my Sephora so I'm gonna go
to the store first I will swatch it out
and then I'll probably end up picking it
up alright guys up next we have a
product here from Tarte cosmetics this
is the new a foil finger paints a shadow
palette it is from the rainforest of the
sea collection which in my opinion is
one of the better collections from a
Tarte so I am probably going to pick
this up because I did see a really great
review on it now there is a three
different shades and they all are kind
of like a foiled consistency they look
incredibly pigmented and incredibly
beautiful but then you have another pan
that has a little slit between the two
of them those are more glitter Stoppers
but the way that I saw and this review
being done the girl was actually taking
them and kind of foiling down her brush
picking up the product and when she put
them on top of the other foiled
eyeshadows they were so blinding and
they almost looks like a Stila glitter
and glow on the eyes without having to
work with the wet formula so I thought
this was very interesting and intriguing
it is around the 30 dollar mark so I'm
gonna go ahead and possibly pick this
one up let me know if you have tried it
out too but yeah I'm definitely
interested in new foil finger paints of
shadow palette from Tarte cosmetics
all right here we have a new liquid
highlighter formula from wet and wild I
want to pick up at least three of these
there are different shades here but
these are really really beautiful and
they also have like a new mint
cushion foundation for $8.99 a new
eyeshadow quad for $2.99 the color
eyeshadow 10 p.m. palettes which will be
$4.99 I know those are their new
reformulated sort of eyeshadow palettes
let me know if you guys want me to pick
up a few of those as well I personally
love my comfort zone palette but that is
the old-school formula but anyway these
look really interesting to me I actually
saw my friend Amy review these and she
said that they are very similar to the
cover FX custom enhancer drops so yes I
am very very very excited about these I
think the shades that I want are hallo
goodbye which is a really really
beautiful kind of a darker pink or shade
and then I also want halo gorgeous and
rosy and ready so probably all of the
pink toned ones but the gold ones and
the bronze one look really beautiful as
well alright guys the moving right along
to the final product here we have the
new a dose of color eyeshadow palettes
we have sassy siennas as well as
blushing berries I already purchased in
the sassy cno's one let me tell ya these
only have five eyes shadows in them and
I've never tried the dose of colors
eyeshadows before I actually have a few
products from a dose of color sitting in
my collection right now I'm waiting to
do a testing on indie makeup brands
video even though they're not really
India anymore they used to be a happy
highlighter from them a lipstick as well
as the ice cream palette but I also want
to add this one into the video you know
I've heard great things about their
eyeshadow formulas I have like touched
them before in Alta Beauty and I thought
they were just so soft and buttery and
gorgeous so for me I would like to go
ahead and pick probably the other one up
at some point as well if I do enjoy
these sassy Tiana's palette but it looks
like it's very long and linear easy to
pack into your purse beautiful colors
and those shades right there like the
orange e warm tones really really call
to me so I love a kind of warmer tone
palette when it has more orange e and
bird colors in it not so much of reds
and Pink's I feel like when I put reds
and Pink's on my eyes they get a little
um I don't know I almost look a little
sick but when I put something like this
on the house like hot coral scent it
looks amazing so I'm very excited for
that palette to arrive they did release
on December 9th and 10:00 at Pacific
Standard Time and currently it looks
like you can purchase two at a time and
they both are in stock so anyway
that is it for my December 2017 and make
up wish list let me know what has caught
your eye of this holiday season and I
guess I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
