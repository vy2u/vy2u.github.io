channel today's video is going to be all
about my favorite beauty sponges lately
I've been getting asked a lot about what
are my favorite makeup brushes what are
my favorite beauty tools what are my
favorite beauty sponges so I thought I
would share with you guys today my
favorite little spongebob so I have all
of them dampened so you guys can see the
full size let's go ahead and jump right
into it before we do that I do want to
say really quickly I am not showing the
Beauty Blender in this particular video
just because I did not find it
worthwhile to be purchasing the Beauty
Blender I think anything over $15 is
just a little too much for me personally
no matter what I wash my sponges with
whether it be a natural soap or my
philosophy purity cleanser or the Beauty
Blender solid or the cleanser version
like actual gel version all of my
sponges start to disintegrate after two
months that includes the Beauty Blender
and I just don't think it's worth it so
everything that I'm going to share with
you guys is under $12 let's go ahead and
jump right into it so my all-time
favorite sponge is the miracle
complexion sponge from Real Techniques
as you guys can see this one is I think
about three months old so it's starting
to fall apart a little bit this does
retail for $6.99 on the Ulta calm
websites I love the pointed side for
going ahead and applying my concealer
and then I like the flat side for
applying full coverage foundations it's
also really really good with any sort of
foundation that is like a medium
coverage
what I like to do is take the foundation
and either apply it directly on to the
sponge if it's a super full coverage
like a mousse II kind of texture I'll do
that or I will go ahead and I will put
the foundation on and then I will blend
it in with this sponge this one is
awesome would HIGHLY highly recommend to
you guys it is super super nice and soft
and I just love it so much
alright the next one I have here is the
Ulta makeup sponge it looks like a
little egg and this one is a little
stained as you guys can see this was
like the worst color ever to pick they
do have like pink ones so that's what
I'm going to get next but these are the
ultime cup sponges you can get two for
$10 they come in a little case of two
and that is what they look like this one
reminds me the most of the Beauty
Blender so if you want a dupe I would
highly recommend this the only thing
that I feel like it's not very similar
to the Beauty Blender is the fact that
it doesn't really have like a pointed
end it's more like an egg shape as you
can probably see it is very soft and
squishy though and I just love the way
it applies on my foundation now I will
say because it doesn't really have that
pointed and it's a little harder to
apply color correctors and concealers
but for the most part you can apply your
foundation with this side or on the
bottom and it's just really really
beautiful love the finish that I get
with this really enjoy the sponge
alright next we do have the flawless
finish sponge-on it's cosmetics this is
retail for $7.99 on the Ulta home
website it does have a little slanted
angle as you guys can see and this one
definitely is a little more dense now
I'm usually like really really soft
sponges but this one is great for
applying any sort of really really
liquidy foundation so if you have a
serum foundation or a water-based
foundation and you're worried that these
kind of sponges right here will just
sink the product right into them and
you'll lose the actual coverage or you
will actually lose the product this will
not do that so I really like to go ahead
and just apply it right onto the sponge
or go ahead put the foundation on and
then blend in with this I don't lose the
coverage I do not lose any sort of
product really really do enjoy it that
sponge all right next we do have the
miracle diamond sponge this does retail
for $9.99 this is from a real techniques
as well it does have a little marble to
print on it probably the prettiest
sponge that I do own I love this I did
not think I was going to like this at
first because this little tip up here I
thought was so flimsy but it is awesome
for going in to the little crevices
around your nose and kind of picking out
the product there so it doesn't build up
and also if you do have fine lines and
wrinkles underneath your eyes it's
really nice for kind of making sure that
nothing is going to start creasing
throughout the day you can just go like
this and kind of get right into the
inner corner really really love that and
then the bottom part right here is nice
and flat and really good for applying
foundation super super quickly on to the
skin so really do enjoy that sponge and
now we do have the miracle body sponge
this thing is absolutely huge as you can
tell it is $7.99 this is my favorite for
applying foundation in a flash like
literally if you guys would like me to
do it get ready with me using this
sponge let me know as you can see damp
it is huge but it literally will apply
your foundation in I would say 30
seconds 30 seconds a new sort of
foundation it's amazing but what I like
to use this the most for as you guys can
probably see these darker stains here is
actually for applying self-tanner you
can use a damp you can use a dry it's
really nice around the hand area and the
wrist area I see so many people
especially on YouTube that have like
stain
wrists and hands and I have three layers
of self-tanner on right now you probably
can't even see any stains and that is
because I go in with this damp sponge
and pick up any sort of excess after I
put my self tanner on so this is a
really really nice bunch for that really
do enjoy it and if you do need to put
body makeup on you can go ahead and do
it with this as well all right and
finally guys we have the pure cosmetics
little trio so I actually got this in a
boxy charm I believe these are hard as a
rock and even when you do have them damp
like this one it still feels hard as a
rock
I hate these for applying foundation I
hate them for applying concealer three
of them will set you back $36 which is
$12 a piece this is the priciest
little sponge I'm showing in this
particular video but what I love doing
with these is actually baking they're
really really nice they don't soak up
any sort of a powder so you just kind of
dampen them a little bit dip them into
your loose powder and then go directly
in underneath your eyes or around your
mouth area wherever you need to bake and
they do a great job at that so you get
three of them a blue one a pink one and
a yellow one for $36 or $12 a piece and
I do enjoy them they're not my favorite
I don't know if I would repurchase but
they are pretty good and I am enjoying
them right now all the other sponges
that I showed I would definitely
repurchase so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let us know down
below what is your favorite sponge to
work with and I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow from a files and Halla
