my channel today's video is going to be
all about my favorite cruelty free
foundations and this is a viewer
requested video so yeah let's go ahead
and just jump right into it the first of
all I want to talk about what comments
absolutely no surprise to you guys if
you've been watching me for a while
it is the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid I wear the lightest
shade which is called dynamic and at the
bottom it does say to shake well because
this is a very very liquidy foundation
it is infused with argan oil and here is
what the packaging looks like most of
Josie Marans products are vegan I don't
know if this one is but I know it is for
sure cruelty free a lot of her products
or I would say the majority of them like
I said are infused with argan oil so
they're very very moisturizing this
would be great if you do have dry skin
normal skin at mature skin I think you
would love this foundation it gives a
really really nice amount of coverage
without making it look completely matte
on your skin it's very very hydrating
not something that I can wear during the
summer time but this is probably my
all-time favorite foundation as far as
the winter time is concerned I also
really have been loving these two Urban
Decay foundations right here urban decay
is a cruelty free brand however they are
owned by a parent company that tests on
animals so I just wanted to let you guys
know that but these are the bacon skin
foundations and also the Urban Decay all
nighter foundation now this one I've
been playing with for longer I do wear
these shade is 0.5 which is the lightest
out of I believe 24 I'm not a huge fan
of the packaging it's really really
cheap kind of like acrylic packaging and
also the shade range and also just the
fact that this oxidizes like crazy kind
of turns me off a little bit but if I
want my skin to look absolutely perfect
it is the foundation I reach for if this
is my all-time favorite this is my
second favorite it's really beautiful it
has a nice buildable kind of coverage to
it and I just love the way it makes my
skin look so that is the Urban Decay all
nighter and then the naked skin is
something that I have recently tried out
and I fell in love instantly I also wear
the shade is 0.5 and although it does
look a very very yellow in the tube it's
actually a really really nice color
match for me personally now this is
definitely one of those more light to
medium kind of coverage foundations but
it truly does look like skin like when
you have this on it just looks like you
have beautiful natural looking skin
nothing ever looks cakey nothing ever
looks like not natural it's just really
really beautiful and I do like it it
doesn't really have buildable coverage
but it still is a very very solid
foundation
the next one I want to talk about is a
serum foundation or what I would
consider a water-based foundation this
is the Scylla aqua Glo serum foundation
in the shade of fair Stila recently went
cruelty free which is absolutely awesome
this is not my all-time favorite serum
or water-based
AB foundation I do prefer these Smashbox
and BB water drops over this one but
this one definitely has the highest
coverage level so if you are looking for
one of these foundations that has a
really nice slip to it like that
water-based kind of slip it will leave a
little bit of hydration or a little bit
of moisture on your skin but you also
want a nice amount of coverage this is
the one I would recommend this
particular shade which is called fair
does lean a little more on the pink tone
side so if you're a very very yellow
base I would go in store and swatch them
but yeah really really adore that and
the next one is from Tarte cosmetics
this is the Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation I have gone through three of
these in the past five years I love
wearing this on a stage the shade that I
wear is called fair beige it does claim
to be 12-hour wear oil-free and it does
have broad-spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen in
it it is really really good Rimmel does
make the stay matte foundation which is
very similar to this but reynold us
tests on animals now Tarte does not test
on animals but they are owned by a
company that does tests I think they're
owned by Estee Lauder actually I don't
know if they're owned by us a lottery
you guys let me know down below but I
know that they are owned by a brand that
does actually test on animals but yeah
this is a really really wonderful
wonderful foundation if you want
something that is buildable all the way
up to a super super full coverage you
would absolutely adore this this is what
I will be using instead of the Loreal
Pro matte foundation which was one of my
favorites for a very long time as far as
being onstage is concerned this one
comes in very very close to that one and
it is just beautiful so I love that I
also really really enjoy my NARS Velvet
Matte skin tint with broad-spectrum SPF
30 sunscreen now this is a marketed as a
skin tint but no it truly is a
foundation the shade that I wear is
Tarun wave a light 2-0 which is the
lightest out of I believe 18 different
shades I don't think the color selection
is that good because this one still
leans very very pink and orange e toned
on my skin personally it's like a
mixture of pink and orange which is
really unflattering but I do love to
wear it during the summer time I would
not say that it leaves you completely
matte if you are someone with extremely
oily skin and you're thinking this is
just going to be like a lifesaver
it actually really truly gives a nice
like Danny Matt or kind of glowy
complexion which is very strange I now
not like the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid where you're gonna see
like oil on the skin where it's very
very like a true sheen but this one
definitely gives a demi matte appearance
to the skin now if you do have
combination skin a demi matte appearance
to the skin is beautiful because it's
going to hydrate your dry areas it's
gonna take care of like your oily areas
it just looks very flattering on the
skin so I really really do like this and
I would highly recommend checking that
out
NARS is owned by Abraham that does test
on animals but they themselves do not
and then finally the last one I want to
talk about is my all-time favorite
travel foundation and this is the
anasazi of Beverly Hills stick
foundation in the shade porcelain you
only get I think is 0.25 ounces of
product in here which really is not a
lot this is all that I currently have
left but this is amazing for travel
because obviously it doesn't come in a
bottle that might crack open and you
know go around everywhere in your
luggage so you can literally just paint
this onto your skin my only issue that I
have is that it does start to dry out
after a while so I actually found like
an Instagram person who was she was
making like beauty videos and she was
putting oil on top before she would
apply it and I think that's a great idea
so I did that from my last trip and it
seemed to work really really well so
very very happy with that if you are
someone who does have more combination
to oily skin you would like this if you
have a more dry skin I would stay away
but anyway that is it guys those are all
of my top like cruelty free foundations
I do hope you enjoyed this video
definitely let me know down below what
your top cruelty free foundation is and
I will see you guys tomorrow for look of
the week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
