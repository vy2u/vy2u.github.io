to my channel today's video is going to
be all about my favorite blush formulas
I'm super excited because I have some
wonderful blushes in my collection but
there are definitely some favorites and
I am going to start with my all-time
favorite and then go into the ones that
are also favorites but just not like the
ultimate fade that makes sense so I have
six different formulas to talk about
here let's go ahead and jump right into
it so my first ultimate favorite is
definitely the Too Faced love flush
long-lasting sixteen-hour blushes they
do have six different shades I own all
of them in full size but these two
shades right here are my favorites the
first one is love hangover first of all
look at this packaging can we just yeah
it's adorable the first shade that I
love the most is definitely love
hangover although this is very very warm
tone it's just amazing it's really
gorgeous
it has a nice peachy iridescent to it
and actually every single one of these
blushes does have a little bit of like
Sheen to it now it's not anything super
super noticeable until you get it on to
your actual skin it's not glitter it's
not chunks of shimmer it really is just
a really nice natural glowy blush on the
skin but I really really love that shade
and I also really do love your love as
king which is a beautiful beautiful deep
berry color if you do have a dark
complexion this would show up on you I
think the majority of them would show up
on those of you who do have a fair -
light complexion if you do have a deep
complexion you may have to look around
and kind of you know figure out which
one you want to maybe go and store and
swatch them but these are really
beautiful they are incredibly long
wearing and I just love the way they go
onto the skin and the way the fake build
so that is definitely my first favorite
formulation of blush my second favorite
is actually from Illamasqua and these
are the powder blushes I really like all
of the different finishes that they have
but my favorites are definitely the
matte so the first one I have to share
is my all-time favorite the shade is
called lover it is a beautiful kind of
orange creamsicle color I hope you guys
can see that these are the softest
blushes you will ever touch in your life
especially the matte formulas so let me
swatch this one for you guys they are
very pigmented and they seem to have
like a little bit of a white undertone
which really actually helps to cover so
if you do have like a problematic skin
lots of acne or even texture these glide
over the skin beautifully they do have
DeMatha cone in them and they just go on
very very nicely to the skin and then my
favorite or my second favorite one I
should say in like the pink
category is the shade called Katy this
is a really really cool toned pink color
definitely ma show up on every single
skin tone but if you are fair complected
especially with a cool undertone I would
HIGHLY highly recommend to this shade so
there is the shade at Katie's swatched
so I really do love that formulation I
know that they are not sold at Sephora
anymore but you can still order them
online absolutely love those yellow
mascot powder blushes the third formula
that I want to talk about is from Becca
these are their luminous flushable
lushes they are insanely insanely
pigmented even though they are like a
luminous kind of blush the first one
that I do have here is the sheet a tiger
lily and I do probably plan on getting
all of these I still don't know where
mice where I kind of stand on the whole
cruelty-free thing as far as like having
a parent company that owns the brand so
I don't know if I will be purchasing
more becca products they still haven't
made my mind up but this is what the
shade a tiger lily looks like it is
gorgeous has a nice amount of sheen to
it and these are basically their mineral
blushes mixed together with some of
their shimmering skin perfecter so
really really stunning and then the
other shade that I do have is this one
right here which is called Snapdragon
which is a hot quarrel they have lots of
light pinks as well and I do feel like
some of these would show up on very very
deep complexion so this is also really
really gorgeous and I just love the
sheen that it gives to the skin it
doesn't emphasize any sort of texture or
breakouts which is awesome so there they
are together Snapdragon I'm sorry
Snapdragon and then there is Tiger Lily
so those are the two that I own that I
am absolutely in love with alright
moving on the next formula I want to
talk about ease out so from Becca this
is actually the mineral blush line these
are very very pigmented you do have to
be kind of careful with these but my
favorite shade is actually called wild
honey which is a really really neutral
color as you guys can see it does lean a
little more on the warm tone side which
I do have a cool undertone but I just
love the way that this looks on the skin
so there is the shade warm honey it
almost has like a terracotta sort of
look to it almost like a bronzer but it
really looks nice on the skin so that is
what it looks like it does have a matte
formula but maybe the tiniest amount of
Sheen to it like a satin sort of formula
really really beautiful that you have
ones that have some micro glitters as
well I have a shade called songbird
which is also beautiful but wild honey
is my favorite again these are all true
ultra pigmented so definitely be careful
when you do apply them
the skin they are not something that you
really build up on your skin you want to
use like a fluffy brush and then they
just go on full impact so really do you
like that formula as well the next one I
want to talk about is from makeup geek I
really do like the makeup geek blushes
and these are two of my favorites so the
first shade that is my all-time favorite
is called spellbound which is a
beautiful beautiful kind of nudie coral
color or nudie peach color I guess you
could say they're very very creamy and
soft and very pigmented but they're so
easy to blend they are probably the
easiest blush to blend that I have in my
collection besides the Illamasqua one so
there is the shade that is called
spellbound really really nice has a tiny
bit of your add essence to it as well
and then I really love secret admirer
which is actually more of like a lilac
II cooler kind of color
I don't usually reach for like purpley
lilac blushes but this one is really
gorgeous and like I said they're just so
so so easy to blend on the actual skin
and very pigmented so those are the
makeup geek blushes really really good
quality I know I don't talk about makeup
geek all that often but they have some
awesome awesome blushes and finally the
last formula I want to talk about is
definitely from the balm cosmetics I
think they're insane blushes are
incredible I have these shade at 20
Twilight I think it's called um but then
I also do have these guys right here so
these are definitely favorites if I had
to choose one out of these ones that I
do have I would choose frat boy which is
funny again because it does have a warm
undertone but this is a beautiful
beautiful matte kind of peachy coral
shade and I will show you guys what it
looks like
they're not as smooth and buttery as
some of the other formulas that I'm
showing you in this video but they are
very very pigmented and incredibly long
wearing so there is the shape called
frat boy I also have down boy and look
at the packaging so cute this one is a
really nice cool toned pink shade as you
guys can see so here is the shade down
boy and then if you do want something
with a little bit of Sheen to it I would
HIGHLY highly recommend hot mama this is
supposed to be a dupe of Fort narses
orgasm which I do believe I have see the
side-by-side swatches of them and they
look very very similar so here is the
shade hot mama and this just have a nice
amount of sheen to it without looking
like glitter on your face so these are
definitely a little more on the powdery
side but they are very very well priced
and gorgeous when you actually have them
on the cheeks so anyway those are my
favorite blush formulas definitely let
me
down below what your favorite blush
formulas are I would love to hear and
yeah that's pretty much it I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
