channel today's video is going to be all
about my most repurchase makeup products
of all time
so through high school through college I
will tell you guys how many times I have
actually purchased this product because
I do keep track on a spreadsheet let me
know if you want a separate video on how
I do my Google sheets how I do my makeup
inventory all that kind of stuff but
yeah also let me know if you would like
a skincare addition to this and it may
be a more updated version kind of like
cruelty free repurchase items because
obviously these are from all times I
just started going cruelty free in the
last 4 to 5 months so I still do have
products in my collection that were
tested on animals that I purchased
previously but anyway I'll go ahead and
jump right into it we are going to start
with the elf tone correcting powder in
cool and this is what it looks like and
I have repurchased this 69 times yes you
heard that correctly 69 has okay now
that is what it looks like on the inside
as you can see it's kind of like this
nice mosaic kind of coloring I have
started to get BBP on on this one I love
this powder it is my all-time favorite
powder it's beautiful finely milled on
the skin especially nice if you do have
a spare to light complexion that pulls a
strong cool undertone would HIGHLY
highly recommend abs alright next we
have another powder that should come
this absolutely no surprise as well this
is the essence all about matte 16
compact powder I have purchased this 27
times since I first started using it and
when I first started using it I think I
was in college maybe like sophomore year
and I had really really oily skin so
this was something that was great for me
it still works fantastic it's what I
have on my face today it's beautiful if
you do have a darker skin tone
unfortunately it might look a little
ashy on your skin but if you are a
little lighter complexion you want a
really really nice cheap product that is
cruelty free that will go ahead and suck
up that oil this is a really good one
alright the next one I have here is the
elf makeup mist and set I have
repurchased this 17 times since I was a
senior in high school I'll go ahead and
insert a photo because unfortunately I
can't find mine right now I still have
boxes that are packed in here they don't
have a non packed I am just taking my
sweet precious time with that I'm
packing but this is a great great
settings for you guys it is very very
nice a very comparable in my opinion to
the Smashbox photo finish primer water
spray as well as the makeup forever nope
not makeup forever what am I talking
about as well as
wet and wild photo focus setting spray
so I really enjoy all three of those in
this one like I said I have repurchased
17 times which is a lot next we have the
wet and wild reserve your Cabana bronzer
I have repurchases in nine at times I
first started using it when I was in
college I believe you guys can see if
I'll worn off here I used to use this to
actually kind of highlight my face and
then also I would use it to set my under
eye area I'm now can actually dust this
all over my face it's very similar to
the hourglass ambient lighting powders
in that aspect where it can kind of
multitask in a lot of different ways it
can be a highlight it can be an under
eye setting powder you can just it all
over your face now that I'm not as oily
this is just something I've really been
enjoying a lot and I'm sure I will go
ahead and repurchase as well all right
the next products that we have here is
another one that I can't find in my
collection currently it is the Revlon
nearly naked oppressed powder I
repurchases seven at different times it
was my go-to when I was in I think high
school now when I was in high school I
used to go ahead and self tan so I was
like super super Orange oompa loompa
status and I loved this powder because
it would match my orange neck so that is
why I used to purchase it it's not
something I purchase anymore but it is a
really nice finely milled powder if they
just need to work on their color
collection alright next we have the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
the shade of perversion
I have repurchase of seven different
times that is the most out of any sort
of eyeliner I've ever purchased I also
have a repurchase of the shade is zero I
believe five or six times so this is
just a really really nice massive black
eyeliner I've used it all the way
through high school as well as college I
do currently so go and reach for it but
I'm definitely more inclined to reach
for my it cosmetics and note of
waterproof gel eyeliner in black that
one stays on literally all day if you
watched me on snapchat you know I have
the hardest time getting that off at
nighttime and in the morning there's
still residual eyeliner on but yeah this
is a really good eyeliner and I still do
enjoy it quite a bit
alright the next product we have here is
the Revlon what is it called kissable
balm stain in the shade honey this is
honestly something I have not reached or
into a very long time as you can see
this particular packaging is really worn
off as well so it's just one of those
little lip crams like this it does smell
really nice kind of like mint this
actually reminds me a lot of like those
tarte lipsurgence kind of lip products
now this is the gorgeous color and that
is why I have repurchased it so many
times so it has been repurchase like I
said it's a different time
throughout the years and it's a
beautiful color but whatever we
purchased obviously we're at one of
those tests on animals they used to not
but now they do I wish they would go
back to cruelty free status that would
be awesome or even as far as we have
here is the maybelline instant age
rewind I'm going to be really sad when I
MC this out I have gone through six of
these and I've been using them since I
was in college this particular shade I
get is called the brightening
illuminating version this one is a
little more like pink based and it's
super super nice on my cool undertone I
don't like this on top of my foundation
it's a little too dark but I do like it
underneath I just go right underneath my
eyes and then on my eyelids blend it in
with a sponge it looks amazing really
does help to cover dark circles and it
does not take up the little fine lines
and wrinkles that you might have
underneath your eyes which is awesome
all right next we have these arts
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
I have repurchases five different times
again can't find in my collection
currently like I said so unpacking the
beauty rooms I'll go ahead and insert a
photo here if you watched my sentimental
and makeup products video you will know
why exactly I first started using that
foundation I have a lot of sentimental
attachment to that product I'll go ahead
and throw that video up in the cards if
you're interested kind of my makeup
memory box but yeah that is an awesome
foundation probably my all-time favorite
foundation I have not tried it again
since we moved here to Arizona but I
definitely will let you guys know if
it's still working for me it's got full
coverage it's kind of a messy
consistency and it definitely is
buildable which is awesome so really
really enjoy that next we have the
hourglass ambient lighting powders I
haven't gone ahead and repurchase by
full sizes of ethereal light for full
sizes of diffuse like and one full size
of mood light so this is what a serial
light looks like it's my favorite
because it is a cool town opalescent
white powder kind of might be wet and
wild reserve your Cabana you can use
this as a highlight you can use it all
over your face if you have more normal
to dry skin you can also dust it
underneath your eyes to set in your
actual products like your concealers or
your foundation it's a wonderful
wonderful product and like I said I've
gone through so many of these I don't
use it as much anymore but I should
because this is a great product all
right next we do have the benefit
they're real mascara this is my most
repurchase mascara in my collection I
really want to find a cruelty free dupe
the reason why I love it
is because of the wand so that is what
it looks like as you guys can see it and
the one is super super nice like a
little medieval torture device and you
have the little ball on one end and then
you have really really nice spikey
rubber bristles for the one so I really
like that I can get into all the inner
corners with the tiny ball and then even
the outer lashes which are really hard
to get I always just go like that this
is a great mascara like I said I've been
repurchasing this over and over and over
again since I was in high school
would it repurchase it again but it is a
good one and finally we have the cap on
D luck a tattoo foundation this is
something I've don't really change my
mind about would not repurchase again
and this particular one right here is
light 42 I mix the late 42 together with
late 44 this looks like plaster on my
face now and I have repurchased those
five times I honestly thought I have
repurchased this like eight times but no
it's only been five times but I yeah it
is really nice if you have oily skin if
you have a lot to cover this is a great
foundation but unfortunately for me it
just emphasizes all my texture on my
face and it's just not something I reach
for very often anymore so anyway guys
those are my most important makeup
products of all time let me know what
yours are down below and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
