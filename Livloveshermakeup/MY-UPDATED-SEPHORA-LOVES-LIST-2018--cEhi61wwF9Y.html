channel today I have my updated 2018
Sephora loves list to share with you
guys I normally do these videos before
big sales that are happening at Sephora
but I thought it would still be fun to
go ahead and just update you on what I
cleared out of my loves list for 2018 so
towards the end of December I cleared
out a bunch of stuff and what's in it
right now so let's go ahead and jump
right into it I do want to say before we
get started at this video as you can see
towards the bottom of the screen here is
pre film so anything that's on sale
right now as I'm filming this may be no
longer be on sale when I'm actually
putting this video up but I just wanted
to put that out there everything that
you've seen the past week and a half has
pretty much been a pre film video I have
been incredibly incredibly busy with
work and gigs so this is the Urban Decay
troublemaker eyes shadow palette with a
travel sized troublemaker mascara I
haven't heard very good things about
this troublemaker mascara however this
eyeshadow palette I've seen it in person
and although it looks very warm toned in
this particular photo I feel like
there's actually a lot of cool and
neutral tones in here this reminds me of
one of their old school palettes I
cannot remember the name of it but for
$24 I feel like this is a pretty good
deal now I have to really sit there and
say do you just want it because it's $24
would you purchase it at $39 am I just
excited because it's on sale or do I
actually want the palette so I'm gonna
go ahead and leave this on the loves
list for now I will let you know if it's
something that never makes it into my
shopping cart I will have one of those
videos coming up very soon for you guys
but yeah that's the Urban Decay
troublemaker eyeshadow palette and
travel sized mascara up and next we have
these Smashbox Studios skin 24-hour
waterproof concealer I thought that this
was relatively new but it's actually the
side-by-side concealer as it released
with the Smashbox Studios Skin
Foundation now I feel like this shade
selection here is pretty shitty
considering this came out like a year
and a half ago so I may not support this
and actually purchase this concealer but
you do get 0.08 ounces of product for
twenty-five dollars and if I do get one
on the shade I would pick up is fair
light so I'm kind of unsure about this
product as well kind of like the urban
decay so maybe that will make it into my
shopping cart maybe it won't next up we
do have the Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer in the hydrating
version now I recently tried out the so
called dupe to this and that is let's
see here the next hydro touch primer and
fortunately the fragrance level in there
is just a little too much for me I love
everything about it except with the
fragrance level now this guy right here
is apparently fragrance free so I
thought this would be a little better
for me it is a gel foundation primer
that instantly cools hydrates and
refreshes and soothes the skin so $42
for one fluid ounce of product here I do
like a lot of Smashbox primer so I would
like to go ahead and try that out I
think I've gotten a sample of it before
and I did like it all right up next we
have the cover effects shimmervale in a
beautiful lilac color as well as this
color right here which is called halo so
these are actually $28 a piece which is
four dollars more than a Stella glitter
and glow but it's a multi-dimensional
shimmer in a weightless cream texture
for a high-impact finish on the eyes
lips and beyond I wanted to go ahead and
test these out against the Stila glitter
and glows and let you guys know what my
favorite cream eyeshadows and cream
glitters are from the drugstore as well
as high-end so I do want to pick up at
least two of these so the shades that I
have on my list right now like I said
are amethyst which is an iridescent
lavender shimmer as well as halo which
is a holographic multi-dimensional
shimmer alright moving on we have the
new Becca anti fatigue under eye primer
as well as the Becca under eye
brightening setting a powder so the anti
fatigue under eye primer I had on my
splurge or purge video a couple of weeks
ago and this is just something that I'm
very very intrigued with I feel like
it's either gonna be incredibly gimmicky
and I'm gonna hate it or I'm absolutely
gonna love it so I'm willing to try it
out and test it out and then the under
eye brightening setting powder I
definitely could use a brightening under
eye setting powder right now especially
for my super super dry skin I just feel
like you know products don't sit as
beautifully underneath my eyes as they
do as they used to when I had more you
know combo oily skin which is totally
normal you know they just look a little
more crepey and I can't pull off a ton
of different finishes when it comes to
concealers and I feel like having a good
under eye primer and a nice setting
powder might actually help so up next we
do have some more steel like glitter and
glows look at these new shades you guys
these are so cool so this one
right here is called La Douce a this is
basically a shimmering warm gold green
and I think it looks stunning they have
a ton of new shades I don't know if you
guys can see these all really beautiful
but the other one that I want to pick up
is called freedom this is a shimmering
pale aqua so yeah definitely gonna go
ahead and pick these up you guys know
I love it the Stila shimmer and glow and
also the glimmer the shimmer and glow
Emily Stila glitter and glow formulas so
I'm excited to try this guy out I think
it's a beautiful color and I'm excited
for this one as well I feel like they're
gonna be pretty calm people to these
shimmer veils from cover FX but we will
see I want to do a whole dedicated video
to these Stila glitter and glows do a
best and worse and then maybe I'll also
do a best and worst of these shimmering
glows alright moving on we have a couple
of products here from sentía Beauty I am
so intrigued by these lip products here
the first one is the stena lip painted
this is a long wearing fluid lip color
in the shade uncensored it's the perfect
universal red and the ball tip
applicator here really gets me excited I
feel like maybe that's something I can
work with
it's supposed to be weightless 12 hour
liquid lipstick and I've seen so many
people wear this it really is truly I
mean I don't believe in universally
flattering everything but this is pretty
darn gorgeous on a lot of different skin
tones so I really do like this and I
want to go ahead and scoop that up and
then right here we have the Mademoiselle
plump matte lipstick I love the name of
this so cute the shade that I'm really
interested in is called you dig and it's
a periwinkle blue I don't know if this
will look good on me but I want some
sort of really really fun bright lip
color like this I also really like
midnight wasabi as well as one of the
boys which is a wild lilac as well as
clap back I love basically all the super
colorful shades here when it comes to
the Browns and the nudes and the Pink's
I feel like I have colors like that
similar in my collection I'm very
excited would love to try one of these
out all right guys I have two little
perfume samplers from Elizabeth and
James this first one is called choose
your num from your Fitbit now choose
your Nirvana this is the warm and spicy
addition and then here we have the
floral addition so the warm and spicy
edition does consist of Nirvana amethyst
which I have never smelled before a lot
of you were saying it's very similar to
bourbon but it has a little more of like
a floral tone to it or it's a little
more sweet and then we have Nirvana
black and Nirvana bourbon so I thought
these look great I'm pretty sure these
are roller balls which I do enjoy and
then down here we have let's see here
nirvana French gray which again I've
never smelled Nirvana white which I love
and Nirvana rose which is very sweet
Paris together beautifully with bourbon
so I think I'm gonna pick up both of
those and then decide which one I want
to purchase in a full-sized neck
moving on it we do have the new Ola
Henrickson moment of truth two-in-one
polishing sugar mask I'm sorry this is
not new it this guy is new that's a
banana bright eye creme but the moment
of truth two and one polishing a sugar
mask I have had in my loves list for a
while and I have gone through two full
sizes of this and it's just something I
continuously repurchase especially now
that I have dry skin and the honey in
here as well as the exfoliating
particles are very very very nice so I
do like this and I do want to repurchase
and then the banana bright eye creme I
have no idea if this actually smells
like banana but if it does that's even
more of a winner
I started at 2017 with 13 at different
eye creams and I am now down to 3 so
I'll be in the market on the market for
a new eye cream pretty soon so I thought
this one might be fun to try out it says
a brightening vitamin C rich eye cream
the target signs of aging reducing the
look of dark circles while improving
concealer application-aware so this
would be more of a daytime sort of eye
cream up next we have the Josie Maran
whipped argan oil face butter for $40 I
have gone through a full size of the
unscented version but I thought I would
try out the juicy mango this time the
one thing I didn't like about the
unscented was it had that natural
unscented sort of scent now I know that
having a ton of fragrance in your
skincare products isn't necessarily
great however josie maran is very very
good they use it very like a natural
sort of sense so it's not like anything
super synthetic and artificial so anyway
this is a lightweight yet yet
luxuriously rich and buttery face cream
for instant and abundant hydration I
definitely agree with this this is a
great great great face butter I enjoy it
a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and pick up
the juicy mango one I think that sounds
great for my dry skin here is the it
cosmetics miracle water three-in-one
glow tonic I don't like this as an
actual tonic or as an essence but I do
like it to basically put a little bit of
hydration and also cleanse my skin in
the morning very quickly it does sting
my eye area just a little bit but that's
only if I have like my eye open
sometimes I'm just so like exhausted and
the party can I keep my eye open as I'm
trying to wipe over my eye with a cotton
pad I know I know it happens when I'm
not that like 4 or 5 a.m. that just
happened so anyway you know as long as
you don't put it directly into your
eyeball like most products it will not
sting but
sighs that this is $38 which does sound
very very expensive but it's the only
micellar water I have found personally
that actually puts hydration back into
my skin the second best that I found is
the simple one but I absolutely love
this one so I want to pick up a
full-size of that I do want to pick up
another pharmacy green clean makeup melt
away cleansing balm with echinacea green
nd this retails for 42 I'm sorry $34 it
is amazing you guys it's super super
lightweight and love the way it takes
off my makeup and it just does a great
job at leaving my skin nice and hydrated
as well but not like oily so I do enjoy
that I want to repurchase and then here
we have the Ola Henriksen a brighter
truth brightening essential set in here
you do get the melt away gel cleanser
which I have never tried at the truth
serum which is a great day time serum as
well as this guy right here which is the
moisturizing creme which I have never
tried from the truth line so when this
is back in stock I will definitely go
ahead and pick that up and then finally
guys I recently tried out a sample of
the pharmacy honey potion renewing
antioxidant hydration mask with
echinacea Green MD oh my goodness yet
another product from pharmacy that was
like Holy Grail status instantly so I
got about six different uses out of that
one this is such a good mass especially
if you have dry skin so I do want to
pick up a full size of this basically
it's kind of like a warming mask and it
goes on sort of feeling like honey and
then you put it on the skin it sort of
foams up and lather up a little bit it
warms up on the skin and then it leaves
your skin very very hydrated as well as
incredibly incredibly bright so between
that and the Ola Henderson moment of
truth polishing mask I should be good
for a hydration and brightness so anyway
