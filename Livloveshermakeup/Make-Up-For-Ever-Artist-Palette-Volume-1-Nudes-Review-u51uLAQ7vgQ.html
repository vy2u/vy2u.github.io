about this review this is going to be on
the new makeup forever artist shadows
palette number one this is volume one
this is also known as the nudes palette
it is again the artist palette you won
the nudes palette I will be reviewing
right after this video the number two
which is more like bright and poppy
colors that this one is the nudes
palette it is absolutely absolutely
absolutely gorgeous it has nine
different shades in it absolutely
neutral absolutely gorgeous um the
packaging is awesome I really think it's
nice it's kind of heavy kind of weighted
feeling and it's really really sleek it
just kind of opens and closes
magnetically you get a nice big mirror
there and then you get the gorgeous
gorgeous shades and I will say I've been
using this for about a week to a week
and a half and I'm absolutely in love
I'm wearing this on my eyes today I
think it's just one of those palettes
that you don't even have to think about
it it has every color that you could
want in there everything from your brow
bone to you know using liner colors to
transition colors everything you know
this is a great transition color right
here by the way everything is completely
shimmery except with this one shade
right here I want to say is kind of like
semi matte but everything is a very
highly shimmery if you're not into a lot
of shimmer you're probably not gonna
like this telling the black right there
Wow amazing and also pretty pretty much
Matt I'm gonna say dead my Demi matte or
like semi matte because it's just not
completely matte like if you swatch it
you look at in the sunlight you can see
that there is a bit of glimmer and I
want to say glimmer not even shimmer
because it's not even that much just a
bit of glimmer but everything else is
really really shimmery you get that
really nice texture and I just want to
say right away the texture is phenomenal
I've never really felt I shadow like
this this almost feels like the foil
shadows from makeup geek if you are
familiar with that formula they're so
great they almost feel like they are wet
it's just unbelievable and I mean if you
just get awesome awesome color payoff in
just one little swatch you know and
just like I don't know it's like I've
never felt shadows this interesting it's
not just that they're buttery it's also
that they have that finish that's almost
like that's not completely powder like
that's a little bit of like gel or like
water or like I don't even know like
it's got a bit of cream in there it's
awesome really really awesome I have
found that I can use them with or
without a primer and I still get a
really really great look which is
awesome no creasing whatsoever and I'm
just really really impressed so anyway
again that is what the palette looks
like on the back of the box it shows the
actual names and no they don't actually
have names they have basically numbers
so you have you know I 528 or one 528
one 514 Emmie 512 s five five six so
it's like they don't actually have names
which is kind of sad because they're so
cute but um you know it's at least
they're still on the palette in some
form they are also on the back of the
talent not just the box which is great
because if you're doing a tutorial you
can be like hey this is the shadow that
I'm using you know you don't just have
to be like I've taken this one in this
mine a little bit at this one you could
be like take I D 652 and all that kind
of stuff so really like that it also
comes with this cute little pamphlet and
basically how they explain it is that
they wanted to put together looks in
these palettes the two of them Volume
one and two that they're basically one
book two looks three looks so you get
three looks in each palette I look at
this and I see that everything can go
together
this can go with this this can go with
this you know everything could be mixed
together I don't necessarily have to
have one look two looks three looks but
it's nice to happen it's nice to know
that they did test it out and they found
that those looked really nice together I
will show you guys they have a chic look
a natural look and a smoky look so that
was kind of what they were going for and
it is nice to have these little
pamphlets because you know they've tried
these out and you know that they think
you know it works well so they tell you
exactly what shadows to take they
recommend certain brushes that they have
in their line which is awesome and they
basically just go through everything and
I think that's really really fun you
should always keep one of these even if
you're not a beginner and makeup it's
always fun to check back on that
sometimes we just wake up in the morning
and we're like I don't even know what I
want to do is my makeup well you could
take one of those looks because they've
already been tested out and you know
they know that it works so anyway this
is the palette again just want to show
you guys how I'm gonna brief you guys a
little bit about what it says on these
four website it says the makeup forever
artists palette Volume one the nudes is
$42 it is 836 dollar value and it says
it is a collectible eyeshadow palette
with nine must-have artist shadow
formulas in neutral tone so this is the
artist shadows formula I have never
tried the artist shadow formula and I'm
dying now because it's so good it's
wonderful I love it it says this palette
features the coveted easy to use artist
shadow formula for endless i looks
ranging from beautifully natural to
highly artistic with it with its
advanced gel powder formula blended with
an ultra fine pigments each nude shade
leaves a smooth even finish that leaves
lids ultra section ultra saturated with
highly blendable lasting color the
shades are organized in trio so you can
effortlessly create a chic natural and
smoky looks this palette includes an
illustrated step-by-step application
technique technique book by makeup
Forever's founder and creative director
Danny Sanz to help you sweep on a number
of i catching looks so yeah I mean I
agree with all of that the formula of
the shadows is really what it's all
about I think it's totally worth it I
would purchase a palette with this
formula for more than you know $60 so
I'm amazed that it's only what was it 42
yeah $42 so absolutely amazing I
absolutely love it let me do a few
swatches few more swatches I should say
for you guys just so you can see so
there's just a few just so good and that
black color like living for it so pitch
black so those are just a few let's do a
highlight too so you guys can see those
highlight shades are really really nice
too so loving it loving this pal
I just I'm over the moon I'm sure you

over the moon about the volume - but
definitely go and check that video out -
because I will do swatches and the
colors are completely different than
