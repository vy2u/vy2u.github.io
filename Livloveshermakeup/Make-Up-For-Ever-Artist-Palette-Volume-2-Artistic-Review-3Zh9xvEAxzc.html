you just watched my video right before
this one you will know that I am
reviewing right now the makeup forever
artist palettes I just reviewed the
first one that's the video right before
this one and now I'm going to be
reviewing the second one which is volume
2 and it's also called the artist
palette volume 2 which is under artistic
so the first one is neutral and the
second one is called artistic you get 9
gorgeous gorgeous shades I love this I'm
gonna say it right away
if you watch the video right before this
one you know I love the formula and I
absolutely love this palette as well so
I am loving both that I picked up I
picked this one up for $42 as well as
the other one on the sephora website I
will link below but you guys can get it
um so basically um like I said in the
other video this is a nice like sleek
magnetic palette you get a nice big
mirror which is great and then you get 9
gorgeous gorgeous shades the first one
is really neutral and it's basically
like that everyday kind of look that you
can just pop on your eyes I am wearing
the neutral one today however this one
is like oh my gosh it's like so summery
and awesome this was actually the first
one I got so I picked up the first one I
would say I picked up this one probably
about 2 weeks ago and then about a week
ago I went and picked up the neutral one
because I loved this one so much I just
thought that for summer this was going
to be great I think the shades are
awesome those like poppy colors are like
ah to die for and I just thought I have
to get that and immediately when I got
it I just watched it and I thought wow
that's a relief special formula right
there and it is now from what I know
after reading the Sephora website this
is the artist shadows formula so I'm
absolutely in love I've never tried the
artist shadow formula from makeup
forever but I am absolutely in love now
and any time I see a palette that's
gonna come out with this form I'm gonna
have to get it because it really is
spectacular it's like a gel cream powder
it's like powder to cream almost it's
just it's amazing
I have tried both the palettes with and
without primer I've had no issues of
creasing it's just awesome the actual
texture is just like
think I mentioned in the other one
almost like the foiled shadows from
makeup geek if you felt those this feels
similar so basically um it's set up just
like the other palette where you get
nine different shades and they're
thought concept behind it was that three
different look so first look second look
third look um I think that you know you
don't have to of course you never have
to go by what they tell you this is the
look you have to go with you know you
can choose whatever kind of colors you
want but that is kind of the concept
that they have one look two looks three
looks and it does come with this little
pamphlet that kind of explains it in
there and so it says artist shadows
number two the pinks and purple one is
called the playful look the bold look is
the ones with the teals and then the
gold look is the sultry look so it gives
you a really nice like change like a
different kind of scenery you know you
can use all these poppy kind of shadows
and poppy colors but then you can go and
you can get a nice neutral look with
that column there so it's just really
really awesome I love the way they mix
this palette up it almost it reminds me
of like the Urban Decay electric palette
which I don't have yet however it's like
it also throws in those neutral shades
so it's like it's so usable and it's so
great for summer and spring and I was
just I was blown away when I got I was
really just blown away so that is why I
picked up the other one and I love it
just as much but this one in particular
is just really special to me I just
think that there are shades in here that
I've never seen before do you see that
this is like a gorgeous like dark dark
dark charcoal brown with green
undertones like I don't have any shades
like that I just think that's absolutely
gorgeous I love it and there's like you
know this bald in here that's almost
like a gold with a little bit of a
bronze undertone like so special and
then you get this bright fluorescent
purple and it's like oh my gosh you know
invest this one looks really really
matte compared to a few of them I should
talk about that being so excited I'm
just going off on a rant but I should
say that there are a few that are I
think I explained in the other video
they are kind of like
Jenny Matt like semi-matte like not
quite mad none of them are quite not in
my opinion most of them have shimmer but
there are a few here and they are thrown
in each palettes that have a matte kind
of look to them however if you go in the
sunlight you're looking at your eyes and
you're looking at the work you've done
you will notice there is a tiny little
bit of glimmer not shimmer and glimmer
because it's not completely shimmer and
it's not like chunks of glitter so um
anyway but yeah I would say with the
purple you kind of see that and um maybe
this color up here this nice highlight
color but overall most of them are just
very very shimmery you get this a really
really beautiful formula it just feels
like so awesome so the shades that you
get at the top are interesting too like
this is almost like a silvery with like
a yellow undertone I like that a lot
like I really like that that's different
you know it's so metallic it's really
cool and then you get this kind of nice
light almost all of the Goldy kind of
undertone one it's so similar in shades
but it's like it's giving you three
different three different like colors
that you could possibly use on your brow
bone depending on you know your skin
color your you know your skin tone and
how dark you are how like you are so I
really really like that and I think they
all have different undertones so they
are very different the three at the top
so that's really really cool I think
that's awesome but overall I would say
the shade down here I'm obsessed with I
just love that shade I do I just I don't
have anything like it I think it's
absolutely gorgeous and of course the
teal is just absolutely beautiful too
all of them are absolutely beautiful but
I mean come on like a look at that it's
so easy so blendable it's so like you
can just like you see I mean it's like
if you pop that in your crease if I'm
doing this with my fingers you know how
easily you could blend that in with like
a blending brush hello it's like a this
formula it's just it's amazing so anyway
those are my thoughts on that palette
let's go ahead and read on the Sephora
website what they say in descriptive
detail um
it says the makeup forever artist
palette vol 2 otherwise known as the
artistic talent is $42 $136 value it
says it's a collectible eyeshadow
palette with nine must-have artist
shadow formulas in natural and bright
pops of color this palette features the
coveted easy-to-use artist shadow
formula for endless ilex ranging from
beautifully natural to highly artistic
with this with its advanced gel powder
formula blended with ultra fine pigments
each shave leaves a smooth even finish
that leaves lids ultra saturated with
highly blendable lasting color agree
with all of that it says the shades are
organized in trio so you can
effortlessly create playful bold and
sultry looks this palette includes an
illustrated step-by-step application
techniques guide by makeup Forever's
founder and creative director Danny
Sam's to help you sweep on a number of
artists inspired eye looks so anyway i
also stated with the neutral palette I
just think like this texture and like
the actual pigmentation and like how
saturated the colors are it's like
awesome for $42 so really really
recommend if you're like looking at
palettes that are in the $50 range and
you can't decide definitely look at
these new panelists they're absolutely
amazing so anyway that was my review on
the makeup forever
artists palette vol 2 the artistic one I
will link below everything where you
guys can pick this up and I hope you
guys enjoyed this with you see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
