going to be reviewing in this video a
new makeup forever
artist plexi glosses I picked up two
different shades and the ones I got were
two zero one or two oh one and I also
got 405 P so umm qo1
looks like this it's a really nice light
rosy shade and it's very very pretty
it's kind of like a rose with a I guess
I would say like a whitish kind of
undertone and I will talk a little more
about this one because this is the one
I'm disappointed and I actually don't
like this one very much and the second
one for o5p is that what it's called I
believe yes I really just have regular
names looks like this and this is the
one I am wearing on my lips today I've
been wearing it for quite a while now
and it stuff hasn't completely come off
and I really really like the shade so
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
formula first so the formula is really
interesting um it is absolutely the same
for both so it's absolutely the same and
what I mean is you may be picky well
yeah I hope it's the same but what I
mean is I got one that has a lot of
shimmer this one and one that has no
shimmer and they feel absolutely the
same on the lips so I really appreciate
that I love when umm a product can have
some shimmer in it or some glimmer or
something and it just doesn't
um you know feel like it on the lips it
really feels like smooth buttery on the
lips no matter what so like I said I
really really loved the shade 405 P 201
is a little disappointing to me I was
thinking that that nice light pink color
would be really really beautiful they
described it as a rose shade on the
actual Sephora website by the way there
are so many different shades of this
they have so many different formulas
they have a lot of shimmers and lots
with non shimmer they help you with even
glitter like chunks of glitter in it so
um I just wanted to let you guys know
they have probably more than 30 shades
on the Salar website they do go for $19
piece on the Sephora website I will link
below in the description bar where you
guys can pick this up if you aren't
interested it's not an affiliate link
just if you guys are interested
it'll just take you directly to the
website anyway um so basically like I
said this rose shade is just kind of
disappointing to me it really looked
beautiful on the website it looked like
it wasn't going to be as sheer as it is
and it's just so sheer it's just it's
incredibly here so that is what the Rose
shade looks like and I was just hoping
for so much more you know I really
thought it would have that opaque
pigment in there and it just really
doesn't
however the 405 P I think is absolutely
gorgeous I think it's a perfect for fall
kind of color but this and you know
originally I was like oh I might as well
get a shimmer color that it's a little
more bright or something for summer but
honestly I was just drawn to this color
and I just knew I have to get it and
that is a swatch of with that one looks
like it's a lot more pigmented and I
really really prefer it I'm gonna put a
little brown lip so you guys can see how
heavily opaque it is so what I love
about this color is that it picks up all
different kinds of like multi tones
anytime you turn your head you can see
it's really glossy kind of makes my lips
look bigger I love it so anyway so
that's my only complaint is that if you
go with one of the kind of lighter
shades just be aware that they are a lot
more sheer than the darker shades and
just be aware - if you're worried about
getting one that has shimmer and I don't
be because it's the exact same formula
it feels the same between lips it
doesn't feel like you're grinding pieces
of glitter between your lips when you go
you know it just feels really really
good so um anyway so what I want to talk
about now is a little bit on the
packaging I think what's really
interesting about these is that they
have a really interesting wand both of
them look like this so they are flat on
each side and then they have a really
really skinny like that can you see that
so both wands have that same kind of
applicator and I think that applicator
is actually really really easy to use
and really really liked it it's just
really really cool and as you can see
there's a little chunk missing right
there can you guys see that and that is
supposed to be there so don't worry
but anyway so it's kind of like this you
know flat on both sides and then you get
this little angular part where you can
really work in on the sides of the mouth
like right here you can really work in
that area and then the flat part just
makes it really easy to just get right
on the bottom lip the upper lip really
really great I really really like the
applicator I think that's really really
wonderful I'm gonna read you guys a
little more about what it says on the
Sephora website but like I said the
biggest thing for me is mostly just I
love the formula I love the way it feels
on lips I think it stays on for a long
time the staying power is great I would
just say go with maybe a darker shade if
you want a little more opaqueness I was
hoping this would be very opaque and it
obviously isn't that rose-colored the
201 so I recommend going with the darker
shades and also don't worry about
getting something with shimmer versus
getting one without shimmer they feel
exactly the same on lips and they feel
great so let me give you guys a little
more because makeup forever
artist Plexiglas they're $19 each and I
would say they probably have about 25 to
30 shades like I said a triple impact
lip glass with vivid color and high
shine that stays put I do agree with
high shine I do grease that it stays put
but um I'm not really sure about impact
I think what they meant by impact was
like you know opaqueness and I disagree
with the lighter colors I don't think
that they are as opaque as the darker
ones um it's a um it is a vivid color
and stunning shade this innovative non
sticky gloss goes on smoothly and
creates both pearly and non pearly
finishes for a stunning look it's
pigments are packed with a pixie the
plexi sorry pixie color technology no
flexi color technology to deliver up to
5 hours of color impact with a
360-degree reflective shine beads
minimize maximize shine the exclusive
artist design Superflex applicator
features a lip hugging shave that allows
for precision and control and the super
loaded split
tip has a unique contoured to sweep on
the ideal amount of lip lacquer what
else you need to know Danny sans makeup
for ever founder and creative director
or Johnny songs was inspired by one of
her favorite objects a plexi glass
makeup case together Daniel makeup for
Everett's lab and team developed a new
technology at pigments
amplified with the highly vinyl finish
that would replicate the cases unique
look and feel and so I definitely agree
I think like when I turn you guys can
see how much um shine is being picked up
on the lips with this especially the
shimmer the shimmer reshaped so anyway
that is those are my thoughts those are
my reviews I never have too much to say
about lip glosses I usually either
really like them or I really don't for
me it really comes down to UM opaqueness
I really really like a opaque lip gloss
and also comes down to texture I can't
stand sticky lip glosses and these are
definitely not that so formula is great
I recommend sticking with the darker
shades and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this reveal I'll see you in my next one
