today's video I am sharing a review and
swatches for you guys really quick a
little one on this kit from make up
forever this is the festival faves
long-lasting waterproof eye pencil kit i
purchased this for forty-nine dollars on
the sephora calm website and i will of
course link below where you guys can
pick this product up in the description
bar if you were interested it is an
exclusive products that is new limited
edition and you can only purchase it
online right now it is only available
for vib rouge members i don't know if
it's always going to be like that or if
it will eventually change but right now
you can only get it if you are a vib
rouge remember this is a limited edition
kit featuring for aqua extra large I
pencils that were hand-picked by pop
star Charli XCX that are perfect for the
music festival season and in here you
get four zero point zero four ounces of
the aqua extra large I pencils in n 10
which is a matte black and 80 which is a
patch plum I 24 which is an iridescent
blue &amp;amp; M 30 which they match pastel
green so overall I am really really
loving this little kids I think this is
a great value because you are getting 4
full size eye liners in here they
normally sell for 21 dollars a piece so
you're getting 4 450 which i think is a
really really good deal so I'm really
really happy with this little kit that
is what the outer packaging looks like
and then on the inside you have this
little cardboard sleeve here that holds
basically your four little eyeliner so
like I said we have em 30 which is that
beautiful sort I call it a mint green
they call it a matte pastel green I can
get some mint green and then we have em
10 which is the one I have on today on
my bottom line and tightline and that is
the matte black then we have the
iridescent blue color which is I 24 and
then we also have this one and 80 which
is a matte plum color I really really
think these are nice quality I will say
right away they they do not compare to
my Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils
that's just in my opinion I am one of
those people when I'm wearing eyeliner
it's almost always on my waterline and
my tight line not so much like my upper
lash line or lower lash line I have worn
these both ways not on my upper lash
line I can't do a win for but on my
lower
lash line and also i have worn them on
my waterline i think they stay pretty
relatively well on the waterline i will
say they do budge a little bit i think
it's because the actual formulation is
super super super creamy like even
creamier than the Urban Decay 24-7 glide
on eye pencils or like the next slide on
I pencils they're extremely sauce it
sucks did I say sauce or socks they are
extremely soft you guys and they're very
very pigmented so I think because they
are so soft they do make them a little
easier to budge especially if you're
putting it on an area that does have
like fluid you know okay don't how fluid
you know what I mean your water line is
pretty wet so anyway I think if you do
want to wear them on your upper lash
line or your lower lashline bees will
not budge like once they set they are
completely set and it's absolutely
amazing so let me go ahead and show you
guys what they look like so here we have
an 80 which is that beautiful plum color
and I will swatch that one for you guys
by the way they do not come with a
sharpener they can sharpen really really
easily with any sort of sharpener that
you have I personally like to use my wet
and wild one and i have not had any
issues so here is the plummy color again
this one is called m80 there it is and
then the next one we have here is the
mint green and this one is called m30
this is also a matte really really
beautiful and if you guys can see from
the tip there you see how like even when
you just kind of push down on it it's
sort of like molds away it's because
they're so freaking soft so there is the
mint green color and then the next one
we have is that gorgeous kind of
iridescent iridescent blue color and i
will say i feel like the iridescent
color doesn't last as long as the matte
colors but I feel like that's how it is
with any sort of eyeliner even my Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils I find
that the sheets that have glitter or
even just a little bit of she don't last
on my waterline as long but it's still
really beautiful so that particular
shade is called I 24 and then we have
the matte black which I have on today
which is m10 and I
wearing this for about three and a half
hours I don't find that it has started
to collect like on the inner corners of
my eyes or anything it went on really
really nicely really beautifully and I
love how it is just a dark dark dark
black color so there are the four of
them swatched right there i'm going to
give them a second to go ahead and set
completely and then i'm going to rub my
hand over it so you guys can see how
they really don't budge once you've said
it like i said i feel like for the water
line because there already is a little
bit of moisture in that area they do
budge a little bit throughout the day
it's nothing horrible nothing Miranda's
I still think they are really really
good but compared to my Urban Decay 24-7
glad not I pencils I still prefer those
even though the formulation of those are
a little like crispy or they don't glide
honest nicely Oh Sees I just think that
these don't wear as long so anyways here
are the four of them and i'm going to go
ahead and kind of rub back and forth so
you guys can see they've gotten pretty
tacky so they have mostly set now let's
see you early really rub on there so you
guys can see so that's about as much as
they budge when I really really really
rub so I think that's pretty darn good
especially for the mats that you're in
essence shade especially so I think that
this is overall a really really nice
little pit you do get a lot of product
for your money again you are getting 4
full size eye liners for fifty dollars
they're normally sold for 21 dollars a
piece so I think if you can if you are a
vib rouge member go ahead and pick up
this kits you can try them out like I
said they're not my all-time favorite
eyeliner but I think they will be really
really nice during the summertime so I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick little
review thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you guys on my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
