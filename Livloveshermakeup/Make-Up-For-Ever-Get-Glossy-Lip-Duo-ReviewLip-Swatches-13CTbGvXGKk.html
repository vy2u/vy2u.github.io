have another review arm swatches and lip
swatches for you guys on the make up for
ever get glossy lip duo i got this on
the sephora website I think it was ten
or fifteen dollars um it what you get is
basically two full-size lipgloss is from
from make up forever and they are part
of the lab shine diamond collection so
they're very very sparkly and they are
just absolutely gorgeous um I think that
these just have a best shine like in any
of my lip glosses the best shine and
that's definitely because of those added
sparkles so I'm here are the swatches I
think they switch nicely uh you know
they're not super pigmented but this is
more like a gloss that you top / your
favorite lipstick when you want like an
extra little oomph so um right there is
the Tanner color that one is called d16
and the pink color is let's see here d
14 so that's what they look like
swatched on my arm and i will put them
on my lips i will start with the Tanner
y which is d 16 whatever they don't have
name names all right
mmm they're very very creamy to you guys
they are a little sticky but they're
really nicely like um they feel like on
the verge of being sticky so it's not
too bad not nothing that you can't like
handle so this is D 16 and I will take
this off and show you the other one
okay the other one is d14 is that what I
said yes d 14 I love the way they smell
too I know fruity but almost like a
dessert so this is D 14 pink I like this
one better in the nude one I just think
it gives off like better color they
offed me so I do like the pink one
better so anyway here are the colors
again up close absolutely gorgeous super
super-shiny amazing glitter just it
looks like you have like constant water
on your lips like just like a stream of
water um and I think that these are
really really great for topping off
lipsticks wearing on their own if you're
into that look I mean it's fine if
they're just not very pigmented so um
overall I do like these because I'm know
kind of what they are for a kind of knew
when I purchase them that these weren't
going to be extremely highly pigmented
so I am happy with what they are which
is like lipstick toppers so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and swatches and
i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
