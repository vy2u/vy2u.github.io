today's review is going to be on the new
makeup forever pro sculpting duo this is
a undetectable face contour and I
purchased mine for $39 on the support
website I will of course link below
where you guys can pick it up
they have shades one and two and I
actually picked up shade two which looks
like this it's got a deep contouring
color and then it has a beautiful gold
highlight that's what it looks like um
they do have two shades like I said the
other one is called pink beige so you
get this really nice pinky frosty color
as the highlight and then underneath you
get a little more of a warmer toned
contour and this one the one I have is
golden and it says it's for medium at
deep skin tones but I just fell in love
with the actual shade of the highlight
which is why I wanted to pick it up
sorry I have some swatches there um but
I absolutely just you know fell in love
with the actual highlight color so I
thought I'd pick this one up I may go
ahead and pick up the other one I do
like this product I'll talk about it a
little more now so basically I'm this
product is $39 on the Sephora website
and I love the fact that it is a how
would I describe it it's like a gel
powder kind of finished I guess I'm
looking over at the screen on the
Sephora website to see if that kind of
fits what I'm trying to describe and it
does say gel powder on there also so
basically it's not like the kind of gel
powder where you're gonna stick your
finger in it and it's gonna make like an
indent it's still quite like hard
feeling um however it's just so smooth
and everything just glides on so nicely
like let me swatch here for you guys
quickly do you guys see that like it's
so beautiful and everything just goes on
like a dream
that's the darker color and here is the
highlight and look at that highlight I
mean that highlight is life like the
reason I got this product was because of
that highlight I think it's so beautiful
so basically it's like this gel to
powder kind of finish and I feel like
when I'm working with it I really like
to use something that's almost like
like a stiff amount of Bristol something
that's really gonna buff it into my skin
I do not use this to contour and
highlight I don't know if you guys can
tell but the top color actually does
have a bit of shimmer in it as well as
obviously the highlight so that kind of
contour shade first of all is a little
oranjee in my opinion when it comes to
actually like contouring out your face
I think that those kind of colors look
fast if you're going to hollow out your
face you want something that's a little
more grayish in tone or has some taupe
colors to it you don't want something
that has orange undertones to it I think
this has more warm undertones to it um
and it does have a bit of shimmer in it
and then of course the highlight is
super shimmery like I said what drew me
to the product was the highlight however
I really like the way both of these look
on my cheeks just to warm up the face I
put them on I'll put this on
basically like I put on a blush I'll put
it on the apples of my cheeks and then I
will put the highlight over it and it
just gives a gorgeous gorgeous Sheen
singing machine Sheen to the skin and I
just think it's really really beautiful
um I really love the texture and the
combination that the to give which is
why I'm also thinking about getting the
other one but like I said the reason I
really picked up this one was because I
fell in love with that highlight color
like it's just so everything it's
everything look at that it's so gold and
and beautiful and just perfect so
basically let me read for you guys a
little bit of what it says on the makeup
forever
website or on the Sephora website I'm
sorry it says what it is an exclusive
undetectable contour duo for easy
natural and traceless highlighting
contouring right away I disagree with
that because like I said this contouring
shade is kind of Orange II and it's more
warm than cool toned and it's not
undetectable I mean this is this
highlight is anything but undetectable
and I feel like this is undetectable
I'll stop eating anything but
undetectable like if you were to put it
to actually contour out like your
cheekbones you would notice this color
like if I hold that up to my face I
think you guys would notice that orange
and color
and this is anything but undetectable
this gorgeous gorgeous high light so
easy natural traceless highlighting and
contouring you don't really agree with I
just think this is great to warm up the
face and the highlight is gorgeous it
says what it does highlighting and
contouring instantly transforms facial
features for a more balanced and
proportionate face shape this waitlist
innovative gel powder is comfortable to
the touch and blend seamlessly I totally
agree with that
for traceless highlighting and
contouring without any signs of makeup
i'm detectable and totally natural it
helps you master the art of light and
shadow to reveal your most naturally
sculpted look exclusively at sephora
what else you need to know the pros
captain duo is available in two shades
pink beige for fair to medium skin and
golden for medium deep to deep skin so
like I said I just like I don't use this
at all for sculpting or contouring like
my face I do use the highlight to
highlight but I think the best way to
use this um just because of like the
actual shape that bronzer is um is just
to warm it up on the cheeks you know use
it and put it on the apples of your
cheeks and then put that gorgeous
highlight over it and it just gives such
a natural beautiful Sheen to the skin
the gel powder um you know the actual
like feel a bit it's wonderful it does
blend seamlessly I just can't see how
people would use this for contouring
especially that shade you know because
it's so Orange II but anyway that is my
review of the makeup forever pro
sculpting duo I have mine again in the
shade number two so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review if you did please
give it a thumbs up I will leave
everything below where you guys can pick
this up and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
