is part one of my makeup collection the
reason I am splitting this into two is
because I wanted to go through all of my
lip products which are all right here
and then I'm going to go through my Alex
series 9 drawer which is the rest of the
makeup it is Wednesday morning at 5:15
when I am filming this and I promise you
both of the collection videos will be up
two nights so don't worry both of them
will be up this one will be up first and
then the second path of the makeup
collection will be up obviously second I
just thought it would be easier for you
guys to watch and also it's easier for
me to film you guys know I don't edit my
videos so it can be kind of difficult
for me to literally stand here I don't
get to take a break I just kind of film
it and then I just you know upload it so
it would be easier for me to be able to
kind of split it into two parts but like
I said they will both be up to night so

products this is how I store all my lip
products and very lucky all my lip balms

I'm obsessed I think it's adorable and
then right here I have all of my Stila
lip glazes again in a little mercury jar
and I love these I think they're great
they're really awesome to top any sort
of lip color but for the most part
they're a little sticky and a little
tacky so I don't like to wear them on

pick up those chocolate lipsticks and I
actually ended up giving them away I
know I never even reviewed them I don't
know what it was there was something
about some of those metallic shades that
I wasn't really feeling but it's weird
because I like this metallic shade this
one is called metallic dream house I
really like this but there was something
about those darker colors with the
metallic stuff it's just I did not like
it all right and then I have some more

collection I have some Clinique chubby
lip balms I have a chubby stick baby

them then I have another alpha lip on

cha-cha balm from benefits literally
this whole thing is filled up and this
is why I will be doing a lift declutter
next year I did do a to clutter series
which I will also link the playlist for
that below and I basically decluttered
everything that was in the Alex series 9
tour but I never decluttered any of my
lip products which is why I have a bunch
of excess ones and these are basically
ones that I I use these but these aren't
like my go-to colors which is why I
store them in there so anyway guys that
is my lip product collection this is the
first part of my makeup collection video
