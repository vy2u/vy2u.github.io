eye primers and my setting mess let's go
ahead oh I also have my Too Faced

the first one that they're real alright
and I have to have these in Chinese of
pencil eyeliners I'm just gonna give you
guys I'm not gonna go through every
single one I'm just gonna kind of tell
you what I have I have a lot of these
Smashbox these are the ally sharp
waterproof Kohl eyeliners I love these I
have a whole lot of the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencils these are one of my
favorite formulas to wear on my
waterline I have a lot of these NYX ones
these are these slide-on eyeliners they
are very comparable to the urban decay
runs I have a clinic skinny stick I have
quite a few of these laura geller
eye brightener ones these are in like a
banana kind of shade I love those I also
love the master drama by eye studio from
Maybelline these are fantastic eyeliners
this one right here is from steel this
is actually a waterproof liquid
eyeliners
put that little drawer but anyway how I
organized the headliners I just like to
use these little boxes that come from
like subscription boxes the lids and
also the basis of the boxes if that
makes sense just because I feel like
it's nice to have like everything
organized into sections without having
to pay a fortune and buy those acrylic
containers so those are the eyeliners
that I have in all sorts of different
colors and then I have my mascaras here
I'm actually gonna hold them out onto
the table so we can take a closer look
at them I have this Sephora outrageous
curl which is one of my favorites wet
and wild I have a Laura Mercier this is
from Physicians Formula
another Physicians Formula this is
L'Oreal this one is out Solorio I have
the Lancome Hypnose drama let's see here
let's see Too Faced better than sex the

Medellin push-up falsies roller lash we
have benefit they are real we have some
Dior ones over here a Clinique one just

guys can probably see I have a little
bit of everything a lot of deluxe sized
samples a lot of full-size samples a
full size full size product it's not
sampled but just like a lot of them and
I would say definitely my two favorite
are these two right here the covergirl
super sizer and my Sephora outrageous
curl Too Faced better than sex is right
up there as brows so that's my little
bit of current mascaras that are all
open so that is the second drawer we
have mascaras and eyeliners the third
drawer we have here is false eyelashes
although I can't say that false
eyelashes which I really never wear I
should but again I feel like I just
don't I don't know I have a few kiss
ones here I have some from ELF and I
don't know I'm just not great at putting
them on but I do want to start wearing
them and I have these little BH
Cosmetics these are like little tools
for helping you to put them on so I will
try
just haven't really yes so that is my
little false eyelash little box or
little bin and then I have some brow
products here um these are all the brow
products that I own actually show I have
the more brows from model Inc I have the
Sephora this is like a highlighter for
underneath the brow area the BH
Cosmetics flawless brow gel I have
another BH Cosmetics pencil the
Maybelline clear mascara for holding my
brows in place revlon brow fantasy one
of my favorites and then my gimme brow
from benefit so i don't have a lot of
brow products and i like it that way
because a lot of brow products are
really tricky and i feel like i can't
work with them i do have this little
thing over here from tv's this is the
Too Faced no filter selfie powder that I
do like and then I have this little guy
here that is filled with setting powders
so I have my it cosmetics of bye-bye
pores I have the L'Oreal True Match
mineral the stay matte from Rimmel this
is in the shade translucent both of
these are you guys can see I've been
hitting some major fan on these guys the
Revlon nearly naked powder number 10
fair or clear and then I have the Revlon
Colorstay and translucent the essence
all about matte the NYX blotting powder
in the shade BL p01 light I have this
little guy this is the elf high
definition under eye setting powder and
the hello flawless in the lightest shade
so those are the current setting powders
that I have that are open and that I am
using and again I like having them in
these little boxes so that I can just
pull them out if I need to and then here
I have my concealers so let's go through
those I have the it cosmetics bye bye
redness neutralizing cream I have this
one from L'Oreal it's the visible lift
blur I have the L'Oreal True Match which
I love the elf maximum coverage I have
all of these becca correctors and the
becca ultimate coverage complexion cream
but these are all the correctors i did a
review on these this one is in pistachio
this one is in the shade papaya no peach
sorry
this one is papaya and then we have this
one which is called violet and then I
have a glamoflage concealer it come
correct that is the Wet n Wild Fergie
I'm so Cl
just continuing that line i have the
maybelline superstay better skin this
one is the main middle at Maybelline
master conceal I have the cover conceal
at our axe that is from Physicians
Formula Kat Von D two little Mally
pencils there the Kevyn Aucoin sensual
skin enhancer I have the covergirl Ready
Set gorgeous and the amazing cosmetics
concealer so again I just like having
them in this little bin I know there
probably is a neater way to like
organize these but honestly I'm happy
with this little bin I'm happy to just
grab the little thing and then pull it
out whenever I need it
it's actually just a really really easy
and simple so that is the third drawer
like I said we have setting powders fake
eyelashes brow products and concealers
and then of course this little two-faced
no filter selfie powder and keep that
right there alright moving on to the
fourth drawer we are going in to
foundations so if you saw my declutter
series I'm gonna link the whole playlist
below you would have seen this drawer
was ridiculous it was overflowing it was
absolutely crazy it was like stacked up
to the top so right now I have all them
all just in a single line except towards
the back it does get a little crazy but
I have the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
in 105 I have the Revlon airbrush the
Sephora tint infusion the l'oreal
visible lift Revlon and Tartan Revlon
nearly naked elf flawless finish I have
the Becca that's the me one the aqua

that's why I picked up a backup and then
the gosh Cosmetics illuminating
foundation I love this also the Mac
Studio sculpt SPF 15 foundation I have
the true blend from covergirl and then I
had the Marc Jacobs this is the genius
gel foundation so overall this store has
gotten a lot better um it's hard to
store foundations let me know if you
guys know of a better way to kind of
store foundations like this I kind of
want to store them upright but again
some of these bottles are super tall and
it's just not gonna allow me to do so
but overall I would like to be able to
store them differently but those are my
foundations all right the next drawer
