channel today I have my part one of my
eyeshadow palettes collection video to
share with you guys so if you are
interested in seeing some of the
palettes that I have then please keep on
watching I will of course you like it
part two three four and probably a part
5 so anyway yeah I have a lot of
palettes but I'm excited to share with
you guys what I have so let's go ahead
and start with Too Faced I'm going to
start with the chocolate bar palette
these are the ones I currently have in
my collection the white chocolate chips
the semi-sweet and is bonbon so I really
do like the little white chocolate chip
I feel like this would only work for you
if you do have like a sphere to light
skin tone it's got super super light
colors to it the only dark color is like
this black color here and even on me
it's a little actually but this is super
easy to blend and it's kind of like a
no-fuss palette so I actually a fan of
that which I know a lot of people are
not I did not like the matte chocolate
chip palette I ended up going ahead and
decluttering that one but I did go ahead
and keep my bonbon so this is basically
the cool toned a version of the
chocolate bar palette it is super super
beautiful and I feel like the chocolate
bar palette for the most part besides
the boy chocolate chip you work for the
majority of skin tones out there which
is great because sometimes you do come
across a shuttle pedals that don't work
for every skin tone so this is really
beautiful
again it has more cool tones to it and
has pretty cute packaging and then here
I have my all-time favorite sassy
semi-sweet palette so I dizzy clutter
the og original chocolate bar just
because I never used it because I was
using this one all the time I feel like
this one does not get enough credit I
love it because it has a warm tones and
cool tones in it I just feel like that's
so diverse so really really do like the
formula on the chocolate bars and I'm
really happy with those alright next I
have my 9 pan a palace
currently I only have four I have it
tried out every single one that they
offer except for the boudoir eyes one
which I get everybody to explain like I
need that one my belts the best one but
currently I have the peanut butter and
jelly I have to be too cute I have the
natural eye and a sugar pop so let's go
ahead and start with sugar pop and this
is what it looks like I'm thinking of
decluttering this let me know if you
guys want me to film if you caught her
video because I'm definitely thinking
about getting rid of some palettes I
just don't reach for this as often I
love
the strawberry ice sheet right here that
would have called yeah strawberry ice is
beautiful but honestly what I want like
a pop of color I really want a pop of
color and I don't feel like this is
doing it for me anymore so I think I'm
going to let that go I need to play with
it some more next we have is the peanut
butter and jelly palette this is one of
the best and 19 pallets from Too Faced
in my opinion he did the peanut butter
and honey I did return that one but this
one is really really great it has made
warm tones to it a little bit of a
purple color which is probably the
weakest shade in the palette the jelly
shade but these are very soft and
beautiful and creamy and they go on like
a toil to finish and then here we have
it be too cute a shadow palette and this
one is really really spectacular as well
I was so disappointed when they came out
with the peanut butter and honey because
this was the one it came out prior to
the peanut butter and honey and it was
so good and then of course the peanut
butter honey sucked but this one's
beautiful very very pigmented I really
like the colors in here especially at
that clover shade and then finally I
have my natural eye at palettes this is
the second one I've ever gone through
you guys can probably see I've pants
quite a few shades in here so this is
actually the old school packaging I
preferred this one because now it comes
in the tin packaging and the shades are
different but yeah I really really love
that talent
alright and then I do also have these
two little guys from last year's holiday
collection I plan on going ahead and
actually be plotting these what I really
really want with these particular
palettes are actually the blushes and
bronzers inside of them so this is the
eggnog latte palette you have six eight
different eyeshadows and as far as I
really love the colors of the eyeshadows
but honestly I feel like I have stuff
like that in my collection and these are
really hard to build up on the skin but
this right here this blush called peach
cobbler is amazing they need to make
that in a full-size so I want to be top
fat and then I will declutter it and
then here is the junior bread coffee
gingerbread cookie palette again at six
different eyeshadows the gingersnap and
winter dream shades are super super
pretty but I'm really just drawn to that
bronzer so going to go ahead and do pop
that and then declutter that to any of
my friends who want a half ask for list
or moving on let's go ahead and talk
about some of my Allah Brock products so
here I have two palettes from the
unzipped line this is the original
unzipped palette it is a gorgeous lobby
toned palette as you guys can see
you have a nice arrangement of different
finishes in here this is beautiful on
every single like eye color I feel like
it really makes green eyes pop a blue
eyes pop brown eyes pop it's just
absolutely gorgeous love this and then
at the unzipped gold I'm actually really
not a fan of I'm thinking of
decluttering this as well I feel like
the formula is very very chalky and
chunky and kind of dry I really like
these two shades right here they're
pretty but these guys over here have a
really hard time like blending on my
lower lash line into my outer V I don't
like to spend that much time blending so
I think I'm going to go ahead and let
that go but we shall see maybe I'll play
with it a little more alright next I
have at the lorac advanced help dawn at
safe and chic palettes this is quite
nice I think it was a limited edition
the two blushes in here are spectacular
I feel like they would work for a lot of
different skin tones so if you ever do
see this the eyeshadows are very similar
in a formula q is the actual unzipped
palette so you're nice and creamy I also
have this guy I'm not sure about this
this is the lorac nude in the second YZ
challenge I got this probably about
eight months ago it is a very very basic
palette that really probably would only
work for those of you if you have like a
spare to light complexion there is not a
lot of difference between these shades
here and I don't know I haven't reached
for this in over a year so maybe I need
to play with this some more but I am
leaving more towards if you coloring
that are enos if you have my lorac Pro
and lorac pro 3 so this is the one this
is the three the one is amazing if you
want to try out the pro formula would
highly recommend this as you can see
this is a very well-loved palette in my
collection I love that you have brow
bone shades you have transitions you
have masks on top shimmers on the bottom
really really spectacular palettes I
love that and I love that everything is
created equal when it comes to the pro
formula and what I mean by that is the
math are identical in formulation to the
shimmers like they blend just as easy
there's no issue that usually doesn't
happen with eyeshadows like yours with
the mouths are super choppy so very very
cool to see that they actually synced up
the actual formula there but here is the
lorac pro 3 now I'm thinking of
decluttering this as well honestly these
colors look I'm just not drawn to this
palette even when I purchase it the
first time I said in my review I don't
know maybe I'll return it I never ended
up returning it but I don't
I think I'll probably be quite a rescue
Michelle or something she likes a really
really natural everyday friendly eye
shadow and I'd be too but there's just
something about this pallet it almost
like washes me out if the colors it's a
color so it's not that it's a bad
formula it's just the colors weren't for
me all right I also do have the lorac
mega Pro - this was my favorite and mega
Pro that ever came out I love it it has
so many cool shades in here you have
like a nice beautiful gooey color
tangerine you have a forest green
really really beautiful won't talk too
much about it complain nobody can't get
it anymore and then of course the lorac
mega pro 3 a limited edition my ass I
can't believe they did white packaging
it looks so bad but yeah this is well
loved as well in my collection has a lot
of nice warmer tones in it I do notice
if you can get a little muddy especially
these colors down here if you mix them
too much but I don't really mind I think
it's really pretty and in everyday kind
of natural palette I like to you just
want to go on stage as well alright
let's go ahead and talk about my violet
of box
palette shall we the first one I have
here is the violet box Pro eyeshadow
palette in the Holy Grail version is
beautiful reminds me a lot of the
anasazi of Beverly Hills a modern or
Renaissance Palace you have a lot of
different finishes in here and I think
the only shade in here that really is
kind of a dud is this one called wine in
giant about what the cross yeah I know
they sell it through well wine and dine
that's the only one that is a little on
the chunky side but I love the finishes
I love those really foiled shapes for
packing on to the lid really good
formula I know a lot of people say that
the violet off pallets are very cheaply
made that might be so but you know life
when I compare the lists to morphe I
noticed that there were differences you
know when with ingredients and I did not
like the morphe palette speed you think
like the morphe palette but I don't know
I had eye irritation with the market
cause and I don't with these all right
here is the drenched metal how it is
this one is a little more cool town it
does not have any masks except for one
which is that dark black shade which i
think is called midnight trysts yeah
midnight wrist again a little on the
chunky side and it's always like the
bottom right hand corner map and every
single one of the apalis it's not that
great but everything else is foiled so
you need to supplement another palette
in to create a full look but this is
beautiful if you like those
found eyeshadows with a lot of Sheen and
then unless we do have it be lauralee
palace so this is a little more warm
toned um it's kind of like a mixture of
warm and cool elements now I'm not
someone who pulls a warm undertone so a
lot of these shades people find on me
but they don't look amazing I really
love this shade down here called
smashley though it's probably my least
favorite out of all of my violin soft
pellets but these two shades right here
are gorgeous Biggie and 1988 I just
think it with my finger and Pat it all
over my red absolutely gorgeous and then
finally I do have this big obnoxious
palette right here I hate the packaging
because this is the right or die palette
it basically is all of those pallets
combined in q1 if you can get a discount
for this I would highly recommend
getting it it does not stink like the
other one I feel like they upgraded the
formula and these are just beautiful you
get feel problems you get mask you get
shimmers you get a few there you get a
few a glitter pack shades as well but
they're not like you know two-faced
litter packs they're nice they're nice
right now that's a beautiful palette as
well cool tones warm tone transition duo
crumbs is right thanks for that really
cool and I just finally we will end
today with a my should be a sweet
palette so the first one I have here is
the Nubian palette and I have really
started to love this palette when I
first started using this I didn't really
know how to use it I was using fluffy
brushes a lot of you are recommending I
use something more densely packed like
my japonesque I think it's 181 brush so
I go into something really densely
packed and I will work those shimmery
shades into it my crease and they look
great so really really love this palette
if you want the naked heat palette I
feel like this is a cheaper alternative
I got this for like $89 on HauteLook
would you pay flash sale website I also
do have the Nubian shoot palette this is
what it looks like this one's very
interesting I really have not dug into
this one yet because I don't know what
to do with this palette you're going to
see the colors in here they're so unique
I just don't even know where to begin
like you have some oranges a blue you
have like a greenish shade I don't know
let me know what you think I should do
with this particular pellet but yeah so
far so good with those the foil sheets
and there are super super thick and
really like you can feel them between
your fingers so organic want to make
sure that you go ahead and either spray
them down with a little bit of setting
spray like oil the actual soil shades or
go in with a very densely packed brush
you will have some fallout with these
pallets but it's worth it trust me here
is a masquerade palette I'm next to this
one over here I was so pissed but this
is gorgeous you guys you get to make
warm down here again reminds even naked
heat and then the Blues on top are
incredible absolutely incredible and
then this pink one bori oh my god I love
it so it's like a pink with a little bit
of a golden machine so yeah this is a
great palette probably my favorite and
then the Nubian and then the other one
that I haven't dried yet so hey guys
those are some of my palace to start out
like I said this will probably be like a
four or five maybe even six part series
so I hope you enjoyed and I will see you
guys might have fun right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
