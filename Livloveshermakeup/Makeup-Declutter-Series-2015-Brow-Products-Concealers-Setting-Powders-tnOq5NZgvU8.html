in praline really really good coverage
on that one and i letting go of the
Revlon age-defying concealer in 01 light
or pale which looks like that all right
those are all my concealers let's move
on to setting powders eventually I would
really really love if I could fit all of
my setting powders all of my concealers
and foundations into one drawer however
you guys will see when I go through my
foundation declutter video you will see
that I have overload on liquid
foundations there's just no room to put
there's stuff in there but eventually I
would like to do that so these are not
powder foundations by any means these
are either HD powders which I put over
like a setting powder to kind of just
like give an even more beautiful you
know flawless look to the skin or they
are setting powders which I use to set
in my foundation so the first thing I
know I'm going to keep is the it
cosmetics by Jamie keen Jamie Curran
sorry Jamie Curran this is the bye bye
pores poreless finishing hg micro powder
in translucent i love this so much that
i am actually going to let go of all my
other translucent HD powders today so
i'm keeping that but i'm going to go
ahead and let go of these two little
tart smooth operator Amazonian clay
finishing powders same concept just not
as good and also letting go of the NYX
HD studio photogenic finishing powder
same concept just not as good and the
NARS translucent crystal light
reflecting setting powder same concept
just not a good one thing that I'm going
to keep and let go of is the high
definition under I setting powder from
ELF I have two of them in the shade
sheer so I'm going to keep one and let
one go and then something I know I'm
definitely keeping is the Rimmel stay
matte long-lasting pressed powder I used
us to set my foundation in 001
transparent you guys have see can see
that I have hit major major pan on that
baby um another thing that I've hit made
your pan on is the elf tone correcting
powder and cool this is my holy grail
holy holy grail uh you know setting
powder us this is another HD powder this
is the elf high definition powder gonna
let it go the Revlon Colorstay setting
powder in translucent I am keeping this
you guys can see I've hit pan on that
baby again the NYC smooth skin pressed
face powder I've hit pan on this too I
used that to set and lock in my makeup
I'm gonna let go of this true divvy this
is called the triple c week pressed
powder in quiet and still i have hit pan
but it's a little too yellow for me so
I'm going to let go the essence all
about Matt fixing compact powder IM
keeping this I'm keeping the Knicks
blotting powder in the shade be LP 01
light I am keeping the XO benefit hello
flawless powder this is in the shade I
love me ivory I'm wearing this today I
find it to be a little cakey it's a
little more yellow toned but I think
that I could probably use this up this
week this tiny little travel-size thing
so i am going to use it and keep it the
elf I brightener in buff to yellow for
me I'm going to let that go the Revlon
nearly naked powder in 010 fair i'm
keeping that you guys can see i hit pan
a little darker than my skin tone but
that's okay and i'm going to let go the
bare minerals mineral veil yeah just the
original mineral veil I just don't reach
for it so these are the products that I
will be donating and as these are the
products that I will be keeping I feel
like I did relatively well I love you
know like my setting powders and things
like that I go through those really
really quickly I put I really really
like to set my foundation I put a lot of
powder on so that's why I've hit pan on
a lot of the products but concealer wise
I knew that I wanted to get rid of quite
a few and then of course the brow
products like I just don't reach for
powders as much I don't find them as
easy to use and I just know that I love
brow pencils or just not wearing
anything on my brows like today so
anyway let's count these up quickly 1 2
3 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24 so 24 um products that
i am getting rid of and that includes
concealers brow products and um setting
powders so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this I think 24 is relatively good at
this particular drawer that I'm emptying
out today doesn't have that much product
in it like I said I really want to be
able to combine all my concealers and
pressed powders and foundations at some
point but there's just not enough room
so we'll see once i get to my foundation
drawer if i can let go up as many
foundations
I need you to let that happen but this
is kind of one of those random sort of
emptiest drawers so I feel like 24 is a
good number so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
