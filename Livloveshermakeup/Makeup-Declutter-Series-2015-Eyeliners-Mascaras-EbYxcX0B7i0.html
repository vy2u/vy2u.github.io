little lid I have all of my gel
eyeliners right here and in this little
white container I put all of my mascaras
so we are going to be making separate
piles on these two lids right here and
this one the farthest one to the well I
guess this is to what your left I don't
know um this one right here is going to
be the lid of things that I'm going to
keep and then this one is going to be
the lid of four things that I will be

I'm going to start with my gel eyeliners
because I have the smallest amount of
those so the first thing I have here is

chocolatey brown color and I really like
it so I am going to hold on to that I

to the forever 21 gel eyeliner so I'm

from the drugstore they stay forever on
the waterline they're awesome so I'm
also going to keep the NYX slide on in

I'm not doing very good with eyeliners I
have obviously gotten rid of them but I
just can't part with good eyeliners you
know alright here are my mascaras let's
go through them they are all open and I
am not quite sure if the place that I am
standing I need to ask them if they will
take open mascaras because mascaras go
bad pretty quickly you know they start
to dry out and things like that and
actually all of mine are open so I'm
gonna have to ask them if they take them
if not I'll probably just end up tossing
the ones that I don't use because
honestly you know how long can a mascara
stay like open like that you know what I
mean but the first one we have is the
super sizer from covergirl definitely
keeping this this is one of my favorite
drugstore mascaras the covergirl full
lash bloom this is a waterproof one I

time the two-faced size queen mascara

this one go the Clinique lash power
feathering mascara I'm gonna go ahead

going to keep the Urban Decay perversion
