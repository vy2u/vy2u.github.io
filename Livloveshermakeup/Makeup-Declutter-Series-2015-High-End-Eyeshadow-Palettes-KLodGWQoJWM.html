yes I'm uploading a lot you're probably
seen quite a few videos just straight in
a row for me I had coffee this morning
although I was supposed to have a blood
of stuff going on today like I was gonna
be teaching and doing all this stuff and
everything fell through literally I have
nothing to do now today which is kind of
finding it kind of cool I think my
boyfriend I will watch The Walking Dead
tonight but he's at work and I felt the
Spree time that is why I'm posting a lot
so anyway let's just get started this is
going to be a continuation of my
declutter series I'm doing high-end
eyeshadow palettes this is gonna be a
tough one I want to keep all of them
because they were all expensive but I'm
going to let go of things that I just
don't need so the first thing I have
here I'm going to let go of this is the
Hello Kitty pop-up party palette I liked
this at one point but I just don't reach
for it often enough so I'm going to let
that go the next thing I have is this
Urban Decay I don't even know this is
really old palette it doesn't even like
have a name on it but it's really pretty
and I've had it forever and you can see
I've barely used it so I'm going to go
ahead and let that one go as well you
know the name of that palette let me
know below the lorac summer glow
eyeshadow palette I am keeping this the
colors are fantastic for summer look at
those beautiful keeping that I'm sorry
if I keep grabbing and touching my hair
it's very very dirty and I love the
texture I'm getting at the bottom but
like up here it's so oily and gross you
guys know what I'm talking about if you
have fine hair like me alright the Tarte
golden days and sultry nights eyeshadow
palette this one's hard I love the
colors I really do like this eyeshadow
palette but um in the past year I think
I've only used it like consecutively for
one week it was actually maybe like a
month ago or something they haven't
reached for it really I probably used it
like for one week out of the whole year
so I'm gonna let this one go it's
beautiful it's beautiful though alright
the lorac party eyeshadow palette I want
to keep this I have not really played
with this at all look at the colors
though yes this came out like around the
new year I love it alright the Smashbox
smoke box
I just don't reach for this I'm gonna
let this go it has really really dark
colors they don't get like muddled
together they're actually really nice
they stay very
like separate like you can tell which
color is which but I already have an
Urban Decay palette similar to that the
smoke palette which is in here somewhere
and I'm going to keep that one so I'll
let that one go the Smashbox I'm also
gonna let go of this Smashbox mini box
palette I thought I could get a lot of
use out of this when I travel but
honestly I just never reached for it so
I'm going to let that one go it's nice
though because it can fit in your purse
this little lorac get hot i shadow
palette hmm I love this but I have so
many colors like this I just don't need
it so I'm gonna let go of that alright
this Tarte couldn't essentially travel
chic palette 5 in 1 eye shadow palette
super key packaging and I love the
colors perfect for winter and fall and I
just have not played with this enough I
want to give it a shot this chart coral
crush Amazonian clay eye and cheek
palette I love this I'm keeping it
gorgeous that blush shade in there is
everything everything alright the makeup
forever palette 9 artist shadow this is
the Volume one I love this beautiful
neutral really creamy and easy to blend
keeping that the chart this was part of
their little I don't know where the
other half of it is but last year's
palette very very neutral and pretty I
do like it I think Tarte consecutively
comes out with like the same sort of
palettes so I really only feel like I
need one like shade wise you know
they're very very natural and neutral
looking I'll be lorac mega Pro 2 keeping
that baby I love this Bare Minerals what
is this called I don't even know what
this is called but it's amazing it's so
pigmented the ready eyeshadow formula is
amazing you get some blushes and
bronzers in there as well the bare
minerals the power neutrals palette
again this formula but what's it called
the 8.0 formula or whatever is amazing
super creamy and easy to blends Stila in
the garden palette um I'm gonna have to
compare this with the
because I picked up a bunch of these
little boxed pallets let me look at the
colors quickly and decide which one I
want to keep it which one to let go I
think I'm gonna keep it's hard I think
I'm gonna keep the purple one which is
the in the moment palette and I'm gonna
let go of this in the garden palette
it's beautiful but a lot of the shades
kind of overlap in these boxed ones so
I'll let go of that one
these Smashbox on the rocks I love this
packaging it's beautiful and I just need
to get into this more I just haven't
reached for it often and I think it is
beautiful I love the way it's packaged
and yeah I'm going to keep that alright
so the bare minerals the posh neutrals
rose gold packaging I love this so I'm
gonna keep it again that eyeshadow
formula the 8.0 or 2.0 4.0 whatever it's
awesome my Too Faced chocolate bar
palette I'm keeping this the makeup
forever this is the artist 9 shadow
palette but this is the second one this
is like pop of color love this keeping
that my deal of trust and love gift set
love this I just reviewed this for the
holidays I'm giving it the Bobbi Brown
Taylor I dye palette really really
pretty very neutral
love it keeping it the Laura Mercier
artist palette for eyes and cheeks I
haven't even gotten into this yet but I
have a feeling I'm gonna love it look at
those colors yes over the cane Naked
basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 keeping these very very
basic really really nice however I have
been using umm if you guys want a
drugstore tube but those little
Physicians Formula matte quads are so
similar one's a little more warm toned
and one's a little cooler just like the
Naked basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 obscura from
hourglass the modernist eyeshadow
palette you can that I'm gonna let go
this little to face like a cell phone
case like a candy bar palette I think
that's what it's called I shadow is you
get a blush to highlight can't let that
go I feel like you could also fit in
your purse really easily the Too Faced
smokey eye box alright I think I'm gonna
let this go just because I'm going to
keep the Urban Decay 1 and I don't feel
like I need one or two or three I just
need one I do need one
I'm not two or three of like smokey eye
shadow palettes which is why I'm Lango
the smoke box from Smashbox
this one and I will keep the Urban Decay
one just because they have the same kind
of colors like dark Burgundy's blue
smoky colors so yeah and I don't reach
for I don't do that kind of look on a
daily basis so I don't need three of
those palettes they making it Urban
Decay on the Run palette haven't even
tried this yet I will let you guys know
what I think I've only like swatched it
and what not so we'll keep that for now
the Too Faced natural eye
hmm can you guys tell that I like this
palette that I have to keep this I've
actually hit pan I have completely used
up that hip and hit pan almost hit pan
on that honeypot shade are not heavy
packed push-up love this probably one of
my top 5 definitely is one my top guys
Urban Decay is this the ammo palette
it's an older one I don't even know
again I've had this for ever haven't
even really like gotten into any of the
colors I just don't reach for it so I'm
gonna let it go alright the to face
pretty rebel palette I love this this is
amazing for like pops of colors super
super gorgeous I'm going to keep that
the Too Faced natural matte I love it
this palette I am keeping that my advice
for palette keeping this love it
beautiful beautiful shades really
impressed with the formula of these love
it so get your hands on that if you want
it they meet matte nude palette from the
balm I wasn't sure whether to put this
with my like low and not low-end
palettes but like drugstore lower end I
shadow palettes or with the high-end I
feel like it should be with the other
one I do have a hold another drawer of
eye palettes that is all like drugstore
or like you know BH Cosmetics things
like that house that aren't super super
expensive but this is really well priced
and I'm keeping it it is all matte
really really amazing I love that it has
a lot of those like salmony and orange
undertones which are really really in
right now so I really do like that oh my
gosh okay
hey Sephora glamour all-access glam
golden silver eye and face palette I
never reach for this so I'm gonna let it
go I don't know if those are like
blushes but those are tiny little pants
for blushes but again I feel like
someone could fit this into their
and would probably get a lot of use out
of it a two-faced sugar pop sugary sweet
eyeshadow cap collection love this you
guys know I love Too Faced it's my
favorite high-end brand can't hurt to
face return a sexy one of my favorite
eyeshadow palettes high-end um the Stila
garden of the lammer
it's like this tiny little one really
nice I feel like if somebody could get
this in their purse but I do not reach
for it som when you go to face
semi-sweet chocolate bar can't part with
that one you have to keep it it
cosmetics naturally pretty palette I
love this keeping that hey don't get
those dirty does the Urban Decay smoked
is the one I keep referring to him and
it keeps us it has the same kind of
smoky colors as the Too Faced one and
also the Smashbox one they all just look
kind of similar and again I don't do a
really really dark smoky eye very often
so I don't need three pallets to have
sitting around so I'm just keeping that
one Urban Decay don't know the name on
this money there are letting you go
don't reach for it often at all you guys
can see it barely even touch this baby
so letting go of that really really nice
pops of color there and in general you
guys know that I'm kind of iffy about
like Urban Decay eye palettes ever since
the naked so I don't know I'm not huge
on like their formulation this is the
other half of that tarts palette from
last year again really really neutral
very very soft colors going to keep that
they magnetically attached to each other
my lorac pro keeping this oh my gosh has
everything you could need met on the top
shimmers on the bottom perfect all right
250 lap CIA CIA Olivia Palermo I
smoldering eye palette love this
purchase this and reviewed it recently
keeping that and the Laura Geller the
wearables color story baked shadow
palette this one's hard like I think I'm
gonna keep this yeah I'm gonna keep it I
want to work with them wet I've really
only tried them kind of dry ah how I've
worn them wet I've on it I want to try
with them a little more I know I'm
making excuses I needed I need it in my
life
and the last thing is the bare minerals
ready eye shadow 8.0 in the September
issue and this again is that wonderful
wonderful formula however I'm going to
let go of this one because the color
selection is kind of odd do you guys see
that like purples and just I feel like I
can't put together like a look that
makes sense for me personally I don't
know pretty but gonna let that go
alright guys so let's count up how many
I'm giving away let me put my little lid
here one two three four or donating five
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
heavy twelve thirteen and fourteen so I
am giving away or not giving don't need
to take giving away donating fourteen
high-end eyeshadow palettes I still have
a lot I'm looking down at this box right
now like girl you didn't get rid of
anything but I feel like that's pretty
good I am obsessed with blush and eye
palettes and I feel like those are my
weakness and I really want to hold on to
everything and I will make excuses to
try and keep them in my collection but
yeah I think that's a good number to
donate and I hope you guys enjoyed this
