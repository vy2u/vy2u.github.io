thank you so much for joining me this is
going to be the starter of like the
starter video of my makeup declutter
series I've seen a lot of things going
around on YouTube lately and honestly I
am interested because I recently moved
and you guys know I am putting together
my beauty room and I still don't have
like everything set and organized yet
and I did purchase one of these gorgeous
Alex series drawers which is amazing
do you like my slippers but you guys can
still see I have a bunch of boxes and
crap over here so I'm still not
completely moved into my Beauty room and
I did end up putting all my makeup into
these drawers that I was thinking you
know why I mean I was like putting
things in and whatnot and I just thought
you know what I'll put everything in and
then I will do my declutter and then I
will organize things the way I want to
organize them so I literally threw
everything in I have like my primers
here foundations all that kind of stuff
and this particular drawer is my
highlighters and my bronzers and my
contouring palettes and all that kind of
stuff so I thought I would throw
everything into their drawers and just
kind of start picking out the things
that I don't necessarily use anymore or
things I don't want anymore I am
planning on donating these so if you
guys could leave a link below of you
know places that I can donate this
makeup to I will give some to friends
and family if I find something that I
think they would really like but overall
I would really like to donate it and I
know that there is like a professional
woman's like network or something that
helps donate makeup to women that are
going on job interviews and things like
that if you guys know the name of the
website please let me know because I
would love to go ahead and donate the
stuff that I am not using anymore so
anyway the things that I will be getting
rid of are just you know products I'm
not using anymore products that don't
really interest me anymore or products
that I absolutely hate and obviously I
don't want to use those anymore so um
yeah let's just get started like I said
everything is not organized in here
because I did just move I just threw
everything in here because I thought you
know what I'm not gonna organize it till
I do my declutter because that's what
makes sense and I just want
you guys know that I will be doing an
updated makeup collection at the
beginning of the new year in January if
you guys are interested in that but
overall you know I already have my 2015
makeup collection so if you guys are
interested in that I have that under my
makeup collection playlist but anyway
let's just start going through this
drawer and let's pick out stuff that I
don't need anymore that I can donate so
the first thing I see here is the wet
and wild ultimate minerals bronzer and I
have not even tried this yet so I am
going to go ahead and keep that I have
this elf glow what is this
elf mineral glow shimmer this is kind of
like a highlight powder I'm not going to
use this so I'm gonna go ahead and
