makeup setting sprays that can be used
as primers as well and I happened in
this little lake here I'm going

to put in this box and then everything
I'm going to donate I'll put back in the
lid and I just wanted to ask you guys do
you prefer me doing the declutter videos
this way instead of sitting in front of
little drawers do you prefer me sitting
out here and showing you guys so that
everything is in like better lighting
and also um a few people had said what I
did the first one that like I was moving
the camera a little bit I'm really have
like an kind of unsteady hands with the
camera and they were saying they got
motion sickness I so apologize I get
motion sickness from like being in the
car it's really weird so I know how you
feel I'm so sorry about that so I wanted
to see if you guys prefer this that way
I can show everything to you you can see
everything up close and if you like it I
will continue filming my declutter
videos like this so let's just get
started let's see here the first thing I
have is the Loreal used coat texture
prefecture poor Vanisher I'm going to
keep this I like this a lot I have my
Stila aqua glow perfecting primer I love
this it has such an like amazing like
texture to it it's so hydrating and also
it's kind of like cooling and it's just
I don't have any other primer like it my
give C at the home - she clocked blur
primer I'm going to keep that it's kind
of like a silicone one I'm going to let
go of my ELF poreless face primer this
is basically just another silicon primer
it is a very very good though the
professional license to blot from
benefit I'm going to let this go it just
did not work for me let's see here the
Too Faced shadow insurance anti-crease
eyeshadow primer
I have two of these so I will keep the
smaller one and let go of the bigger one
doubles a place so if you see me digging
around and looking that is why the
professional probelm to minimize the
look of pores from benefit I have a
full-size of this it may actually mean
you know what I used it today so it's
actually in my one of my makeup drawers
but I will keep the big one and get rid
of the little one the Milani eyeshadow

Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
another fantastic one keeping that my
elf makeup mist and set I love this I'm
putting that I'm gonna let go of these
little I haven't even dug into these yet
you make up forever step one mattifying
primer these of kind of primers are just
a little to mattifying on my skin right
now and even this past summer I didn't
get that oily I think my skin is
changing a little bit getting a little
more dry so I don't need that one and
also ups wrong box I don't need that one
and also the smoothing primer I feel
like this is just gonna be another kind
of silicone one and I have a lot of
those so I'll let that go the Smashbox
photo-finish hydrating under eye primer
I'm going to keep that I just use it as
like an eye cream in the morning these
two little I use these to fill in any
areas where I have like fine lines these
are the Mallee ultimate performance
perfectors they're basically like a
little concealer stick that you go over
and then you put your foundation on top

going to keep it my put a lid on it
eyelid primer from the balm love this
going to keep it the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer oil-free the
pore minimizing one this did not work
for me at all it really made my skin
look dry so I'm going to let go of that
the Revlon age-defying wrinkle remedy
line filler I am keeping that the pixi
by petra makeup fixing mist with
rosewater and green tea you can use this
as a primer before your makeup and also
to set your makeup after use that today
I love it the Becca ever matte poreless
priming Perfector again
like you know this is really really
great if you have very very oily skin
but my skin just hasn't been overly oil
oily lately and especially during the
summer like last summer it was
ridiculous I used this like all the time
but this summer I didn't and my skin is
kind of changing so I'm not gonna keep
something that you know I don't need
anymore so I mean like go of that my ELF
eyelid primer I'm going to keep this I
love it something that's very similar
that I do like but I don't need if I
have the elf one is the terena Tarantino
doll skin eye primer and I let that one
go my Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer in light I love this I'm keeping
that something that is very similar in
texture is the wet and while to cover
all primer I'm gonna let that one
actually now I'm gonna keep that one too
I really really like these they're very
similar let's see here the coverfx
calming primary there's only a little
bit left in here I do like it I'm gonna
use it up I love this the Napoleon auto
pilot pre foundation skin primer it's
awesome really hydrating the elf
hydrating face primer I am going to keep
this one I really like this one so
keeping that if the tarte miraculous

makeup drawer the NYX eyeshadow base in
white I'm going to keep that the
covergirl outlast all-day primer I have
stuff that's similar to this so I'm
going to let it go it really doesn't do
any pore filling benefits or anything
like that but it does um
just extend life of your makeup so it's
good I'm gonna let it go on the Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion going to
keep that I'm almost out of this Korres
Greek yogurt - nourishing primer we're

smaller one I'll let that go
whoops from box rocks girl alright these
little benefits stay flawless 15-hour
