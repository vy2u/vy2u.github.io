Smashbox it's a highlighting bronzing
and also
touring sticks so she's gonna have all
three of those I'm gonna pass these on
to my friend Haley these are the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzers she
seems to like those I did decide to go
ahead and keep my what is it called big
book of bronzers from Too Faced I was
saying how I did want to declutter those
but honestly but I think I'm gonna do is
just go ahead and do pop them and I
don't know where that palette is I'm
guessing since it's not in the stores
probably in my eyeshadow palette drawer
but you guys will see it then next I
have the elf bronzer palette I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter that as well and
then this little guy here I'm also going
to go ahead and declutter the shade is
called light nude I'm gonna give that to
my friend Rochelle and then I have this
bronzer here this is just an old one it
still works but I never reach for it it
is the bronze booster from Physicians
Formula gonna let that go I'm going to
keep this elf blush here in the shade
kitty gold here I have the elf
contouring blush and bronzing powders in
those like matte shades I'm gonna go
ahead and keep that I will be keeping my
NYC smooth skin sunny bronzer love that
and also my makeup forever pro sculpting
duo in the bronzer and number two gold
highlighting shade I have this little
tart self tanner here I never use
self-tanner so I'm Nikki clutter that
I'm going to declutter this to my friend
Rochelle this is the bare skin sheer Sun
bronzer I'm going to keep this mixed
prismatic eyeshadow in the shade girl
taça do you like this single shadow I'm
going to go ahead and let go of this elf
blush this particular one is called
blushing Rose it's beautiful but the
lorac blush that I'm keeping is very
similar I'm gonna let go of my one and
only NARS dual intensity blush in the
shade adoration I'm going to be giving
this to my friend Haley because you guys
I do not like the formulation on these
blushes this is what adoration looks
like it's very very beautiful but
honestly these are so so so hard to work
with I just don't think they're easy so
I'm gonna pass that along to her my
Milani
delicioso pink blush I'm gonna pass this
on to Haley as well and the reason why
I'm doing that is because I did keep a
shade yesterday called pink passion that
is very similar from ELF
here we have an elf blush that I'm going
to go ahead and let go of as well and
also this one the names have worn off on
the back so I don't know what they are
here is a 16 hour blush from Too Faced
in the shade love hangover my all-time
favorite I will be going ahead and
keeping that
then we have two little color pop sticks
here so the highlighting shade is gonna
go to Haley this is called releve that
is what it looks like and then I'm gonna
keep the shade of this is one of the
only cream contouring products that I
like this Clinique chubby stick in the
shade curvy contour is going to go to my
friend Rachelle like I said she's very
good with clean contour this little Too
Faced bronzer right here in chocolate
Soleil will go to Haley and then this
little guy right here is another elf
blush in candid coral I'm gonna go ahead
and declutter that I'm going to keep the
wet'n wild ultimate minerals bronzer
it's a very very pretty shade the shade
is called Amber glow and it's just got a
nice amount of like reddish to it and
then here is my all-time favorite
contouring palette if you were curious
