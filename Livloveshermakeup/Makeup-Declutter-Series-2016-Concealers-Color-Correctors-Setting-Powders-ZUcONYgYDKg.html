have another declutter video for you
tonight I will be doing my foundations
after this I'm kind of on a roll so I
hope you guys don't mind but I am
showing you my setting powders my
concealers and my color correctors in
this video I really don't have too much
concealers or color correctors or
setting powders so I thought this one
would be relatively quick I do want to
show you really quickly though I just
did my mascara and eyeliner declutter
and these items were actually in my
concealer drawer so I wanted to show you
guys what they are and let you know if I
would declutter these so the first is
the Maybelline master drama by eye
studio in the shade midnight master it
is an eyeliner I will be keeping this I
will also be keeping these two mascaras
this one is the clump crusher in the
black version and then also I will be
keeping my Sephora outrageous curl
mascara which is one of my favorites I
did find some more Urban Decay 24/7 eye
pencils I know how many of these could I
have the first shade is called the
queues I'll be keeping that I will also
be keeping the shade of Voodoo which is
a purple and also this one which is
called gonzo and then here are the other
two makeup forever
pencils that I could not find these are
the aqua extra-large and m80 and also
m10 so those are both going to go bye
bye and then I'm going to keep the
benefit they're real mascara so just
wanted to show you guys those like I
said some items are creeping into other
drawers so I'll just do it that way when
I find random stuff in random drawers
but yeah let's go ahead and start with
some setting powders color correctors
and concealers the first item I have
here is the Kat Von D locket tattoo
concealer this is the old version look
how dirty my hands are getting from the
eyeliner and mascara video anyway this
is the old version the old formulation
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter this it
was way too dark for me the shade is
light 16 the next item we have here is a
morphe concealer and also going to
declutter this the sheet is called khaki
I just do not like the formulation on
those next I have this amazing cosmetics
hydrate concealer in the shade ivory I
will be keeping that it is in a current
project pan video of mine next we have
the maybelline superstay better skin
skin transforming powder in the shade
number 10 porcelain love this amazing
powder i will also be keeping the tarte
rainforest of the sea aqua sealer the
next item I will be keeping is this
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 16 hour
powder in the shade porcelain so I'm
actually gonna keep both of those I'll
be keeping most of my powders because
you guys I'm a powder whore I don't know
what else to say
I love powder I'm an oily beast so I
feel like I go through powder really
quickly now one
patter I definitely was thinking about
decluttering but now I have changed my
mind
possibly again this is the Kat Von D
locket translucent powder so I'm gonna
use this and try and bake I'm gonna try
and bake my face you guys I've never
baked my face in my life I mean try
using this with EDM sponge thank you to
my friends Haley and Jessica who kind of
taught me how to do some baking so I'm
gonna try this out we'll see how it goes
if it's no good then I'm just gonna
declutter it next we have the maybelline
instant age rewind eraser dark circle
treatment in the brightener version
going to go ahead and keep that here we
have the Becca what are you this is the
ultimate coverage concealing creme in
the shade praline I'm gonna go ahead and
let that go next we have the Kevyn
Aucoin sensual skin enhancer I'm going
to keep that to my shade is sx0 to next
I'm going to keep it this one this is
the bye bye pores translucent airbrush
powder from it cosmetics I love that I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter at this
Stila color correcting palette this was
called they correct and perfect palette
there is two shades in here that I'm
obsessed with those two powder shades
this yellow shade and that lavender
shade I don't like the cream products
though I was originally going to return
this but the time passed for it so I was
like alright whatever I'll just
declutter it but yeah I need to pop
those two is that horrible of me to
depop these and then like give this to a
friend I think my friend Haley wants
this and I would just give her the cream
products I feel like that's really
bitchy of me how about I leave her the
yellow powder but I take out the
lavender that lavender powder is life I
wish they had that in a full-size
alright anyway that's going next the
Tarte wipe out color correcting palette
I'm also going to go ahead and let this
go it was just one of those items like I
really really liked it until I got my
Urban Decay color correcting fluids and
then I was like nah so I'm gonna go
ahead and let that go as well and then I
have my Becca backlight priming filters
that's not oh my god that is a fat as a
primer this is not what these are these
are the backlight targeted color
correctors a lot of you were asking you
remember when I went through that craze
of color correcting everybody was like
did you keep the color correctors of
course I did I know there are people on
YouTube that literally buy stuff just to
review it I'm sorry I don't mean to
throw shade but you know what I'm
throwing shade it's just so silly like
why would you do that just to review it
like people are gonna wonder when you do
your makeup collection videos or things
like that they're gonna wonder like
where did all that go it's so
stupid so anyway I'm sorry
totally ranting but yes I did keep all
of these color correcting products and
yes I did keep all of these the first
shade is called papaya and then we also
have pistachio and then we have this
lavender shade which is called violet at
first I wanted to hold on to my lip I'm
actually not gonna hold on to any of
those because like I said I have other
color correctors that I do prefer and
the ones that I do prefer if you are
curious are these babies so these are
the little they look like little Easter
eggs these are the naked skin color
correcting fluids from Urban Decay we
have yellow we have peach we have pink
and we have green I absolutely adore
these these are amazing so I will be
keeping all of those alright another
color correcting item that I do like
more than these two color correcting
palettes is definitely the NYX color
correcting concealer palette love this
we'll be holding onto that I will also
be holding on to the it cosmetics /
redness neutralizing cream that is an 8
current project pan video I will be
letting go of this other morphe
concealer I just did not like those that
much at first I liked them and I was
like okay I can kind of deal with this
and then I was like you know what no I
hate that I don't know what it was they
just started settling into my fine lines
and wrinkles and things like that
alright so next we have the amazing
cosmetics illuminate concealer this was
recently sent to me and I knew right
away when I put it on my face I was like
this is not gonna work
so yeah amazing cosmetics did send this
to me but I am going to go ahead and
declutter it it's a very thick
formulation and I just couldn't deal
with it it just felt too thick on my
face it also had a little tiny microbes
shimmers in there it's just not my thing
so I am going to go ahead and did I say
return it declutter it alright moving on
here we have the L'Oreal True Match
crayon and this is something that I do
want to declutter the shade is an one
two three
I never reach for this so I'm gonna go
ahead and let that go I'm also going to
go ahead and let go of the elf and
maximum coverage concealer it's way too
yellow for me this time of year amazing
cosmetics also sent this to me now I
purchased this little guy about a year
ago and I think that they upgraded the
package or they just sent me a really
large one this is the ivory concealer
and this one it needs to be tossed out
it's almost completely empty I do love
this product so I will be keeping this
if you would like a dupe for that from
the drugstore the wet-and-wild come
correct celebrity concealer is so so so
good now because I'm keeping this one I
don't need this one but unfortunately I
do think this may be discontinued
someone said that they did see these
stills so I don't know if you can find
it and you want a dupe for the amazing
cosmetic
definitely check it out all right here
is the other Kat Von D lock a concealer
creme the shade I have is white out I
love this we'll be keeping that I have
two of these Mally ever color they're
not ever color what are they called they
are ultimate performance Perfector ever
color concealing sticks so I'll keep one
and then I will declutter the other
alright so moving on I have the elf high
definition under eye setting powder I do
like this I'm gonna keep that this
little guy from Revlon is a beautiful
concealer but again almost done with
this and it's starting to go bad so I'm
gonna let it go it is the targeted dark
spot correcting treatment so we can just
toss those two next we have the Rimmel
stay matte long-lasting pressed powder
in the shade zero zero one transparent
I'm gonna keep that and I'm wondering
where the hell all of my essence all
about matte fixing compact powders are
they love to be in some other drawer
I'll let you guys know I'm definitely
keeping all of those alright I have the
hard candy glamoflauge because I'm
keeping the amazing cosmetics one I
don't feel like I need this one so I'm
gonna declutter that I'm also going to
you actually I'm gonna keep this one I
like this this is the covergirl Ready
Set gorgeous concealer in the lightest
shade I'm gonna keep that and this is
the conceal rx really really good green
concealer this is from Physicians
Formula the Physicians Formula I'm gonna
keep that and I'm going to keep the
Maybelline master concealed by face
studio so here are the items that I will
be keeping for setting powders color
correctors and concealers and here are
the items that I am going to declutter
so definitely not half of what I had but
I do feel like this is the nice amount
and then those two I am going to throw
out so I hope you guys enjoyed this

with you guys and my foundations bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
