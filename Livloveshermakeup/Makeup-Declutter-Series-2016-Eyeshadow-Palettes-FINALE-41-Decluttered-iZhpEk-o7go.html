sorry if my voice is just completely
gone by now but I am back for part four
of my eye shadow a declutter video I
shouldn't say eye shadow I should repeal
it to declutter video so we are on part
4 this is the last segment I really
wanted to get this done today because I
want to start putting these pallets into
boxes for donation and for friends and
things like that so let's go ahead and
wrap this up shall we
the pens that we have here first of all
is the it cosmetics and naturally pretty
palette - this is what it looks like
this is the first version I really do
enjoy this and I will be keeping it and
that is what it looks like it is
beautiful so yeah I will be keeping that
one I also will be going ahead and
keeping let's see here this one right
here this is from ciate so let's put
that in the keep pile this is the Ciotti
Olivia Palermo these smoldering eye
collection palettes it is beautiful I
love this for the fall time the shades
are absolutely stunning in my opinion
and it's just really really good quality
so I'll be keeping that I also will be
keeping my Too Faced natural matte
eyeshadow palette ooh this is one of my
favorite 9 pan palettes from Too Faced
it is absolutely beautiful I do love the
original version of this which is the
natural eye palette which I think is in
my bathroom damn it I don't have it for
this video oh my goodness
okay well it's in my bathroom it is
basically this is the map version of
that palette it's gorgeous
in James way that's quite a bit so I'll
be keeping that I have this little quad
here from Physicians Formula this is B
Canyon Classic squad and this is what I
was talking about that is definitely a
dupe or kind of like an alternative for
the Urban Decay Naked basics I think
this is for the two this one is a little
more cool toned and then they do have a
warmer tone right here and this one is
called classic nudes and this one really
does have similar shades as the Naked
basics just the original so if you are
looking for a cheaper alternative both
of those are good and I will be keeping
both of them
alright we have the makeup forever
palestine artist shadow this is in the
colorful version I think that's what
it's called number two this is what it
looks like on at the inside you have
some really really nice pops of color
here like that pink and that blue I'm
going to go ahead and hold on to this
because I do really like the formulation
I'm gonna let go of this BH Cosmetics
wild at heart two baked eyeshadow
palettes like I said earlier I just
really have not been into baked
eyeshadow palettes lately
is beautiful it's got gorgeous gorgeous
colors if you guys can probably see I
really do think it's great but I just am
NOT you know reaching for stuff like
this anymore so I'm gonna go ahead and
let go of that moving on we have another
little Maybelline quad this is the
expert we're in the shade chayo latte
again Emily Noelle 83 recommended this
to her subscribers I picked it up and I
loved it so I'll be keeping that I will
also be keeping this little trio here
from wet and wild
I know it's technically technically not
a palette but I do put all you know any
sort of eyeshadow that is more than a do
what I do store them with my palettes
because it's kind of like a mini palette
but this is in I'm getting sunburned
I love the wet and wild eyes shadows
this is what it looks like beautiful I
will be keeping that I am going to let
go of the balm cosmetics mont balm
eyeshadow palette it's super super cute
it's just like a little quad here you
open it up you do have some nice kind of
fall-like shades but I just never reach
for this I do find a few of them are
quite glittery and hard to blend so just
not on my style
I do have an SI Lauder palette here this
is the provocative petal let's see here
reflect matte satin matte
oh no pure color and pianist reading the
actual finishes this is the pure color
and the eyeshadow palette in provocative
petal this is what it looks like very
very beautiful packaging I will be
keeping this I think it's just so so so
beautiful I don't have any other Estee
Lauder eyeshadow palettes and I just
feel like a collapsing biatch or when I
am carrying that around alright moving
on the next item we have here is the
tartlet in bloom palette this is a
favorites of a lot of people's and
definitely mine as well it is a gorgeous
formulation I do like the shades in here
they are very very neutral so if you are
someone who really does like those
neutral tones you would enjoy this they
have some luster shades they do have
some transition shades and a nice matte
brown shade so I will be keeping that I
also will be keeping this Laura Mercier
palette and this is called the artist
palette for eyes and cheeks it comes in
this leg kind of like what is this tiger
print yes this tiger print its magnetic
you open it up you do have a blush and
then you do have like little quads of
eyeshadow on each side I hope that I am
holding this properly
let's just go like this let's just go
like that you can see all my boxes
anyway you have a blush here and then
you have some cool tones here and some
warm tones here I love this palette I
will be going ahead and holding on to
the next item we have here is the
Jacqueline Hale favorites palette from
morphe I'm gonna go ahead and let go of
this I just cannot stand morphe makeup I
don't know what it is it's like a
combination of the scent and just the
quality I don't know it just feels very
cheap to me and I don't like that so I'm
gonna let that go I will be holding on
to the bare minerals bare minerals ready
eyeshadow 8.0 pallets in the power and
neutrals this is what it looks like I
did declutter the little rosy pink one
but this one is really gorgeous very
very nice neutral kind of earthy tones I
love keeping that I am going to go ahead
and get rid of this love and beauty by
forever 21 I shadow palette and I do
love this I really think some of the
shades in here are fantastic and good
quality but you guys this thing is just
humongous it's like double the size of
my metal matte palette from Kat Von D
and that thing's huge so I just I just
don't want this in my li series 9
drawers so I'm gonna go ahead and let it
go let's see here we have a we have a
bronzer palettes that apparently got put
in with eyeshadows this is the lorac
take me to 10 tegu 10 Tico 10 Tango
palettes this is what it looks like I
will be going ahead and keeping this
obviously it's not supposed to be in
this video but we shall put it in the
keep pile anyway I'm gonna let go of my
Urban Decay vice Ltd reloaded palette
this is what it looks like I like to
this at first but I do find that the
color combinations in here are just kind
of not color combinations the colors in
here are hard to combine together okay
so it's hard to put together color
combinations without them looking kind
of interesting I don't know why I just
have a hard time I do like the shade
right here called gold mine I was gonna
deep pot that but I'm not gonna do that
I'm giving this to my friend Haley and I
know that she will love that shade so I
really like um asphyxia acid rain and
this shade right here but I had a hard
time hearing some of these colors
together just because they are so
different so I'm gonna go ahead and let
go of that we have the chart what is
this rainforest of the sea eye shadow
palette I will be going ahead and
holding on to this it is very similar to
the makeup forever artist 9 pan palette
but I like both with the formulation
they're both foiled and very nice I'm
gonna let go of this Stila pellet this
is the eyes are the window shad shadow
palette in the body shade so this is
really beautiful like when you see this
you're gonna be like where are you
decluttering that the actual shades are
gorgeous you have some nice like
aquamarine shades and it's just
beautiful but I do find
these do have a lot of glitter in them
they're hard to work with I just I don't
want to put the time and effort in just
don't want to all right moving on we
have a two-faced gingerbread cookie
palette this is also part of the grand
hotel cafe set this is my second
favorite in the little collection we
have a nice bronzer there and then you
have six different eyeshadows love this
we'll be keeping that moving on we have
this little tart palette here I talked
about this in products that nobody talks
about that I really do enjoy but
honestly I have not been reaching for
this nearly as often and I do notice
that these shadows in here are starting
to get a little firmly pressed so I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of this this
is the Tarte couldn't essentially travel
chic five and one eye shadow palette
really really keep packaging as you guys
can see you do open it up and this is
what it looks like it's like a perfect
like really really kind of sultry
palette I love that green in there I
really like those brown shades it's
beautiful but I just don't know the
sheets or the actual consistency of the
powders are starting to change alright I
have a little Maybelline eye studio mat
from mauve quad right here if you have
guys have never tried these out you
should these are beautiful little quads
from the drugstore I will be going ahead
and clean that I'm going to let go of
the other half of this little Tarte
palette here I showed the magnetic side
in the other video this is like like I
said this was one of their holiday
palettes it connected magnetically I
don't really know why they did that but
I guess it was because you could travel
with this but these are the shades very
very boring and basic and I'm sorry like
I know I'm keeping a lot of basic
eyeshadow palettes but I just feel like
Tarte always stays in the same kind of
color family I don't know why I picked
this up so I'm just gonna go ahead and
let that go I don't know why it's still
in my collection another Maybelline eye
studio little quad this one is in I
believe copper craze again these are
beautiful beautiful eyeshadows if you do
not want to sorry I feel like it's like
I'm blinding you guys I mean if you do
not want to spend like money on a
high-end eyeshadow palette you should
definitely check those out listen here
we have the Christmas in New York
Mary macaroons palette from Too Faced
this was a pretty good one for the
holiday season I will be going ahead and
keeping this it is very very neutral I
had a subscriber say I think that the
only pops of color that Too Faced really
knows how to do is like a green and a
purple I feel like you always see if
purple or green in a very neutral
palette but it's true this is nice it's
a little more on the cool tone side
which I do like so I'll be keeping that
I have another Stila what is this
perfectly perfect hue palette this is in
the shade medium slashed hand which is
my favorite it's got like rose gold
shades can you guys see that
absolutely stunning we'll be keeping
that to slushes and then you do have
some eyeshadows in there I have this
little Sephora it's just a quick - yeah
- Quint and this is actually really
beautiful the shade is called mild to
wild khaki and I do think the Sephora
collection eyeshadow palettes are good I
don't like their singles but the
palettes are good very very pretty green
colors I'm gonna go ahead and keep that
I have my covergirl true naked Rose's
palette I love this this is better than
the Naked 3 in my opinion now I don't
like they naked fellas I never have I
declutter doll of mine I just thought
they were very very chunky hard to work
with hard to blend but I will say this
is beautiful I love the consistency will
definitely be holding onto that I will
also be holding onto the Tarte thrilled
kindness around like confetti this is
the young wild and free eyeshadow
palette that is what it looks like it is
basically a travel size palette and I do
think that the shadows in here are very
comparable to the in bloom palettes very
creamy very very beautiful and it's
perfect for your pores so I'm gonna keep
that I have a little Revlon Colorstay
quad here this isn't free spirit and I
just thought those shades looked so
beautiful that blue and that kind of
like taupey color but honestly they
they're not very pigmented at all so I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter that
another NYX ultimate eyeshadow palette -
this is in the smokey highlight version
it looks very similar to the cool
version I'm gonna go ahead and declutter
that we have another steal a perfect
knee perfect hue palette like I said I
adore all these will be keeping all of
them this is in the ferret / light
version again two blushes and some
eyeshadows and that's finally it we have
this little guy this is the runway eye
shadow glamour berry blue but this is
from profusion this is such a good
palette this was like three dollars and
49 cents at Ulta you open it up you have
like such creamy eyeshadows in here I
don't even understand like I bought this
on a whim it's amazing I love this if
you can find this at also for three
dollars and you need to get it is
beautiful so anyway guys as that is it
we are going to go ahead and add these
into the declutter bin so so far I do
have a bin going here of all of these
decluttered items and it is at the top
so we have done and you guys I think I
have probably decluttered around I want
to say 30 to 35 different palettes as
you guys can see it is completely
completely full okay we don't want those
to fall out but I will definitely leave
down below how many eyeshadow palettes I
ended up decluttering but I'm super
excited I feel like this is gonna be
really really nice for my collection
because I just feel like my two bottom
drawers at my Alex series 9 drawer were
just filled with eyeshadow palettes and
I wasn't getting to all of them so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
was hey guys tomorrow for some more
declutter videos that we're gonna be
going through my lippies and that's
gonna take a long time as well so anyway
I hope you guys button fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
