is going to be part one of a three of my
eyeshadow declutter videos like a series
within a series I will be posting all
three videos today it's not that I'm
trying to draw them out even longer if I
was trying to do that I would post one
today and then one in a week no I am
posting all three of them today and the
reason for that is just because there
are so many eyeshadow palettes I feel
like my lippy collection and my blushes
and also my eyeshadow palettes are the
most overwhelming and you guys know I
don't edit my video so I have to sit
here on the floor cross-legged and I
know sound like a drama queen but
honestly it just starts to be a little
much after about 20 minutes I'm like you
know what I cannot do this so I do not
have the luxury of you know stopping the
video and then starting up again I mean
I could have that luxury but I don't so
I will be going ahead and sharing with
you guys about fifteen to sixteen eyes
shadow palettes in this video and then I
will have part two and part three going
up later today as well so anyway let me
know if you like this new formats I'm
going to see how this works but let's
get started the first little palette I
have here is the Too Faced eggnog latte
a shadow palette this is part of the
Christmas in New York collection you do
get six eyeshadows in here and a blush
and this is what it looks like it is
really really stunning
I do enjoy this palette I think it's
beautiful I think the color selection in
here is really really gorgeous so I will
be going ahead let me see if I can do
this better come out Olivia come on
alright so I will be going ahead and
keeping this I really do love the colors
and out of all of the Christmas in New
York palettes I do think that the Grand
Hotel cafe hands down had the best
formulation so I will be keeping that
the next item we have here is the lorac
mega Pro 3 this is what the lorac mega
pro 3 looks like and I will be going
ahead and keeping this we do have tons
and tons of gorgeous shades in here we
have some warm tones we also have some
cool tones and I just think this is a
gorgeous palette so I will be going
ahead and keeping that moving on we have
the metal matte eyeshadow palette from
Kat Von D I found it guys this is what
it looks like it is absolutely beautiful
you do get foiled shades in here it says
metal matte home did you get foil shades
in here as well as Matt so the foil
shades are on the top as you guys can
see and then the matte shades are on the
bottom I love this palette I think it's
absolutely stunning so I will be going
ahead and
I will be keeping this alright moving on
we have the by Lafosse Pro eyeshadow
palette in the drenched metals version I
will be keeping this I do love the
violet Voss formulation of eyeshadows I
know that they are kind of like a
cheaper brands like a lot of their
products are made in China and things
like that but I don't know what it is it
just works for me it's kind of like
morphe I really enjoy their brushes that
I hate their makeup but a lot of people
love their makeup so anyway I do enjoy
this palette you have some nice cool
tones here some warm tones and it's just
beautiful so I will be keeping that
moving on we have the Urban Decay smoked
palette this is what the Urban Decay
smoked palette looks like it does have a
little zipper I already used the
eyeliner that was in here it was I think
in the shade zero it was it Urban Decay
24/7 glide on eye pencil which I love
those but I think I've only used this
like once or twice I'm not even kidding
you do have a nice brow bone shade you
do have a nice transition shade but all
of the other colors are just dark and I
got this one it was on sale so I thought
oh yeah I have to get it but honestly I
never wear like smokey eye shadows so
I'm going to go ahead and let that go
moving on we have the Urban Decay Naked
basics palette this is the original one
so it's a little more warm toned I will
be going ahead and keeping this it's a
very nice basic little palette so that
is what it looks like alright next we
have the a violet bas Pro eyeshadow
palette in the Holy Grail version I have
compared this to the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills modern renaissance palette I do
prefer this one um you know the modern
renaissance kala is gorgeous but this
one has the same sort of shades you are
getting double the amount of product in
here so I do think that these palettes
are worth the price I know they're about
$60 they are worth that you do get large
pan sizes here but you have some foil
shades you have some glitter shades and
some matte shades I love this going to
go ahead and keep that moving on we also
have the Laura Lee collaboration from
violet boss this one's definitely more
warm toned it's it is different from the
Holy Grail palette the Holy Grail let me
show you guys so the Holy Grail
definitely has more very tones in it as
you guys can see so there is the Holy
Grail this is not going to work I wish I
could set these up together but here is
the Holy Grail and then there is the
Laura Lee so Holy Grail definitely has
more berry tones and then the Laura Lee
has more pops of color and definitely
just more like orange tones in it it's
very very pretty and I do enjoy that so
I'll be
that one as well moving on we have the
Urban Decay Naked on the Run palette I
love this for travel I will be keeping
it it comes in a nice little case like
this you do get a perversion mascara in
here a deluxe size and also a stag
eyeliner in the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
formulation so keeping that and then the
perversion mascara and then you also do
get let's see here how can I show you
guys this so you do get five different
eyeshadows and then you do get a bronzer
a blush and a highlights now you do also
get a lip gloss but mine went bad the
shade was called CESO but it was quite
pretty but the urban decay color
correcting fluids fit perfectly in here
so this is great for travel I do adore
this and I will definitely be keeping it
alright moving on we have the Too Faced
peppermint mocha palette this is also
from the gran hotel cafe set this is the
one I'm actually going to go ahead and
let go like I said I really do like the
ground hotel cafe set however I will say
I find that the formulation in this one
is definitely very similar to the
chocolate shop palate which I'm going to
show you guys in a second I'm going to
declutter that just because they're a
little harder to work with so I'm going
to go ahead and let this go I do love
that blush color but I have others in my
collection and then these sheets here
are beautiful berry tones but again I
have those kind of shades and I think my
friend Haley would really enjoy this so
I'm going to go ahead and let that go
moving on we do have the Christmas in
New York the chocolate shop palette so
this is what it looks like it is like
double the size you do get a blush a
bronzer and a so a highlight in here and
also 21 different eyeshadows I like
these bigger eyeshadows here they're
very very nice but some of these are
hard to work with the mattes especially
but the highlight to the bronzer and the
blush are gorgeous but I do think my
friend Jess would get a lot more use out
of this than I would because these
shades are very similar to what I
already have alright so moving on we
have the meet matte nude palette this is
something I'm going to declutter I have
not touched this and I think six or
seven months maybe even a year you know
what since my last declutter I don't
think I've used this once not even I'm
not even joking no shade this is what it
looks like it's beautiful you do have a
lot of nice matte cool tone colors in
here but this is just yeah I never reach
for it so why hold onto something you
never reach for right guys alright
moving on
and we have here is the urban decay of
ice for eyeshadow palette I love this I
will be going ahead and decluttering the
reloaded palettes but this one is
gorgeous so I love the outer packaging
but not just that these shades in here
are fabulous so you do get a lot of it's
very reflective so I apologize but you
do get a lot of jewel tones in here and
I just think it's fabulous you do have
some mats on the side for your
transition and also like a matte brow
bone shade so this is a palette that you
can use on its own even though it may
not look like it alright moving on we
have the Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette this is my all-time favorite
chocolate bar palette it will be going
ahead and holding onto it and this is
what it looks like on the inside it is
absolutely beautiful a little more warm
tones I really do enjoy this and I'm
keeping it alright moving on another Too
Faced palette we have here is the peanut
butter and jelly palette peanut butter
jelly peanut butter Jenny they are
coming out with a peanut butter and
honey palette which I'm so excited about
but this is one of the 9 pan palettes
from Too Faced and if you have been
watching my channel for a while whoa
that is like so so so look at what's
going on here ok let's just do it like
this
this is one of their 9 pan palettes and
I adore their 9 pan palace the
formulations are really really good and
I do like the tones in here so I will be
going ahead and doing that
and the final palette that we have here
is the Naked 2 basics this is from Urban
Decay as well I feel like we had a lot
of Urban Decay palette um but this one's
definitely a little more cool toned I
don't know you can find dupes for these
particular shades definitely at the
drugstore like in the Physicians Formula
quads I think it's called Canyon
classics I'm going to be keeping those
as well as these but this is just a nice
little palette to have when you're
working with cooler eyeshadows and then
the first version is nice to have when
you are working with more wear eyeshadow
warmer eyeshadows sorry I just choked on
my own spit so anyway so far we are
going to go ahead and declutter these
items the Christmas in New York eyes
shadow palette as well as the meet matte
nude eyeshadow palette the Too Faced
peppermint mocha palettes and also the
Urban Decay smoked palette so we have
three different parts and so far I have
decluttered for eyeshadow palettes so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
