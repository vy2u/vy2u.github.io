welcome back to part two of my eye
shadow declutter a video for 2016 you
guys know the drill I'm not going to
spend too much time blabbing let's go
ahead and jump right into it so the
first palette i have here is the laura
geller the wearables color story baked
shadow palette this is what it looks
like and it is very very beautiful I do
like the outer packaging I think it's a
really pretty product but I will be
going ahead and decluttering this just
honestly because I do not seem to like
baked eyeshadows as much as I thought I
did I really used to think that baked
eyeshadows were awesome I liked that you
could foil them and that you could do a
lot of different things with them and
they would show up more pigmented or
less but honestly I just find these very
very dusty looking on the eyes and
although they are so so so pretty to
look at
you know something that's pretty to look
at just isn't enough sometimes this is
not enough guys so I'm going to go ahead
and let that go the next item that we
have here is the makeup revolution ultra
eyeshadow in the flawless matte version
this is a very very nice I shadow
palette I do think makeup revolution is
a really good brand however a lot of
these colors are very very similar I
don't know if you guys can tell but
there is not a lot of differences
between the colors like the actual shade
so here is a little bit of a close-up I
just feel like all the shades are very
very similar to each other
there are some nice cool tones in here
but honestly it's just I have stuff like
this in my collection so I'm going to go
ahead and let that go as well the next
item that we have here is actually easy
palette filled with some miscellaneous
eyeshadows so oh my god by the way if
you see this little stain here that was
from earlier when I was filming part 1 I
got like a pink eyeshadow on the floor
I'm like great that will never come out
but this is a Z palette that I have
filled with some single shadows I'm not
much of like a single shadow kind of
person I do have some makeup geek
eyeshadows in here I do have a rocket or
blush that i depotted a little mini
fireball eyeshadow from Urban Decay and
then also some Oprah cosmetics
eyeshadows so I'm going to actually go
ahead and let this go I actually kind of
customized this palette for my friend
Rochelle she really likes kind of
neutral items and I just had all of
these sitting around and I
what the heck I have never really used
these I have quite a few of the makeup
geeks like unexpected this particular
shape oh that's from Oprah this one
right here is called corrupt this one
right here is called beaches and cream
you know there's tons of colors in here
that are very very popular but I just
don't tend to reach for Z palette so I'm
going to go ahead and let that go the
next item I have here is the Too Faced
and the power of makeup by
nikkietutorials if you saw my review on
this you know that I was very very
disappointed I do not think this is a
good palette and I know that she has
Sens kind of talked about a little bit
on Twitter or at least I heard that yes
there were some palettes that were duds
and I just feel like going a little bit
of a rant here but I just feel like all
of these collaborations it was like the
same thing with the Jacqueline Hale
stuff some of it was really great some
of it wasn't it's like come on people
it's so hard to trust collapse now
because it's just like I don't know if
you know the effort is going to be there
but anyway well I'm story short this was
very very disappointing to me the
highlight shading here was barely barely
detectable on my fair skin tone this got
immediate hardpan I don't know if you
guys can see that but the bronzer got
immediate hardpan the blushes have
started to get hard pan and a lot of
these shadows are very chunky and have a
lot of Fallout so I'm going to go ahead
and pass that on to my friend Jess who
is really really good with makeup and
one thing I want to say about this
particular palette is that if you're
just like me and you're kind of like
basic with your makeup and you're not a
makeup artist I do think it's harder to
work with this but if you are a makeup
artists I know that you're going to have
any issues alright moving on the next
item that we have here is the lorac nude
necessities palette I was going to
declutter this but now I decided to go
ahead and hold on to it because I am
letting go of the makeup revolution
flawless matte palette I feel like I can
keep this one and honestly this is just
a palette that only would work for those
of you who do have fair to light skin
tones a lot of the colors are similar
and they're not very deep in tone let me
do a little so watch here for you guys
I'm sorry my wrist is kind of you know
what let me swatch it like this that was
not good um my wrist is kind of Raschi
from my lupus shot but there is like the
darkest shade that's the darkest shade
and yeah it looks dark on me but for
someone with like a medium to tan skin
tone that is going to be literally like
the color of your skin so I'm going to
go ahead and hold onto because it does
work for my skin tone but I would not
recommend it if you do have dark a
darker complexion than like I don't know
I would say medium to tan skin or darker
it's not gonna work for you but anyway
alright moving on here's the lorac
palette that I am going to go ahead and
let go of I love the shades in here this
is the lorac summer glow eyeshadow
palette I have rarely reached for this
like I said the shades are absolutely
stunning here are the shades they're
very very beautiful you get some nice
pops of color here let me go ahead and
do a little swatch as well for you guys
so there is a little swatch beautiful
beautiful kind of like turquoisey color
but I do find these a little difficult
to work with there's a lot of fall outs
they are kind of chunky and you do have
to spend you know a lot of time blending
and I am NOT the kind of person that
likes to spend a lot of time blending so
although they are really really gorgeous
shades I wish these were like the pro
formulation but they're not so I'm gonna
go ahead and let that go um moving on we
have the NYX oh my gosh look at my hand
now and we have the NYX butt naked
palette I love this I also have the butt
naked underneath it all palettes and
basically what this is is I believe 25
eyes shadows yeah 25 eyes shadows on the
top and then on the bottom you pull it
out and you actually get a bunch of like
blushes and bronzers and highlights it's
amazing I love this palette especially
for travel let me see if I can open the
whole thing up and kind of put it back
here for you guys to see so it's really
gorgeous
I like the neutral tones in here these
are very easy to work with very good
pigmentation and if you like very very
natural kind of looking eyes you would
like this and then the blushes and
highlights and the bronzer are really
really great so I do adore this palette
probably my favorite palette from NYX
this one and the underneath it all so
I'm going to keep that alright moving on
we have V a visor cool matte palette if
you saw my review on this or my little
tutorial that I had done it was a collab
video I said that this was extremely
hard to work with and I stand by that I
feel like if you weren't if you are a
makeup by artist kind of like with the
nikkietutorials palette I feel like you
could get this to work but I am NOT
someone who likes to sit there and spend
you know a ton of time blending my
eyeshadows nor do I have the time to do
that so this just did not work for me I
know a lot of people who are good at
makeup do adore these I know like Jaclyn
hill or at least I've heard she likes
these I know
babes really likes these pallets but
again they're very very good at makeup
so if you're just kind of like a basic
bitch like I am then this is going to be
you know first of all eighty dollars
second of all um you know you're gonna
have to spend a lot of time with this
particular one beautiful beautiful
shades in here and they are pigmented
but they're just they're hard to pin so
I am going to go ahead and let that go
all right moving on I have my Stila what
is this called trust in love gift set so
this was probably my favorite eyeshadow
palette from last year's holiday
collection however I have noticed that I
have a lot of similar colors to this and
I have already used up these Stila lip
glaze and absolutely mascara so I just
have this like chunky packaging thing
going on here they are beautiful
beautiful shades the foiled ones are
extremely extremely beautiful especially
the shade right here it's kind of like a
bronzy shade I'll go ahead and swatch it
for you guys hopefully you guys can see
that it's a beautiful beautiful kind of
bronzy shade I love that so honestly I
have colors like this and I have you
know products that have the same sort of
consistency the same sort of formulation
and it's just kind of bulky now that
it's missing a couple items so I'm going
to go ahead and let that go and I'm sure
I will have a friend or if I donate this
one hopefully they will do it alright
moving on we have the Lime Crime Venus
palette I think this is a beautiful
palette the colors are gorgeous to look
at I love the outer packaging
unfortunately these colors make me look
sick like really really sick there's
something about these they're a little
too warm toned for me I do have a strong
cool undertone in my skin so when I try
and use shades that are like straight-up
orange it doesn't always look good so
this made me look sick like straight-up
sick I had a few of you telling me you
were like ah Olivia what's wrong with
your eyes today and I'm like oh it's my
eyeshadow and no it's it's not good for
me so if you do have a strong cool
undertone I would not recommend checking
that out maybe if you have like a medium
you know too tan complexion but if
you're super super fair that's going to
look weird if you do have a warm
undertone it's gonna look great right
moving on we have the anasazi of Beverly
Hills
modern renaissance eyeshadow palette I
do adore this and I will be keeping it
this is what it looks like on the inside
and I just love the formulation of this
I did not pick up the mario palettes
because I felt like I had a lot of
shades like that but this one is very
unique to my collection it is very
similar to my violet boss Holy Grail
eyes shadow pal
but at the same time there are some
differences so I really do enjoy this
and I will be keeping that alright
moving on I have my makeup forever 9
artist shadow palette this is the one
that's like the neutral version it has
all of the numbers listed on the back I
wish they would just give them names but
this is what it looks like these are
really really beautiful kind of like
foiled eyeshadows I do enjoy this
particular palette it is very similar to
my Tarte rainforest of the sea eyeshadow
palette but I'm going to hold onto both
of them because I really do like that
formulation so I will be keeping that
moving on I have the Too Faced pretty
rebel palette I love the packaging on
this can you guys see that absolutely
gorgeous it's like I don't even know
it's just so cute I think I've used this
two times and I got this maybe what like
three or four years ago the shadows are
still really good they don't like smell
or you know nothing's gone bad the
expiration is actually on the back I
found a little tag on the back and it
does not expire for another two years
which is crazy because I just wanted to
put it out there the modern renaissance
palette expires in six months which is
ridiculous or eight months or something
like that but this little guy does not
expire for quite some time I love it
beautiful beautiful colors so so so cute
I adore Too Faced they are my favorite
high-end brand but I now reach for it so
I'm going to go ahead and declutter that
to my friend Rochelle moving on I have
the NYX wicked dreams palette I love the
name of this I love the way it looks but
I think I've used this once and I feel
like if I've only used something once
there's no point in holding on to it the
actual you know formulation is quite
good I do prefer the but naked palettes
the underneath it all and the regular
version but this is still really really
beautiful gorgeous gorgeous colors in
here kind of a strange color selection
actually you have some greens and then
some random like pinks and whatnot but
it's pretty it's very very pretty there
very blendable very nice but I am going
to go ahead and let that go because I
never reach for him alright next I have
these Sephora some bleached filter
palette I feel like Sephora collection
um I shadows are either a hit or a miss
I feel like the palettes are good the
eyeshadow singles are not this is
beautiful this is such a unique palette
to my collection I don't know how else
to describe it but look at those colors
I hope that this is doing justice on
camera but it's just gorgeous that this
particular shade right here which is
called swung swan song
is really gorgeous it is a matte white
pinky color and it's like perfect if you
do have a cool undertone so I really do
adore this palette it's very very light
and natural so if they're not into that
then you would not like it
but I like it and you guys look at that
packaging she's like running around with
balloons I'm like how whimsical is that
adorable
alright moving on I have my Too Faced
original chocolate bar palette I am
going to declutter this and I'm sure
some of you were gonna be like what
makeups in this is gonna go to my friend
Rochelle she does not have any of the
chocolate bar palette and I rarely reach
for this one this is the original
version like I got this thing when it
first released it doesn't even have the
names on it you know how the old palace
didn't have names it still smells like
chocolate which is amazing but there are
actually shades in here that I have not
even swatched I don't know if you guys
can tell which ones but yeah I think
it's just very very basic and I have so
many colors like this I do prefer my
semi-sweet and I'll say V bon bons
palette so that's gonna go to Rochelle
just you know go Rochelle it's kind of
like bent here I don't know what's going
on with that you're gonna have to take
that off sorry girl
alright moving on I have the studio
makeup on the go eyes shadow palette
this is I don't know something that I
got in my glossy box now I haven't even
tried this yet and I feel like I should
try it now it's very very basic when I
open it up you're probably going to
think okay Olivia you don't need that
and I feel like I don't but I did swatch
this on Instagram or I'm sorry snapchat
the other day and these foil shades were
really really beautiful so I do want to
try this out I do want to play with it
we shall see but yes it's very very
basic I might end up decluttering it
moving on I have my lorac mega no I'm
sorry my lorac pro 3 eyeshadow palette 2
the rock pro 3 it's so dirty this like
topi tan color and like the white one I
just can't I can't but anyway this is
what it looks like beautiful I love the
lorac Pro formulation my violet boss
eyes shadow palettes and my lorac Pro
you know palettes you will never see me
get rid of those like they are amazing
they even have like similar packaging
just really really good quality here so
this is what it looks like and this is
very very neutral as well and you guys
may be noticing I have a lot of neutral
palettes which is why I probably don't
need this guy but I want to try it out
first alright so yes I am keeping
but moving on we have the Stila in the
moment i shadow pellets i had picked up
all three cells over i had picked up all
three of these little boxed ones i had
the in delight which was pretty i had
the in the garden and then this is in
the moment i don't like the packaging
it's very very cheap no mirror however
these are very very pretty shades the
actual formulation is quite good very
similar to like the kitten single if you
like like the kitten shade i don't know
for some reason i find that the Stila
eyeshadow singles the only good one is
kitten i don't know why but these are
very very beautiful and very buttery
um but yeah i just i don't think i've
reached for this for probably the last
time I think I used this was this time
last year so I'm going to go ahead and
let this go my friend Haley loves purple
eyeshadow so I will pass that on to her
next I have the bare minerals ready
eyeshadow 8.0 palette in the posh
neutrals gorgeous packaging here rose
gold I would be lying if I said I got
this because of the colors I got it
because of packaging I know I know it's
I'm sick I know this is what it looks
like on the inside the colors are super
pretty to look at the packaging is super
pretty to look at but these are not very
wearable they're actually kind of
strange and they don't pair together
very nicely so you do have to pull in
another palette with these but the 8.0
shadow formulation is beautiful from
bare minerals so I'm going to keep my I
believe it's called the power neutrals
I'm going to keep that one and then I'm
going to declutter this one alright
moving on we have one more here and this
is the hourglass what is this called
modernist eyeshadow palette in the shade
obscura I want more of these but they're
so freakin pricey I adore this I adore
this this is a beautiful palette I know
a lot of people don't like it because
you know some of the product does start
to kind of sleep together but it's
gorgeous like this is the epitome of a
beautiful neutral palette they are so
blendable I know some people were saying
they were chalky I don't think so I
think they're gorgeous maybe if you do
have like a darker complexion maybe they
you don't go on slightly actually I'm
not quite sure but these shades were
very very pigmented on my particular
skin tone I love this palette and I do
want to get all of them my friend Mellie
has every single one and I'm so jealous
so anyway I'm going to keep that alright
guys so I'm going to keep in this little
pile let's see here one two three four
five six
seven I shut up wait one two three four
five six yes seven eyeshadow palettes
and then we are going to declutter that
bareMinerals one we have the Stila which
is number two Too Faced chocolate bar is
number three we have four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen and then in it part one of my
declutter a video I did go ahead and let
go a for palette so we have a
decluttered quite a bit already so I'm
very excited so those are the other ones
so anyway I think my goal is to probably
declutter I don't know I think I said
around 15 to 20 eyeshadow palettes and I
feel like I'm getting there so anyway I
hope that the people that I donate this
to you and also your friends I hope that
they enjoy these palettes because I feel
like palettes are one of those items you
want to know that they're going to like
a good place because it's like oh you
spend so much money on them but anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
