weirdest hand movements and this like
I'm so not used to fill me like this I'm
like hey guy call the guy if you are
curious by the way somebody asks are
your nails chipped hell yeah they are
girl I was practicing yesterday and I
just I not a single was given
apparently I'm sorry if they don't look
cute to look at but yeah I feel like if
you want to be a musician and you want
to have cute nails like you can't have
it you have to pick one but anyway we
are going into my third installment in
my eyeshadow declutter series um it's
like a series within a series
unfortunately this is going to sound
weird but I did find another box of
eyeshadow palettes I thought I was just
going to do 3 videos but I found a
little small box I had about 20 more in
them so we're going to go through
probably about 20 now and then 20 in
another video so you are going to have
what 4 or 5 videos for me today if you
don't want to watch them you definitely
don't have to I'm sorry if I'm like
spamming the out of you are in a
subscription feed but it is what it is I
feel like I'm always doing that anyway
so let's go ahead and get started
the first eyeshadow palette I have here
is the Kat Von D serpentina eyeshadow
palette I love this packaging inside of
here you are getting some of the I think
it's the metal crush yeah metal crush
eyeshadows which are beautiful you are
getting 2 mattes in here the mats are a
little more rough to the actual touch if
you guys saw my review on this I said
that but they are very pigmented but
yeah the shades are gorgeous you do have
this little loose pigment in here it's
in gorgeous kind of like dark greeny
yellowy like it kind of looks like the
color of pee okay it's kind of like a
pea shade but it's like cute like QP
um anyway it is kind of like a dark
muddy yellowy green color I actually
really like it but I am just I I can't
do these like I can't do it I don't even
know how to apply this I tried so many
different ways it's kind of like me with
winged eyeliner like it's just never
going to happen so I'm going to
declutter that I don't know if that's
weird to just like pull it out on my
palette but I'm going to do that and
then I am going to go ahead and keep the
V serpentina palette moving on I have a
two-faced 9 pan palette here of Gannett
this is the sugar pop palette and these
are 9 pan palettes which means I am
going to be keeping them I absolutely
adore the Too Faced 9 pan palette
formulation and this one is no exception
my favorite shade is this one right here
which is called strawberry ice it's like
a nice like cool lavender toned shade
alright moving
I have this Revlon eyes cheeks plus lip
palette I hate this so much to the point
I don't even want to declutter this to
anybody like is such crap you guys you
do have some cream products in here
mixed in without a cover mix right into
the powder products which i think is
absolutely ridiculous it's messy there's
no pigmentation I did a first
impressions on this and I was just like
what the hell is this so I'm going to go
ahead and just throw that away because I
will not donate that so it nobody needs
that okay it's a piece of crap alright
the next item I have here is the lorac
Pro palette this is just the original
one it is beautiful and I feel like this
is just a fan favorite of everybody's
everybody loves this palette is gorgeous
you have mats on the top shimmers on the
bottom and you have every single shade
that you could ever need in a palette
right there alright moving on we have
these Cielo perfect to me perfect cute
pellets in the tan slash a deep version
this is what it looks like I need to
like prop it on the ground so that I can
have it even but these are beautiful I
have all four of them I will be keeping
all four of them I love these for travel
as you guys can see you have two blushes
on the bottom and then some eyeshadows
really really good quality palettes here
and great for travel alright moving on I
have the lorac mega pro 2 palette here I
love this one this is my all-time
favorite mega Pro palette if you guys
were curious and you probably have
realized that I am not too flattering
anything from lorac then it's like the
pro formulation that's because I'm
obsessed so I will be going ahead and
keeping this I love this one because it
has pops of color some nice like pinky
shades in the middle and then like a
bunch of neutrals so kind of the perfect
proto telus in my opinion the next item
we have here is the torch coral crush
Amazonian clay I in chic College I
really love the packaging of this and
honestly I got this palette because of
the blush let me show you guys the blush
in here it is absolutely beautiful it is
like this gorgeous gorgeous like rosy
tone I think it's just stunning but I
will say I don't get any use out of the
eyeshadows or the highlight or the
bronzer so I'm going to go ahead and
declutter this it really pains me to let
go of that blush but honestly guys
comment I've so many blushes I'm sure
that I can find something similar in my
collection
alright the next item we have here is
the Bobbi Brown Telluride eye palette I
keep going back and forth with this some
of most of the items you guys just so
you know I'm a very decisive person so I
am making the decisions as we go through
I
a comment nah opposite this video no it
wasn't from today it was from my
highlighter yeah my highlighter video
somebody had asked if I had already made
the decisions on all of the items the
answer is no I'm just a very like blunt
straightforward person I'm like I either
want it or I don't so just do you guys
know I don't already have everything
planned out but that's I've been going
back and forth with this I have been
thinking about this one recently because
I notice that I wasn't reaching for it
and I found it in my collection I was
like do I want to declutter that do I
want to keep it it is the Bobby Brown
Telluride I pellet like I said it does
come with a little brush and then this
is what the actual shades look like it
is very very basic and I feel like I
don't need it but the inner makeup
hoarder in me wants to keep it so I'm
gonna give it all right moving on I have
this bareMinerals palette here this is a
beautiful beautiful palette well I
shouldn't say it's a beautiful palette
there are two shades in here that I'm
obsessed with I did crack the mirror
which totally sucks but there are some
pretty bronzers some blushes and outs
with some eyeshadows in here hopefully
you guys can see that my two favorite
shades are this one right here and list
one hoopla and then this one is called
water cycle what does this a bragging
rights okay bragging rights really
really gorgeous love those two shades
but I feel like I can do them out in my
collection I don't get any use out of
the other products so I'm going to go
ahead and let this go I don't even know
what this is called it says oh ready I
shut it doesn't it doesn't say anything
alright moving on we have this little so
for a guy right here yes this is the
Sephora
sand illusions baked eyeshadow palette I
love the packaging on this and I love
the way that baked eyeshadow look like I
love them they're so cute they look like
little bubbles I don't think I have used
this once i think i've swatched it and i
have never used it because it just
doesn't interest me so it's got to go by
it's got to go all right moving on I
have the NYX ultimate IRA shadow palette
in the bright subversion I will be going
ahead I will be going ahead and keeping
those I cannot speak I will be going
ahead and keeping this I did pick up all
four of the ultimate eyeshadow palettes
I'm going to declutter three of them
because I have other palettes of my
collection that have the same sort of
colors but this one I have two I love it
alright moving on I have the Urban Decay
electric palette again this is very
similar to be brights version I don't
feel like I need both but like I want
both so I'm going to keep
this is what it looks like on the inside
really really bright
really really bright and a vibrant I
direct I adore it alright moving on we
have the Knicks butt-naked underneath it
all palette so in the other was it the
last I can't remember which declutter
video was was it the first one or the
second eyeshadow palette one I showed
the butt-naked version this is the
underneath it all so this is more of
like a fall I would call this like more
of like a fall version so you have like
some nice eye shadows up here you do not
have 25 like I said in that video you
have 15 here I can count you do have 3
illuminators at the bottom and then some
nice blushes I adore this I honestly
adore this these are so good from NYX if
you can ever get your hands on these you
should definitely keeping that I have
this little pixie palette here this is
called the icy eye palette in buff
blizzard I don't think I've ever really
used this i've swatched it before and I
was like oh that's so pretty and then I
was like yeah it's pretty and I don't
want to use it so I'm gonna go ahead and
let it go alright I have this elf
palette here this is actually really
nice a little palette however um a
little bit of a funky smell to it and
I'm just not that kind of person that
likes my eyeshadows to have a funky
smell I believe this is called the I
cannot tell what the elf palette you
guys it's always just like it says 3 3 4
3 it's got just a bunch of eyeshadows in
here that are very beautiful some of
them are foiled and I like that foil
finish like this green shade here but I
will say I do think this is starting to
kind of go bad so I'm actually just
going to go ahead and toss that because
I have a bad feeling about it
here's another NYX ultimate shadow
palette this one is in cool neutrals
this is what it looks like I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter that to my friend
Haley and then we also have this one
right here which is the warm neutrals
and this one's beautiful as well but I
have so many you know colors like this
in my collection so I'm going to cutter
that as well let's see here at this
little tarts piece of sheet this was
from what Holiday Collection last year
or the year before this is why I don't
buy Tarte eyeshadow it's like during the
holiday season I just feel like they're
all crap this was made in China nothing
wrong with China
my boyfriend's Chinese I love Chinese
people I think China's gray
um seriously every time I say that
someone's like why are you so racist I'm
like I'm not I'm just saying I don't
like the way that they put together
their palates during the holiday season
I feel like they're very cheap this is
no exception it does have like another
magnetic side here that attaches another
pellet that you guys will see in the
next video but beautiful beautiful
neutral colors you know this is like
typical tart and they're just not
pigmented they don't blend well they're
patchy they're just pretty to look at so
I'm going to go ahead and declutter that
um we have the Too Faced chocolate bon
bons palette I do adore this this is
great if you do have a cool undertone or
if you like cool toned eyeshadows and I
mean hello it is so adorable so I will
of course be keeping that moving on we
have this little quad here if you're
wondering why I have like trios and
quads it's because anything that's more
than a duo i do consider like a little
mini palette so this is from Tarte it is
called the apple of my eye quad it is so
cute but you guys like I have so many
colors like this like let's be honest
that is what it looks like I think it's
adorable I'm going to give this to my
friend Rochelle if she wants it I can't
remember she said she wants it but like
I think it's so cute how adorable is
that for like purse travel and it's like
a little cardboard box so any weight
very cute but I have similar products I
have a few little what are these Ulta
eyeshadow palettes here so these are
supposed to be like a dupe for the
hourglass modernist eyeshadow palettes
now I have a one of the hourglass
modernist eyeshadow palettes and
although these are quite good they're
not the hourglass is so I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter these this first one
here is kind of like a greenish color I
think it was really obvious what they
were going for with this like they were
just trying to be exactly like hourglass
but really cool that they did that I
mean these were not bad I think I did a
comparison of this against the hourglass
last year around this time and I was
impressed they're pigmented but they're
not as blendable or smooth and creamy so
I don't let go of those and then we have
this Smashbox palette and you will see
this in my what video is it oh yes the
packaging Awards like pretty makeup
sometimes we just have to like talk
about pretty makeup like hello this is
gorgeous I love the outer packaging I've
got this for the packaging like no shame
it's squishy on the top is just so
beautiful it's light reflective it looks
so pretty on the inside and this is the
only time I have ever been disappointed
with an eyeshadow palette dead Emilie
Noel 83
amended she recommended not particularly
that particularly she did not recommend
I'm going crazy you guys she did not
recommend this particular palette but
she did recommend the photo op
formulation and I do not think it's easy
to work with I think Emily is amazing at
makeup so maybe it's like easy for her
but for me I'm just like sitting there
blending and blending and blending it
was too much so I'm gonna go ahead and
let go of that and then we have this
little the rock Purdy eyeshadow palette
really really cute this was like at the
checkout at Ulta and I have never
actually would have I worn this on my
eyes you guys I don't think I've ever
worn this on my eyes and I just have no
desire to I just think it's very very
pretty
yeah I feel like my makeup geek side is
just coming out right now like literally
like I just have it because it's pretty
but you know we all have pellets like
that in our collection I've never used
it because like every time I look at it
I know there's gonna be a lot of fallout
a lot of glitter it's chunky it's just
pretty I don't really know why I bought
it so I'm gonna go ahead and clutter it
give it to someone who really wants it
and then I do have two little drug store
on quads here one of them was
recommended by emily noel 83 this is the
maybelline expert wear designer
chocolates you guys have heard her talk
about this right I feel like she's been
recommending this to her subscribers
forever
I love this and level of Lovelace so I'm
going to keep that and then I have this
little covergirl this is two five seven
blossom this is just a little quad that
has some pinky tones in it and these are
so not pigmented so not pigmented like
come on covergirl when you're going to
come up with good palettes besides well
I think they're true naked palettes were
pretty good but you guys are amazing
alright so actually I'm sorry guys we
have another one I crept up on me here
is another Stila perfectly perfect hue
this is in light/medium again you have
the two blushes and then you have some
eye shadows so I will keep that alright
so we will add let's see here we already
have 14 yeah 14 eyes shadow palettes
that we are decluttering so now we have
15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 actually 27 because in the first
video I took my what did I do I put the
lorac into the go pile even though it's
supposed to stay with me so yeah I feel
like this is pretty darn good I
definitely have exceeded my
Asians I still have a whole nother pile
to go hopefully I can get rid of maybe
like thirty five pallets I think that
would be great so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I will see you in the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
