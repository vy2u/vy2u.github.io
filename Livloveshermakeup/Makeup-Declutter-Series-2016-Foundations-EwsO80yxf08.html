have another declutter video for you
guys tonight at this time we are
obviously going through my foundation so
I'm gonna try and get through this
relatively quickly I'll try and give you
mini reviews on each product but yeah
the Sun is going down pretty rapidly so
let's go ahead and get into it
alright the first item we have here is
the max face and body foundation this is
a white mixer foundation I will be
keeping this I also have two of the
Illamasqua rich liquid foundations these
are also white mixer foundations the
color does change sometimes the
exploration is still fine on both of
these so I'm going to keep this one and
I am going to declutter the other those
two shades are called our f100 if you
are curious next I have the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
with broad-spectrum SPF 35 sunscreen
3515 I can't see through the viewfinder
this shade I wear is fair beige this is
a wonderful wonderful foundation if you
do have oily skin or if you have combo
skin it keeps you really matte and it
has full coverage the next one we have
here is from Bobbi Brown this is called
the Bobbi Brown SPF 25 tented
moisturizing bomb and the shade that I
have is alabaster tint I will be going
ahead and holding on to this but I would
not repurchase after I used it up it
isn't a current project pan which is why
I'm continuing to hold on to it next I
have a laura geller based balance and
brighten foundation in the shade fair I
do like the porcelain version but the
fair version is too dark for me so I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter that but
this one I will be keeping this is in
the shade fair alright moving on I have
this Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation
this is a beautiful beautiful foundation
the shade that I wear is 110 I will be
going ahead and keeping this really good
coverage from the drugstore and I think
it's very nice if you do have combo or
oily skin next we have the Mac Studio
sculpt SPF 15 foundation the shade that
I wear is NC 15 it's just a little too
dark for me right now and also on top of
that I do not like the formulation so I
will be going ahead and decluttering
that next I have this Stila aqua glow
serum foundation my all-time favorite
serum foundation I will definitely be
holding on to this next I have these two
foundations here these are from L'Oreal
the first one is the visible lift with
the serum absolute what's the difference
between the two of these I don't know
this one is called serum absolute and
the shade is 1:45 and then this one is
143 and it's a visible lift so I do like
both of those but um I just don't need
both of them they've been in my
collection for a while now and
they haven't expired yet but I feel like
someone who could get through those
quicker than I can so I'm going to go
ahead and declutter those I am going to
go ahead and keep this covergirl
trublend foundation very very basic
foundation but so so nice and actually
something that not a lot of people talk
about that I enjoy alright moving on I
have a highlighter in here that should
not be there we have the covergirl clean
matte BB cream in five ten fair really
love this great coverage and it does
keep you quite matte I'm gonna keep that
I'm going to declutter the elf flawless
finish foundation is just a little too
yellow toned for me unfortunately the
shade is called porcelain but beautiful
packaging really nice coverage on this
actually alright moving on we are gonna
go onto my one stick foundation this is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills stick
foundation the shade that I wear is
porcelain I really really love this
foundation perfect for travel and I will
be holding onto that next I will be
decluttering this l'oreal visible lift
blur op to blur technology foundation it
just does not last on my face if you do
have dry skin I think it would work for
you dry skin or normal skin if you have
combo or oily forget about it it just
disappears on your face the shade that I
wear is 201 light ivory so I'm gonna go
ahead and let go of that alright next we
have the maybelline superstay better
skin skin transforming foundation that
the shade is number 10 porcelain this is
what I've been wearing this week I love
this really good foundation going to
keep that I have the chart powder what
is this called again it's called the
confidence creamy powder foundation in
the shade fair neutral love that will be
holding on to that I have this hello
flawless from benefit I'm just going to
go ahead and toss this it's pretty much
like dead and I feel like it already
started to break up in there so I'm
gonna go ahead and toss that one next I
have the Neutrogena Healthy Skin glow
sheers this is an illuminating tinted
moisturizer with broad-spectrum SPF 20
I'm gonna go ahead and let go of this it
should doesn't have enough coverage for
me and it does run a little bit on the
darker side another serum foundation
that I adore is the Smashbox camera
ready BB water drops in the shade fair I
will be going ahead and holding on to
that I'm gonna declutter this Stila
color correcting cream with
broad-spectrum SPF 20 I have a friend
with dry skin who would really like that
I will be holding on to the covergirl
hydrating makeup and these are really
good this is the CG smoother I really
like this alright moving on I will be
holding on to my Estee Lauder Double
Wear stay in place makeup if you are
curious the shade that I wear is one and
one ivory news moving on I will be
holding on to the L'Oreal infallible
Pro glow foundation the shade I wear is
201 classic ivory it definitely doesn't
stay on for as long as they claim but it
still is a really good nice nice finish
sort of foundation at that huh
my god I swear a bug just room to fluid
to my throat really nice foundation it
looks good on the skin all right moving
on we have these Sela illuminating
tinted moisturizer with SPF 20 I will be
passing this on to my friend Rochelle
she would love this the shade is 0-1 I
will be going ahead and keeping my
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundation I love that I'm also keeping
this CC cream from gosh cosmetics this
is one of my favorite CC creams it is
the illuminating version in the shade
porcelain I love that I also really love
my hard candy glamoflauge foundation so
I'm gonna hold on to that I will be
holding on to my vibrancy fluid
foundation from josie maran one of my
all-time favorites i will also be
holding on to the NARS Velvet Matte skin
tint the shade I wear is Tarun wave a
very very nice if you do have combo to
oily skin and also if your skin is
problematic because that has a lot of
coverage so does this one this one is
the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation the shade I wear is 101
classic ivory will be holding on to that
I'm gonna let go of this foundation I
have only tried it three times but a
made me break out like crazy it is the
dermablend smooth liquid camo medium
coverage foundation did not work for me
so I'm gonna let that go I will be
holding on to my Marc Jacobs genius gel
foundation I really really do enjoy this
beautiful nice and lightweight
foundation another nice the lightweight
foundation is the Laura Mercier candle
glow soft and luminous foundation the
shade that I wear a shell I love this

the covergirl Plusle a CC cream love
this baby will be holding onto that I
will be letting go of the covergirl
Ready Set gorgeous fresh complexion
makeup in the shade 1:05 I don't know
what it is about this it really makes my
skin look very very aged for whatever
reason the next time we have here is the
Rimmel stay matte - liquid mousse
foundation in zero one zero light
porcelain I will be keeping this I think
it's a very nice product and if you want
something that's very similar to the
Tarte Amazonian clay foundation
this one is alright moving on I have the
dream of velvet soft matte hydrating
foundation from Maybelline I will be
passing this along the sheet as much my
to pink for me and finally we have the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid makeup
the shade that I wear is what is a
classic ivory number 10 it's a little
dark but absolutely beautiful on the
skin alright so here are all of the
foundations I will be keeping and here
are all of the foundations that I will
be getting rid of I feel like it's not
that much let's go ahead and count them
out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
