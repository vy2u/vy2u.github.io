today's video is going to be another
makeup declutter series video this time
we are going through what I would
consider at my miscellaneous drawer I
have a bunch of brow products in here
eyes shadow singles eye shadow duo's you
won't see any trios because the trios I
show in my palette video scents I
consider anything more than two shadows
to be like a mini palette we have some
lip balms we just have a whole bunch of
 so we're gonna go through here and
declutter this stuff and yeah let's go
ahead and get started the first item I
have here are these kiss lashes YouTube
makes me feel like I need to wear
eyelashes on camera and I never have
done it it's just all of these beauty
girls wear them and I was like oh I
should start wearing fake eyelashes and
then I was like why it's just like extra
it's just an extra step that I don't
want to deal with so I'm gonna go ahead
and let go of all of the eyelashes that
I do have just because like I said I
never put them on and I don't know why
should I have some glue here with a
little tweezer I'm gonna let go and yeah
I just I just don't need those alright
next I have this oh my brow this is a
highlighting brow pen I'm gonna go ahead
and let that go next I have this eye
shadow stick here this is called the
Beauty for real shadow sticks I do like
the color but I don't really like cream
eyeshadow so I'm gonna let that go next
I have the elf long lasting lustrous
eyeshadow in a gold shade and never
reach for that gonna let it go I'm gonna
let go of some of these lip balms here
we have Fanta sprite coca-cola and also
grape Fanta
I just have better lip balms and I'm
gonna let those go this particular one
I'm going to keep because it tastes
amazing this is the lip smacker the lip
smacker in white chocolate lemon I do
feel like lip smackers are good if
you're like an everyday person you do
want to use them however for me as a
flutist like they're nice underneath lip
balms but I need something heavier
during the day so I'm also gonna go
ahead and let go of this coca-cola
vanilla I'm gonna let go of this Burt's
Bees pumpkin spice lip balm I'm sure my
friend Rochelle would love this it's
taste really good and it smells really
good but Burt's Bees products are not
hydrating enough on my lips personally
one that I'm going to keep is this
Vaseline lip therapy in the rosy lips I
love that I am going to go ahead and I
think I'll keep this one I love my
Maybelline Baby Lips this is in the
quench 2 version which is just the clear
version I have a color pop eyeshadow
here I don't like color pop eyeshadows

over my lids I feel like YouTube made me
buy it and I'm just not very happy with
them so
I'm going to declutter all of them
