if you're wondering what this is I have
a few people asking me in my last couple
of videos for declutter and this is my
leg I'm sitting cross-legged so this is
technically my knee and I'm just wearing
like really fluffy little pants here but
yes almost like what is that I was like
that's my legs anyway welcome back to my
channel guys this is going to be my
liquid lipstick or metallic lips or even
just lip cream declutter video so I'm
gonna be going through all of these I
think I have maybe about 30 of them
total which is probably the smallest
part of my lippy collection so we're
gonna start with this and just for a
little bit of background information my
preference for lipsticks has completely
changed or just lip products has
completely changed I'm no longer really
into this kind of stuff so I will
hopefully be able to declutter half or
even more of them so let's go ahead and
get started the first one I have here is
from Too Faced and this is the middle
I'm sorry
melted matte liquefied matte lipstick in
the shade if you saw my review on this
you know that I really did not like this
particular product but I wasn't able to
return it so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that I also have a whole lot
of the one of these called Too Faced and
melted liquefied long-wear lipsticks and
I just don't like this formulation
anymore I feel like they go bad before
I'm able to get into them I did already
toss the ones that have gone bad but I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter all of
these too my friend Haley who said she
wanted them I'm a little iffy with you
know actually passing on like eyeliners
and also mascaras and lip products in
general because the actual place where I
donate won't take lip products or
eyeliners or mascaras so most of these
are gonna go to my friends and then the
other ones I'm sure I'll find people to
take them but I also will probably have
to declutter and kind of toss out the
ones that have gone bad like completely
bad but none of these so far have gone
bad so this one right here is in melted
candy this is the strangest shade ever
you guys it is so so so overly like
bright pink it looks great if you have a
really deep skintone and the girl at
Ulta who was wearing this who talked me
into buying it had a gorgeous dark
complexion and it looked amazing on her
but for me it looks horrible I also have
let's see here melted berry which is
just a little berry shade and then I
also have chocolate milkshake like I
said all of these are going this one
right here is liquefied metallic
lipstick this one isn't melted peony
and then we also have this one which is
called melted metallic dream house I
always want to say dream horse I don't
know why let's see here we have three
yes three of the melted Chihuahua shades
which I know is a little excessive I
don't know why I have three of them but
I'm gonna give one - just one - Rochelle
one - Haley and then let's see here I
think that's it no but we have another
peony and this one is the large size in
the regular formulation so just not
really into those anymore so I'm going
to pass all of those along I do have
three of these Stila liquid lipsticks
and I will say I used to adore this
formulation even last year when I you
know reviewed them I thought they were
beautiful they came in a little set and
there's just three different shades here
the first one is called Rico and this is
what it looks like it is a beautiful
beautiful kind of like deep berry color
and then we also have beso which is a
gorgeous gorgeous red liquid lipstick I
have to keep that one and then we also
have the shade bussy and this is what it
looks like so I really enjoyed this
formulation I do feel like it is semi
uncomfortable but it's not the most
uncomfortable so anytime that I really
need to wear a lip product that will
last a knit like I'm not playing a
concert or practicing my that day I will
use these so I'm gonna keep those three
let's see here I have an Oprah what is
this long ring liquid lipstick right
here in the shade hip Noah and this is
from the mani mu a collaboration I do
have all three shades hypno charmed in
also Ares I have no idea where charmed
and Ares are so if I find them when I'm
going into like my next couple of videos
for lip stuff I will go ahead and show
them but yeah I have no idea where those
have gone but I love all of them will be
keeping all of them let me show you guys
a swatch of this because it's beautiful
this is a very like mousse-like
formulation so if you are into that
thank you would like this oh goodness I
should have just kept it kept it when I
went like that it just messed up this
watch but it's beautiful love the shade
will be keeping that alright a lipstick
formulation that I'm also really in love
with is the lime crime lip Velveteen
formulation I know that there is a lot
of issues surrounding the brand all I'm
gonna say is the is that I do purchase
like with PayPal anytime I'm on any
website so I personally have never had
any issues but I love this formulation
the first shade we have here is called
cement and this is a very very liquidy
formulation like you don't want to tip
the actual little container over when
you are
applying this because it is literally
like water so there is the shade cement
I think it's beautiful and these do dry
down very nice and very light on the
lips and then we have the shade Salem
upside-down Salem is a nice chocolatey
dark brown color we'll be keeping that
as well we also have cashmere which I
feel like looks really good on my skin
tone with my cool undertone so I'll be
keeping that and then I'll so the shade
riot and I also do you want to keep it
as that one alright moving on we have
one from Revlon here this is the ultra
HD matte lip color
I believe the shade is called nude or
honey it is not on here which really
bugs me but this particular formulation
reminds me a lot of the NARS Velvet lip
glides I don't know why but I just feel
like they're very very creamy not super
super opaque they do dry down matte but
not completely matte so I do like this
and I will be going ahead and holding on
to that I have two of these Sephora what
are these called exactly the Sephora
creme lip stain is one of them is in the
shade African violet and then the other
one is this deep purple eye I don't know
what it is about these I don't find them
very comfortable on the lips at all I
know the African violet is a very very
hyped up shade I don't think it looks
very good on my skin tone so I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter both of those
another thing I'm gonna do cutter is the
obsessive compulsive cosmetics lip tar
in the shade authentic if you guys watch
my video from two years ago or watched
my videos in general from two years ago
or wait was it two years like a year and
a half ago when I was living in New York
I used to have a huge collection of
these lip tars I liked them a lot I
actually felt like I could practice my
flute and have these on it they are
quite sticky but it was never like too
bothersome but I do think now I'm just
not that into them and I do notice that
you have to kind of shake them up once
in a while on this one's kind of it's
starting to separate I'm not into it
anymore so I'm gonna let that go all
right I do have a NYX liquid suede cream
lipstick here in the shade of passion
rose it is beautiful and very very
vibrant and bright but I'm gonna let it
go here we have these Sephora wonderful
cushion what is this called matte lip
cream I am obsessed with this these are
amazing I think these were limited
edition if the sheet is 0-3 wonderful
magenta and I just love how these look
on the lips it is so matched that I
almost blurs out the appearance of like
fine lines and wrinkles on your lips
I see that how it's like blurring it's
crazy I don't know what it is with this
formulation but these are beautiful so
I'm gonna keep that I am going to let go
of all my little Kat Von D liquid
lipsticks the first one I have here is
in the shade Suspiria which is a
beautiful kind of purply color I just
think that the Stila formulation is more
comfortable I also I'm gonna let go of
melancholia which is a nice light pink
shade again I just think the seal is not
comfortable and then this one I haven't
even opened it was a little like
500-point perk or like I don't even know
a code that you could type in this is
Lolita - I've never tried Lolita or
Lolita - I wish she would just come out
with like a lip oil in Lolita that would
be great um but I am going to get this -
my friend Rochelle she actually
requested when I was placing in order
that I picked that up for her so that's
gonna go to her I have two of these
color pop metallic lips right here these
are kind of recent purchases they're
very very beautiful in color but I'm
just gonna keep one of them I think and
I can't decide which one I want to keep
because one of the shades is very unique
this one right here is called flitter
and I don't know if you guys can see
that but it is like a gorgeous gorgeous
Goldy pinky color I have heard that you
a has something similar to this in a
very comfortable formulation so maybe I
should declutter that one and then I can
pick whatever this you a 1-up is does
that make sense I don't know but it's a
beautiful beautiful color you guys but I
do think this one is a little more thin
in consistency compared to the other
shade which is called zebra and zebra is
beautiful in color as well as kind of
like a rum raisin shade it's cool tone
is very nice you would think that I
would like these because they are very
air light and whipped but I don't know
what it is they still dry out my lips so
I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
keep flutter and I'm gonna get rid of
zebra kind of pains me because it's a
beautiful color but I have a lot of
other colors like this in my collection
so I may get rid of that one and then
keep this one moving on we have another
wet and wild liquid lipstick in the
shade
really bad formulation gonna go ahead a
tea cutter that and then we have this
one right here in the shade click on my
hyperlink horrible horrible formulation
on these they're just horrible let that
go all right I have a laura geller
luscious lips liquid lipstick right here
this is in a really nice kind of like
dusty light pink color the shade is
called peach buttercream and I'm just
gonna let it go it's not
think that I like that much I do have
the rimmel show-off lip lacquer in the
shade a big bang right here to show you
guys the reason I'm showing this in this
particular video is because I feel like
it wears like a liquid lipstick but it
looks the colossi so it is that lip
lacquer formulation my Vania Lev or what
does it call pop water glossy stain from
YSL is very similar in color and also
just inconsistency so I'm going to let
this one go I have this DLS matte
lipstick right here in a beautiful
beautiful red shade called phantom but
I'm gonna go ahead and let this go
because I'm keeping the Sela shade in
beso or miss Saul and then we have NYX
soft matte lip cream in the shade
Istanbul I'm going to keep this I do
enjoy this a lot so let's see here these
are all of the ones that I am going to
go ahead and declutter let's count them
out we have 1 2 3 4 23 24 I will
declutter and then I am going to keep
let's see here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
so I am going to keep 11 and then I am
going to declutter what did I just say
24 so I think that's pretty good
I did want to declutter half of them so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
