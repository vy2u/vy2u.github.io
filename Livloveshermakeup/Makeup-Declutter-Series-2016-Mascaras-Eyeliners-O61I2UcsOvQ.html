channel this video is going to be my
2016 declutter for my eyeliners and
mascaras before we even get into this I
do want to say if you do have like a
medium to larger sized collection like
me you probably know that sometimes like
items get misplaced in different drawers
so I'm pretty sure that I have even more
eyeliners and mascaras than this so what
I'm gonna do is anytime that you know
I'll be working my way through my Alex
series 9 drawer if I come across
anything that was in a different drawer
that and was supposed to be I will
include it in that video and I'll let
you guys know if I'm decluttering it but
there's already a few full-size mascaras
that I know are missing here and things
like that so I just wanted to tell you
guys but anyway I am here to share with
you guys obviously this declutter I was
originally going to post a different
video today on a different video I was
gonna post this one and then III and one
comparison video for you guys that's
actually gonna go up tomorrow with a
fall tag and then today I am going to
film this one and then another declutter
series after this so I hope you guys
enjoy that let's go ahead and get
started shall we
alright by the way before we get started
I'm sorry
here I go good I got my little stand
like for my actual camera it's like a
piece of it was tipping over so I'm
gonna have to find a way to actually get
it to like stand completely still and
things like that it was just I don't
know what happened with it like it was
the worst little tripod ever so I'm
gonna see if maybe I can order a
different one but we're just gonna hold
the camera for now so anyway let's get
started finally stop talking Olivia okay
I mean first item I have here is this
Hello Kitty Charmy Kohl eyeliner statue
this is like something I am obsessed
with every single time I travel as you
guys can see it has a bunch of different
eyeliners in here you have a nice dark
green and navy blue a purple and
aquamarine you have a brown a highlight
shade and a black and it's just perfect
for travel I love the packaging so I am
going to go ahead and keep that alright
moving on the next item I have here is
the super sizer fibers mascara from
covergirl I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter this because I just preferred
the original formulation over that one
the next item is the Econo Milano
emoticon emotion I can't even read that
emotive and allowed mascara I do not
like this I believe I got this in my
boxycharm box it's nothing special I'm
gonna go ahead and declutter it the next
item I'm also going to declutter is this
lorac Pro cream eyeliner I used to love
this the shade is called copper it's not
that it's not a good formulation it
really is
I just don't use it that often so I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of that I'm
also gonna get rid of this buxom mascara
this has like the most basic bitch name
ever it's called lash mascara that's it
it has a huge huge applicator and it's
much too hard to work with so I'm gonna
let that go
I'm also gonna let go of all of my aqua
extra large.i pencils her makeup forever
I thought that I really liked these when
I first got them I have a set of four of
them and unfortunately I'm just not into
them so I don't really know what
happened I have one over here as well so
these are just two different colors we
have like a bluish color and then this
nice minty color the bluish one is
called let's see here I twenty-four and
then the minty color is called m30 and I
don't know what it is I'm just not into
these so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter those I'm also going to
declutter this Mally ever color
starlight waterproof eyeliner this is a
good formulation I'm not gonna say it's
not I just don't reach for it so I'm
gonna go ahead and let that go I have a
bunch of these little mini Too Faced
better than sex mascara I have a full
size so I don't need any of those so all
of those are gonna go ahead and be a
deep cluttered alright I have this
little tart clay pot in the shade mint I
also have one in rose gold and I'm going
to go ahead and keep both of those I'm
also gonna hold on to this limited
edition Amazonian clay duo liner here
this is a cream eyeliner we have these
shades black and bronze really really
like this so I'm gonna hold on to that I
do have some other cream eyeliners and I
don't feel like I need tons of cream
eyeliners so I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of this one from Malley not get rid
of it but declutter it this is the ever
color waterproof plum eye shadow so I'm
gonna get rid of that I use it as an
eyeliner it's not good as a cream eye
shadow also I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of this wet and wild black eye liner
and also the BH Cosmetics eyeliner in
the shade below which is a beautiful hot
pink color alright I do have a full-size
of the benefit they're real mascara so
I'm gonna go ahead and let go of all the
little deluxe sized samples that I have
here I am going to keep those of my
Lancome Hypnose drama mascara zyyd or
those I'm also keeping my big Too Faced
better than sex mascara because this
isn't a current project pan and video I
will also be keeping my L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara it has a
really nice dinky wand I really enjoy
that I will be going ahead and
decluttering this Urban Decay heavy
metal glitter eyeliner in the shade
baked it's beautiful but I just don't
need it anymore alright I have the next
slide on glide on stay on and definitely
a turn on water
eyeliner in the shade black these are
very similar in formulation to the Urban
Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils in my
opinion so I'm going to keep that
speaking of Urban Decay pencils I have
quite a few here I will be keeping all
of them the first one is called bourbon
which is a nice brown right here we have
the shade faint which is a nice kind of
like dusty Bobby not dusty ma be dusty
kind of cobalt cobalt what am I saying
you guys it's been a long day already
it's like a dusty gray color ok we also
have vitiated glitter rock which is kind
of like a pinky Mavi color we also have
delirious which is a purple and also
these shade zero which is like an inky
black color right here this one right
here is called Roche again going to hold
on to that and then I also have two more
of the NYX
slide-on eye pencils in the shades dark
chocolate brown and also bronze one to
keep both of those I'm also gonna keep
this in ours audacious mascara I really
love the formulation on this really
enjoy that I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter the Estee edit to the edges or
the edgiest jewel side in mascara one
side is better than the other the volume
side is pretty darn weak the other side
like the length side is pretty good but
yeah not my favorite so I'm gonna go I
haven't to clutter that gonna declutter
all of my Tarte mascaras honestly I'm
not a fan I feel like Tarte mascaras
make my eyelashes fall out I don't know
why so I'm gonna get rid of the Tartus I
am going to go ahead and declutter the
Urban Decay perversion mascaras that I
haven't deluxe sizes because and they
are not opened and also I do have quite
a few full sizes of them and I don't
know where they are I'm guessing they're
in a different drawer but I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter all of those like
deluxe sizes and sample sizes
alright moving on I have this Smashbox
the lash primer so when I first reviewed
this I got this a new lash lash that to
last fashion from Sephora I didn't like
it but now I'm starting to like it a
little bit so I need to play with it a
little more gonna keep that I'm going to
go ahead and declutter the amplifi
mascara this is an amplifying mascara
serum I don't like this I don't like
these serums that have like the black
color to them I don't feel like they
work for my lashes so gonna do powder
that I have two mascaras here that are
quite similar the first is the wet and
wild max volume plus mascara and then
this one is from ELF this is the
volumizing and defining mascara so I'm
going to go ahead and let go of the elf
and I'm going to keep the wet and wild
since they are so similar
I have this mr. right now pencil this is
an eye pencil in the shade Jack I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of that it's a
good formulation but not as good as some
of my others I also have this NYC Kohl
eyeliner pencil in white I'm also going
to let go of that I have a few of these
Mally ever colored waterproof eyeliners
these are not bad okay it's just I never
reach for them I don't think that they
are up to par with the urban decay ones
or like the Smashbox one so I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of all three of these
the first shade I have is called auto
pilot violet I also have this hunter
green shade which is beautiful this one
is called green means go and then the
blue one is called Blue Streak so gonna
let go of all of those I'm also gonna
let go of this steal a sparkle
waterproof eyeliner it's a felt-tip
pencil you guys know I don't use
felt-tip pencils why I have this in my
collection I don't know the sheet is
called Bora Bora though and it is quite
pretty I'm going to let go of this elf
cream eyeliner in the shade black like I
said I'm going to keep the Tarte one so
no reason for me to have two of those
the Wet n Wild mega liner why I have
this I don't know can't use looks liquid
liner so I'm gonna go ahead and
declutter that this is a newly packaged
it is the Hikari eye pencil I get
recently got this in a subscription box
gonna go ahead and declutter that don't
even need to open it because I have so
many already and I have the Clinique
bottom lash mascara I'm going to keep
that two more tart mascaras here the
lights camera splashes horrible horrible
horrible like so hard to get off
decluttering that and then the gifted
mascara to also makes my eyelashes fall
out I wonder what it is about Tarte
mascaras that make my eyelashes fall out
alright moving on I do not like benefit
roller lash I've never thought this was
a very impressive mascara so I'm gonna
go ahead and let that go I do have the
extra lash sculpting mascara from Laura
Mercier which is one of my favorites I
love this and I am looking for the Duke
right now and it must be in a different
drawer because the dupe that I have is
absolutely wonderful it is from
Maybelline is the push-up drama so I
will show that in another video when I
find it like I said sometimes some of my
collection gets mixed up alright next I
have that this gel eyeliner here from
forever 21 it's really really good and I
kind of want to hold on to it but I
don't need it if I'm gonna have this
Tarte one with that dark bronzy color
well this one's kind of like a darker
brown guys can I keep it I'm gonna keep
it I'm gonna give it alright moving on
they're open Decay perversion mascara
like I said I have a full-size so I'll
toss that also the roller lash we're
gonna let go of that the blink jet-black
lash primer again don't know why I have
so many of these lash primers they do
not work for me so I'm gonna let go of
that I have this mtj high definition
mascara this doesn't do much for my
lashes it has a very cool wand but it
doesn't work for me so I'm gonna let go
of it I have a bunch of these Diorshow
mascara and primers these are so shitty
this is like the worst formulation ever
there's the over curl mascara then this
is the lash primer and this is this just
the Dior show these do not work for me
at all so all three of those are go
moving on I have the it cosmetics note
