today's video is going to be my first
installment in my makeup declutter
series for 2016 I have a few things that
I want to say before we get into this
video since this is kind of like the
intro and first video of this season
number one all of these items are 85% of
these items I should say are being
donated there is a women's shelter in my
area that helps women to get ready for
basically women who can't afford a lot
of makeup and things like that helps get
them ready for job settings going and
taking job interviews things like that
so thank you so much to all of you who
have taken interest in it maybe
purchasing some of these items from me
or just taking interest in maybe asking
if I would declutter my decluttered
items to you guys I really don't mind
you guys asking I just wanted to put
that out there right away please don't
please don't feel bad for asking I
totally I'm okay with that I know some
people think it's weird I'm totally okay
with it but I did want to tell you guys
that 85% of this is being donated I will
not be selling any of these products
that I am decluttering and I also wanted
to say 15% of it is going to be split
into three little boxes and I will be
giving that to my closest friends so
that is number one those are where these
items are going at number two I am
holding my camera right now now a few
days ago we kind of made a deal not a
deal but no like my channel you believe
the night we both kind of sat there and
we thought about what should i do how
should i film these kind of videos last
year I did it on camera and I would show
you guys every single item a few people
were asking can you point down and look
into your Alex series 9 drawers and then
I actually said what about like a you
know makeup graveyard setting where I'm
sitting on the floor and you guys see my
hands and I hold up you know product up
I show you swatches things like that a
lot of you agreed that that would be the
best option so I wanted to tell you guys
I do have a mini tripod coming in
tomorrow night so although I am holding
the camera for this particular video I
will not be doing that tomorrow or the
next day or for the rest of the
declutter series you guys will be able
to see both of my hands it will be in a
nice stable environment I know that I'm
a very shaky person so I'm not good with
this one-handed thing but you guys will
be able to see both of my hands and I'll
do swatches and things like that I
figured today it didn't really matter
anyway because we're starting at the top
of my Alex series 9 drawer I took all of
my primers and setting sprays out and
these are obviously clear so I'm not
gonna be doing any squatching but i did
want to tell you guys that is basically
what will be happening
and what else did I want to say I think
that's about it so anyway let's go ahead
and get into this video like I said we
are going through my primers and my
settings plays so let's get started the
first item that I have here is from
two-face this is the hangover RX
replenishing face primer this is
something that I currently have in my
project pan video I have already
finished it which is exciting so that is
obviously going to be kept because I
mean I finished it off already and I
want to show it in that video the next
item I have here I also will be keeping
this is the it cosmetics feel at the
moment
anti-aging ultra hydrating sensory
awakening a primer serum this is my
all-time favorite primer so I will be
holding on to this but there is one over
here from it cosmetics that I will be
letting go this is the it cosmetics
number 50 serum serum collagen veil
anti-aging primer this is very very
similar to a primer that I already have
in my collection from Wet n Wild and the
one from wet &amp;amp; wild is called the wet
and wild coverall primer and I actually
preferred this one over the it cosmetics
so I'm gonna go ahead and let go of the
it cosmetics and I am going to keep the
wet and wild alright moving on I have my
ELF setting spray this is just the
original one I will be going ahead and
keeping this I do like pretty much all
the setting sprays that I currently have
I finally finished off if you guys are
curious I finally finished off with
etosha dewy skin mess so that won't be
in here but yes finally finish that off
thank God alright so the next item I
will be letting go of and actually I'm
gonna pop into the trash this is the
Garnier 5 second blur it's just gone bad
so nobody's gonna have that we're gonna
put that in the trash pile the next item
I have here is the Becca backlight
priming filter this is another item that
I currently have in my project pan so
I'll be holding onto this
the next item I'm gonna let go this is
the Ofra silicone primer gel I really
just don't like this it's not something
that I really have been getting a lot of
use out of so like I said gonna let that
go the next item I have here is the NYX
matte finish long lasting setting spray
I love this definitely going to keep
this the next item I have here is
another matte finish setting spray this
is from ELF and I just really like
setting spray so I'm probably gonna be
holding on to most of those alright the
next item we have here is the NYX
honeydew me off this is a primer serum I
will be going ahead and letting this go
next I have this little Shishido
glow enhancing primer I will also be
going ahead and letting that go next
I have the NYC City proved 24-hour eye
base I will also be going ahead and
letting that go next I have the Too
Faced shadow insurance and this is a
24-hour anti-crease eyeshadow primer I
will be going ahead and letting that go
next I have the benefit Porefessional
Pro a balm to minimize the pores I'm
sure some people are gonna die when I
say this but I'm going to go ahead and
let it go now the reason why I am
letting that go is because I think that
this product is so much better and you
can get it at the drugstore this is the
L'Oreal magic perfecting base I feel
like this hides my pores way more than
the professional one does so I'm going
to keep this and like I said let go of
the professional I also do have a little
mini version here of the professionals
so gonna let that go as well and then I
do have two of these little primers here
these are from where these from cover FX
I'm gonna let go of both of these one is
a calming primer one is a mattifying I
don't need anything mattifying this time
of year and a calming primer I don't
really have that sensitive skin I do
have sensitive skin but it's not that
sensitive alright obviously I'm gonna
keep this since there's literally
probably like two uses left in here that
would be so shitty if I was like oh hey
yeah I'm decluttering this here you go
it's like what is that this is the
Korres Greek yogurt and nourishing
primer obviously going to hold on to
that I will be letting go of this Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion I just you
know it's not my favorite I really tend
to like drugstore eyeshadow primers you
guys you're gonna see that in a second
which here we'll talk about my all-time
favorites the Maybelline master prime
long-lasting eyeshadow base if you are
curious as to what is my all-time
favorite eyeshadow primer it is this one
the shade that I wear is called let's
see here 5:20 I believe it's 5:20 and I
just absolutely love this I really like
an eyeshadow primer that isn't too
sticky and tacky there is one that I
like that is like a high-end eyeshadow
primer that is tacky but for the most
part I really just like these nice
smooth ones so I will be keeping that I
also will be keeping my ELF eyelid
primer this is my second favorite so
yeah really really enjoy drugstore eye
primers alright moving on I have this
benefit stay don't stray this is a
eyeshadow primer again a little on the
sticky and tacky side and one of the
friends that I will be giving some of my
makeup to really loves this primer so
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter that on
to her alright moving on I have this
little Jean here doll this is called the
smooth affair brightening primer
go ahead and let that go I have this one
right here this is new to me basically
this is from amazing cosmetics it is the
line smoother plus primer this was sent
to me by amazing cosmetics I need to use
it a little more haven't really gotten
into it so I'm gonna keep that I have
about two uses left of this Bobbi Brown
extra enriched vitamin face base is that
what it's called no it's called
vitamin enriched face base it smells
like lemon pound cake it's so good I
love this stuff so I mean like I said I
only have like two years left so I'm
gonna obviously use that up I'm going to
go ahead and let go of the NYX eyeshadow
base in the shade white I just never
reach for this and I do think again I
have a friend who really likes to work
with like bright eyeshadows I think that
would be perfect for her I am going to
go ahead and keep this Tarte CC colored
clay eye primer I really do like eye
primer Stix I think they're really easy
to use and that NYC one unfortunately
like I said isn't really working for me
right now but I think the Tarte one is
so I'm gonna keep that I will be keeping
both of these little Revlon age-defying
wrinkle remedy line fillers I really
like these these are really nice they're
very similar to the amazing cosmetics
one so if you're looking for a dupe for
the amazing cosmetics I would recommend
checking out those Revlon's all right I
have three of these little Smashbox
primer oils and no reason for me to have
all these their oils they're gonna last
forever so I am going to go ahead and
let go of the two that are the most full
so I'm guessing ya chose two and then I
will keep this one for myself I do think
this is a nice product it's nice to you
know mix in a one or two drops into your
foundation get a little more of a glowy
effect or just use it as a primer but
like I said I don't need three alright I
recently picked up this pure mineral no
I'm sorry it's pure cosmetics hydrogel
lift this is basically an under eye and
also eyelid primer I really am NOT into
this it's a very very sticky and tacky
it was on sale so I'm not gonna go and
return it I just didn't I don't know I
don't think you can return it first of
all for the Ulta 21 days of beauty event
but also it really wasn't expensive so
I'm not interested in returning it but I
do have a friend that I think would
really enjoy that
alright moving on I have this Becca
backlight priming filter go ahead and
let that go I have the put a lid on it
from the bone this is an eyelid primer I
really do like this eyelid primer primer
eyelid primer is very easy to use so it
will be going ahead and keeping that
I am also going to keep this Napoleon
autopilot pre foundation skin primer
this is awesome it's like a moisturizing
gel I'm gonna let go this bareMinerals
well-rested face and eye brightener I
also am going to let go of this little
Smashbox pore minimizing photo finish
foundation primer I hate this stuff it
balls up so bad on my skin like it's
horrible I'm going to go ahead and keep
the YSL Touche cloud this is a beautiful
beautiful blurring primer really love
this I'm gonna keep that I am going to
go ahead and let go of the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer light
what else
the next dewy finish setting spray
another one that I really love that I am
going to go ahead and hold on to I'm
gonna go ahead and let go of this
bareMinerals five-in-one
eyelid primer this was just way too dark
for me so no point in holding on to that
I am going to go ahead and keep the Too
Faced shadow insurance glitter glue this
is probably the only high-end primer
that I really actually love I am going
to keep this milk makeup sunshine oil
it's kind of like the primer oil from
Smashbox but it isn't rollerball formula
so really nice for travel this is in a
current project pan it is the Smashbox
photo-finish hydrating under eye primer
I'm going to keep that I am also going
to keep these little cover FX radiance
drops kind of like again at the Smashbox
primer oil you just mix them in with
your foundation it does help to adhere
your foundation on all day I am also
going to keep the not benefit the balms
time bomb face primer I will be keeping
this a meet a makeup diamond heart base
this is in the illuminating soft focus
effect I love this primer I'm gonna let
go of this little Burberry sheer glow
and finally I have this that gal from
benefit to this is a brightening face
primer I'm gonna go ahead and keep that
so let's see how I did we have one item
we're gonna toss and then all of these
items I am going to go ahead and
declutter and then over here much bigger
prize much bigger primer much bigger
file over here so I feel like obviously
I kept on my studying sprays I really
don't have any setting sprays that I
don't love anymore I feel like I do
alternate them every single week the
only one I really didn't like was the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist but I
finally got through that so I feel like
this was a good a good amount
I feel like last year I did a little
better I did ultimately want to
declutter about half of this of the
whole entire thing I don't think I got
to half but I do feel like I got a
pretty decent amount so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for my mascara and eyeliner
declutter bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
