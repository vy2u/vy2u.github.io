this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new kathleenlights
highlighter palette this is the
collaboration with makeup geek or
Marlena and makeup Keith and
kathleenlights I love all three of them
I love the brands I love Marlena and I
love kathleenlights so I was super
excited to get this this is a $39
palette and you can pick it up right now
on the makeup geek comm website they did
say I'm shipping is going to be a little
slower just because this is in high
demand but currently it is in stock in
here you are getting three limited
edition highlighters in the shade
nightlights starlight and also sunlight
and if you guys are curious yes this is
$39 which may seem like a very steep
price for a highlighting palette from
makeup geek however each pan size has 7
grams of product and in total you get 21
grams of product so that's pretty darn
good it's not amazing usually
highlighters like separately are between
5 to 8 grams I have this new over one
that's 10 grams so you guys can see here
this is 10 grams each pan is 7 grams in
this particular palette although they do
look bigger I think it's just an
illusion from the actual palette because
it's so sleek and slender but I will say
this is still a pretty good deal now $39
you may be thinking is it better for me
to just go pick up the Jacqueline Hale
face collection palette or should I get
the Tarte rainforest so bc highlighting
palettes well those are like 3 or 4
dollars Moree the Tarte rainforests of
these seas around this particular price
range so I would say out of like all of
the other high ends like highlighting
palettes that are on the market this
probably isn't the first one that I
would pick but I still do think it is
worth the $39 and I still think it is a
very nice natural highlighting palette
to have in your collection so and this
is what the outer packaging looks like
you have this nice embossed kind of
pretty shimmery it's kind of like a
pinky purple e lilac color right there
and you turn it around you guys can see
it says makeup geek it does tell you all
three of the shades below and also says
kathleenlights or right there and this
is a pretty decent packaging I mean I
like the packaging because it's very
compact and sleek it reminds me of a
lorac Pro palette however what I don't
like is that for the price you know I
feel like we should have gotten a mirror
in here I'm someone who
stuff like this to travel with all the
time so I would prefer to have a mirror
in here but the actual pans look really
really humongous in this nice sleek
packaging which I think it's pretty they
do have a little bit of embossing on
there but once you rub your finger in
there and also your brush it does
dissipate but here are the three shades
I think all three shades are really
really nice this first one right here is
called sunlight we also have starlight
in the middle and then night lights
night light definitely has more golden
undertones it's very nice if you have
fair skin starlight is also very nice
especially if you do have a cool
undertone and then sunlight would be an
absolutely beautiful highlight on deeper
or darker skins well I would say that
this is quite good this is a very
interesting formulation when I dip my
finger in here it feels very much like a
powder but when I actually swatch it on
the back of my hand it kind of turns
into like a baked chalet formulation if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you know I love big Chalet
formulations I love like my Dior glowing
gardens highlight I love the Bobbi Brown
afternoon glow just those ones that are
super super highly like metallus eyes
they're really really nice and they
almost make your skin look like they're
wet I'm really into those highlighters
because I love the way that they sit on
the skin now even though these might
appear to like they look like they're
kind of like that they actually aren't
so they really are kind of like a powder
to almost like I don't want to say cream
finish because that's not what I'm going
for they're like a powder - there's like
a hybrid there like a powder - a base
gel a formulation so it looks like a
baked Soleil formulation even though
it's still a powder I really do think
they are nice but I will say you guys if
I use like a dense brush with these even
like a Sigma I'm tapered highlighter
brush or even just like my love see
tapered highlighter brush and I really
pack these on I just don't think this is
the kind of highlighting palette that
looks good really really built up on the
skin they're very shiny and pigmented
and they look quite nice on the skin but
I will say overall I just feel like they
really start to emphasize texture fine
lines wrinkles you guys know I have
combo skin I do get more oily during the
summer time and I tend to deal with a
lot more texture and just like
pigmentation just just kind of more
gritty skin during the summer time and I
just don't think that these look very
nice on my skin really layered and like
you know heavily built up they're not as
pigmented as you may think
here are the Becca
two highlights in the champagne
collection face palette we have
champagne pop and Prosecco pop I'm just
gonna swatch those next to these two
highlighters right here that I just
washed so you guys can see because I do
feel like the Beca highlighters
definitely have a little more umph to
them and they're definitely a little
more pigmented but I still feel like the
makeup geek ones are quite good so there
are the makeup geek and then there are
the Becca and it may not look like much
of a difference but I do feel like the
Becca ones have more pigment to them now
and it's not necessarily a good thing
when highlighting palettes have too much
pigment because again they can tend to
look a little textured on the skin but I
just find it kind of strange that
although these do feel very very
textured and heavy in the pan they
really do thin out on the skin but they
still emphasize fine lines and wrinkles
so I'm only 24 years old I don't have
tons and tons of fine lines and wrinkles
but I really do feel like if I build any
of these particular highlighters up on
my skin I really do feel like they start
to ball up and I can see a difference
between where I put the highlight and
where my skin is so I think what you
need to do if you want to get this
palette is use a really nice kind of
fluffy brush like a nice fan brush or
even the Real Techniques setting brush
and just lightly dust it where you want
a delight to hit it looks absolutely
beautiful and incredible when you just
use a small amount so that is my
recommendation with this particular
palette as far as I'm aware time is
concerns that these aren't super super
like I don't know they don't wear on the
skin all day is what I'm trying to say I
would give them a good eight to ten
hours I have been wearing this
particular shade right here which is
night light I've been wearing that for
what almost like 14 to 16 hours now and
I do feel like it has started to wear
off of my skin and I also feel like my
skin just looks a little more gritty
because like I said I do think that
these do emphasize a little bit of
texture throughout the day however I do
want to say if you wear a really nice
kind of primer if you're wearing
something that has like a little bit of
DeMatha cone or like a smoothing primer
or something that's a little more
hydrating I feel like these do go onto
the skin a little nicer that if you're
using something like a mattifying primer
so overall us like we're time staying
power is kind of okay it's not like
amazing but still eight to ten hours is
pretty much like your whole workday so
it's pretty good but your pigmentation
is solid it's not as pigmented as I
thought it was going to be but this is
beautiful when you use it with a
and with like a fan brush it looks like
the disc gorgeous like lit with lit from
within sort of glow basically cannot
speak lit from within sort of glow and I
really think it's absolutely stunning on
the skin so I do like this I think this
is more like of a natural highlighting
palette and I actually really really
enjoy it so yeah I'm very very happy
that I got that so let me go ahead and
do some swatches for you guys the first
shape that we have here like I said is
that beautiful kind of coppery bronzer
shade and this one is called starlight
there it is swatched on the back of my
hand beautiful kind of bronzy color
would be absolutely stunning on really
deep skin tones as a highlight the next
shape we have is starlight which is that
beautiful kind of pinky purpley color it
kind of reminds me of AA Nastasia
Beverly Hills
sassy grape just a little bit it's
definitely got a little more pink in it
it then purple but it's still beautiful
and I want you guys to be able to see
can you see that it looks like one with
the skin however it's almost like you
can see my skin through it that's
because the pigment level isn't
completely like insane and then the last
one is that beautiful golden color and I
wish that they had done maybe another
one that was a little lighter but I
still like these shades and this one is
a night light so there are the three of
them us two washed together very very
pretty don't get me wrong I think they
are beautiful and I think if you use a
light hand with them they are really
gorgeous now just for a comparison I'm
gonna swatch this new over a Rodeo Drive
highlight next to them so you guys
really can see what like the
pigmentation looks like so there is the
Oprah one I don't even know if you guys
can see that there's the Oprah and then
there are the makeup geeks they're just
a little more sheer but they're still
really really beautiful on the skin here
is the laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator and gilded honey next to
them again
more like pigmented in my opinion just a
little more pigment but just as shiny
these are just a little more sheer again
and then I'll do one more time champagne
pop so you guys can kind of see and then
there is a champagne pop at the bottom
so although they are a little more sheer
they're still beautiful very very light
reflected and really pretty on the skin
as long as you use a light hand so
overall I would give them I would say 3
out of 5 stars still a really good
palette I'm definitely going to keep
mine and yeah I hope this review and
swatches is helpful thank you so much
for joining me guys and I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
