thank you for joining me today I have a
makeup haul from Mac and also sephora
that I wanted to go through with you
guys and also I have my little baby
wipes here i'm going to go ahead and
watch this stuff because i literally
just got it i have nots watched any of
them I'm the only thing that I have seen
the color up is the foundation because I
had it color match to my skin but other
than that i'm going to swatch through
them with you guys and guess we'll see
what kind of colors and fun makeup pics
i picked up so anyway let's just get
started the reason um or I guess yeah
we'll start with mac and the reason I
went to map was because I really really
wanted to be color matched in their
foundation I know that each foundation
has a different light color matching
system but lately I have been getting a
lot of foundations whether they be
drugstore right at sephora that ended up
just not matching my skin tone so I
thought you know what I'm going to go
ahead and purchase one from Mac so I
decided to try out the studio sculpt SPF
15 foundation it comes in a box like
this and I was color matched to the
shade NC 15 which i believe is like a
cool a cooler tone so I did think that
my skin tone was a little more cool I do
use like a tone correcting powder to set
my foundation and it is in the shade
cool and it seems like cool shades just
tend to look better on me so I do think
my undertone is cool I used to think it
was born but now I think it's cool and
the guy who nationally at Mac definitely
said that um I was a cool undertone so
anyway this is the studio sculpt SPF 15
foundation in NC 15 like I said and it
really really matched nicely to my neck
he took a little bit of my foundation
off right there you guys can probably
see the foundation i'm wearing right now
is too dark for me so he put a little
right there and it really matched my
neck really nicely so hopefully this
will be good i know a lot of people say
that mac foundations make them break out
like i said i've never actually tried a
mac foundation so i don't know i was
always scared to try in that foundation
because i was nervous that it would make
me break out because a lot of people do
break out but again it's one of those
things you just need to try it for
yourself first
and I was just you know you can get
samples but I took the plunge and just
purchased an actual full size of the
foundation but again it's all about
different types of skin just because
your oily or like acne prone doesn't
mean you're going to break out um but
you could so just something to be aware
of so anyway I picked up that foundation
and the next thing I picked up for Mac
was the sheer tone shimmer blush in Sun
bask it's like this really nice like
bronzy beautiful blush color looks like
this really really really pretty it's
got lots and lots of shimmer in it and
I'll swatch it for you guys I just think
it's gorgeous can you see that I know it
looks really really deep but I just
think it would be beautiful for summer
even on my skin tone which is very very
fair anyway that Sun baskets got that
nice like gold undertone in there I
think it's absolutely beautiful so I'm
really really excited to try out that
blush um and just so you guys know um I
have tried out like I shadows and
blushes from Mac I have a few products
like that but I just hadn't tried any of
their face products out so that's why
I'm new to like the foundation however I
do like their eyeshadows and their
blushes and things like that so next I
got an eyeshadow this is a flux pearl in
all that glitters this is a really
popular shade and I just never picked it
up i'm not quite sure why but it's just
a really really beautiful um shade is
kind of like pinky with lots and lots of
shimmer really really nice really nice
colors I really liked that little fuzz
there let me swatch it for you guys so
that's what it looks like on my finger
and then it's watches like that so I
think that would be really really pretty
paired with Sun bask on the cheek so
we'll see about that one all that
glitters um like I said it's a Biloxi
pearl and next I got another eye shadow
and this one is actually a lust
and it's called mythology and I just
thought that this and all that glitters
would be really pretty they'd be like a
just to shadow kind of look you could
put all the glitters on your lid and
then blend this color mythology into
your crease it's a luster and it kind of
got those pink undertones but it's
almost on the verge of being a little
more like bronzy so I thought that you
know some Basque all the glitters and
this pair together would be like
beautiful like a beautiful look all over
so that is mythology it's really nice
like rose gold and that's what that one
looks like swatched so definitely
thought that that and all the glitters
would look beautiful together as a kind
of to shadow look you know and that's
just really fast and easy and then of
course son backs would be beautiful on
the cheeks with it so definitely looking
forward to trying that out and the last
thing I picked up from Mac also in the
kind of Rosie gold um tone coloring I
picked up the mac pigment in Rose it's
absolutely gorgeous it's got tons and
tons of like a rose color with tons and
tons of gold shimmer in it so I do want
to swatch this I'm kind of nervous oh my
gosh oh I don't want it spilling out all
over but I will take a little bit of it
let's get a little bit out of the cap
it's so beautiful and the girl was
telling me you could use this like on
your eyes you can use it as they
highlight like on your cheek and I was
just like oh my god like I'm so excited
I can't I just can't even I just think
it's so beautiful it's like the epitome
of rose and gold combined so that is the
Rose pigment isn't that gorgeous oh my
god can you imagine that on the lid or
even as a highlight like it's too much
it's too beautiful but um really really
excited for that one they had all their
little pigments at the front when you
were checking out and I was like oh I
have to get this so anyway that is the
mac Rose pigment and that's what I
picked up at math
guys spend around a hundred dollars but
I feel like I got five things one of
them was you know full-size foundation
so that was pretty darn good so let's
continue on to the things I picked up at
sephora i got another one of my one of
my top three favorite mascaras this is
the sephora outrageous curl mascara I've
gone through a few tubes of this I love
this this is one of my favorite mascaras
out of the you know my top three
favorite mascaras are two-faced better
than sex benefit they're real and
outrageous curl from sephora i love the
wand it's really really tiny and it just
allows you to get in everywhere that you
need to get into the inner corner is
just everywhere it's really really great
and it's such a tiny little wand and
it's rubber and i really like rubber
ones i just find that those really
really work well for my eyelashes so it
says dramatic volume and curved mascara
and it really really does hold a curl
very well so this color is just the only
one they have I think they only have one
which is black so really really love
this mascara I also picked up the tart
high performance neutrals or natural
sorry Amazonian clay 12-hour blush in
exposed I have a few of these blushes
like I have a few over here I have let's
see here pampered and likes a bird and
maybe a few more in my collection
somewhere um but I really like the tart
blushes I think they're really really
beautiful and the Amazonian clay formula
really does stay on the cheeks all day
and this isn't exposed which is one of
those really neutral blushes but
everybody talks about it and I guess
it's flattering on every skin tone so I
really thought I should pick it up
that's the color and I know it looks
kind of boring in the pan but everybody
raves about this saying you can pair it
with any I look anything so there it is
swatched on my finger put it on to my
skin so really really like neutral just
not like super overstated its really
kind of an understated blush however you
still need you know at least for someone
like me I still need a little color on
my face during the day and if I'm doing
a really dramatic I
lots of color or something I never can
find really a blush that will go
completely with this one but I mean up
blush that will go completely with like
a colorful I look so I thought that this
would be nice it kind of reminds me up
I'm going to grab this milani rose baked
blush this is in another really nice
understated blush this is in romantic
rose it kind of looks similar to that
it's a little lighter but those are two
really really nice understated blushes
that you can pair with any kind of
colorful I look at just looks really
good so picked that up I also picked up
the Korres or coors I'm not quite sure
um how you pronounce it chorus or korres
lip butter in jasmine I've heard a lot
of good things about these lip butters I
can't remember if this is like an actual
like we're at at nighttime kind of lip
butter or if it's tinted I think it
might be a little tinted because they
had different colors on there that had
like actual color to them so I'm just
gonna swatch this and feels really nice
feels like a little jelly um actually I
don't think it has really a lot of color
to it which is actually what I was
hoping for I'm hoping just to wear this
um at nighttime it does smell nice smell
slightly of jasmine which is really nice
kind of sweet and it seems like it has a
really nice texture I'm always just
looking for nice like lip balms or
treatments so I'll probably wear this at
night it doesn't look like it has too
much color to it so definitely like that
but I guess you could wear it during the
day maybe have a little bit of a tint
like a little bit of a new tint on your
lips but that is the lip butter from
Korres or coors and jasmine and let's
see here is that no I have one more
thing from Sephora and that is the Kevin
up wand sensual skin enhancer the
sensual skin cancer I'm kind of confused
by this product I see people rave about
it all the time on the Sephora website
and i'm not sure how you use it if you
know please tell me you guys are
probably thinking oh my gosh Olivia you
bought something that you don't
you know how to use well yes i did
because everybody race about it my color
is s times 0 to s 0 to which i think is
their lightest shade with pink underdogs
but anyway this is like a cream product
and on that the support is to say on the
back it says cream makeup / concealer so
i'm pretty sure can be a foundation or
concealer but it comes in such a tiny
little pod I thought the pot was gonna
be much bigger honestly but it comes in
such a tiny little pot that it makes me
think it should be like a concealer but
oh man this stuff is really pigmented
this goes a long way you probably could
use this as foundation actually but um
it's just really really creamy and like
the lights on like butter so goodness I
don't even know like that may be too
heavy to wear as a foundation I guess if
you use a really small amount you could
try it out maybe with a Beauty Blender I
don't know i'll have to see but it will
be a beautiful concealer it's so creamy
and it's gorgeous and it is a pretty
good color match this is like i said so2
this is with the pink undertones so
something to look into but if you know
exactly how to use this or if you use it
for a specific use please let me know
below because it's one of those products
that i'm kind of troubled about like
what concealer or foundation you know
everybody talks about on the support
website people are like oh i use it as
this or that or like everybody uses a
different way so let me know is it just
one of those all in one kind of products
like you can use it as a foundation or
concealer or a highlight or whatever you
really want i'm not quite sure i'll have
to try it out a few different ways but
anyway so yeah that is the sensual skin
enhancer from kemah no quon in s x 0 to
s times 02 and then let's get on to the
samples because they sent me a bunch i
got syntovox by the way so i'm one of my
hundred point perks i got this sephora
colorful glitter eyeshadow in a croco
punch kuroko punch left oh really really
pretty like that let's watch it pretty
chunky but very very pretty
I like can see that nice pretty perfect
for summer I think that's still one of
their 100-point perks right now so if
you're interested in a really nice
bright blue eyeshadow for summer I
definitely pick that up as one of your
perks um and then they sent me doubles I
don't know I know I mentioned this in
every video but they always send me
doubles when I order like for online i
get like my three samples and they
always send me double up everything for
whatever reason anyway so i got the
bobby brown hydrating eye cream I got
two of the belief honesty honesty
naturality efficiency herbal traditions
modern Korean skincare science and this
is like a what is this the true cream
aqua bomb increased hydration level so
I'm guessing it's like a moisturizer
nice little sample there I got two of
the clinic one two three step systems
the cleanser exfoliating toner and the
moisturizer um I got two little packets
that sent from your hearts to hers it's
like those little scent things that they
send you those little packets filled
with little cards send cards and then I
got to be gifts you sail along saying
the one YSL whatever um what is this
this is the did you know radiance comes
in multiple shades touchÃ© Ã©clat in
available of 12 shades so uh yeah
hopefully one of these shades matches me
and then the clinic beyond flawless
foundation with concealer inside of
course it's not in my shade it's in 24
golden but that's still a nice way to
test it on your arm and see what the
formulas like and then also the
universal face primer and another one of
the Bobby Brown hydrating eye creams so
that is what i got from sephora and mac
i hope you guys enjoyed this little haul
if you did give this video a thumbs up
and I'll see you
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
