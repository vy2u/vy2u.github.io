my channel today I am here to share with
you guys a makeup I regret not buying
part one and this is going to be all
about palettes that I regret not
purchasing now this was a series that
was created by my friend Samantha March
here on YouTube I'll go ahead and link
both her videos as well as her channel
down below in the description bar you
guys know we recently collapsed together
I love her channel I love the content
that she comes up with so full credit to
her she did come up with this idea I
thought it was really genius because we
all have those products that we really
do what regret and not fine so let's go
ahead and jump right into it before I do
it let me answer a few questions yes I
am filming on the DSLR today every time
I film on this camera I get questions
about what it is this is a Canon Rebel
t5 I have had this camera for about six
to eight months and people are always
like why the don't you film on this
for every video so in this particular
camera DSLRs in general I do have
difficulty with filming over the
10-minute mark that's why I go back and
forth between my camcorder but if you
are new to my channel yes I do have a
good quality camera
I just don't film on it all the time but
I figure now that I unpacked it I should
go ahead and film on it for my videos
that are under the 10 minute mark so
let's jump right into the video guys we
are going to start with the honest
awesome Beverly Hills self made a
palette every time I look at this I'm
like why did I buy this you guys
it's so beautiful you have that shade
pink champagne which looks gorgeous and
I remember thinking when I looked at
that the first time I was like that has
to be like a chunky glittery mask it's
not at all every single person that uses
that just looks amazing on the eyes it
has like a deep purple shade you have
the self-made shade which is like a
gorgeous army green color you have the
this beautiful like block some shade
spirit rock all of them look amazing
they're cool tone shades which I totally
love I cannot believe I did not pick up
this palette today I do have on the
modern renaissance palette on my eyes
and I will be going ahead and reviewing
for you guys the subculture palette in a
couple of days I need just a few more
days with it but yeah I think that this
is the absolutely gorgeous palette and I
really regret not purchasing it I just
wasn't on time it's sold out and it was
a limited edition I was pissed off so I
really like that one Nastasia Beverly
Hills is now doing a lot of like
permanent palettes I believe this
subculture is permanent I know and
that's in the modern Renaissance's so I
appreciate when they do that because
these limited-edition palettes I did not
get my hands on alright the next one is
the dose of colors I
scream of Hallett now Samantha also had
this in her first video that she did
it's just so beautiful and I've heard
such good things about the dose of color
eyeshadows they are more of like a
cruelty-free indie brand and I would
love to try some products out from them
so this was just something I missed out
on it that beautiful bubblegum shade and
that mint chip shade oh my god I'm so
pissed I didn't pick this off you guys
it also has some neutrals but I felt
like this was the perfect palette with
the perfect amount of pops of color in
it so really really disappointed I did
not get that now the next one is
probably the reason why I wanted to do
this video it's the Kat Von D me vida
loca palette palette looked amazing and
is the second and that I didn't pick it
up I was like oh my god because I
started seeing reviews of it on YouTube
this was from holiday 2016 last year or
wasn't 2015 I might have even been 2015
you know what it was it was holiday 2015
I said I don't need it I'm not gonna get
it people started doing reviews and
swatches and I was like suck I need it I
jumped on the website it was gone it was
gone just like the metal matte palette
which is why I did not pass up on the
metal matte palette when it came in
stock last year you guys honestly Kat
Von D comes out with some awesome
holiday collections if you see an
eyeshadow palette from her the draws
your attention get it okay do
not be like me because I have always
regretted not picking this up it has
shimmers that have matte it had
basically like six little colors of
neutrals in the middle and then the
whole like rainbow all around it I ended
up actually picking up the Urban Decay
full spectrum palette but the
pigmentation is not as good the swatches
don't look as good at this seems like my
biggest regret as far as makeup is
concerned for sure alright the next one
is that the Marc Jacobs holiday palette
from last year this was the eyeshadow
palette I believe it retails for $19
which is why I skipped on it I just was
like I cannot justify a $90 I shadow
palette I think the highest I've gone
for an eyeshadow palette has been in the
60 or 65 dollar range so this looks
beautiful it had cool tones on one side
and warm tones on the other it was just
one of those things that I didn't pick
up and I really really do regret it you
guys because I have not tried at the
Marc Jacobs formula and they are cruelty
free there are beauty products are there
perfumes are not but their beauty brand
is so I'm very interested in seeing what
they release this year for the holiday
season
and I really want to go ahead and pick
up an eyeshadow palette and give a
review for you guys so I thought that
that would have been the perfect color
for me honestly it's just a bunch of
neutrals but when I look at it the cool
tone side I would have really loved
those purples alright the next one we
have here is the holiday 2015 a palette
for hourglass so hourglass releases the
palette every single year I got to the
you know what this might have been the
2014 I'm getting my dates confused so I
got the 2016 I got the 2015 this was the
2014 okay
it had three different blushes in it it
was called the ambient blush trio and I
always regret not picking this up now I
do have pretty much all of these colors
now in other palettes but this was
something that I just thought was so
beautiful it was a little on the
expensive side but it wasn't like $80
expensive like their new holiday
palettes are so that was something I
really regret not getting I love the
ambient lighting formula for their
powders or blushes their high lers
everything so that's definitely
something I regret not getting and
finally guys having products here from
Too Faced which is kind of interesting
now I remember seeing Emily Noelle 83
saying this was one of the best to face
palette she had ever gotten this is the
Vegas nay palette now I have no idea who
Vegas name is I still don't know who
that is
um no shade like I just don't know who
that is and because I didn't know who it
was I didn't pick the palette up it also
looks so neutral same colors that you
know every Too Faced palette is but yeah
and we know well 83 said these were so
blendable and so beautiful in this same
formula as the chocolate bar palette so
I kind of regret not getting that as
well so anyway guys those are some
makeup palettes I regret not purchasing
it let me know if you have any products
that you regret not purchasing down
below also let me know if you would like
me to do a part to you where I talk
about other products and knots and felt
like are not palette related but yeah
that's pretty much it again go check out
something up this channel she is the
creator of this and yeah I guess I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
