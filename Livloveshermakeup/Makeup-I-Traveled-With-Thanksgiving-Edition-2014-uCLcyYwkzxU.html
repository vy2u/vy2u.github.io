I wanted to do a quick video on the
makeup I used when I traveled for
thanksgiving break I thought this would
be interesting I've never seen any of
these videos on YouTube I'm sure people
have made them that seems like something
I'd be interested in interesting in
looking at but i just wanted to show you
guys the makeup that I traveled with for
thanksgiving and let's get started so i
ended up using this little handy dandy
bag that i got from sephora and what
happens is it actually opens up here so
you unhook it down here and then it
opens into several compartments like
this and then you can just hang it on
the back of your bathroom door which is
what I ended up doing so everything is
really really nice and secure and also
everything come velcroed so that is
really really really nice to have so I
thought I'd just go through them one by
one I will unveil pro them and then show
them to you guys i hope that this is
interesting I just thought you know it's
kind of a fun video it's nice to know
what people take with them I'm always
curious do people take samples with them
do they travel with their best pallets
or do they want to try different
palettes while they're away so um i will
show you guys when i travel bit so the
top bag right here the belt road one
that says toiletries i actually used for
my makeup brushes and I packed them in a
ziploc bag like this so they wouldn't
get all dirty and the ones that I packed
were the let's see here I'm ecotools
this is like they're finishing brush and
then I also packed the equal tools um
kabuki brush which I use almost every
single day I also attacked my Real
Techniques what is this the expert faith
face brush for my foundation and I also
packed my eyelash curler of course I
one of the elf blush brushes which i
really be loved I packed this thing
which actually ended up breaking off um
not when i was there but before this is
part of a brush from dresslink.com and i
have said in many many videos i like to
use these just to blend in my foundation
into my hairline and it broke off from
the actual you know like stick part of
the bush I know this is the Pharaoh
ballistic bar called I'm not quite sure
but I broke off from that so I am
planning on super gluing it back
together but I use that anyway it was
totally fine um for I brushes let's see
i bought brought the sigma tapered
blending 840 that's always a good one
have I also brought um let's see he's
the real techniques by Samantha Chapman
watch it what is this this is like
they're setting brush this is for
highlighting I brought that I also
brought a spoolie from my eyebrows and
and then I brought two more things I
brought a elf professional I priests
brush from my lower lash line and then I
also brought from my crease the Sigma
tapered blending e35 brush so those are
the brushes I brought and I kept those
in the top little compartment and it was
really nice none of them were too heavy
nothing and velcroed everything stayed
in place and I definitely recommend
using a plastic bag when you are
traveling with your brushes could they
get dirty so quickly and they can get
everything else super super dirty so
anyway that was really nice I did like
um bringing those brushes I thought I
had one for everything and it was super
easy and I was very happy with that so
the next thing I had this was called I
so this was the I stuff that I brought
with me as an eyeliner
pallets and I did end up bringing the to
face the return of sexy power I think I
told you guys I was going to bring this
after I hauled it I fell in love with
the colors unfortunately the mirror it's
kind of like sliding in and out this was
not good to travel with next time I will
definitely bring something like my lorac
pro or you know something a little
thinner this packaging is just a bit too
bulky for the kind of traveling i was
doing i would just had everything in a
very small suitcase I was only gone for
a few days and so this just did not
really hold up very well now none of the
shadows actually broke which is a
miracle but I will not travel with this
again although I do absolutely adore and
love this palette so will not travel
with this a little too chunky but no I
wanted to try it out the next thing I
brought was the cargo liquid eyeliner
just for my top lashes never actually
got to using this so but it's always
nice to have a liquid liner with you I
brought two samples of mascaras um let's
see here I've got these 2401 which is
the outrageous curl dramatic volume in
kirov mascara which is an amazing
mascara by the way but let me tell you I
cannot get this off of my eyelid like
under I eyelids nothing will remove this
the next day I always have extra residue
and it's just so hard to remove so I
kind of don't like it for that reason
but it really is a good formula and it
really does give lots of volume and
length so I do like that and I like
bringing little tiny I have a lot of
these you know you get these from
Sephora 100-point perks or whatever
these are nice to travel with instead of
bringing a huge tube of mascara and the
second one I brought was the clinic lash
power feathering mascara that's the one
I'm wearing today I flew in today so I
wore very very light makeup I don't like
to go too heavy when I'm on the airplane
so this was a really nice one and I was
happy with it I did not get to use those
up unfortunately but they're great for
travel um the next thing I brought I
brought two eyeliner these are my
favorite eyeliner as the 24-7 glide on
pencils from urban decay I this is just
my favorite formula for my waterline I
will not put any other eye liner in my
waterline because it just smudges so I
brought them in the color bourbon and
Roach which are brown colors so really
really like those they work very well
and then I brought one a white eyeliner
or like yellowish eyeliner this is the
Laura Geller icare waterproof eyeliner I
brightener and I think sometimes it's
nice to have that fresh look to your
eyes so I brought that so that is what I
brought for the I compartment the next
little compartment in here is the space
one and it looks like this and this one
was definitely the heaviest I brought
the most I think it's because of the
blush palette I brought so let me just
start I brought my ELF tone correcting
powder and cool and I love this powder
that I used this to set my foundation
basically every single day so I just
brought that for a setting my powder and
then I brought my L'Oreal visible lift
blur foundation I've been liking this a
lot I used to hate this product I used
to hate it but when the weather changed
over and my skin started to get a little
more dry than oily I started to love it
so definitely a keeper and it was really
nice to have on the trip and then I just
brought one concealer I brought the
l'oreal true match this is in warm 1 2 3
yes so this was nice I think it's nice
to bring just one foundation one
concealer something you know that works
well with your skin and that you can get
you know the look that you want with it
and then the last thing in here well not
the last thing but I brought my
Amazonian clay what is this the blush
palette I just thought this was going to
be the easiest way to get all the
blushes that I wanted for the week I'm
probably going to bring this again when
I travel for Christmas it's just the
easiest
way to get all of those blushes and
instead of having to pack them in one by
one so I was really happy with that it
did kind of stuff up this pouch a little
bit but it didn't break it's great
sturdy packaging and you get every
single blush eight you really could want
so it's definitely worth it I brought
one little highlighter with me this is
the GlossyBox highlighter in Kashmir I
had never used this I thought what the
heck I might as well try it it was
beautiful it is a like kind of tacky
formula which I'm not a huge fan of it
kind of actually got rid of the
foundation on my nose when I used it
there but on my cheekbones was really
beautiful and on my chin it was too so I
did like that but i guess i really only
want to use it on certain areas but I
want to try you know highlight that I
hadn't used before yet and then I also
brought this lashem picture-perfect
instant wrinkle reducer I thought I
could use this kind of as a primer in
this area and around my eyes and I did
like this i saw that i really didn't
have any creasing when i was using this
so i was gonna be with that so that was
my little face um my little face bag
that I brought with me and then the last
couch on here is for lips and it was the
smallest one nothing really in there
because I brought the buxom glasses and
this is from the serial kisser I did a
review on it it's the buxom serial
kisser little lip set and you get six of
these or I'm sorry five of these
full-bodied lipsticks and basically any
shade that you could dream of and that
you would want for like holidays so you
get like a nice purple color you get a
nice red color you get a nice plummy
color you get a nice pink color and then
you also get a nice like a neutral color
so those were perfect I will definitely
bring these again they're perfect sized
I think that they just you know worked
with
well for this situation and I was very
very happy with them I used I think that
most all of them so i was very happy
with that i think that because they're
so portable and small it just was the
way to go so anyway that is the makeup I
traveled with for Thanksgiving 2014 I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I would
love if you would also share what you
traveled with for thanksgiving i think
this could be really interesting to see
um i'm curious about what people used
for like you know perfumes things like
that I brought samples of perfumes with
me um and that works out really well and
I'm always curious to see what kind of
eye palette people bring and if they
bring you know something fragile does it
break you know all that kind of stuff so
anyway I thought that he'd be
interesting if other people could do
this video too so I take all of you a
gas line so this is a really a tag video
but I would love for all of you to go
ahead and do this video if you did
travel over thanksgiving and let me know
what you guys brought with you so i will
see you in my next video thanks so much
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
