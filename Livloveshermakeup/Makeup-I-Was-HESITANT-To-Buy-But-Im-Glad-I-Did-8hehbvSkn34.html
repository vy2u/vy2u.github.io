channel so about a week ago I did a
video all about makeup products I'm so
glad I did not buy and in that video a
lot of you were requesting that I do a
video talking about makeup products I
was hesitant to buy but I'm glad I did
so that's what we're doing today let's
go ahead and jump right into it I want
to start with the Smashbox Studios skin
15 our rare hydrating foundation machine
I wear is one point one which is a
little too dark for me but it still does
work when I am self tan I love this
foundation and I was very hesitant to
purchase it because I did not believe
that a foundation could have such a long
wear time but at the same time be
hydrating on the skin but boy was I
wrong this is literally worth every
penny
it has quickly become one of my all-time
favorite foundations it is beautiful on
the skin especially if you do have dry
skin and I've also heard from a lot of
you that you have combo an oily skin
that you do enjoyed this as well if you
do have more combo oily skin I would
just recommend you set it in with a
powder
I still do set in my t-zone with a
powder when I use this just to make sure
it doesn't break up in those areas
especially around my nose but yeah this
truly does last 15 hours on the skin you
guys I mean I work some very long work
hours sometimes and let me tell you this
really does hang in there so I love that
foundation right there and even though I
really was hesitant to purchase it I am
happy I did and next up we have the
Ordinaries high adherence silicone
primer this retails for four dollars and
ninety cents on the Sephora comm website
and I hate to say this but yes I was
very skeptical because of the price but
if this performs like a high-end primer
in my opinion actually it's kind of like
a mixture of a moisturizer as well as a
silicone blurring primer so if you like
the thought of that and if you do have
dry skin or normal skin I think you
would really really enjoy this it
doesn't have that sort of silicone
texture to the point where it's like the
professional where it's just going to
mattify your skin it doesn't do that and
I feel like that's really nice if you do
have dry skin because you know and the
primers like that actually just start to
lift up on your skin and actually
emphasize even more dryness so and this
is a really really nice combo of Hydra
hydrating properties as well as silicone
based kind of blurring properties I
really do enjoy this and I would
absolutely repurchase it up next we have
the color pop yes yes please Fallon
this is what it looks like I did not
believe the hype when I first saw
there's so many people were saying oh my
god this formula is amazing it's just
like that Natasha didn't own a sunset
palette as far as colors are concerned
and I really did not think for like the
$15 price market that this could be as
good as it is but you guys can see I use
this out of this palette and that's
coming from someone who doesn't even
love warm toned shadows all that much
but I get so much use out of this
especially these two colors right here
the kind of burgundy matte as well as
the orange matte the mats are stunning
in this palette they are
incredible you get so much bang for your
buck would highly recommend it you guys
look into the pressure palettes from
colour-pop specifically the yesplease
palette
are we moving on we have the Too Faced
Born This Way ethereal studying a powder
I did not believe the hike when I first
purchased this I actually bought it
because you guys wanted me to test it
out in a video where I tested out my
subscribers favorite makeup products and
you know I have a love-hate relationship
with Too Faced but what are the reasons
why I purchased it was because I wanted
to use it in that video and I instantly
fell in love you know and this is the
problem with Too Faced sometimes they
release a really really good product and
sometimes it's just but if this is
one of those really good products it
kind of reminds me of a finishing powder
like a silica powder you can also bake
with it but I don't like to bake with it
cuz I feel like I use too much and it's
not worth the money but what I like to
do is just use it as a setting a powder
or a finishing powder and I think that
the nice thing about this is and the
thing that makes it different from
silica powders is that it actually is a
little bit of coverage but in a
beautiful way and it really kind of
neutralizes the skin and redness and
things like that so this is absolutely
worth the money and I definitely
wouldn't repurchase that up next we have
the Becca Christian Tegan palette I did
not think this was going to be as
special to me as it actually is I really
thought this was made for people who
have more like tan or deep complexions
but I use the out of this I use it
on my eyes because the majority of these
are eye safe
I do also use it on my lips sometimes
like I will use this as an all-in-one @
palette and I get so much use out of it
when I do self-tan a beech nectar is my
perfect highlight I can
use rose gold as they blushed hopper I
just get so much use out of this town
like I said I really didn't think I was
going to but I love this for travel it
is an all-in-one palette and it's
fabulous so even if this does come back
in stock and you do have a fair
complexion would highly recommend at
least taking a look at it and finally
guys we happy bites beauty of Musa Busha
lipsticks I have cremini on my lips
today which is a very very interesting
color and unlike that babypoo color nice
together with this great shirt I'm sure
it's given off all sorts of vibes but
these are 26 dollars apiece I was very
hesitant to purchase them because I'm
thinking hey 26 dollars apiece like you
know this better be damn good lipstick
and guess what they are they're
great and if you do have a darker shade
like cremini you might I recommend the
shade of honeycomb and this is amazing
for mixing any sort of the deeper shades
together with so you can take a lip
brush and kind of layer this on the
outer part of your lip or even in the
center of your lip to kind of plump it
up honeycomb is that beautiful beautiful
neutral sort of new color it doesn't
leave too pink toned or too warm tone
it's just perfect if you're not a new
girl and you want a nude lipstick that's
not gonna lead too warm or too cool and
this is a really good one they go on
folk pigment they are beautiful they
last pretty much all day they taste good
they're food grade this is literally
everything you could want in a luxury
lipstick so yeah would highly recommend
you go ahead bite the bullet and just
purchase one of these because I do not
think you're going to regret it
I certainly did not so anyway guys those
are some makeup products that I
definitely was a little uncertain about
but I'm very happy I did a purchase
please let me know if you have any of
these down below and I guess I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
