couple of announcements I know a couple
of announcements before we get into this
video I feel like I have lipstick on my
teeth first announcement I probably have
lipstick on my teeth you don't need to
point it out in the comments section I
am out of town currently so if I'm not
responding to you guys right away on
YouTube or Instagram that is why I'm
spending some time with my family in
Minneapolis and I will be having this
hair and outfits all the way through
pretty much Wednesday there will be a
video that will be going up every single
day if not twice a day I think I will
film my fails in holy grails obviously I
can't pre upload that I don't know what
I'm gonna like or dislike this week yet
but I will be filming that um at the
house in Minneapolis and also the 5000
subscriber giveaway but besides that all
the other videos there will be one up
every up every other day no everyday and
maybe even two everyday but I will be in
the same outfits I'm just kind of
recording everything in bulk and yeah
let's just get right into the video
shall we
oh now for thing third thing I'm sorry
like nice idea if I'm not responding to
you guys right away I really do
apologize one of my favorite things
about YouTube it's talking and
communicating with you guys and I feel
bad when I see the message and I don't
respond to it right away I always try
and do that just because I know I love
talking to you guys but obviously what
I'm spending time with friends and
family it's just kind of one of those
things where it's like I'm other like I
don't know I want to spend time with
them so I promise that we'll get back to
you guys at some point but if it's not
within like the day or two I apologize
but of course I will get back to you
guys eventually because I love you very
very much alright so this video is going
to be all about makeup that I have
currently hit pan on if you would like
to see more of these kind of videos
because I feel like every three months
six months I hit pan on new products I
would love to share them with you I
recently posted a picture on Instagram
of I think four or five items that I had
hit pan on and people were like please
do a video on this topic so that is what
I am doing today so let's just get right
into it I have let's see here 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 items to talk about
that I've currently hit beyond on so
let's just get right into it the first
two that I have hit pan on are the
Rimmel stay matte long
Dean pressed powders in the shade zero
zero one transparent I hit a nice amount
of pan on these guys they do have a
little bit of a yellow tone even though
they are transparent however if you have
darker skin they don't leave a white
cast so you probably really really like
them I have hit a nice amount of pan
like I said kind of difficult with the
lighting because the pan is always
reflective but hopefully you guys can
see that I really really adore these I
am wearing it today it just please your
face a very matte and these are like
under five dollars at the drugstore so a
really really good deal as well
alright the next product I hit pan on is
the Revlon Colorstay pressed powder in
translucent another fantastic setting
powder from the drugstore I love this I
just really really enjoy it a lot I have
hit pretty much pan on the whole thing
except the outer rim and I wasn't really
oh by the way that was the other thing I
was going to say I had a nail disaster
today that was number four number five
whatever nail disaster please excuse my
nails I tried to make them look cute for
you guys and then I didn't wait long
enough and half of them wiped off onto
my towels sorry guys
anyway I really really loved at this
particular powder if you do have darker
skin tones I think it does leave a
little bit of a white cast so be careful
with that but I really do like this
product and I'm one of those people I
will like you know anytime you like hit
usually when you swirl your brush into a
powder you do it in circular motions and
I always have this level outer rip part
that has the tiniest bit of products
left and it starts to break up and I
will crack it up put it in a bowl and
use it like I love a powder that much I
would you know continuously use the
whole thing
alright the next product that I of hit
pan on is the Maybelline chic Naturals
15's linen eyeshadow it is matte it has
a little bit of like a satiny finish in
my opinion but this is what it looks
like hopefully you guys can see that I
put a little bit of pan on it this is a
product in my 2016 makeup use of collab
so I am trying to use this up and this
year and hopefully I will be able to do
it another product that is part of that
collab is the elf shimmer palette this
is a cream highlighting palette really
really beautiful I believe when I
started I can't hit pan on one shade one
or two shades
I now have hit pan on all four of them
so really really love this really
gorgeous when you apply it with a damp
Beauty Blender absolutely wonderful
wonderful that will create highlighting
right there all right so the next
product I want to talk about are
actually two little eyeshadows from
colour-pop these are the super shock
shadows again these are products I am
trying to use up in 2016 the first one
is the shade get lucky which is a
gorgeous some talaq gold and I have hit
baby pan on this one from digging my
brush in the same area every single time
and I also I also have hit baby pan on
the shade of bubbly so I call it baby
that one it's just like a little dot
like that but yeah I think I will be
able to use these up this year they're
very very soft and creamy and I feel
like color pop eyeshadows are really
easy to get pan on because even though
they look like I have a really really
big packaging it they're really like
there's not a lot of product in there
basically all right the next product I
have hit pan on is the hello flawless um
what is this called this is like I think
this is a powder foundation yeah not a
setting powder it's a powder foundation
from benefit my shade is I love me ivory
and this is just a little deluxe sample
size I don't know if I would repurchase
a full size of this it kind of it's a
little dark on my skin a little yellow
but it is very nice and I have hit pan
and the next product I hit pan on is the
essence all about Matt 2:15 compact
powder
I have already purchased two full sizes
of these love them there's like 399 on
the Ulta comm website if you do have
darker skin this will leave a white cast
it actually even leaves a bit of a
weight cast on my skin tone and I'm
pretty darn fair so I don't know that's
kind of crazy but it really does leave
you very matte it's beautiful and I
pretty much used up the whole product
you guys will probably see that in my
March ft all right now let's talk about
eye shadow palettes I'm so proud of this
one this is my Too Faced natural eye
I've actually used up a whole shade in
here which I feel like it's hard to do
with a palette so I used up that shade
right here which is called nudie Beach
and then I have hit pan on silk teddy
and also heaven and then these three
right here we have honey
to push up and Velvet Revolver if I turn
it you guys can see I have made it quite
like I don't know quite the big dents in
there I would say like especially these
two right here I will probably hit pan
on those very quickly or soon at least
hopefully and then Velvet Revolver as
well has a bit of a dent in it and I'm
so proud that I oh god I'm so proud that
I use this little guy up I was like oh
my god I used up a whole eyes shadow in
a palette like that's amazing or at
least I think it's amazing when you have
as many palettes as I do and then right
here these three shades right here I
haven't even made a dent so kind of
shows you which are my favorite shades
in the palette love that palette and
like I said I'd hit pan on three of the
shades and hopefully I will hit pan on
the other three shortly alright the next
product I want to talk about is the
Revlon nearly naked pressed powder in
zero-one-zero fair this is really nice
it does leave a bit of a pink cast on my
face so I just make sure that I don't
apply too much like blush or if I'm
contouring or bronzing I don't make it
too extravagant because this does put
some color into my face but I love it
it's a very finely males powder really
gorgeous on the skin I highly recommend
checking that one out and then the last
product that I've hit pan on is the
L'Oreal Paris True Match mineral instant
shine eraser this is soft ivory and 1/2
this is just a setting powder beautiful
beautiful color match I really really
really love I'm gonna show you guys the
cute side this side these ones are not
even fainted it's really really
beautiful shape match like I said
matches ratchets matches my skin tone
really really nicely and probably have
about a week's use and then I'll
probably use it off so you'll probably
see that in my empties as well
the n12 shade is like their neutral
shades so I'm curious to try out the
cool one so I do personally have cool
undertones so yeah I hit pan on that as
well so those are all 12 of the products
that I
we have hit pan on give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoy it I always say
that when I don't know what else to say
at the end of my videos I don't like
Sain thumbs up because it's like you
should do whatever you want but I didn't
know what else to say I already talked
about yeah if you guys want to see more
videos like this just tell me in the
comment section but yeah I hope you guys
are having a fantastic day thanks so
much for joining me for this one and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
