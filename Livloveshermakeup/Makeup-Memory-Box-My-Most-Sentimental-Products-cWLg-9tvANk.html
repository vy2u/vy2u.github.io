my channel today's video is going to be
all about my makeup a memory box I am
sharing with you guys some sentimental
products you know items that remind me
of like nostalgic feelings sadness
happiness tenderness things like that
it's kind of interesting that I've
associated some of these products with
those feelings I think that's a
beautiful thing and yeah if you have a
channel or anything like that and you
would like to make a video like this I
would love to see some products that
mean something to you so the first two I
want to talk about are a little deeper
I've talked about them on my channel
before and maybe I've just kind of blown
them off or just kind of talked about
like hey I love this foundation but
there is definitely some deeper meaning
and I thought I would share with you
guys that deeper meaning today so the
first one I don't want to cry um and the
first one is the Tarte Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation I wear the
shade at fair beige this is a 12 hour
makeup it is oil free oh okay so I have
just described or explained to you guys
before that I was in an abusive
relationship when I was in a college and
there was a time where my boyfriend at
the time did hit me so hard that I had
actual bruising and blood and just you
know battle marks basically on my face
and I do want to eventually open up to
you guys and talk about that I'm just so
not ready yet it really really triggers
me still and it makes me feel all sorts
of kind of pain and just twisty dark
feelings and sadness and all that kind
of stuff but the first time that he had
hit me on the face I ended up having a
really really bad bruise and I went into
Sephora and I asked them for a full
coverage foundation this was the one the
girl recommended to me she was looking
at me and I remember her turning to me
one of the Sephora employees and saying
are you okay because I had gone in and I
was wearing some sort of drugstore
foundation that obviously was not
covering everything up but I needed a
good full coverage foundation and I
remember at the time telling her
everything's fine everything's fine and
that was literally me that whole year
throughout that relationship
everything's fine everything's fine
everything was obviously not fine um and
you should I always reach out to someone
if there is something going on in a
relationship that you're in
but yeah this was the foundation they
recommend it to me and I now associate
this with happy feelings I feel
independent I feel strong when I wear
this this is my sixth tube that I have
gone through and it reminds me that I
got out of that bad relationship
I wear this when I'm on stage when I
feel very powerful and I try and
associate it with good feeling so that
is the first one a lot of sentimental
value there obviously but yeah it's a
pretty damn good full coverage
foundation and it is a good product and
I now associate it with good feelings
the second one D is an urban decay
eyeshadow single this is very very old
school I actually had purchased one of
these years ago on HauteLook for the
first time with my own money and it was
funny because I had panned this it is
the eyeshadow single in the shade frigid
this was a limited edition you can't get
this anymore about four years ago when I
was in high school I had a friend that
gave this to me before she died she was
21 years old and she died of ovarian
cancer this was her favorite eyeshadow
that she ever had in her collection she
had collected a ton of them and they had
all this cool packaging on them
Urban Decay had done this kind of like I
was like graphic I don't know like
graphic design sort of thing here I
don't know how to describe it besides
feeling a little motional I don't know
how to describe it um but they had done
this cool like pop art sort of thing and
this is the shade how gorgeous is that
it's like a violet navy blue shade and I
just absolutely love this I don't want
to use it because it reminds me of her
and she died way too young like I said
she was very very young she died of
ovarian cancer and this is just
something that reminds me of her so I
choose to happen in my collection but I
choose not to use it so there's a lot of
sentimental value there let's move on to
some other stuff that's a little happier
here we have the Revlon nearly naked
pressed powder in the shade affair or
Claire this was during the days where I
did not like the color of my skin and I
wanted to be a tan girl and I used to
cake this on it left a very pinky
oranjee look on my face and I look back
now and I say okay well you know what I
love the color of my skin now I'm
absolutely fine with being a pale
princess so cool so far whatever
but there was a time where I was like I
need to be tan and I used to wear this
all the time so this is a powder that I
think I have pants seven times I've gone
through like seven casings of this and
yeah I look back and I remember that I
used to be very unhappy with myself and
how I looked and now I do not feel that
way anymore all right next we have the
alto grip teen powder in the shade cool
I've gone through 64 of these you heard
that right 64 I have been using this
since I was in high school it is one of
my all-time favorite setting powders of
life that this one is a soap and as you
can see and it is just beautiful it's
better than any sort of drugstore powder
I've ever found any sort of high end
powder I've ever found again something
I've been using since high school that
I'm absolutely in love with so I really
really do enjoy that here is the first
primer that I ever purchased my first
high end primer I should say it was from
Napoleon petty this is the auto pilot
pre foundation skin and primer I went
through four full sizes of this this
used to be sold at Sephora I believe
it's not anymore but it's a beautiful
gel consistency and I kind of don't use
this anymore because it just reminds me
of like being in high school or being in
like early college years and I just
don't really want to use it the smell is
very nostalgic to me the way goes onto
the skin is still is beautiful after all
these years and I'm just kind of like
obsessed with it I don't mean because
this is an old tooth this is rather new
what I mean is that the way it goes onto
my skin still acts like how my skin is
now so on combination now used to be so
so so oily it's still beautiful on my
skin it's just one of those products
that like grew with me and I still love
it so that is definitely a nostalgic
moment next we do have this guy right
here this is the Maybelline um what is
this called a clear brow gel or whatever
it is now this was something that my mom
gave to me when I was like 10 years old
not this particular to my bronzer like
16 of these but she gave me this when I
was 16 or not 16 years old when I was
like 10 years old and basically as she
said you know I want you wearing this
because I don't want you wearing mascara
yeah I really really wanted to wear
makeup at a young age and as she told me
to just use clear gel on my actual
eyelashes I now use this to set in my
brows I'm holding on to this one
probably won't use it up because it's
not something I would repurchase but
it's something I keep in the makeup
sentimental box because it was kind of
like my first makeup product if you will
and then finally we have the Revlon aged
mine wrinkle remedy lino filler I
remember the day where I woke up in
college I was gonna say high school no
college and I noticed some fine lines
underneath my eyes and they were not
severe in any way shape or form there's
still not that bad there there and I
would never get like Botox in that area
or anything like that because I feel
like if you have smile lines it just
means that you've smiled a lot in your
life and that is a wonderful wonderful
day you should never be unhappy with
that but I remember waking up and I was
like holy are those lies underneath
of my eyes and I went out to the
drugstore when I'm makeup alley which
was like this website used to write
reviews on I was looking for reviews on
products that would help with you know
wrinkles under the eyes filling in pores
and everybody recommended this it is so
 good you guys if you could
purchase this and you're not doing the
cruelty free thing I would highly
recommend it it's really awesome it has
a super thick consistency to it and it
still works really nicely this day 2
filling in like the outer little
marionette lines like here and then also
underneath the eyes and filling in a
pores so anyway guys those are my
sentimental makeup products let me know
down below if you have any thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
