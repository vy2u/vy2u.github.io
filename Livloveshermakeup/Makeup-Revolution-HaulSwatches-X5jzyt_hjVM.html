thank you so much for joining me today I
have a call for you guys and it is
actually from a brand that I personally
don't know a lot about this is actually
the first haul or any kind of products
that I've actually had from this brand
the brand is called makeup revolution
and it is based I believe in the UK yes
in London and I recently saw emilynoel83
here on YouTube also known as Emily
Eddington I believe she's amazing I love
her she's one of my favorite youtubers
and um she was doing some sort of like a
pallet video a few weeks ago and she had
shown this gorgeous bronzer palette and
blush palette and it is from the makeup
revolution line and I thought oh my gosh
those are gorgeous I better go look into
the brand they do sell a good amount of
the line at Ulta however when I got onto
the Alta website I saw that they didn't
have the blush palette that i wanted i
wanted the one that she has shown which
is called sugar and spice so i ended up
actually going on to the makeup
revolution website and i picked up a few
things so i got three highlighters I've
got the bronzer palette I got a blush
palette and then I got an eyeshadow
palette so i thought i would go ahead
and call these with you guys today and
also go ahead and do swatches so i'm
really really excited i have heard a few
things about these vivid baked
highlighters i got three of them i guess
i'll start with these so i have heard a
few things about these I've seen photos
on makeup social on Instagram things
like that and I mostly see photos of
this particular one this kind of Goldie
color this is called golden light but I
thought I would just pick up all three
because they were relatively cheap the
line is relatively well priced a lot of
their palates are under ten dollars and
these highlighters I think we're under
five dollars so um i think for the
amount of product you get to that's a
great deal so i thought i would just get
all the highlighters that they had from
the vivid baked line so i picked up all
three the first one is like rice
in golden lights and it looks like this
and its really really beautiful kind of
like white faced but it has tons and
tons of little like gold shimmers in it
so I'm going to go ahead and swatch it
I've knots washed these yet so this
actually feels it doesn't feel super
super soft but it doesn't feel super
rough either but it is holy cow very
very pigmented so I'm going to go ahead
and swatch that on my hand to show you
guys so that is what golden lights looks
like absolutely stunning that is really
really beautiful very very excited let
me grab my makeup wipes so I can make
sure that getting these swatches off but
that is gorgeous I think it's beautiful
it's kind of yellow based like I said
it's got tons of those tiny little
golden shimmers but it's more like
glimmer you know it's not a glittery or
chunky so really really beautiful you
know not super soft to the touch however
I mean holy cow very very pigmented so
very excited for that the next one I
picked up looks like this and it is
called pink lights and it actually has
this beautiful like lavender tone to it
see if I can open it and this is what it
looks like so it's got this beautiful
kind of lavender purple II like
iridescent undertone to it so let's
watch this one again the texture feels
the same not really soft but it does
kind of feel like it has one of those
films that once you kind of work through
the product it will start to kind of
soften up if that makes sense soften up
if that makes sense yeah so you know how
sometimes you get shadows or any kind of
powder product and you really have to
kind of work into the product to get it
to UM get it to its full like potential
I feel like that's kind of what this is
because when I touch it at first it
feels a little hard but then once I work
it in in circles it really feels a lot
better so let's swatch this pink light
shade I don't know why this one is
called pink lights because i'm going to
show you the other one which looks more
pink to me this should be called like
lilac lights or something but really
really beautiful it is right to their
right underneath the golden lights one
well I
a lot that it's very very pretty so this
one has a lot of iridescent i would say
silver shimmer to it it doesn't have
that gold in the undertone it just has
that lilac color with lots of silver
shimmer so really really beautiful love
that pink lights 120 I'm excited you
guys these are awesome and these are
huge there is um let's see here seven
point five grams in your so that's a lot
of product and the last one is called
peach lights which looks like this I
feel like this one should have been
called pink lights but this is what it
looks like and it is kind of like peachy
and let's watch this one texture feels
the same this one looks like it has like
that pinky kind of you know color but
then underneath it has a bit of leg
silvery almost purple ah shimmers so
that's what that looks like let's watch
that so this one actually I don't know
this one is not a yeah this one doesn't
feel it feels a little different like
the formulas a little different and
feels a little harder and it doesn't
look like it's watches as you probably
can't tell but as evenly so it's not as
buttery and it's not as pigmented as the
other two but that's down there that's
peach lights so we have golden lights we
have pink lights and then peach lights
so golden lights and pink lights the
first to definitely look like they are
going to be my favorite but of course
I'll have to play with all of them and
you know see what they look like on my
skin but so far a very impressed those
are really beautiful you get a lot of
product in here really cheap and
cheerful definitely recommend checking
these out I believe these highlighters
were on the alte website so you do not
need to order from the UK if you want
these particular highlighters alright so
the next thing I'm going to go into is
the bronze palette that I saw
emilynoel83 talk about it is called the
makeup revolution London bronze ultra
professional bronze palette it says
eight high payoff blusher powders don't
really know why it says blush when it's
a bronzer palette but um sometimes they
do I don't know that UK sometimes they
um package things that way I'm not
really sure why but this one is called
the ultra bronze palette in all about
bronze and you can see they have a few
of the shades on the back I did not find
that these look anywhere like nearly as
pretty or nearly like the color seems
wrong like the back of the packaging
doesn't really look like what the
palette looks like so i will show you
guys what it looks like but i'm very
excited about this this was one of those
things that i saw again on Emily
Noelle's channel this was one of the
products really really beautiful
packaging kind of glossy and just very
very sleek travel-friendly you get a
huge mirror in here and then these are
the shades can you guys see those so
what really drew me into this was the
fact that she was talking about these
not having tons and tons of like crazy
crazy dark colors in it you know for a
bronzer palette and I'm honestly someone
who has fair skin tone so that's kind of
what drew me in and then those two over
here those two shades right there are
gorgeous they just looked like they
could be like hi lady kind of baked
colors so I'm going to go ahead and
swatch it for you guys they do not have
names on this so I'm just going to go
from the top row and then the bottom row
so we'll just go that way and I will
just watch all them so you guys can see
who they feel like slipping butter
alright just had to say that so the
first shade looks like this it's a very
very neutral I'm almost undetectable
even on my skin tone which I actually
really like so that would make a really
nice soft um like contour color or if
you just kind of want to bronze up your
face a little bit I am noticing you just
get a little bit of kick up but that's
okay they are very soft so that's
probably why the next shade is a little
deeper in tone it's a little more pink
based I would say but still really
really beautiful very buttery and it is
completely matched those first two are
completely matte the next one has a
little bit of like more like I don't
know golden shimmer in it and it looks
no it's definitely like warmer it's not
as dark and pinky is the other one it
definitely has shimmer in it and that
one is right there really really pretty
and then we're going to get into one of
those at kind of baked shades I'm not
quite sure if these like come off very I
don't know let's see let's watch up that
is what that looks like so it does kind
of look like kind of high lady but
really really smooth and also just has
like a lot of like iridescent to it very
pretty like that and like it all right
going down to the bottom row we have a
mat here this one it looks like it's a
little more like neutral not as pink
based really really nice i like these
goodness it's going to look good on my
fair skin tom so that's that one right
there um kind of waking these off as i
go and then we have another map one it's
a little more warm it looks like it
maybe has a little more not like orangie
undertones I don't want to say that but
it definitely looks like it has more of
a warmer on your tone very pretty and
then we have another match but it is
deeper and it's got more of like a ready
undertone and that one is right there
very very nice and then the last one is
that kind of pearly color right there I
feel like this is definitely going to
show up more like that's a highlight and
yes it is so it's right there I don't
even know if you guys can see that but I
thought this was really beautiful when
she showed it on her channel and also I
think she did on the Express channel as
well I was just like oh that looks so
nice for somebody who has you know fair
skin tone isn't you know doesn't want
stuff that's like too dark too crazy so
I was really really excited to kick that
baby up so that is the all about bronze
palette the next one I picked up was the
other palettes he had talked about which
was the blush palette and it is in sugar
and spice again the back like the shades
on here do not look like that I don't
know I've you know
sometimes they do that with the
packaging they're like this is what
you're getting this does not look like
the colors inside but anyway this is the
makeup revolution blush palette in like
I said sugar and spice and this was
gorgeous there were two shades in here
like the high lady kind of baked shades
towards the I think right inside that
were gorgeous again really really nice
sleek packaging and I was just so
excited so check those out do you see
those over there oh my gosh yes
beautiful so really really gorgeous you
get some maps in here um actually oh my
gosh all of them are Matt except those
two shimmers on the on the end there so
let's watch them the first one is kind
of like a matte plummy color um kind of
deep kind of neutral really really nice
that's going to be great for fall I like
that a lot next to that is kind of a
warmer plummy color I'm so very very
nice a very neutral great for fall right
there and then we jump into kind of a
bright fuchsia pink color you guys can
see that really really pretty and these
are going on really nicely very smooth
very very pretty colors oh yes yes yes
yes yes girl yes these look great very
excited and then we get that first kind
of baked shimmery one up there oh my god
hahaha holy crap do you guys see there
what wow that is amazing oh my gosh oh
my god I'm dying right now and dying do
you guys see this oh my gosh that is
like the thickest most pigmented
gorgeous silver beam uh-uh highlight
ever that is absolutely stunning that
just came from this one up here oh my
god I am in love I'm in love gorgeous
all right moving down we have kind of a
plummy kind of ready sort of color oh my
gosh that is very pigmented to
crap that is right there next to that we
have more of a neutral i would say
medium toned warm pink and that one is
right there oh my god that highlight is
ridiculous so beautiful I'm dying you
guys die and then we have a warm peachy
pink which is nice that they throw that
in there cuz a lot of these are neutral
or kind of darker so that's the warm
peachy pink and then we have that other
baked color which is like that pinky one
again beautiful iridescent oh my gosh
it's gorgeous do you see that oh yes I'm
going to be wearing that on my cheeks
gorgeous so definitely my two favorites
are these ones right here sorry these
ones that those gorgeous kind of
highlighted baked shades are just
absolutely stunning I cannot wait to
play so um yes can't wait to play with
those really really beautiful palette
love it and I think this was under like
I said ten dollars so definitely check
that out and the last thing i got was
just something that i saw on the website
and i was like oh what that looks right
up my alley i think i should get it so
it is the makeup revolution revolution
flawless Matt 32 eyeshadow palette so it
is a completely matte palette they have
all the colors on the back there I am
NOT going to swatch every single shade
because that's going to take forever I'm
just going to show you guys what it
looks like in swatched like random
shades really nice packaging again and
this thing has a jumbo sized mirror
really beautiful and you guys look at
these how beautiful are those you get
some nice cool tones you get some nice
warm tones I am seeing so many great
like transition colors in here like I am
so excited to play with this and they
are all completely matched so let's go
ahead and swatch a few i'll try and get
oh my god they feel like butter you guys
these are so soft oh my god i'm so
impressed i gotta get on the altar
website right now order some more stuff
or something but those are a few colors
right there let's go ahead and just do
some random swatches
on my hand i'm going to start flipping
over and going on my wrist because it is
my hand is now getting a little like red
and stained from the blushes oh wow they
really feel great and i just love all
like i love the fact that these are all
matte but i also like you know the
butteriness is great like these feel
like they're gonna be really easy to
blend out so really really excited for
these these look great let's see heroes
just watch a few on the back of my arm
can I see those oh my god I'm so bad at
swatches let's try again that's like the
leftover excess of these ones but really
beautiful oh my god in this color right
there that looks gorgeous you see that
middle one that looks really beautiful
like perfect like neutral pink so oh my
goodness I am so excited I am so
thrilled um I definitely shipping was
more when I went on to the actual makeup
revolution website to purchase these
things but I'm definitely going to go on
to the altar website and purchase some
more because they do have the blush
palette on there I believe they do have
the highlighters and they have different
blush palette so they have different
colors they have different bronzer
palettes they've so much stuff so I am
definitely gonna have to go back onto
the Ulta website and order a few things
as well because we can get free shipping
here in the US um the overall first
impression was really really excited
they look beautiful everything is
gorgeous so pigmented really really nice
and creamy the things that were not as
creamy as I had hoped were the baked
highlighters but again they were so
pigmented it doesn't even matter so um I
hope you guys enjoyed this hall if you
did please give it a thumbs up and I
will be doing a follow-up hall in about
a week and I'll let you guys know a
little more about you know my first
impressions of using them on my face not
just swatches and yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this I'll see you my next one
