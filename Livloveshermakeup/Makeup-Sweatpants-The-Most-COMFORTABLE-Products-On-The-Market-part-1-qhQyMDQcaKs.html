my channel today I have part 1 of a
miniseries that I want to do on here
called a makeup sweatpants talking all
about very very comfortable makeup
products now this one is going to
include some color correcting as well as
let's see your concealer based products
and powders a little bit of highlighters
as well as the mascara the next one will
have blushes we'll talk more about
highlighters probably some more base
products and of course lip products
which you guys know I love comfortable
lip products so I thought this would be
a lot of fun probably about 3 years ago
before I even started a channel I saw
Emily no led3 do a video like this where
she was talking about the sweatpants of
a makeup and she was actually putting
them onto her face and doing a tutorial
style now you guys know I am NOT a
tutorial based channel so I'm gonna do
this more in a review sort of format but
like I said this will be a 2 or 3 part
series super excited to share with you
guys very comfortable makeup products
because I feel like I am the queen of
comfortable makeup products I do not
beat my face to the gods every single
day is just not my style I do wear
makeup everyday but I like very natural
and comfortable makeup so let's go ahead
and start with base products the first
one I want to talk about is the one I
have on today as kind of like a my
foundation this is the Tarte Amazonian
clay BB tinted moisturizer it does have
broad-spectrum SPF 20 in it and a dish
aid that I wear is ivory now it says on
the backyard oil-free makeup antioxidant
rich formulated without parabens mineral
oil theta lates triskele and sodium
lauryl sulfate and gluten it is just a
really natural beautiful tinted
moisturizer and actually has quite a
thick consistency to it which you
usually don't see it when it comes to a
tinted moisturizer usually they're very
very runny so this definitely feels a
little bit more like a BB cream but when
you start to blend it out on the skin in
my opinion it gets more and more sheer
now this can be beautiful just for like
a little bit of blurring effects when
you pair it together with a concealer
you can have a full face that looks
really nice but not overdone so
obviously you can still see little marks
like my acne scars or even little active
pimples through this but at the same
time it just makes the skin look
beautiful and radiant and it is
incredibly lightweight and comfortable
to wear so and that is the first product
that I want to recommend the next one is
great if you do have more combination to
oily skin and this is the Urban Decay
Naked skin a one-and-done hybrid
complexion Perfector it also does have
broad
some SPF 20 in it and the shade that I
currently wear is called light and this
is the great match for me currently I
don't even have to bronze up when I'm
using this I am a little darker
currently now that I live in Arizona but
this is great because it goes from a
liquid to a powder so it truly is a one
and done sort of experience I usually
take about one pop and then I apply it
with my fingertips because I love the
way that it goes on I take it around my
eye area I take it everywhere and then
it goes to a powder finish so if you are
a little more on the dry side or normal
skin you don't even have to set this in
which is amazing now I do like to set my
makeup fan up with a powder just because
I'm very picky like that and I just like
the way it looks I feel like it gives a
really nice finishing veil and on top of
that it does prolong the longevity of
your base products but this is really
wonderful very light on the skin super
comfortable and I would say gives a nice
solid medium coverage now if you are
looking for a comfortable a full
coverage sort of cream I would
definitely recommend the it cosmetics
your skin but better cz illumination or
just the regular CC cream from it
cosmetics these do have SPF 50 in them
in the shade that I currently wear is
called fair I may need to go a step down
once I get a little darker since I am
down here in Arizona now like I said I
like to take one pop of this I would
recommend the CC illumination for those
of you with more dry mature and kind of
normal skin it does have little bits of
glitter infused in here which if you are
in direct sunlight you can see it now if
you do have more mature and dry skin
that could make your skin look more
luminous but I don't think you would
love this one if you do have more
combination to oily skin but if you are
more confidently just get the regular
version it's wonderful be careful with
this if you do have sensitive skin it
does have quite a bit of fragrance in it
which nobody ever told me about and I
was pretty shocked when I first used it
but this is beautiful love the way it
feels on the skin and it really does
give awesome coverage one of the things
I love about this as well is the fact
that you can actually build it up so if
you want to take one at pump and apply
it all over your face and then build it
up in certain areas like for me I have a
texture and acne scarring right here
from like hormonal acne I just kind of
build it up in those areas it looks
natural but like I said it gives a
really nice amount of coverage and it
feels so comfortable on the skin so I
love that all right as far as colour
correctors are concerned hands down the
Urban Decay Naked skin colour correcting
fluids are amazing I love the pink one I
love the yellow one but lately I've
really been loving this
under shade now a lot of color
correctors in my opinion are very sticky
and tacky and they're very hard to blend
into the scanner these are not like that
whatsoever and I really like that
they're not overly pigmented so if you
do have a fair complexion these blend
beautifully so very comfortable very
very natural-looking here is a concealer
I want to recommend to you guys from Too
Faced this is called the born this way
naturally radiant concealer now I do
currently wear the shade it very fair I
feel like these run a little dark
because this matches my skin tone
perfectly right now while I'm tan so if
you are like looking into this concealer
I would go with the shade lighter but
anyway this is a beautiful really
naturally a radiant finish it goes on
really really nicely I have heard it's
very similar to the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer I believe they're around
the same price that's the one I want to
try next but I really love how
comfortable this is today I did take the
Tarte Amazonian clay tinted moisturizer
and then I took a little bit of this
concealer underneath my eyes and on my
eyelids I know a lot of people say Tarte
shake tape is so comfortable or like
I've heard someone say the amazing
cosmetics concealer is comfortable for
them from me and those feel very heavy
on the skin to be completely honest and
I would watch much rather go with
something like this so I would highly
recommend this do enjoy any Borna this
way concealer like I said it next I'm
gonna try out the Urban Decay one though
now as far as powder is concerned if you
are going to set your face I really
think the elf tone correcting powder in
cool is amazing they also have a warm
tone version if you do have more of a
warmer undertone but this was amazing
it's super super finely milled I can
barely feel it on at my face now a lot
of people are gonna say what about the
essence all about matte fixing compact
powder don't get me wrong that is a
beautiful powder as well but I
definitely feel that especially if I put
a lot of that powder on I cannot feel it
on my face this one I cannot I think
it's beautiful finely milled absolutely
gorgeous and also I want to recommend
the it cosmetics what is it bye-bye
pores for finishing powder so anything
that has silica in it is super
lightweight and very very comfortable on
the skin so if you're looking for a
powder to set in your face or just to
use as a finishing powder or even to
bake your face would highly recommend
the one from a cosmetics or even the elf
one alright moving on let's talk about
some highlighters you guys so you're not
gonna be surprised by the first little
option here the hourglass ambient
lighting powders now these can double
and triple as like a million different
things let me know if you want me to do
a video exclusively on how let
five different ways that you can use the
ambient lighting powder so if you do
have more combination to oily skin these
are beautiful highlighters they're not
going to emphasize any sort of texture
on your skin you can also use them just
at your under-eye today I do have on
these shade
diffused light now I'm a little more
normal skinned now and this just works
really really beautiful for me as an
under eye setting powder I also can get
away with taking these and dusting it
all over my face now these are just
super super light in area I think
they're beautiful as a setting powder
under the eye as a highlighter whatever
you choose them for I think they're
absolutely fantastic and like I said
super comfortable to wear now as far as
like a cream highlight is concerned
these Stila
putty highlighters are really really
nice now this is from the holiday
collection last year I know they don't
have this palette anymore but I do
believe that they sell all three of
these in a full size they're this really
really light airy texture and I mean you
cannot feel these on the skin it
literally feels like nothing you could
just take a little bit and tap it right
onto your cheekbones you will not notice
it throughout the day and if you do want
to you can actually take these and then
set them in with the hourglass powders
to get even more of like a wham bam sort
of highlight so I would highly recommend
though is now I have another highlighter
here that I feel like I don't talk about
enough this is the highlighter from as
you a in the shade rose quartz so and
these are actually called their powder
highlighters these are actually a true
baked shalay sort of formula but super
super silky and airy and light weights
like when I rub my finger in here
honestly it just feels like butter like
you can barely feel it so when I put
this on the skin I really do like it
because I think it gives a natural glow
from within sort of look and I never
feel like I have something heavy or
cakey on at my skin at whatsoever which
is something that I love about facial a
highlighters and finally guys I want to
recommend a mascara I know it might
sound kind of weird like how can a
mascara be heavy but I think we've all
been there but like waterproof mascaras
or even just mascaras they give you a
lot of volume and length at once they do
feel heavy they feel crispy they feel
weird to the touch with this mascara
right here I have on today and it just
feels so soft it feels like I don't even
have anything on my lashes this is the
Charlotte Tilbury full-fat lashes now
full disclaimer this was sent to me for
a PR I have talked about it in previous
videos but I really really
like it is quite expensive I mean I'm
sure that you could get something at the
drugstore for a similar um you know
similar sort of feel but it does have a
nice sort of natural bristle wanted it
just goes on so beautifully I can layer
two to three layers of this without
feeling like a cakes up on my lashes are
feeling like they feel heavy or crispy
to the touch there's nothing worse than
like rubbing your eyes and feeling like
this crispy feeling and having the
little excess pieces of mascara flake
off that just doesn't happen with this I
think it's gorgeous it feels great and
it's very very comfortable so anyway
guys that is part one of my makeup sweat
pants video I hope you enjoyed this I
will have part two coming up for you
guys a very very soon but yeah I hope
you enjoyed it thank you for joining and
I'll see you guys tomorrow fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
