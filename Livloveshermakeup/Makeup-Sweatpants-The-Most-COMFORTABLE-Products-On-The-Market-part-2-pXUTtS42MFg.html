my channel and welcome to a makeup
sweatpants the most comfortable products
on the market part two i have not filmed
one of these in about nine to ten months
but i will still go ahead and throw a my
first one up in the cards if you guys
would like to check it out
but today i have some updated really
really comfortable products that i want
to recommend to you guys so when it
starts with the butter lipsticks from
nyx cosmetics I feel like I am late to
the game when it comes to these
lipsticks but they are so comfortable
this first shade that I have here is
called root beer floats which is a
beautiful ma be your lips but better and
these have a little bit of an oily
consistency to them and even though they
are called a butter lipsticks they
definitely don't feel as heavy on the
lips as say the butter glosses do now I
actually got all three of these little
minis when I got to these cyber a Monday
deal from a NYX Cosmetics on the
ulta.com website it was like a trunk
case or something like that filled with
a ton of different lipsticks and lip
products from NYX Cosmetics they
constantly come out with new lip ease
but I was so incredibly impressed with
these that I already for sure know I
will be going ahead and purchasing a few
of the shades in full sizes now the
second one is called seashell which is
just a baby pink color it's not my
all-time favorite but they do have a ton
of different shades that you guys can
choose from now the one thing that I
will say about these of butter lipsticks
is because they do have a little more of
a thin oily consistency to them and they
do feel very light on the lips however
they also cap the tendency to move
around outside the lip line so I would
highly recommend you go ahead and you do
put a lip liner on if your going to wear
one of these this last shade is called
ripe berry which is beautiful but I
really really do enjoy these and they
are so air like you don't even notice
them on your lips throughout the day so
and that is the first product I want to
talk about up next I thought I would
mention the new you glow girl baked
highlighters from jcat Beauty I don't
know how new these are but I feel like
people just really started to talk about
them ever since the Tayla was saying how
good these are these are absolutely
incredible now this shape right here is
called Bella Rose I'm not usually one
that gravitates towards baked
highlighters because I think they get a
little bit of a bad reputation baked eye
glitters tend to feel very scratchy and
kind of like eg to the touch that I
don't even know if that's the right word
if you didn't feel very scratchy to the
touch kind of like sandpaper and if
you've ever tried out like the elf baked
highlighters you have to dig off the top
layer and
really scrape off the top layer to get
this nice buttery consistency I wouldn't
necessarily say that these highlighters
right here have a super buttery
consistency Jakob UD did send this one
to me by the way full disclosure so they
definitely don't have a buttery
consistency to them but they do have
this gorgeous way of going on to the
skin there AirLife like you literally
pick it up and you don't even feel like
you have product on your finger but you
can see there clearly is product on your
finger and you just blend it in you can
use a buffing brush or you can go in
with a fan brush which has been at my
personal favorite way to apply these and
you just get this high metallo size sort
of shine right on your cheekbones down
the bridge of your nose your chin
wherever you highlight and it is
absolutely gorgeous
that is definitely a newer product to me
that I think is really really good
quality super air like you don't notice
it on the skin and it does look very
very beautiful up next I have some newer
foundations to me that I have really
been enjoying and they honestly feel
like nothing on your skin so the first
one is from nude by Nature this is the
liquid mineral foundation in the shade
affair to e brand out of Australia but
they are cruelty free but this is a
great foundation I feel like it goes on
a little more moosie than I expected
however it really blends out beautifully
on the skin and at least a little bit of
moisture so that's the first one I want
to recommend and I believe that's around
$10 a USD and then here we have the uLTA
Beauty HD soft focus liquid foundation
if you're here in the u.s. this is
definitely something I would jump on the
shades right here is called light cool
and I really do enjoy it I know that
they are expanding their shade selection
right now they only have I believe about
ten shades but they will be opening it
up to five more deep shapes and then I
believe five more lighter shades which
is great but like Kol is a really really
good match for me it does have a little
bit of like a serum base to it so it's a
little slippery if you have normal or
dry skin I would recommend this if
you're a little more oily combo this
might slip and slide on your face
throughout the day but this is a great
foundation super lightweight you don't
notice it on the skin throughout the day
and if you blend it out with a brush it
honestly just feels like your skin it's
very very breathable let's talk about
another lip product that I feel like a
lot of people don't mention you can get
these on these Sephora calm website I've
had them for years this is the Carrie
Graham lip whip this particular one
right here is the pimento berry which is
cinnamon and there are a bunch of
different shades that you can choose
from some of them are limited edition I
also have the marsala shade as well as
The Naked lip whip I don't talk about
these very often but if you want a
comfortable lip butter or something
that's going to be like a true ball not
like the butter lipstick something
that's actually going to moisturize your
lips but you don't want it to be too
heavy and this is going to be the way to
go they have peppermint as well as
cinnamon so you get to choose one of the
flavors The Naked lip whip is great it
has no color to it the marsala one is a
little deeper you will get a lip tint
and then this one right here has just
the slightest amount of color to it it's
not anything that's super super
noticeable but I really do enjoy these
because I can actually wear this lip
product while I am practicing my flute
if I were to put on like my bike Beauty
agave lip mask while I was practicing my
flute that would be all over the
head joint and I have to clean my flute
for ages and ages so this is really
really nice it will moisturize your lips
it will give a little bit of a tint and
it doesn't feel super super heavy
because it is a lip whip alright guys
and finally I have two of these little
liquid highlighters here if you caught
my vlog from a couple of weeks ago I
went ahead and swatch these out these
are from Amy a touch of glam Beauty she
sent these to me and these are the kind
of I don't guess liquid illuminators but
like almost like a shimmer built into an
oil now I have never really been a fan
of those liquid illuminators where it
truly is just like an oil with a little
bit of shimmer in it but these are
incredibly comfortable you cannot even
feel them on the skin I love putting
them on with a damp sponge over my
foundation because for some reason they
do not actually disturb my foundation or
my powder which is amazing but also
these are really cool to mix into your
foundation if you want like an all-over
sort of sheen so the first one I have
here is called a pixie poison super
super pretty it is a gorgeous and
gorgeous sort of I would say purpley
trichrome I mean it's got green in it
it's got silver and just the smallest
amount of this will give you a ton of
color payoff it's a little more purpley
as you guys can see so if you were into
that sort of colorful highlight trend if
you were into the duochrome
or the holographic goodness you would
probably really really enjoy that one
right there and then this guy right here
is called drenched in pearls drenched in
pearls is probably my least favorite
just because of the shade now this one
is gold with a little bit of like a
green undertone to it which I know is
very in right now but like I said these
are just so incredibly lightweight on
the skin they feel amazing and when I
blend them in onto their skin I even can
get a little bit of a glow if I don't
want to wear foundation but these mix
well with foundation I feel like they
give my foundation
more moisture and on top of that like I
said if I do want to set my face in and
then apply this with a damp sponge they
don't actually remove my base product or
make them bunch up in any way shape or
form which is really really cool so if
you are looking for a really really
lightweight liquid Luminizer I would
highly recommend looking into those from
touch of glam Beauty so anyway guys
those are all super super lightweight
comfortable products on the market that
I absolutely adore let me know down
below if you have any other
recommendations you would like to add to
this list and that's pretty much it
thanks for joining me guys
I'll see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
