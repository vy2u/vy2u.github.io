today's video is going to be a little
more lighthearted
I thought I would share with you guys a
makeup products in my collection and I
really really inspire me now I wanted to
put this video up before I get into some
different topics this week I have a
beauty wishlist video coming up
obviously my fails and holy grails and
then also a little more of a serious
video talking about the
over-sexualization of a beauty products
and the industry as well as a video
about makeup the mindfuck to me so I
wanted to put kind of a different video
up for today and just so that we can go
back and forth so it's not just like ooh
let's talk about serious topics all week
long so anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into it I want to say before we
get into this I'm a very interesting
person when it comes to products that
inspire me a versus products that I wear
on a day-to-day basis if you guys didn't
know I am a teacher I'm a music teacher
and I find for the most part I am
allowed to get away with a lot of
different makeup looks but you know
green lipstick and things that are super
super overboard I would never really
wear those to work I am one of those
people that actually is incredibly drawn
to color
I'm incredibly drawn to cool toned lips
cool tone eyes really really colorful
eye looks one of my favorite youtubers
on here is Jay kissa I'll go ahead and
throw one of her videos up in the cards
so you guys can check out her channel
she is one of my favorite cruelty free
youtubers she does beautiful colorful
makeup looks and she really really does
inspire me if there is a list of beauty
youtubers that inspire me she has to be
on that lips a hundred percent sorry
have like a really really high a little
messy bun today and I feel like he's
starting to fall out I am wearing some
of my favorite sort of inspirational
products on my face today and you
usually don't see me in these kind of
colors because I usually do film on days
where I'm heading out to work but I
wanted to let you guys know if you're a
little confused in this video where some
of the stuff that I'm holding up and
showing you as makeup that inspires me a
lot of these products are my favorites I
just don't wear them every single day so
anyway so let's go ahead and jump right
into it guys I do want to start with the
lipstick that I have on right now and
this is the wet and wild liquid cat soup
metallic liquid lipstick and this
particular shade is called three four
ninety six so sirens jewel I love this
lipstick color and I know so many people
are not into green and blue lips I was
so many people told me this looks like
 on my lips not could literally care
less this is one of the most beautiful
beautiful dark mossy green colors I feel
like it makes my teeth look really white
I like the formula there there are some
issues with this particular formula I'm
not the biggest fan of the applicator
can be kind of difficult you also can
get a little bit of streaking with this
formula so you do have to layer them on
and then right here on the inside of the
lip it will always be like a distinct
line between the dark green and
obviously the color of your lip but I
have to say this is just such an
inspirational lip product to me every
time I wear it I feel like I want to
step up my makeup game I feel like I
want to put different things on my face
and I just absolutely love it so that is
the first liquid lipstick that I want to
talk about another lipstick in my
collection that really does inspire me
is the colour-pop lippie stix in the
shade raw and again you guys never see
me wear colors like this but I love this
lipstick this is a mint green and this
definitely gives more of a satiny finish
so if you don't want the really really
dark color and you don't want to liquid
lipstick on I love this this is
something that definitely inspires me
every time I wear this I usually wear a
smoky eye with it and I just go crazy
with my makeup and again I'm no
professional when it comes to makeup but
this really these two liquid lipsticks
right here or the liquid lipstick and
the satin lipstick really do inspire me
to do things differently with my makeup
and I love that I think makeup is all
about artistry and stepping outside your
comfort zone and I'm all for it alright
I'm not quite sure how well my highlight
is showing up on camera today but I have
to say the Aurora glow kit and the moon
shall glow kit from anastacio Beverly
Hills are some of my favorite glow kits
if not my all-time favorite definitely
for the moon child so today I'm wearing
a purple horseshoe and Blue Moon
combined together as my actual highlight
I feel like a little alien when I wear
these collars I love them I love a
colorful highlights I should do an
updated video all about colorful
highlights and which ones are my
favorite but I love dual chromatic
shifts I love trichrome ships I love all
sorts of beautiful beautiful different
colorful highlights on my face
especially purples as someone who does
have a cool undertone naturally I lean
towards blues and purples and a blue
moon right here is absolutely stunning
and then I will
use a little bit of purple horseshoe
just as kind of a topper purple
horseshoe in the moon shall glow kid
unfortunately does have some glitter
pieces in it which isn't my favorite but
if you do mix together blue moon and
star you will get a beautiful look as
well so let me go ahead and just swatch
out blue moon for you guys so you can
see absolutely stunning and it's it's
pretty natural and you can build and
these up to get like a wham bam and your
face kind of look but I love the way
they go on I love the way that they
adhere to my skin throughout the day and
this is definitely my all-time favorite
glow kit now when it comes to the aurora
cloak it seems sort of thing going on
here one of my favorite shades in here
currently is Orion which is the blue
highlight in here now I will say the
Aurora glow kit definitely has a little
bit of a different formula going on it's
a little more sheer and then in the moon
child and that's probably because they
have a little more like poppy colors in
there so right here we have blue moon
from the Anastacio Beverly Hills Moon
child and then right here we have a ryan
from the aurora glow kit so i ryan
definitely has a little more sparkle to
it a little more shine to it but again
if you want to mix and match colorful a
blue and purple highlights having the
two of these in your collection is
absolutely fantastic so I love those and
they really do inspire me alright some
more highlights that inspire me a lot
and they didn't at first but they do now
are the elect chaser highlighters from
Becca Indy shades
opal flashes Jade which is a beautiful
beautiful kind of neutral color with a
mmm green a blue shift to it now these
are supposed to be used on the eyes as
well as on the cheeks or they're
supposed to be able to be used on the
eyes as well as the cheeks I don't like
these on my eyes and actually when I
first picked up this highlighter I was
going to return the two of these because
they weren't showing up on my skin and
when I'm not self-tan now when I do
self-tan I really really do like the two
of these this guy right here is called
topaz flashes guilt and again very very
unique and inspirational to me when I
see colors like this that are just so
 different I'm like where else
can I put that on my face so I really do
love those two highlighters right there
absolutely would recommend looking into
the light chaser highlighters from Becca
I do own all six you can get some really
really natural of beautiful colors that
you can also get some really cool
inspirational ones like that the Stila
glitter and glows have always been
something that make me want to step up
my makeup game I pop on one of these
onto my
inner corner of my eye or on to my lower
lashline and instantly I feel like my
makeup game has stepped up a little bit
again I'm no professional makeup artist
and I'm not great with blending and I
don't put in maybe as much effort as
other people do on YouTube because you
know everybody has different things that
they want to do with their life some
people want to blend for forty five
minutes and some people need to get out
the door in the morning like me so I am
one of those people where I feel like
the cela glitter and glows really seal
together and I look quickly and you can
do so many cool things with that and one
of my favorite formulas are the
duochrome formulas when I first got the
duochrome formulas I was kind of like
some of these are a hit some of them are
a mist this one right here which is
called Sunset Cove it tends to be a
little more on the sheer side versus
this one right here which is called into
the blue is definitely full-on pigment
I'll go ahead and swatch these so you
guys can see but into the blue has a
really really nice a blue base to it
with a purple shift it looks stunning
smoked out on the lower lash line now
you may be saying how the hell do you
smoke something out on the lower lash
line with a cream product well I will go
in and apply it with a pencil brush and
just put it right onto my lower lash
line I let it dry down quickly and let
it set completely and then I will go in
and I will either layer a powder eye
shadow on top of this or I will just
leave it as is and then here we have
Sunset Cove and this one is really
interesting so you have basically a
lavender base and again you'll be able
to see it's a little more sheer can you
guys see that so you have a lavender
base with gold as well as green reflect
in here and there is nothing more
stunning and then popping this onto your
lid it does not matter honestly it does
not matter if you have a smoky eye on if
you have a warm tone eye a cool tone eye
this will bring it together it will
inspire you every time I wear this on my
lid people are like what the is on
your lid that's amazing all right guys
let's move on to the Too Faced chocolate
gold palette I've been so inspired by
this lately I love this palette I love
this palette this might be one of the
best chocolate bar palettes that has
dropped from Too Faced to be completely
honest now one of the reasons why this
inspires me so much is not because of
the packaging or those smell of
chocolate it's because of the colors in
here and the high shine impact again I'm
very very drawn to glitter and when
people ask me what's your favorite color
live I usually say glitter okay not like
I love
shiny things I absolutely love shiny
things that is one of the reasons why I
became a flutist when I was 12 euros
sold the band director asked me what do
you want to play and I said flute and he
said why and I said cause it's shiny so
I have a long record of just love and
really a really shiny wham bam and your
face kind of products I love the look of
a glitter but of course it has to be a
specific glitter and I usually like it
on my eyes and not my cheeks so that I
emphasizes texture but I love high shine
impact kind of look so this is beautiful
and I think the colors in here that
really inspire me the most are the very
unusual ones like moneybags which is a
true green as well as gold dipped and
dripping diamonds these just really
really stand out to me and again tend to
be a little more cool tone they go on
beautifully onto the eyes you can pair
them together with the Stila glitter and
glows and again this is one of those
palettes where I feel like I toss it
onto my eyes and instantly it looks like
I know what I'm doing with my makeup
which is really cool now another palette
here that does inspire me quite a bit is
the Urban Decay heavy metals palette now
I know not everybody was a fan of this
this year but I have to say this side
over here with the cool toned eyeshadows
really does inspire me and again the
shades that I'm most drawn to are
definitely metalhead which is a true a
purple and then also amp which is a
really really nice turquoise kind of
color I love blues I love greens and I
feel like these go on really really
nicely it does remind me a little bit of
the chocolate glow palette but the
chocolate gold palette it definitely has
more wearability to it and they're
easier to use these guys right here are
very thick and very very foiled so you
need to make sure that you do spray down
your brush and refile them so that you
don't get followed on your face I know
some people will say that's way too much
work but for me I love taking these on
my lower lash line that loves smoking
them out on the lower lash line putting
them on the inner corner of the eyes
with the more peachy shades over on the
other side and then also I love putting
them onto my lid and finally guys let's
go ahead and talk about the Kat Von D
saint and sinner palette this really
takes me outside my comfort zone mostly
because it's not cohesive and I like
things that are cohesive and when I look
at this I think I don't know what to do
with it
now you
maybe thinking okay as someone who does
usually wear natural makeup on a
day-to-day basis like that's problematic
is you have to sit there and decide
where I'm gonna put this on my crease
this on my lid that was my transition
and there are some shades in here that I
feel like are lacking and ones that
could have been put in that would have
been a better fit for the palate and I
did do a video talking about my least
favorite shades for my favorite palette
where I talked about this palette so
I'll go ahead and throw that up in the
cards but you guys it inspires me
because it makes me look at it and
actually put together I looks and
because the shades in here are so unique
and different I am more likely to step
outside my comfort zone I will be doing
it to looks one palette video featuring
this palette for you guys soon which I
usually don't do tutorials or anything
like that usually on my channel but I
feel brave like I use this palette
because I love absolutely love pretty
much every single eye look that I get
with this palette and there are certain
formulas in here that I like over others
there are some shadows that can be
difficult to blend but like I said I
feel confident and happy when I use this
palette and I can use this for work as
well I tend to stick to more at the
saint's side I love like immaculate and
worship as well as Cathedral in heaven
but also these two shades right here a
martyr as well as devil I also can know
where to work very easily and things
like that and it's not that I can't wear
colorful eye looks to work it's just
sometimes it feels like it wouldn't be
appropriate you guys know what I mean if
you're a teacher but yeah that's pretty
much it guys will you let me know down
below what kind of makeup inspires you
what makes you feel creative but what
makes you feel like you can step outside
your comfort zone and are there any
makeup products in your collection that
actually make you feel better about your
skill level when it comes to makeup
because this is one of those palettes
that do and I think it's great
so that's pretty much it for today's
video thank you so much for joining me
guys and I guess I will see you tomorrow
