you at my channel or should I welcome
myself back yet again I feel like
sometimes I take breaks from my channel
that are like a week or two long and
then I'm like oh hey remember me so this
last week I was traveling a lot I had a
conference in San Diego over Valentine's
Day which I attended with my boyfriend
and then his birthday was actually last
weekend so we went to the Grand Canyon
so that's where I have been this week
I'm sorry I wasn't able to post any
videos I had every intention of doing
some pre filming and it just didn't work
out of the way I had planned but anyway
let's go ahead and jump into today's
video let's talk about some makeup
products that personally bind fucked me
okay some of this is false advertising
and some of it is just me being a stupid
consumer I really really really
encourage you guys to be aware of what
you are purchasing I feel like when
stuff goes up online we're also ready to
just jump on it and especially me when I
do review things on YouTube and
especially youtubers in general I think
we just jump on shit and not really
think about hey it's not gonna work for
my skin type hey what's the amount of
product that you get in there all that
kind of stuff so you'll personally feel
like a lot of these products I should
have just read the description I read
some fucking reviews looked at the
actual amount of product that I was
getting in there before it actually
mind-fucked me but unfortunately I did
not and I have a few products here that
definitely it were not - what I was
thinking and they were going to be so
the first two I have here are actually
products that I thought were going to be
much bigger than they are the first one
is the cabinet Quan sensual skin
enhancer and this is supposed to be it's
sort of like a concealer you can mix it
with a tinted moisturizer you can use it
as a foundation a little goes a long way
apparently but I feel like this is so
heavy and cakey on the skin I spent over
$50 I think book and fifty dollars for
this I think I spent over fifty dollars
on this so I'm having an incredibly hard
time at letting go of it if you have any
idea on how I can use this in a very
very natural in pretty way without
feeling like a damn cake face please let
me know down below but yeah I definitely
thought this was going to be like an
actual jar like a jar foundation and it
is this tiny tiny little fucking lip
balm size thing so that is the first
product that definitely a mine fucked me
another one is the tarte young wild and
free
shadow palette the problem with this
palette was the way that art advertised
it so they had this girl with either the
fucking smallest hands in the world or a
different palette in her hand for the
advertisement so it literally looked
like this thing was huge like it was
going over two of her hands now I'm a
pretty fucking small person okay I'm
about 5 to 105 pounds I have small hands
I wear it 5.5 shoe size and this is
super super tiny as you guys can see it
is a true pocket palette so for $32 I
really thought I was gonna get a lot
more in here I should have
double-checked the gram size in here but
I did not so that is definitely the
second product is that mind fucked me up
next I feel like we should talk about
the two-faced peaches and cream
collection the just peachy mattes
palette as well as the white peaches and
cream palette now the thing about these
is that I was gonna roast this whole
fucking collection and I pulled back and
decided not to after going to Sephora
and actually seen the Just Peachy math
in person and the photos the Too Faced
was releasing looked fucking horrendous
compared to what these actual palettes
looked like when you saw them in store
now I still was not too drawn it to the
cult owned one or the white peaches and
cream palette however the just peachy
mattes I could have seen myself actually
at the end of purchasing that now I told
you guys I didn't want it I still
haven't purchased it I never purchased
the foundation or the powder anything
really from the peaches and cream
collection but I will tell you when I'm
wrong and I feel like I really was kind
of off and wrong when it came to the
peaches and cream collection and the
reason why I say that is just because I
felt like the advertising that they were
doing and the photos that they were
showing were such a misrepresentation of
what these palettes actually looks like
in person now I know a lot of people
have had issues with the white peaches
and cream at palette but the just peachy
mattes honestly pretty fucking good i've
swatched about beautiful colors the
reason why I didn't personally purchase
it is because I just don't need it I
don't need another scented girly little
palette like that and I also don't need
any more colors like that in my
collection but those are definitely two
different palettes that totally mindfuck
to me and I feel like it was two-faced
that my in fucked me you know what I
mean I never purchased either of them
I feel like the way that they were
advertising them and the way that they
showed photos was just completely
off-base if I had seen the actual colors
and the actual representation of what
the product looked like in a true photo
I honestly would not have gone so ham
off them and like fucking you know
crawled up their ass and talk shit
alright guys and finally let's talk
about the hourglass a seamless vanished
foundation the stick I recently picked
it up and I recently returned it again I
I knew I knew that there was a small
amount of product in there but it was
not until I literally got the product in
my hand and I twisted it all the way up
and I saw it was about this about and I
just said no and I know so many of you
have told me well live you know you only
need a small amount too little goes a
long way same thing before like I want
to Stassi a Beverly Hills stick
foundation which when I first got that
when I was like oh my god twenty-five
dollars like yes but you know I'm just
so used to having a full ounce of
product in my foundations and it doesn't
feel right but there's not a full outs
okay and this is one of those products
where I kind of knew it was coming at
the same time I had never seen someone
actually screw it all the way up to see
that there was this amount of product in
there and I said fuck no for what for
$54 no thank you
let us pretty much take you guys for
makeup that mine fucked me I know we
have all been there and done this so
please let me know your thoughts and
your comments down below what kind of
products have mindfuck to you and that's
pretty much it I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow for a video all about the
over-sexualization of beauty products in
the fucking beauty world okay in the
community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
