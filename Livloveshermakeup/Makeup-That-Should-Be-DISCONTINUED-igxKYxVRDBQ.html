again I'm sorry there was not a video on
a Monday and Wednesday unfortunately my
computer crashed this is the second time
in two months that this computer has
crashed so I'm thinking about just
buying a goddamn new one because clearly
and there is something going on but
anyway today's video is a fun one I
recently saw Thomas Halpert create a
video idea called make up I wish would
be discontinued or make up I think
should be discontinued and I thought
hell yeah I love that idea there are a
lot of different people that have
followed suit and just like me as far as
this video idea is concerned so I will
go ahead and throw their videos up in
the cards I really really think this
would be fun if everybody in the
community started to do a video like
this cuz I love hearing people's
thoughts on products that they think are
 and need to go and you guys
know I want to talk about lucious a lot
of the time so let's jump right into it
let's start with the two-face they have
the glitter pop peel off eyeliner I
actually did try one of these out my
friends sent me the shade hey mister DJ
it was sort of like this dark green
color with a gold shimmer running
through it very similar to steal the
starfish eyeliner if you guys have ever
tried that and I wanted to love this I
am no wing girl I'm not good with
 liquid liner okay everybody
knows that I've done a video attempting
to put on fake eyelashes as well as do a
wing I'll throw that up in the
cards if you want to check it out but
this was a really really painful way to
remove your eye makeup so the thought is
is that you put about three to four
layers of this glitter eyeliner on I was
usually just putting it on my lower lash
line and then at the end of the night
you can actually peel it off well honey
it doesn't feel good it's a drip a
 eyeliner off your goddamn eye at
the end of the night I don't care if
it's on the top or the bottom but it
made me tear up and any time I would use
coconut oil or any sort of makeup
remover to remove this it started
to ball up and actually would attach
itself to but that damn eyelashes and
then I felt like I had to pull it out
and it would pull my eyelashes with them
and I'm like please don't do that
I need those goddamn eye lashes okay and
so these are definitely not very good
liquid liners they do get a 2.5 or 3
star rating on the sephora website as
well as only two based website
not a fan favorite I feel like two-face
has so many different things right now
that are similar to this you know you
just don't need this and there's no
reason to have a pull or peel off
eyeliner I feel like they've gotten so
stuck in the peel off phase as well as
the glitter phase and honestly just
needs to slow down a second stop
do you understand Darren you need to
alrighty y'all know that I absolutely
love to drag the out of Tarte
cosmetics so let's just keep that
bandwagon going shall we just kidding
but not really a chart shape tape
foundation I was going to say shot tape
shapes whatever shape take Foundation
guys this was an absolute PR nightmare
and I have gone into depth on this I've
done a rant video talking about this
particular subject so I won't go too far
into it but this honestly should be
discontinued ASAP they have a hydrating
version which turns out that it's
actually just repackaged from one of
their old empower foundations I think
that's what it was called
I actually reviewed it that foundation
back in the day and I ranted about it
then you guys could go back on my
channel and see it it was this
foundation that came in a little glass
jar they expect you like deep goddamn
fingers in there slather it on your face
at the time I had oily skin the shape
range was really up too it was
way too dark for my particular
complexion but of course star comes out
with the goddamn tart shaped a
foundation and they say oh we're gonna
expand the shade selection it's still
 all of it is still the matte
foundation gets horrible horrible
reviews if you go on to the Ulta website
or in-store at Ulta you'll see that a
lot of these are just not selling and
they get what a 2.5 or 3 star rating
that's the overall rating in this video
for these products is 2.5 or 3 stars
like I said any hydrating version is
basically just the empower foundation
that was repackaged absolute PR
nightmare a for a tart I feel as if they
should have pulled this off the shelves
immediately after they up but
they didn't and yeah if you're watching
tart you really should discontinue this
 you're really cuz y'all
 up alright guys let's talk about
this milk makeup quad I'm sure you have
never heard about this but my friend
Sonora does own this it is called the
glitter glaze quad and this is actually
a product that you can use on your lips
your cheeks as well as your eyes it is
cream and it comes in these tiny little
four pans you have a white shade you
have a topi shade a pink shade it a
Braun
so this originally retailed for $49 you
don't get a lot of product in here it's
just a tiny little quad I'm like milk
makeup who the do you think you are
retailing something like this for $49
now you can see on the Sephora website
it has slowly decreased in price and
right now it is listed at $30 it is
still not worth the $30 you guys please
don't purchase this product now it does
have a three star rating with only 45
reviews this was actually one of their
first products that they actually put
out milk makeup before they got into
like the stick trend and my friend
Sonora has this she immediately hit pan
on them because they are a cream product
she said she dipped her finger in it and
actually got a media pan which is never
a good feeling and then on top of that
they're very very greasy and oily I did
try wearing the lighter shade which was
a white shade on my eyes one night will
be one out as well as a highlight and I
feel like everybody in the review
section on Sephora Ulta wherever this is
sold are seeing the same sort of thing
it is very very greasy it they're really
not long-lasting you can go ahead and
set it in with a powder but then you're
gonna get a lot of chunkiness a lot of
products or milk makeup are much better
than this and I just cannot believe that
they have the balls to sell a quad like
this for $49 that is $50 for just this
tiny little quat that you immediately
hit pay off because there's barely any
product in there it definitely is not a
good deal in my opinion and it's not a
good product and honestly they should
just discontinue it you know it's really
really hard when you're watching the
Sephora website and you see those
products that are slowly decreasing in
price every single week and you know
they're about to go and that's what's
about to happen with the milk makeup
glitter glaze quad move on to a product
that nobody saw coming this is
the cover FX illuminating setting spray
now I don't want to be too hard on them
because I know they just released some
new setting sprays that are supposed to
be really really good a matte finish as
well as a dewy finish so not
illuminating a bit dewy now the
illuminating setting spray is just a
 trick in a bottle talk about
makeup and mine me do you guys
remember that video I did I'll make up
that mine me yeah I'll throw that
up in the guards if this was one of
those products that everybody thought
was going to be sort of like a dewy
setting spray and it's straight up has
 glitter in it I'm sorry a lot of
people say it's shimmer no
anja splitter it's glitter I am
usually not somebody who has to stop
using a setting spray there is always a
way that you can finish off a setting
spray even if you don't like it you can
go ahead and foil you know certain
shadows with it you can just set your
 know your decollete I couldn't
do any of that with this particular
product that's how noticeable it was now
to be fair guys I am NOT a glitter lover
when it comes to glitter on my face I it
was probably the worst release I've ever
seen from cover effects and so many
people didn't see the glitter
spray coming and while I think this
would be really cool for festival makeup
or something like that at the day-to-day
sort of setting spray this is just not
everyday friendly in my opinion so that
was definitely something I'm gonna say a
lot of people didn't see coming it does
not get good ratings like I said they do
have new settings breeze out they're
supposed to be really good so I don't
want to be too hard on cover-up facts a
the brand is pretty consistent I like
that they don't over release too many
products but this was definitely a fail
and it should be discontinued and
finally let's talk about Urban Decay's
go naked perfume oil rollerball this is
$24 don't need more from you
Urban Decay ok no I can see right here
that this actually does technically have
a three and a half star rating which
isn't horrible but it's been
limited-edition for six months now it's
just stupid
I feel like urban decay is trying to
milk the the living out of the
Naked line and honestly I don't need
perfume from you hunty
okay the worst part is they go and they
put this product out and it's not even
like a spray it's like a it's a
rollerball
see where it's kind of perfume everybody
knows it okay so I'm gonna go ahead and
say this is an item that could easily be
discontinued for me personally some
people may really like this I've never
tried it every other product in this
video I have tried but I wanted to throw
that in there because I don't give a
 about you releasing a goddamn
perfume okay Urban Decay just like oh I
don't care about Too Faced releasing
goddamn shoes and glitter glow job masks
okay damn it
bad they're scratching at the door he
agrees with me Mama's getting heated so
anyway guys that is it for makeup as
well as just one random beauty products
I think should be discontinued please
let me know down below if you want a
part to you because this is a
fun video to fail
everybody who would join a video like
this I will throw up in the cards or
I've a link down below thanks again so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys on Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
