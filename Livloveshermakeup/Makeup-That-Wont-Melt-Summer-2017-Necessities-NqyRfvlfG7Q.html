channel today's video is going to be all
about summer 2017 necessities as far as
makeup is concerned I tried to go
through every single category but there
were a few that I left out just because
I've already packed up those boxes if
you didn't know Tom and I my boyfriend
and I are moving a to Arizona in less
than two weeks so I thought this would
be a good time to go ahead and talk
about makeup that will not melt off your
face because it's already in the triple
digits down there it's already like 103
degrees and I know that I'm going to be
using a lot of these so I feel like no
matter what skin type you have we do
deal with transfer or traveling of
makeup throughout the heat or throughout
the summertime so I hope that this video
is helpful let's go ahead and jump right
into it
I want to start with setting sprays I
feel like setting sprays are super super
helpful to have during the summer time
if you do have more normal to dry skin I
would highly recommend these Smashbox
photo finish primer water this is
cruelty free it is silicone free
alcohol-free and oil free so if you
don't want anything with alcohol in it
this is a really good one now if you
don't mind the alcohol if you are an
oily beast like I am I would highly
recommend the NYX matte finish
long-lasting setting spray or the elf
matte magic mist and set to these are
drugstore cruelty free really really
nice products and I think that if you do
have more combat oily skin you would
enjoy these quite a bit I like to miss
these throughout my makeup application
during the summertime so after I do my
foundation mist a little on after I do
all my powder products mist a little on
and then at the end I miss some more on
and I just feel like that does help with
the longevity throughout the day so I
want to recommend those two guys as far
as eye primers are concerned anything
that's a little more sticky or tacky
will help with oily eyelids like the Too
Faced glitter glue or the elf glitter
glue which is a $3 dupe for the Too
Faced really really excellent and then
as far as face products are concerned or
face primers are concerned I would
highly recommend at the Becca ever matte
if you have like a special event you
cannot be sweaty at all you cannot have
your makeup move anywhere that is an
excellent primer you take a little bit
put it between your fingertips and warm
it up and then press it into the skin
where you are oily that's a really good
one I also have been trying out to be
for a salty unicorn essence lately
really been enjoying that I noticed that
if I do a full drop or full of that
apply it to my face and then go in
immediately with my foundation my makeup
lasts all day long and that one as well
as the Beca first light priming filter
do leave a little bit of a tacky residue
on the skin and
it's really really good as far as
longevity is concerned because it's
going to go ahead and make sure that
your foundation adheres to your primer
very very well so would recommend both
of those and then if you do have a
little bit of like a higher budget on
the hourglass ambient light correcting
primer in the shade luminous light or
really any of them are really really
nice I wouldn't recommend this for dry
skin or normal skin but if you do have
combo oily this actually will keep your
makeup on like all day long I've had my
makeup on for quite a few hours now I'm
wearing this today pair together with a
tinted moisturizer I love the way it
looks I don't feel like I'm getting oily
whatsoever really really good a product
all right as far as lip products are
concerned I do want to recommend a
liquid lipstick now these are going to
be decluttered out of my collection the
reason for that is just because I'm not
into liquid lipsticks anymore but I do
have to say when I was into liquid
lipsticks the Stila stay all day liquid
lipsticks were definitely my favorite
formula on the Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lipsticks come in a close second
but here I have these shades bussy or
bachi no I think it's bossy bossy base
oh and then this one is a Rico and I
used to wear these a lot it was a really
really beautiful formula and if you do
want something that's going to stay on
your lips all day long I think you would
enjoy that and then something that I do
take with me when I have a special event
or when I am backstage is my honest
hacia Beverly Hills lip palette now a
lot of people say that is just not
something that I need in my life you
know if you're not a performer if you're
not going backstage if you don't do a
bunch of special events maybe you don't
need something like this but I do notice
because this is in lip palette form a
lot of these are a little more on the
drier side anything that's a little
drier is going to last longer on your
skin so really really good for the
summer time if you want these to be a
little creamier just drop a little bit
of oil into them you do have the basic
colors down here so you can mix and
match and basically get any sort of lip
color that you want with this but I do
like to wear this when things are a
little warmer I travel with this for
vacation which was really nice and I do
like this when I am backstage and stuff
like that so if you are looking for like
an all-in-one kind of thing I would
recommend the Anastacio Beverly Hills
lip palette all right as far as prouder
this powder is I'm concerned you guys
know what I'm about to say the essence
all about matte fixie compact powder
absolutely wonderful wonderful wonderful
especially if you do have a fair to
light complexion if your medium or you
do have a deeper complexion this might
look a little ashy on you but I
this powder definitely keeps in my
foundation in all day long the tone
correcting powder from elf in cool is
one of my favorites again if you do lean
a little more on the fair to light
complected side and you do have a cool
undertone this is going to be great for
you they also do offer they offer a
shimmer and warm version so if you have
more dry skin you want a little bit of a
sheen you can go for this one or if you
do have a warm complexion I would go for
the warm one really really excellent and
then finally the Rimmel stay matte
long-lasting prosper I've hit some major
pan on this baby right here this
particular one is zero zero one at
transparent it says for up to five hours
of natural shine control I feel like
this controls my shine literally four
seven eight nine even ten hours
sometimes so really enjoyed this if you
do have a deeper complexion they do
offer different shades as well so what
highly recommend those powders right
there as far as concealers are concerned
there's really only one that I feel like
stays on my eyes all day long throughout
the heat like I literally could swim in
this and it wouldn't go anywhere it is
the Kat Von D locket tattoo concealer
creme in the shade white out now I do
mix this together usually with another
concealer but if you want a really
really good formula that is going to
stay all day I would highly recommend
this as far as eyeliner is concerned
somebody did ask if I would go ahead and
talk about a liquid eyeliner I do not do
liquid eyeliner but I did try out did
the Kat Von D tattoo liner in Mad Max at
Brown and I noticed that this was so
hard to get off so although I don't know
much about liquid eyeliner I would say
that this is probably a good formula
because it took forever for me to get it
off when I did my winged eyeliner and
false lashes video which I'll go ahead
and throw up in the card so if you guys
want a good laugh and then as far as
like the waterline is concerned I would
highly recommend and the no tug
waterproof anti-aging gel eyeliners from
it cosmetics this one is in black this
is extremely hard to get off your
waterline but it will wear all day long
even during the summer time I feel like
this is almost like borderline
waterproof I know it says waterproof but
like no eyeliner is truly truly
waterproof but this one is borderline
almost completely waterproof even on the
waterline so I would highly recommend
that and then you guys know I love the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils
these lasts all day long on my waterline
personally I don't notice I get any sort
of like eye boogers or like weird
traveling throughout the day so these
are awesome this particular shade right
here it's called akyüz they do have a
shimmer formula they have matte
they have all sorts of different
versions you could probably also do like
a wing if you want with this kind of
eyeliner this one and the no tug
waterproof would be good for that as
well
all right as far as like foundations are
concerned I have three here that I want
to recommend to you guys let me know if
you want a video all about tinted
moisturizers and BB creams that are
really nice and light for the summertime
like light kind of face products these
ones are a little on the heavier side
but it is because they do last all day
long so the first one I want to
recommend is the Rimmel stay matte
liquid mousse foundation in
zero-one-zero light porcelain this does
not go anywhere it does not go anywhere
it kind of reminds me a little bit of
the Kat Von D locket tattoo foundation
except this one's a lot more wearable it
feels like you can actually breathe like
your skin can actually breathe it gives
really really good coverage and it
really does keep you matte all day long
and then here we have the Tarte to BB
tinted primer so this is basically just
like a little bit of a primer built into
a tint and what happens is although it
is silicone based and you would think it
would slip and slide all over your face
what it ends up doing is going on really
mousse-like and then it actually dries
down to a powder finish so that is an
excellent excellent product during the
summertime the shade that I wear is
called fair and then finally from the
drugstore the covergirl clean matte to
BB cream in the shade of 510 fair is
really phenomenal it's got really great
coverage I would say medium to almost
full coverage you can build it up a
little bit and yeah I really really like
this it is meant for oily skin but I
feel like you can get away with using it
if you do have more dry skin or even
normal skin all right moving on I do
also want to recommend some blush it to
you guys so the first two that I want to
recommend our blush palettes from elf
cosmetics these are the blush pallets in
light and dark I feel like these almost
stain at my cheeks they stay on all day
long really really fantastic the first
version we have here is the dark version
so if you do have a deeper skin tone
this is a really really nice option
these do feel a little crispy to the
touch but because they aren't super
smooth and buttery they just kind of
like adhere to your face very nicely and
that's really really good for the summer
time and then if you do have a little
more of a lighter complexion the light
version is beautiful as well and it has
a nice kind of bronzer tone over here I
actually can get away with using that as
a bronzer as well so would highly
recommend those now I do have a powder
foundation here that I also want to
recommend if you're super super oily you
do want a powder foundation that doesn't
have any sheen to it and you do want one
that will kind of build
coverage on the actual face at the tart
let's see here
Amazonian clay full coverage airbrush
foundation is really good I have the
shade fair honey which is fair skin with
peach undertones it's a little too
yellow in peachy for my skin but I feel
like during the summer time it's going
to be a good one this is beautiful and I
do feel like the Amazonian clay face
products from Tarte really do where and
incredibly an incredible amount of time
throughout the day alright next we do
have some more blush formulas at the
Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush
formula as long as it is the original
one of the singles that are made here in
the US these are phenomenal they really
do last all day again because they are a
little bit on the firmer press kind of
side you can see right here you get a
lot of pigmentation but you don't get
any sort of kick up and because they
just don't feel super super soft and
creamy and buttery they really last all
day long this particular shade right
here is called risque which is beautiful
really really do you like this like I
said the ones that are made here in the
u.s. that are in the single form are
very good the Too Faced love flush a
long-lasting 16 hour blushes are
incredible as well they wear all day
long if you want a really nice color for
summertime I would definitely go with
how deep easier love which is a hot
coral which looks a little something
like that if you do have a deeper
complexion definitely your love is King
is going to be as a blush for you it
looks a little something like that these
ones are not completely matte like some
of the Tarte ones these ones have a
little bit of your Edessa to them but
not anything that's going to make you
look oily and then also justify my love
is beautiful if you do have a fair
complexion you want a little bit of like
a pink color on your cheeks for the
summertime would highly recommend that
as well and then finally guys the last
thing I want to recommend is a blush
formula kind of from the drugstore so
this is the balm cosmetics hot mama and
frat-boy blushes any blush from the balm
cosmetics is going to stay on your face
all day long I guarantee it they have
all sorts of different shades that you
can choose from the insane blushes like
I have the shade Twilight I believe
absolutely beautiful as well they really
really adhere to the skin and they're
wonderful but right here I have hot mama
which is kind of similar to NARS orgasm
this one's definitely more peachy though
so if you want a little bit of a shimmer
this is a great one and anything you
have matte versions as well so this guy
right here is called a frat boy and I
know that they just released one and
that has a little more of like a mute
kind of color and it's really beautiful
as well kinda reminds me a little bit a
baby love from the two-faced love flush
line this one is beautiful if you do
want something a little more natural
during the summer time like nearly there
kind of makeup kind of like I'm wearing
today or tarts exposed or the new blush
from the balm will be great so anyway
guys those are some of my
recommendations for summer 2017 I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
if you want a skin care edition and I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
