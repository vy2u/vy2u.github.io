thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be my final thoughts
on the sweet peach collection sweet
peach yes.we peach collection from
two-faced as well as my finale on my
makeup used up 2016 challenge so I'm
gonna start with the makeup used up 2016
challenge I will have a time stamp down
below in the description bar if you
would like to fast forward to the sweet
peach collection final thoughts or
reviews so yeah let's go ahead and get
started so the makeup 2016 challenge was
created by my friend Ella or Ella's for
living here on YouTube I will of course
link her channel down below thank you so
much al for including me this in this
particular challenge this year as well
as all the other women that did
participate in this challenge so a lot
of the women were actually on a no by
this year which is amazing so they were
using up products that they just wanted
to use up we really wanted to get
through me on the other hand you guys
know I buy new all the time so I'm
not on a no buy but I do believe in
project panning I think if you have a
large collection like I do you really
should try and get through some of the
items especially if you really like an
item and maybe the expiration date is
coming up quickly you should try and get
through it I really do believe in that
so anyway I had chosen about 15 or 16
different items that I wanted to get
through and I do have all of the items
that I've used up here on my phone on at
my new phone look how cute this little
cases of this look like the Becca um
what is it the highlight in rose quartz
anyway I have all of the products listed
that I did get through this year and
then I have the three products that I
didn't get through and I will show you
guys those so anyway the reason why I
have them on my phone instead of showing
you the actual product is because you
have seen them throughout this year and
during my empties of videos also I don't
want to hold on to makeup products for a
whole year like empty bottles that's
just a little too much for me and if I
was doing a monthly empties and I'm fine
with holding onto products for three
months for project pans but a whole year
like holding on to Beauty trash kind of
bothers me so anyway I haven't them
written down here so the first item that
I used up was the L'Oreal color riche
balm this was in the shade rose elixir I
had about half the product left and I
completely used that up I also used up
the Florence quad from the Milani fierce
foil eyes shine so those were basically
like these pressed kind of glitters and
they were kind of a cream finish didn't
really love those but I'm very happy
that I got through those there were four
different ones they didn't have that
much product in each but I basically
just use them as eyelid
I did you stuff with the elfish shimmer
palettes this had a four or five
different cream highlights in it when I
first started I had two that I had
already hit pan on it and then the other
three are the other two again remember
how many are in there we're completely
full so I did use that up which is great
I also used up the Revlon kissable balm
stain in the shade honey which was a
beautiful beautiful neutral color loved
those kissable balm stains very happy to
get through that because that was the
product that had been open for two years
I also got through the NYX butter gloss
in tiramisu I actually have two of these
so I'm working on getting through the
other one right now I did use up two
different color pop eyeshadows and I
actually ended up decluttering the rest
of them so I'm pretty happy because I
don't really like the color pop
eyeshadow so I got her two of those I
did get through the pixie eye pencil in
the shade golden massa as well as the
Stila eyeliner in the shade starfish
they were very similar kind of like a
mossy green color with gold shimmer I
did use up these Smashbox under eye
primer and ousted the BP made contouring
one two three kit from a dr. jart now I
did not get through all of those
products and they had like a
neutralizing shade which is yellow I did
get through that I also got through the
pink highlighting shade but the
contouring shade excuse me the
contouring shade I did not get through
completely it was very orange e on my
skin and I don't believe in using
something if you really don't like it if
you can't make it work then it's okay to
go ahead and toss it so I tossed that
all right the three products I did not
get through the first one is a blush I
cannot find it in the Beauty room right
now I still have all of the items that I
didn't declutter yet I'm like here in
the robe it still haven't mailed those
out to my friends yes because I still
have more declutter videos to do so it's
somewhere in my Beauty room right now
but it was at the gosh cosmetics blush
in the shade pink pie I did not even hit
pan on this I really really made me
notice this year that it takes a lot of
effort to get through a powder blush so
I really want to continue to work on
that this year I also did not get
through the it cosmetics / redness
neutralizing cream I have probably about
a third left of this product but I
really have a newfound love for this so
I'm kind of happy that I haven't used it
up yet and then I did not use up the
Bobbi Brown extra Ches PF 25 tented
moisturizing balm in the shade alabaster
tint this is actually really nice for me
right now because I'm very very dry but
throughout the year usually I'm pretty
oily so this was something that I wasn't
reaching for very often did not make a
lot of progress but I hope to get
through the rest of those three products
so anyway that is how I did for the
makeup use up challenge like I said
definitely go check out Elle's channel
and all the women listed down below but
yeah
let's go ahead and get into my final
thoughts on these sweet pitch collection
so I did pick up two of these sweet
peach lip gloss oils I did pick up the
Papa Doble peach blush and also the glow
kit so we're gonna start with my least
favorite and when I did the first
impressions I did not know that this was
supposed to be a highlight topper a
blush topper and also a bronzer it was
the first impressions not a review so my
thoughts on this have you really changed
I'm a very decisive person and I can
kind of tell right away if I'm gonna
like something or not like something I
do believe in continually using a
product because my thoughts on the
papadum peach blush have completely
changed but this little guy right here
is still not the biggest fan I am going
to go ahead and hold on to it I think it
smells good and now that I know that the
middle shade is actually a blush topper
I think that it actually looks really
nice on top of the pop it on peach blush
so I think this is gonna be designated
for me during the summertime but I just
want a little bit of color on my face
I think the bronzer is very very orange
II the highlight is actually quite
pretty once you get it on nicely and I
would recommend using a little more of a
stiff brush when you apply these when I
applied it in the first impressions I
was using something that was a little
more fluffy but again I thought these
were gonna be very powdery these were
actually not they're more of a baked
jala formulation so anyway that kind of
surprised me I love a baked Soleil
formulation but I was very much not
impressed with the pigmentation on this
if you do have darker skin at like a
medium to tan complexion this is not
gonna work for you I would not recommend
picking it up you also don't get a huge
amount of product in here for what the
$45 price tag I would recommend just
getting anasazi a Beverly Hills blow kit
but for that price if you have way more
product but yeah I mean I think it's
okay if you do have a fair to light
complexion these will show up on you
just know that you do have to build them
if you want to use it as an actual blush
as an actual highlight as an actual
bronzer so I think it's nice for those
days where you want barely their makeup
during the summertime if you're wearing
a BB cream or maybe a really light
tinted moisturizer and you just want a
little bit of a glow I think this is
okay like I said I really fallen in love
but with the Papa don't peach blush this
is what it looks like when I first
applied it on camera I was like I'm not
really that into it but I have a
newfound love for this I think it's
absolutely gorgeous on a fare to light
skin tones this is not gonna show up on
you as an actual blush if you do have a
deep complexion one of my friends who
has a very very deep complexion we put
this on and it was actually more of like
a peachy highlighter on her skin it does
look very beautiful it has that typical
sort of powdery consistency and
sure to it so it does pick up quite a
bit of product you can use any sort of
brush like this but I think it's
beautiful smells like peaches and it
just has a really nice glow to it it
definitely is not the exact same color
as the original puppet don't peach blush
I feel like that one had a lot more
golden tones and also a lot more peach
in it but this one is beautiful it's a
little more of like a nudey peach so
that is what it looks like and I really
am liking that I would recommend picking
that up and then at my favorite products
are definitely the lip gloss oils I have
Papa don't peach and also peach tease I
think these are gorgeous they are very
pigmented they wear a nice amount of
time and the best thing about them is
they are very very comfortable so Papa
Doble peach is a really really nice
neutral color I really really love this
my favorite one for sure and then peach
tease has a little more of a bright
coral hue to it so if there is anything
that I would recommend checking out from
the state peach collection it is big lip
gloss oils I think they are incredible
absolutely fabulous
I think the papadum peach blush is
pretty darn good especially if you do
have a fair to light complexion and I
would definitely pass on the sweet peach
if you know kids so anyway guys that is
it for today's video
I hope that you enjoyed this thank you
so much for joining me and just scratch
myself yeah and I will see you guys
tomorrow but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
