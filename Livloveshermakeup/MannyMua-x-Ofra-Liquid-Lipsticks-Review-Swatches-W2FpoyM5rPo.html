channel in this video I am giving you
guys a review and swatches on the new
mani mu a Oprah collaboration for their
lippies so over teams up with mani and
UA who I recently just started watching
on YouTube I know I'm so behind but I
recently just started watching him about
two to three weeks ago
really love his personality he's very
out-there and I love his sense of humor
so I definitely wanted to get these
lippies not only to support him but also
because I was really into trying out the
ofra liquid lipstick formulation I had
never tried them out and also on top of
that I thought these colors were
absolutely gorgeous so they teamed up
and they came out with these shades
hypno
Ares and also charge I do have hypno on
my lips right now if you are curious and
I have been wearing this for about two
and a half hours so anyway the actual
lippies you can buy for $19.90 a piece
on the Ophir cosmetics comm website or
you can buy them for the bundle or the
little lip set the little trio for $49
and seventy cents now when I bought them
about three to four days ago they did
have a discount code it was 30% off if
you typed in Mannie MUA all in capital
letters currently right now as of April
21st 2016 they are sold out right now
but I believe there is a restock
happening very very soon so I highly
recommend just kind of stocking the
website and making sure that you can get
your hands on them because I believe
this is like a limited edition sort of
collection so I definitely recommend
checking them out I think this
formulation and these colors are
actually really beautiful I'm very very
impressed and yeah let's go ahead and
just kind of get into the review so you
do get let's see here of 24 ml of
product in here and these are made in
the United States which i think is
fantastic this is what the actual outer
packaging looks like I was gonna say
utter puffs other bucks other box looks
like it's just kind of like a dark gray
and a mint color just very very basic
sort of packaging it says Oprah on there
and then the actual packaging of the
liquid lipsticks that looks like this
they're very long and skinny and they
say Oprah and silver and like I said
this shape is called hip now this one
right here is called charmed and then we
have
areas right here which is the lightest
of the three so I think the formulation
on these is absolutely fantastic I mean
this is probably the most comfortable
liquid lipstick I've ever put on my on
my lips ever like literally in my life
I'm a big fan of the Stila stay all day
and also the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
I find those very very comfortable but
if you guys have been watching me for a
while you know I am a flutist that's
what I do for my job and it has to be I
love wearing like a lip product that's
very very comfortable on the lips I
don't want to be messing around with a
product that's going to get all over my
flute head joint which by the way this
stuff and it's which is great but I
don't want to be using a product that
gets all over my flute head joint or one
that I have to touch up throughout the
day and I also don't like when I use a
liquid lipstick and they start to
crumble on my lips that's a huge huge
pet peeve of mine I absolutely hate that
so like I said I've been wearing this
shade hypno for about two and a half
hours this is the darkest color out of
all three of them and it is starting to
come up a little bit on like the inner
part of my lip where it is like a little
more wet which makes sense I feel like
no matter what lipstick or balm or
liquid lipstick you're wearing it is
going to start coming off kind of
towards the inner part of your lip but
for the most part I still think this
looks a very very nice on the lips for
having you know been wearing it for two
and a half hours so overall I think the
formulation is absolutely fantastic
these we're literally 10 to 12 hours
even when you're eating and drinking and
things like that obviously the darker
colors do start to look a little more
unflattering as the day goes on like
after about seven hours I kind of want
to take this hypno color off and then
reapply it again however I do notice one
of the best things about these liquid
lipsticks or the formulation of these is
that they actually layer on top of each
other really really nicely they have a
very mousse-like texture to them and I
have yet to have found a liquid lipstick
like this one where I can actually go
and put in a second layer without it
looking crumbly or like flaking off on
my lips so I absolutely love that good
job Oprah I think they have an amazing
amazing formulation of liquid lipstick
right here and like I said they wear all
day so they're really really fantastic
now let's talk about the actual shades
I love these shades these kind of shades
are right up my alley
sort of like a your lips but better
color and then of course you have that
deep kind of berry like seductive color
and I did match up all my makeup today
to kind of go with this hypno color
because it just reminds me a fall I
think it's very seductive it's very
beautiful I love the colors that he came
out with and I'm guessing the Ares he
came out with this one because he's an
Aries yeah fire science I'm a Leo and
then charms it basically like your lips
but better sort of color and then we
have hip now so let me go ahead and
swatch them and show you guys I do want
to show you really quickly I have been
wearing these this particular lip color
for two and a half hours like I said it
is not kids proof so if you were worried
about transferring your lip color this
is going to happen with these liquid
lipsticks I think the reason that this
happens is because they are so creamy
and they kind of have like a whipped
souffle sort of texture to them I think
they're really really moisturizing like
more moisturizing than your typical
liquid lipstick which is why they do
transfer so I just wanted to bring that
up quickly in case you guys were curious
but anyway let's go ahead and swatch by
the way this is what the applicator
looks like the wand is really nice it's
kind of I will say one of the things
that I don't like is that when you pull
it out right away you do get a little
excess product at the tip of the wand
and again because it's a very moosie
sort of texture I think that's why that
happens but for the most part the actual
lip one is really nice it's very slender
and has a very small little tipped like
as it not tipped has a very nice little
tip at the top which is great for
getting into those inner corners on the
lips so this is the first shade this is
hypno and I love it it's a beautiful
kind of berry brown color it's just
gorgeous like really really this is one
of those colors look like right on my
alley I love that a red lip and I love
kind of like a deep berry lip so there
is hypno and I will say when you first
put these on they look quite glossy and
then they do dry down to a matte finish
alright and then the second one is Ares
then this is the lightest one out of the
bunch really really beautiful kind of
peachy nude color I would say that's how
I would personally describe it this is
probably my least favorite out of all
three my favorite color is actually
charmed which is the your lips but
better at my second
hypno and then my third would be areas
just because I do have a fair complexion
and I find that peachy nude colors don't
always look super flattering on me so if
I were to repurchase any of these shades
I would repurchase charms and hypno
those are kind of more up my alley but
anyway there we have hypno and then here
is aries okay and then the last one we
have is charmed which is beautiful it's
just that typical kind of your lips but
better shade really really gorgeous I
absolutely love it
and it kinda reminds me of like that you
know like Kylie Jenner 90s lip sort of
trend but it's really really beautiful I
think this is such a flattering color on
so many different skin tones and I think
that's probably why he chose these kind
of shades not only because he probably
likes them I notice that in his videos
he does like to rock kind of like a
zombie or your lips but better sort of
like lip shade you know but I think in
general too these are all very
flattering on a lot of different skin
tones and of course when you're doing a
collaboration with a makeup company you
want to choose colors that are going to
be flattering for every single skin tone
so there are the three of them swatch
you can see that they are starting to
dry down now so right here we have hip
now in the middle we have Aries and then
we have charms right there so they are
very beautiful I love these colors again
I think what would make these even more
perfect is this collaboration happen
during the fall time because I think
that people would be running out to get
these and other people aren't running
out to get them because like I said it's
already sold out on the website but I
think of these as very like beautiful
fall colors I know I will be pulling
these out a lot during the fall and I
think they're absolutely beautiful so
let me show you guys up close again what
they look like in the packaging I will
say the packaging is pretty reminiscent
of basically exactly what you get they
don't look darker in the tube or lighter
and then they come off differently when
you actually put them onto your lips
they really do look like that so we have
Aries right here which is that kind of
peachy nude color then we have charmed
which is the Euro lips but better sort
of shade and then of course hypno which
is what I have on my lips right now so
overall I love the color selection I
think this is probably the
it's comfortable liquid lipstick I've
ever worn on my lips oh you can bet your
ass I will be going out and picking up
some more shades that are not like parts
of obviously Manny just came out these
three shades so I will definitely be
going and purchasing some more of these
Oprah liquid lipsticks I love the
formulation they're beautiful very very
comfortable and that's what I care about
when it comes to my lip products so very
long-lasting beautiful colors I think
they did a wonderful job and yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this little review and
swatches thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
