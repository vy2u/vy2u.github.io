my channel today's video is going to be
all about my March 2017 a products I've
used off empties whatever you want to
call them so I have a bunch of garbage
in front of me and I'm gonna share with
you guys it's what I liked and what I
didn't like this month most of this is
skincare I just wanted to give you guys
a heads up and I'll probably go ahead
and throw it up in the title as well but
yeah let's go ahead and jump right into
it so the first item that I did ease up
with some more she Sato facial Cotton's
I have like 4 packs that I'm trying to
get through that I purchased forever ago
these are absolutely amazing super super
soft they are very very expensive like
120 of them are like $9.50 at Sephora I
would not repurchase because she Sato
does test on animals and I don't want to
be affiliated with that brand however I
have heard that there are some really
good cruelty-free options that are
pretty darn close to this so I will be
trying those out and letting you guys
know if they are any good next I did use
something L'Oreal micellar cleansing
water this is the complete cleanser that
removes makeup dirt and oils and also
purifies it mattifies the skin of her
normal to oily skin and I thought this
was just okay if you saw my battle of
the micellar cleansing water switch I'll
go ahead and throw up in the cards right
here for you guys you would know that I
thought that this ring too right in the
middle it wasn't amazing but I also
wasn't super super good so it's not
something that I would personally
repurchase again I do prefer my simple
micellar cleansing water alright another
micellar cleansing water that really
wasn't that great either it was from
formula 1006 this is he so totally clean
micellar cleansing water in the
sensitive formula this is not sensitive
at all it feels like there's just tons
and tons of alcohol in here it really
burns and irritated my skin so I would
really advise against purchasing this
particular micellar water now formula
1006 has one of my all-time favorite
masks of life which is their bergamot
orange mask which is just fabulous
really really good for clearing out your
pores and just taking all the toxins and
gunk out of your skin however this was
just something that I was very
disappointed in from the brand so I
would not repurchase that all right I
did use up a vanilla bean Noel deep
cleansing hand soap or two of them from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the blend of
fresh vanilla bean warm caramel and
sugar cookies it does say on the back
here and not tested on animals so maybe
I would repurchase I'm having a very
hard time getting a definitive answer
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works on whether they
test on animals or not I wrote to them
personally did not get a response so I
don't know I guess it's just one of
those brands you have to make your mind
up about next I did use up the L'Oreal
miss manga Rach mascara this is the one
make up item that I did use up this
month like I said I just used up a lot
of skincare so he's like that either
used up a lot of makeup a lot of body
care or a lot of skin care but this is
what the blonde looks like this was one
of my all-time favorite mascaras you
guys it gives great volume great
definition I don't believe it's even
sold anymore they still have the regular
pink version but L'Oreal does tests on
animals so I wouldn't purchase it anyway
but I'm going to keep that one to use it
with different mascara formulas I did
use up that this candle right here or I
burned through it and this was actually
a coconut shell candle I got when I was
in Hawaii this scent was amazing it was
mango coconut papaya I believe it
literally oh my god yeah it's not better
than any sort of Bath and Body Works
candle I've ever gotten my hands on it
literally was the best scent ever I
should have picked up a bunch of these
but I only picked up one I will probably
keep this outer shell because I think
it's so so so cute but yeah this was
amazing and it was cruelty free I have
no idea what the brand was even I was
just sold like at some little street
fair that we had gone to when we were in
Hawaii but it was really amazing and I
enjoyed that a lot here is the bath the
body works through the candle that I buy
every single winter time it is frosted
cranberry and the fragrance notes are
frosted cranberry Red Delicious apple
and blonde woods very very nice and
sweet but like I said it does not
compare to that Hawaii you can't build
what so ever alright so moving on I do
have the Brio Gio don't despair repair
deep conditioning mask for your hair you
guys will see this in tomorrow's video
which is going to be a product sales
video this is so bad look at $28.00 mask
and this one like to get any boxycharm
and the one before that I actually
purchased with my own money or not a
boxycharm I think this was in a PopSugar
bus cab so the one before that I did
purchase with my own money you get eight
ounces the product it has a very slimy
strange thin consistency to it it does
nothing for my hair and it really
irritates my scalp and now please
understand that I have been having a lot
of scalp issues lately if you didn't
know I just had scalp surgery a couple
weeks ago so obviously I have a very
sensitive scalp but if you are someone
who's very very sensitive this is not
something that's gonna work for you I
can guarantee it it really really made
me itch my scalp it got like very crusty
and just kind of gross when I would use
it like directly on my roots which I do
because I do want to go ahead and kind
of moisturize that area so I know that
most people will say just shampoo this
area don't bring your shampoo through
your ends and then obviously don't
condition like your root
I always do because I need that extra
moisture and that just irritated my skin
further so not a good deep conditioner
especially if you are sensitive on your
scalp so would not repurchase here is
the philosophy purity made simple
one-step facial cleanser would not
repurchase I use this to deep clean my
makeup brushes they do tests on animals
which I totally do not see coming from
philosophy it just seems like a brand
that wouldn't do that but they do so
yeah they test on animals and although
this is really really good you can still
find something that's cheaper and
probably a lot better at cleaning
brushes so I'm gonna try out the dr.
Bronner's soap next and I did actually
go through two of those so this little
one I used for travel and then this
little one I use for cleaning brushes I
do have a huge size that I'm trying to
get through right now I did not know
that they test on animals been out that
I do it like I said it will not read be
repurchasing alright I did you thought
the unani
illuminate milk cleanser I believe I got
this in a subscription box as well it
was really beautiful it's a second
cleanse I had a very milky consistency
to it I felt like it was very hydrating
but it actually did have little shimmers
and particles of like I don't know
glitter in there
not even glitter I'll just say you have
like a shimmery iridescent to it and I
find that kind of strange when you're
using skincare that's just me personally
so it's not something that I would
repurchase but I did enjoy using it as a
second cleanse all right I did use up at
the and that scent body works very very
kiss deep cleansing hand so this was a
very like basic bitch kind of scent I
actually didn't like it at all
it felt like it was something that you
would get from like the dollar store
like some kind of soap from the dollar
store in fact there are many soaps at
the dollar store that smell a lot better
than this it was just winter berries
snowy vanilla and crystallized ginger I
didn't smell any of the ginger I really
like the scent of ginger so I was hoping
to get more of that with this but it
really just didn't smell good so would
not repurchase that but would not
repurchase this either even though
Pacifica is a vegan and cruelty free
brand this is not a good at micellar
cleansing water especially if you are
even the slightest bit sensitive so this
is the coconut water micellar cleansing
toning it says rinse free cleanse remove
stubborn makeup and tones the skin and
it says all skin types especially
stressed out sensitive skin which is
crazy this just made my skin burn it
kind of like the formula 1006 I don't
know if they both have ingredients in
there that were just really really not
good for my skin personally but I love
the kale water from this brand so if you
do have more combo to oily skin and you
really want to help to remove our
residual oil from your skin and things
like that definitely check out the kale
water but this coke
water I would not recommend to anyone it
really really stressed my skin out even
though it says it's for stress skin
alright moving on I did use up the
Garnier clean plus balancing daily
exfoliator this does have grapefruit and
pomegranate it is made for combination
skin the grapefruit is supposed to
purify your t-zone and the pomegranate
is supposed to soften the dry areas on
your cheeks so this is what it looks
like it smelled amazing and honestly was
that back-right of a scrubbing kind of
thing going on so I didn't feel like I
was really really scrubbing up my face
when I was using it but the smell and
just the meat way made me feel in the
morning I thought were really really
nice so I did enjoy it but would not
repurchase and Scarne does test on
animals I did use that the emotion of
detoxifying black cleanser this is a
really really wonderful cleanser but
would not repurchase Boscia does tests
on animals as well which again one of
those brands that you'd be like they
left Maytag sorry are you serious it
just doesn't seem like bozo would but
they do and yeah this basically comes
out in like a black fluid if you are
looking into it and you you know don't
mind purchasing products that are tested
on animals I think it is really really
nice for clearing out blackheads and
gunk of with your skin it actually does
heat up and warm on your skin so if you
want to try that out I would highly
recommend it it doesn't stay warm on
your skin for like the whole entire time
but when you first kind of push it on to
your fingertips and then push it onto
your skin out or put it onto your skin
it will start to warm up and it kind of
tangled a little bit so if you're into
that you'll probably enjoy this let's
see here the only Hendrickson ultimate
lift a gel this is what it looks like
Olli Hendrickson is a cruelty free brand
and I think I would actually get a
full-size of this I normally don't find
a gels or eye creams to be that
significant in my skincare routine in
fact I usually just take my regular
creams and put them around my eye area
but this is really really good they say
it's for a night time but I really feel
like it kind of lifts your eyes in the
morning so if you do want to use this
because it does have I believe a little
bit of glycolic acid in it I would
recommend following up with sunscreen
but honestly this is actually something
that works it says it's gonna lift and
it really does so I did enjoy that I am
talking this little hand cream right
here it went bad this is the skin fix
ultra rich hand cream it's a wonderful
wonderful hand cream it's fragrance free
really good if you do have like eczema
and things like that I actually use it
when I'm in lupus flares but I didn't
get to this on time so it actually went
bad I did use some too little samples of
the CEO antioxidant protective repair of
moisturizer from Sunday Riley this is
new
and I think it's just okay it's
definitely not like the Sunday Riley
title brightening enzyme water cream
that I'm totally obsessed with right now
I feel like this doesn't hydrate as
nicely it feels a little sticky and
tacky on the skin and they do claim that
the actual vitamin C in there is okay
even though it comes in like a jar
if you don't know vitamin C usually it
should come like in a pump and make sure
that it's not exposed to light so I
don't really know how this is still
stable but they claim it is so I don't
know I don't think I would actually
purchase a full-sized it was on my wish
list for a while on this sephora.com
website but I took it off after trying
out a few samples Tom let's see here did
use up the Peter Thomas Roth 3% retinoid
plus high potency retinoids serum this
is what it looks like we both love
retinol retinol is great for your skin
whether you're 18 years old whether
you're 50 years old of retinol is great
I've been using retinol since I was 17
and I just think it's a really good
product now you don't need to buy this
this is $80 at Sephora this is just
basically like a retinoid oil so it's
very nice I'm kind of like the luna oil
if you want something that's not going
to dry out your skin as you use like the
anti-aging kind of properties in here
but at the same time you can also get
something just as good as the drugstore
so I'm gonna be doing a video soon for
you guys all about skin care products
that actually work and I will recommend
a few a drugstore retinol products as
well that are good all right we did use
them our favorite tooth Brian toothbrush
this is the TheraBreath of palasa
maximum strength fresh breath toothpaste
we really like this yeah I don't know
Tom buys it because it's like doctor
recommended I don't know it's just it
tastes good alright moving on here we
have the shea moisture african black
soap dry scalp elixir it is for dry
itchy scalp for dandruff eczema and
psoriasis it has tea tree oil and willow
bark extract in it this has been like a
lifesaver for my scalp Shea Moisture is
a brand that does not test on animals
which is awesome for a while there I
thought they did I don't know why but I
thought they did but they don't and yeah
this is just beautiful willow bark
extract is just another fancy term for
salicylic acid which is great for just
removing the buildup on your scalp and
this is one of those over-the-counter
products that I actually could use when
I was in flare-ups so really really
appreciate and love that will repurchase
I did use up these skin diba 100% pure
high
Roenick acid i feel like such a bitch
because when i talked about this brand
on snapchat when they first sent me
products i was like these are gonna be
 they're not gonna work and the
reason why i said that was because they
are an instagram brand and i don't know
what it is I've actually had a lot of
instagram brands that have been great to
me like viola Voss and all that kind of
stuff but when they sent me this which
they did for PR by the way I was just
like there's no way this is gonna work
but then I looked at the ingredients
list there's literally like four
ingredients listed they are cruelty free
not test on animals non-gmo vegetarian
vegan and I was just like holy and
you know what it actually works so
hyaluronic acid basically will just bind
in the moisture that you already have in
your skin or that you've already placed
on your skin so if you put a serum on
and it kind of binds and the moisture
this will just help to keep that
moisture in there if that makes sense
and it is absolutely fabulous so I
really did enjoy this I feel so bad for
kind of talking smack about skin diba
just because their skin care at this
skincare brand just because they're a
Instagram brand does not mean that
they're not good this is actually very
good product so I enjoyed that a lot
and I probably would repurchase with my
own money and then finally we do have
the C forma day serum from drunk
elephant just found out drunk elephant
does not test on animals thank goodness
they did write to me personally they
were going to sell to Estee Lauder and
they decided not to which is awesome and
then also the Losi tag what is this
cherry blossom hand cream which smells
amazing not something I would repurchase
I find these a little bit on the greasy
side but still really good at hydrating
but like I said wouldn't repurchase so
anyway that is it guys those are all the
products that I've used up this month I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow for my product fails right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
