today's video I have my Ipsy I'm begging
for the month of may so my may 2016 if
see I'm begging if you are interested in
seeing what I got them please keep on
watching alright so let me pull out my
little bag here we have a little card
and it says greetings from where you are
now and yeah it says dear ypsi today I
tried Blake for the first time it was
blank I've already taken blank southeast
I'm having the best time but I can't
wait to get home and see blank XOXO
Olivia so i don't know exactly i'm
guessing the theme is like travel or
something like that i'm not quite sure
but that is a little postcard we have
and here is the actual little bag so it
looks like the theme is travel you see
on all of these locations here like the
totally fell and the Statue of Liberty
and things like that so there it is and
it has a little I like this has like a
little button so it's basically like a
pouch which I think it's adorable so
let's go ahead and see what I got in my
bag oh the first thing I have here is
the it cosmetics that this is the no tub
waterproof and gel eyeliner and the
shade is black I love a cosmetics so I'm
very excited to try this out I believe I
have one of these eyeliners in a full
size and I really do like it they are
extremely waterproof and they stay on
the waterline all day so here it is and
let's go ahead and just watch it if I
can open it to be open there we go oh
it's so creamy and like jet black there
it is that is the no tub waterproof
eyeliner from it cosmetics in the shade
black and it looks like it does have
this little twist down here so that's
nice because its retractable you don't
have to sharpen it so that is awesome
very excited for that the next item I
see here is a little eye shadow trio
from Pacifica this is really cute I have
heard really good things about the
makeup products from Pacifica I
personally do not own any makeup items
from Pacifica I really like they're like
body butters and also I enjoyed their
perfume so I am excited to try this out
it says it is a natural mineral coconut
eyeshadow trio how cute is that I really
enjoy that
one hundred percent vegan cruelty-free
rich long-lasting eyeshadow infused with
coconut for a velvety finish so let's
see what it looks like this is really
cute little packaging look at that it's
so compact too alright so here are the
three colors we have sort of like a topi
color a warmer coppery color and then
sort of like a basic creme brulee color
so here is the coppery color wow these
are super soft did they smell like
coconuts they don't smell like coconut
um but there is the coppery color really
really pretty nice they go on kind of
foiled so there is that copper color the
next one is that sort of like topi
colors actually reminds me of max satin
taupe and that is beautiful these go on
very nicely so there is the copper color
the taupe color and then it lets do that
kind of creme brulee color they all have
definitely a little bit of a sheen to
them there they are so it looks like the
copper and the top ones definitely are
the standouts in there but that is
really really beautiful and I'm excited
for some reason I'm always associated
Pacifica with not really like a makeup
brand but it seems like they actually do
have some nice creamy products so yeah I
excited for that so far so good but the
next item I have in here is the Jersey
Shore spa lavender moisture rich
hydrating lip balm I love lip balms you
guys know I'm a flutist so any sort of
lip balm is great for me let's go ahead
and smell this smells very strongly of
lavender and I don't think I own any
sort of lavender lip balm so there it is
and I do like the Jersey Shore spa line
we got like a hand scrub a couple of
months ago or I got a hand scrub in one
of my FC bags from them and it was
really really nice i do enjoy that
product so that is the next item and
then the next one I got is the Aurora
New York oh my god this is like the
brightest nail polish ever i love
this look at this gel effect nail polish
I don't even know if this color is
showing up on camera this is like
straight up and me on the shade is
called safety orange and it really does
look like it safety orange sort of color
so yeah it says made in italy aurora gel
effect nail lacquer no UV needed and i
have one of those people I really can't
be bothered like I don't spend a lot of
time on my nails to be completely honest
so I do like anything that has like a
gel effect because it really locks in
the nail color and makes it last a lot
longer so that looks awesome very
excited to get that and then the final
item that I have here is the Smashbox
x-rated mascara a volumizer so there it
is and I have never tried this before
and this is what the wand looks like
this is not the sort of wand that I'm
normally really crazy about I really
like um what is it like rubber bracelet
ones but I will be more than happy to
try this out so those are all of the
items that I got in makeup seat bag I
got the nail polish I got the lavender
lip balm I got the pacifica I shadow
trio I got to the mascara and I also got
the cosmetics eyeliner so overall I
think this was a really really good bag
and I really think the little bag of
payment is adorable I love that it's
like a little pouch so I hope you guys
enjoyed my Ipsy I'm begging from may
2016 thank you for joining me and I'll
see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
