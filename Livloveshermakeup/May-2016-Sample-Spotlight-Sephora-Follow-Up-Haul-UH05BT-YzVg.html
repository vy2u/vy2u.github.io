thank you so much for joining me i hope
you were all having a wonderful tuesday
so far in today's video I have my sample
spotlight for the month as well as my
Sephora follow-up halls so I fell into a
Sephora haul exactly a week ago on my
channel well I filmed it a week before
that but it was posted a week ago so I
have had two weeks to test out the
products I'm gonna let you guys know
what I think of them so far and then of
course I used a seven or eight samples
for the month and if you guys are
unfamiliar sample spotlight is a monthly
collaboration I do every single month on
my channel with my friend Meg Bernardo
here on YouTube my lip just got stuck on
my tooth is like it anyway it is a
monthly collaboration that we do every
single month we pick out six to eight
different samples that we want to try
out and she has some really really good
ones this month so i'm going to link her
channel and also her video and her
instagram down below so you guys can go
check out her samples that she used up
for the month um but yeah let's go ahead
and just get into it i am going to time
stamp these sephora follow up all of you
just like to skip ahead to that but i
would recommend checking out sample
spotlight as well because all of these
samples i get at sephora so they kind of
tied together anyway let's just get
started at the first sample i used up
this month was the touch up here one
step camellia cleansing oil this was
really really beautiful and luxurious it
does remove your makeup and it also can
just cleanse your skin if you were very
very dry i did use it to time so i've
used half the package to just cleanse my
face normally and then i use the other
side to go ahead and remove my makeup
and I didn't really like it I thought it
was very very nice but honestly I am a
big fan of my bow show makeup breakup
cool cleansing oil as you guys probably
know and I just think that one is still
better than this one this doesn't leave
any sort of residue like after you rinse
your face or anything like that but i
still prefer my bozhe you do get more
product for the price this is quite
expensive and also I think it smells
better and has a little bit of like a
cooling tingly sensation so I do for
freely boscia I would not purchase a
full size of this but this is nice if
you have very very dry dehydrated skin
and you want to cleanse your skin or if
you wear makeup and you want to try oil
cleansing you can try this out but i
would suggest trying out to the potion
makeup break up first anyway movie
on the next sample I used up was the
glam glow youth cleanse this is the
daily exfoliating cleanser and you guys
know I'm a huge fan of glam glow and I'm
a huge fan of their treatment mask in
the youth like format if that makes
sense i recently just purchased a full
size of this again and i thought the
youth cleanse was just okay i really
thought i was going to like it more than
I actually do so i don't know if i would
actually purchase a full size of this
we'll see so the actual treatment mask
has like actual flakes of tea leaves in
it and it really kind of exfoliates your
face if this just had these tiny little
beads but almost felt like they were
kind of tugging at my skin and I didn't
really like it so I don't know right now
in my guest bathroom I do have the
clearing mud treatment which I really
really like I think that's an awesome
cleanser but I'm not quite sure if I
would purchase a full size of this so I
I'm glad that I tried this one out
because I was definitely going to
purchase a full size of that alright the
next item I used up or the next sample I
used up was the dr brandt oxygen facial
flash recovery mask it revitalizes
hydrates and boost radiance this was
just okay it's supposed to be like a 60
second mask so basically you just put it
on your skin and you're supposed to put
it on to damp skin and then kind of rub
it in leave it on for 60 seconds and
then rinse it off I feel like that's
still not enough time to see a
difference with a mask in my opinion
it's just not and it's the same thing
with like any sort of cleanser I feel
like you're not keeping it on your skin
very long so it's not going to treat a
whole lot of things and that's why I
would rather go with a different
cleanser that smells a little better
than this one and I'll showed bit just
you know exfoliates a little more cleans
a little bit better but this particular
little mask I just don't see the point
in using a 60-second ask i just don't
think it's worth it it did kind of
hydrate my skin but that's all it did it
definitely didn't revitalize it or boost
any radiance in 60 seconds so yeah i
would not purchase this particular
sample again unless i do by accident um
and i definitely wouldn't purchase a
full-size all right and the exact sample
i used up i was really excited about
because it's from dior this is the Hydra
life jelly sleeping mask and you guys
know I love masking and I love like
jelly like anything jelly cooling nice
like that I really really
enjoy that and especially sleeping mask
I've really gotten into that this
definitely had a lot of alcohol in it
alcohol is actually the third ingredient
third fourth and fifth ingredient in
here and I just don't see the point of
that you know if you're looking for an
overnight hydrating mask and it has
alcohol in it is probably not going to
hydrate your skin that well it did smell
really good because you know it's like
the Dior scent and all that kind of
stuff and it felt kind of luxurious but
honestly it just didn't feel like it did
anything for my skin I put it on and in
a meeting it immediately sunk in which i
did life because they have combo skin
and I don't like anything that's too
bracing on my skin but I just didn't
kill like it did anything so I would not
repurchase this and I did use this three
nights in a row alright the next sample
I used up it was the renewed hope in a
jar overnight recharging and refining
moisturizer now this I actually liked I
saw a difference within one use of using
this and I did get to uses out of this
so i used it one night and then the next
night and I really really liked it it
just had a nice consistency to it it
does have a little bit of fragrance I
feel like philosophy products do but i
don't mind i do like philosophy products
and i'm getting more and more into their
skin care I really like they're like
shower and bath items but this was
really really nice and I would consider
purchasing a full-size alright the next
item I used up was this little Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer this is
the oil-free pore-minimizing i purchased
a full size of this maybe six or eight
months ago and I hated it so I did
return it and this balls up on my skin
no matter what I do if I tap it in if I
just lightly rub it in no matter if I
haven't voiced erised my skin no matter
if I of oil on underneath the matter of
I have moisturize my skin it just balls
up on my skin and it has a beautiful
thick like silicone dimethicone sort of
feel to it but I really do prefer my
professional from benefits this just
literally every single time it makes my
foundation fall up it's the strangest
thing so I do not like that and I were
not purchased i also used up this bow
shop purifying cleansing gel sample i
did like this a lot which is like no
surprise i love the bow jamaica breakup
cool cleansing oil and sound like a
broken record but this is kind of
similar it just felt really nice i felt
like it really kind of purified my pores
I seem to really really like a lot of
products from bosha so yeah
this was really nice and I would
consider purchasing a full-size and then
they last sample that I used up for the
month was the md solar sciences evening
facial Repair Serum I used like four
nights worth of this so like I just took
a little amount out like each night and
a little in a long way I didn't think it
was anything special I didn't think the
consistency was that great I didn't
think that it's sunk in really really
quickly I just don't think it's great
for my combo to oily skin so I would not
purchase a full size of that so anyway
those are these samples that I used up
for the month and I will be back next
month to share with you guys more
samples for the month so anyway don't
forget to go over and check out Meg's
video and tell her I say hello oh and
look for high can get into the follow-up
hall so like i said i will post the
original Sephora haul down below if you
would like to see me unpacking
everything and showing samples and
deluxe like samples and all that kind of
stuff because I don't show those
particular products in this I just show
you guys the full-size products that i
bought that i have tried so the first
item i got so that you guys can see I
definitely have gone through already is
the shiseido facial cotton it says the
delivers moisture with the links of
london a luxurious a luxurious gentle
touch so these are just cotton pads or
cotton yeah just cotton squares they are
so soft you guys I have fallen in love
and everybody raves about these and I
was like no I don't need them I don't
need them and then I got them and I'm
like AHA can't live without these they
are so so so soft and pillowy today I
did cleanse my face really quickly in
the morning with my my seller my simple
micellar water and one of these it's
just so nice I feel like it doesn't like
you know eat up all of your product if
that makes sense and you really can just
wipe it everywhere and it just feels so
soft and you really do notice a
difference between this and you know the
other cotton pads or rounds that you use
so i love these i definitely will be
repurchasing for sure they're especially
nice around the eye area and they are
quite expensive but I've never put
anything so soft around my eye area so i
will definitely continue to purchase
these for my eye area and i do like them
for toner and also like micellar water
as well so I've been using these for
pretty much everything and I really do
like taking my simple micellar cleansing
water and
cleansing my neck in the morning because
i don't know i don't like washing my
neck in the morning because i feel like
water gets everywhere and it just feels
I'll grow so I've been taking one of
these putting on some micellar water and
then wiping my neck down and it's just
so soft and nice and I love it oh my
gosh totally losing my voice alright
moving on the next item I had purchased
was the herbivore Rose hibiscus coconut
water hydrating face mist I talked about
this in my files and halle grails the
other day and I just don't love it
honestly I think there's alcohol in here
I still need to double check the
ingredients on the website if you are
going to get a high-end facial mist I
highly recommend getting picture link
rosewater balancing missed if you do
have combo or oily skin if you have dry
skin there's a really really good one
from and I can't I remember right now I
tried a little sample the Nirvana
hydrating mist from josie maran that
one's really good as well this one I
just think have alcohol in it it did
make me break out the first couple of
days I used it I'm not going to return
it because hello in two weeks I'm pretty
much use the whole thing up but it's
just not my favorite and also the little
spray thing it doesn't really it have
like one area where it just like
splotches on to your face and then the
rest just goes on like a fine mess so I
don't know it kind of sprays unevenly
I'm just not a huge fan and I do not
think that I would repurchase this
alright let's see here because I am I
got was the viktor and rolf flowerbomb
soap i have it on this little paper so
that it's not all gross um yes i have
this in my guest bathroom right now we
have it on a little dish to wash your
hands with it smells so good you guys it
doesn't smell identical to the flower
bomb perfume I think there's definitely
a little more like undertones and over
notes in the actual perfume but it still
smells really really really good and
it's just one of those luxurious
products like you could have it in your
guest bathroom you won't go through go
through them to quickly I decided not to
go ahead and purchase more to use in
light our main bathroom just because I
know I'm going to go through it so
quickly and that's like a thirty-dollar
bar soap and come on you can get other
bar soaps that are just as good so I
will keep it in the guest bathroom its
kind
luxury item but I would repurchase for
guess basically all right the next item
I had purchased was the ACV by DP Hugh
this is a apple cider vinegar treatment
and a lot of you were saying why don't
you just use apple cider vinegar because
this is like thirty dollars well this is
also infused with argan oil and
macadamia oil so it's not just apple
cider vinegar and I do like the way like
it makes my hair feel and look so anyway
this is what it looks like and I am
liking this a lot it helps with
detangling it really makes my hair nice
and soft and it's really lightweight
like if you want to spray it on your
root area that's totally fine as well my
hair looks so greasy right now because i
just got done with working out but if
you do want to spray it in your root
area and you do have like an oily scalp
like i do it won't weigh your hair down
it won't look greasy it's really really
beautiful and it also has dandelion
extract aloe vera and other ingredients
in it so it's not just alpha site of an
apple the apple cider vinegar and that
is why i wanted to get it it was just
apple cider vinegar i would just go and
pick up a thing of apple cider vinegar
but i am liking this alot and maybe i
will check out the rinse as well alright
so the next item i have purchased was
the pharmacy lip bloom in the strawberry
basil sent this is what it looks like
and i'm going to put some on right now
it is really really nice you guys so
it's just this clear bomb and as you
guys can see it kind of makes your lips
a little blob see which is really nice
and i love it i really really love it it
smells amazing kind of like echinacea
and a little bit of strawberry and a
little bit of basil it's not like
straight up like they have all these
scents on the website and they don't
smell straight up like what you see on
the website if that makes sense they
have a little bit of like grassy earthy
natural notes in there but it really
really works well I love the way in
which dries my moisturizing my lips and
i believe it is free of petroleum jelly
so if you guys are sensitive to
petroleum jelly or if you just don't
like using petroleum jelly i believe
that there is none in here and it just
was really nice i like it is it like the
best lip balm i've ever used in my life
no I would rather purchase am i if I was
going to repurchase something I would
just like my bite beauty I've got my lip
mask or something like that but it still
is really really nice and I could see
myself collecting quite a few of faith
in different sense I just wiped it on
myself yes alright I'm moving on the
next item I had purchased was a little
kit with two of the Urban Decay
perversion mascara is in it so we have a
deluxe size right here and then you get
a full-size and the kids was basically
$24 which I believe is the size is the
price of the full-size mascara so you
are getting 24 24 and I love this
mascara it's a really really wet formula
and it really does I like the way it
layers but you have to wait in between
layers if that makes sense so it's got a
natural bristle brush which normally I'm
not about that life I don't even like
natural bristle brushes but I really
like the formula on this it's just jet
black super super wet and like I said it
does layer nicely so if you put on one
layer you let it kind of set or slick
sink in not sink in you know what I mean
you let it like completely dry down and
then you put on another layer it
actually looks good and it doesn't look
lumpy so I really really like this
mascara and yeah I'm happy that I got
that little deal and then the last item
that I had purchased was the chlorine
nengo oil this is nutrition and UV
protection for dry sun-exposed hair I
only used the tiniest amount because a
little goes a long way if you do have
really fine kind of oily hair like I do
it smells really good just like all of
these chlorine mango items do one of my
subscribers had said that her hair
started kind of breaking off a little
bit when she was using this the best way
to use this in my opinion is when your
hair is damp I just spray it onto my
hands like five pumps I rub it together
and then I just put it on to my ends so
I don't like brush it through or
anything like that I don't like using it
on my hair when it is dry although it
does give a lot of shine I feel like it
kind of coats the hair and it just feels
kind of gunky so I do like it it is more
of like a dry oil spray it's not like a
super super oily spray but for me
personally any sort of oil I just have
to be careful with so I do like it for
my ends is it something that I would go
out and repurchase right away probably
not but I do think it is really really
nice and I want to see how it does over
the summer with like the UV protection
and help
my you know bleached hair from being too
damaged or looking to you know brittle
and gross and disgusting alright guys so
that was my little follow-up all in
sample spotlight for may 2016 I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
