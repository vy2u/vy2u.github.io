thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having a fantastic day I am
here to share a review with you guys on
a new foundation that I have really been
loving from the drugstore this is the
McLean dream velvet soft matte hydrating
foundation I purchase mine on the altar
calm website for 1099 however I have
seen it in um let's see here Walmart
yeah walmart stores for 799 and Target
stores for 899 so you definitely don't
need to go and purchase it at all to if
you don't want to I am however very very
happy that the drugstore is finally
coming back down and price it seems like
well I mean at least from Maybelline
seems to be staying consistently at you
know under the twelve dollar mark
because it seems like so many drugstore
foundations have been so up there in
price like 1599 up to like 1999 like
ridiculous so I'm happy that this was
under $11 the shade that I have is
number 10 porcelain ivory which is a
pretty good match for me it does tend to
oxidize during the day it has a strong
pink undertone but if I top that with a
powder that is a lighter little bit
lighter than my skin tone I don't seem
to have any issues so I do really like
this a lot like I said I'm there are 12
different shades that range from lighter
shades to very very deep shades so I
feel like they are catering to everybody
so this is supposed to be a hydrating
matte foundation it's supposed to last
12 hours and I have been wearing it
since 8am this morning so for about 10
plus hours I went to work and I feel
like it still looks really really
beautiful on my skin I have been using
it for about a week on and off probably
every other day and I would say that
every single day I come back from work
and I noticed that my skin just looks it
still looks so beautiful nothing has
broken up on the skin I've combination
skin and nothing gets too dry i feel
like matte foundations tend to emphasize
dry areas on your face so I'm really
really happy that I don't have any dry
patches on my cheeks and I just think
that it really really is beautiful on
the skin so it does come to this little
squeezy bottle which I guess can be kind
of annoying there is one fluid ounce in
here which again I don't feel like it's
a lot for a foundation but that's okay
um and
what the actual consistency looks like
it is a very mousse like consistency and
when you rub it into your hand you feel
this nice kind of it's not a silicone e
texture but it feels hydrating you feel
like a nice hydrating sort of texture
you guys will be able to see right away
that this particular shape does pull a
lot of pink undertones so it doesn't
match me perfectly but it's definitely
is the lightest shade that they have and
is probably going to be the best match
for me um but overall I think that this
where is really really incredibly well
throughout the day I think that
definitely has that nice matte sort of
finish to it it's kind of like a softer
mat like Demi Matt sort of finish it's
not completely just like plastered on
like completely matte finish it's very
very nice and beautiful and appealing on
the skin I think that when you put a one
layer on I like to apply mine with my
Real Techniques damp Beauty or beauty
blender or any sort of damp sponge
basically I use mine with the Real
Techniques one today i feel like when i
apply one coat all over my face I
immediately get full on medium coverage
I wouldn't say that it's like sheer
coverage or light coverage was
definitely medium coverage and I did
apply it all over I felt like it covered
my acne scars really well I feel like it
covered everything really really well I
was breaking out a lot last week and I
felt like it also covered a lot of um
big like me marks that i had so that was
really fantastic you can definitely
build up the coverage i've also noticed
which is another fantastic things
sometimes you get foundations that just
can't really get there and they can't
really build up in coverage but this one
is not one of those you definitely can
do one to two maybe two and a half
layers that the foundation and get a
full on coverage look so overall I'm
really really happy with this foundation
I think the texture is really great it's
kind of moves like and it really really
blends and is spreadable and easy to
apply to the skin especially if you use
a damp sponge I think that the color and
the shades that they have caught with
are pretty darn good like I said this
one is pulled a lot of like a pink
undertone but I feel like a lot of
Maybelline foundations do that in
general so just be aware of that but
overall I think that it wears
really really well I love the finish I
think it gives beautiful coverage and
I'm really really happy with it so I
know this was kind of a quick review but
um I really don't have too many bad
things to say about it so I'm really
really happy with this foundation please
let me know down below if you guys end
up picking this up and if you like it
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
