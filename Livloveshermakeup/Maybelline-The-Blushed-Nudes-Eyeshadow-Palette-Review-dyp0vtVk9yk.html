doing another review for you guys today
this time it is going to be on the new
maybelline the blushed nudes palette it
looks like this i got it for nine
dollars and 98 cents on the walmart com
website i will link below where you guys
can pick this up if you are interested
but basically inside you get 12 rose
gold kind of shades and immediately when
you look at this you're like oh that
looks exactly like the naked 3 okay
makes sense so i'm gonna pop out my
naked 3 here so we can do a little
comparison here is my naked 3 it also
has 12 rose gold kind of shades and you
can see it's also very beautiful um so
when I put the two pallets together and
I look at them they look very similar
and I'm like oh my god I love that I
love the thought that for ten dollars i
can get a dupe for the naked 3 however
that's just not the case when you
actually start to swatch them yes they
look very similar in their packaging and
you're like oh yeah this so great yeah
yay no not really i'm sorry guys once
you actually starts watching them they
just don't look that similar anymore so
it's one of those things where it's like
oh man that kind of sucks but at the
same time like i don't know so if you're
seeing comparisons and pictures saying
Oh get the blush nudes and there's the
naked 3 you know they look so similar
which means they are dupes they are not
tubes when you starts watching you'll
see the difference so basically in here
you get let's see here i would say
really only one matte shade in the blush
nudes and that is this one right here
that kind of medium toned light mauve
pink color and its really really nice um
it looks very very similar as you can
see very very nice haha you can barely
see it it looks very very similar to
limit in the naked 3 palette so let's go
ahead and swatch limit and you can see
the difference right there limit is
underneath and that's the one from the
McClain dudes so right away you're like
whoa no no they look similar but no my
goodness they definitely do not watch
the same let's do another one let's take
the shade down here this really dark one
that looks exactly like black heart from
the naked 3 let's do that so that's what
it looks like on my finger go ahead and
swatch it and then let's take black card
from the naked 3 it's what it looks like
on my finger you can already see it's so
much more pigmented and just darker and
not as actually so that is the naked 3
and that is Maybelline one um let's keep
going I don't why not right um so
basically like I'm really not trying to
throw this palette under the bus because
I actually do like it I'm gonna get into
that in a minute but i just want to show
you guys right away because i think
people are mistaking in it righted way
I'm steak anemia and that missed they
are mistaken they think right away but
it is a dupe for the nakeds we want to
snack so let's go ahead and take this
color right here we're going to swatch
that that's what it looks like on my
finger and then we're going to go ahead
and take buzz from the naked 3 which is
basically they dupe to that so there we
have the Maybelline and there is naked 3
this one's look pretty similar so that
is the Maybelline that is the naked 3 so
you know not too bad you're like okay
yeah I thought there's a few shades near
that could work they they they are you
know kind of duple all I would say is
that it kind of continues that way
they're similar they're similar but by
no means are they a do even if they look
like they are ado begin the actual
packaging they're just not so um anyway
I wanted to get that out of the way
right away and now i'm going to put away
my naked 3 same advice that i do love
that palette but we're going to say
bye-bye to that one and we're just going
to talk about the maybelline blush nudes
so it does come with these two little
applicators they are sponge and actually
i normally toss stuff like this however
i used this little one the other day
applying black heart right underneath my
lash line and it was amazing so I really
like a tapered shape I'm going to keep
these little sponges I'm going to keep
them separately from the palette but
just so you know they do come with two
of those little applicator and
applicators and like I said you get 12
shades in here and the only one that's
truly truly matt is this one right here
this one right here is more of like a I
don't even know how I would describe it
it's it barely shows that
like you really have to dig your finger
in there to get really really good color
and it just doesn't have the best color
payoff and what I mean I mean no what
what I'm going to say right now is
generally this palette health and have
the best color payoff if you're a
beginner and makeup and you're working
with some of this stuff and you know you
can see on the top it really has those
nice rosy tones and then on the bottom
it has those cooler deeper tones if
you're working with like the bottom row
and you're a beginner makeup you're
going to love this because you can't
really overdo it you know you really can
build up on the shadow you really can
you know work it into your crease and
not be worried that it's going to look
muddy or that too much product gets on
your brush right away this is not the
kind of product where you're gonna swirl
it around and then want to tap off or
blow off you can just literally swirl it
on and put it right onto your eye with
your brush so um if you are a beginner
or if you're someone who just doesn't
want to be bothered maybe you're in a
hurry in the morning and you can't be
bothered with reaching for your lorac
Pro palette that's just gonna like put
way too much color on your eyes
instantly this is a nice little palette
i will tell you guys right now I never
picked up the original nudes palette
from Maybelline because I heard so many
horrible things I barely heard any good
things people were just saying that the
texture was really crispy that it was
I'm not crispy but just really rock hard
pigmentation was really poor so I was
never interested in picking that up I
saw that they had the color one that
came out and I was pretty interested in
that but I decided not to pick it up I
might just in case I might pick it up
we'll see but i can't imagine that the
pigmentation is that astounding on that
one either i would rather go for like
the electric palette from urban decay
you know if i'm really going for color
however the blush nudes one it was
really the packaging and just how the
shadows looked that captured me i mean i
love those rose gold colors i think
they're beautiful I think it's beautiful
on fair skin tones and I think this is a
beautiful palette for the drugstore so
that is the reason i picked up this one
um I will tell you guys right away they
don't all feel like rough or hard or
like crispy like i said earlier people
are saying about the regular nudes
palette that's why i never picked it up
I just heard so many bad reviews so um I
sure not to even look at reviews before
i purchase this one I didn't want to
sway my opinion I really just want to
get it try it out and review for you
guys but I will tell you that a lot of
these actually feel really nice and
creamy especially the ones that have
like a high-sheen in them they are
really really nice like they do feel
nice and just creamy um now i will tell
you like you can see you get a little
bit of pickup or kick up like you can
see it's a little like textured on my
finger however it does you know blend
into itself like when it goes on the
hand but you can see like those colors
you'll probably expect a little more
than what's watched out anyway so um I
would also say that you know it's not
like every single one has bad
pigmentation some of them are better
than others however like the light
highlight shade barely shows up there's
a few in here where it's like wow that's
that's pretty poor of course now I just
ended up swatching three that were
actually pretty good but you know you
get some hits and misses you get some
good ones like this and then you get a
few that are just really like the first
to the pink one and the white one are
just really kind of pour in the
pigmentation area anyway um I would say
though that the majority of them are
creamy they are easy to blend they're
nice they don't feel super hard or
crispy like the supposedly the first one
is with all the shadows but um I would
say it's a hit and miss there are more
hits than misses in the palette but for
ten dollars you know it's like okay you
kind of expect something like that to
happen but really really beautiful
shades like those two paired together
gorgeous um I mean it's just one of
those things if you don't want to pick
up the naked 3 and you want something
similar I'm not saying this is Duke by
any means but you want something similar
go ahead and pick up the blush nudes
from Maybelline if you want a dupe for
cheaper for twenty dollars go ahead and
pick up the revealed palette nothing
revealed one the revealed two gorgeous
got a lot of a lot of pinky tones a lot
of stuff that really swatches out to
look exactly like the naked 3 so anyway
those are my thoughts on the new blush
nudes palette from Maybelline I think
it's just
really really cute you know I love the
presentation the packaging rose gold I
think it's all really really sweet and
yeah they do have a little chart on the
back to where it shows you what quads
you can use with what so will tell you
you know color the entire eye area shade
the lid with number two so they do kind
of um have little directions on the back
that you can see you can do quads trios
and duo's so they do kind of show you
what colors look nice together however I
think it's one of those pallets where
every single color is going to look nice
you know with each other I think all of
its just they're all pretty colors it's
they're pretty shades that's just how
it's going to work so um yeah this was
my thoughts when my reviews in a little
comparison on the blush nudes from
maybelline i will link below r you guys
can pick this up if you're interested
i'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
