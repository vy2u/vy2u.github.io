thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a great day um I
have tried filming this video several
times I actually tried filming this
particular review two days ago and we
had a bit of an incident in the middle
of the review my cat started crying out
in pain and unfortunately I had to bring
her in two days ago and I had to put her
down and she's was a 14 year old cat her
name was Lily you might have seen her in
some of my videos a lot of people left
really beautiful comments and we're
saying she's so cute and things like
that and she was an older cat she had um
kidney disease she had basically at the
end she had kidney failure so I had to
actually put down and euthanize her a
few days ago so I'm sorry that I've been
a little um am ia the past couple of
days but I i'm back and i'm going to be
doing some reviews and today i'm going
to be reviewing for you the maybelline
the falsies push-up drama mascara as
well as the new hourglass ambient
lighting edit palette so if you guys are
interested in that video that will be up
right after this one but anyway I've had
a few days to just kind of relax my
mom's here so if you see her walking
back and forth she's visiting the wheel
of animals in our family where a big
animal like I don't know we just love
animals and Lily was a rescue and she
meant a lot to me and even though I only
had her for four years she was 14 years
old so um you know I just cherish the
time I had with her and I want to go
ahead and dedicate this review to her
actually today because Lily was actually
my biggest fan in my opinion she watched
every single one of my videos that i
filmed whether she was behind me on my
bed when i filmed in manhattan or
sitting right next to me when I was
filming here she was always watching me
and yeah so I don't need to make this
into a big fat party and sad and whatnot
but um that was kind of difficult for me
and I didn't know I wanted to dedicate
this review to her because she was my
fan so anyway like I said I am going to
be reviewing the new maybelline the
falsies push of drama mascara it comes
in packaging like this really really
cute the shade that I bought was 304
blackest black and they do have a
regular formula and a waterproof formula
and I am obsessed with the packaging
check this out have you ever seen such a
cute
mascara I love it it kind of looks like
it should be a dual ended mascara one
end should be the primer and one end
should be the mascara but in fact this
is just the bottom of the tube and this
is the actual top and what I love about
this is it has that little clicking
thing so it completely closes and you
know it's completely shut when you can
hear and feel that little clicking
motion so that's going to help to make
sure that your product doesn't dry out
and also that you know it just makes
sure that the product stays really nice
and that you feel like it's not going to
open up in your purse or anything like
that the reason why I picked up this
mascara was because of the wand this is
what it looks like it is a rubber wand
which is one of my favorite kind of
wands I tend to really like the rubber
wand because they're really spiky they
have a lot of little spikes on them and
they tend to really build up volume in
my lashes so that is why I picked up
this mascara because I saw a picture of
the wand on alto which is where I am
purchased it by the way was nine dollars
and 49 cents i will link below for you
guys can pick it off yourselves i
ordered it online and yeah so anyway I
do like this mascara and I am wearing it
today i have been wearing it the past
couple of days along with a few other
different products this week but it's
not like an excellent excellent mascara
i will say today is a very hot day my
mom and i were out walking and i have
had a bit of smudging already so i would
recommend if you do have oily eyelids or
if you live in you know a humid climate
things like that i would recommend going
ahead and picking up the waterproof
formula hopefully that has better stay
in power because the staying power on
this one is just not that great and i
think a big contributor to that is
because it is a very very wet slick
formula so what you want to do is make
sure that if you are going to apply more
than one coat of this today i'm wearing
one hope but when i want to apply a
second coat I make sure that I apply it
um before the first one dry so if you
apply it um after the first one has
dried is just going to look really
clumpy really really spidery which some
people do like that look I'm okay with
having spidery looking lashes I actually
think that's kind of cute and I've
always been into that because it gives a
lot of volume and separation but a lot
of people don't like that so I highly
recommend if you do want to build it up
to two coats that you should probably
apply the second coat while the first
one is i would say semi
ret if that makes sense so a little bit
after you apply the first coat you want
to go in with a second coat the reason I
was really attracted to this not just
the brush but also the fact that it said
the falsies push up so it seemed like it
was going to be really great for holding
a curl and really really holding the
lashes up and um I do think it does that
I do curl my lashes and I have to do 30
seconds on each side when I curl my
lashes but I noticed that this really
pushes up the lashes and gives like a
very very you know they don't stick they
don't point down they don't stick
forward they really really hold up
throughout the whole day which I love
even if I hide two coats and even if I
do kind of back home on the you know the
back of the lashes which I like to do
for even more volume and length so I
really really think that's great i love
that it really holds it up all day no
matter how much you really put on the
only thing i would say is if you want a
really natural mascara you're probably
not going to like this one if you have
tried the other products maybelline with
the one who came out with you original
the falsies i believe right yeah so the
original falsies has kind of like a
curved like spoon like brush and I
really like that one too and so I just
thought you know I might as well pick
this one up and I do like it it is good
um I would say if you are someone like I
said if you don't like too clumpy of
lashes if you're not really into the
spidery look if you want something a
little more natural you're probably not
going to like this one but for under ten
dollars at the drugstore at Alta I do
think it is a great deal and the
packaging is so cute so anyway um yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this review I'm
sorry that I've been gone for the past
couple of days um if you guys are
interested in seeing the hourglass
ambient legging edit um review that
would be coming right after this video
so I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
