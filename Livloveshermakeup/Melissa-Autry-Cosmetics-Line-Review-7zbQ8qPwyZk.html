hope you guys are having a really really
good day today I am reviewing a product
that is actually a makeup line that has
been started by a fellow youtuber her
name is Melissa
Autry or I guess the makeup line is
being called M Autry also known as Mel's
here on YouTube she is amazing she is
the funniest YouTube guru you will ever
experience on your computer like
literally she is hilarious she is just
the funniest um I love her she's this
really thick like southern accent she's
just so cute so sweet I just I
absolutely love her she's just hilarious
she makes me laugh out loud all the time
I will link below her channel um I do
want to say right away that I did
purchase these products myself she is
really big on YouTube I'm sure she is
sending out products for people to try
out however I did purchase these myself
so this is not a sponsored video I
really just purchased because I love her
and I really wanted to see what you know
kind of makeup stuff she's coming up
with anyway so um I'm just gonna start
basically I went on she had a whole
video dedicated to the makeup line that
she started starting and why she's
starting a makeup line and right now she
only has three lipsticks and I purchased
all three I have them swatched here on
the back of my hand I am wearing one on
my lips right now as well and I got them
she her video that she described all the
stuff in and she talked about like her
new makeup line directly linked to the
website that you can get at the only
website you can get it right now is real
style which is REE l st yl e i will also
link that so you guys can find the
product but it's if you go on there you
shop under melissa Autry and E L is sa a
u TR y and right now they just have
three lipsticks that they have basically
if she has created so they have pink
Power which is $17 supreme which is $17
and wiggy which is also $17 so you guys
may be thinking well seventeen dollars
is a lot for a lipstick it's true it is
it is more than
a matte lipstick which is kind of crazy
but at the same time you have to
understand that like you know when
you're first starting up I think like a
makeup like brand and things like that
you kind of have to go I think maybe the
prices will drop later if that makes
sense you kind of have to start with
like a higher price range just so that
you're making sure that you're actually
like meeting the standards of how much
money is going out force is coming in or
something like that that's just kind of
what I think about it because I have
seen youtubers that start makeup you
know brands on here and at first their
prices are really high but then they do
gradually go down so that's something to
think about
however I do think they are worth the
$17 as you guys can see they're very
very opaque very pigmented and I really
like them so like I said I'm wearing one
on my lips right now and that particular
color is supreme I really like the
packaging the packaging is really nice
it's very very sleek and it has her
little on it says M Autry on it oops
that was upside down M Autry on it in a
little pink like sketch it's really
really cute and then they have the
number and the name of the product and
just you guys know these are made in
Canada which i think is really really
great
so 5:41 supreme and it just you know
turns up like this and that is the color
of supreme like I said I happen to my
lips right now and it is just very very
pigmented very creamy it feels great on
the lips and all of these I want to say
right away it's not like MAC lipsticks
you know that kind of like frosting
vanilla kind of sweet scent
they all smell exactly like matte
lipsticks so anyway that is that color
supreme I have it swatched right there I
think it's beautiful I think if I were
starting my own makeup line I would
definitely want to hit up this kind of
color range that she got you know she
didn't go too crazy she didn't pick a
bunch of bright colors she didn't pick a
bunch of like neutral nude colors she
really went for three colors that I
think are very wearable and anybody
could wear so this first one like I said
I'm supreme is just beautiful and it's
almost got a little bit of mauve
undertone which I'm not surprised by
because Melissa loves mauve undertones
and just mob everything so the next
color that you guys can see this one
which is truly like a mob
kind of purple color in the middle it's
called Wiggy and it's 5:23 Wiggy and it
says it is a high gloss by the way let
me tell you guys um supreme says it just
says lipstick but this one says high
gloss so I'm guessing that um it just
depends on you know like this one is a
little more like the textures a little
more shimmery like it feels a little not
shimmery but it feels a little more
sleek if that makes sense there's no
shimmer in it but it just feels a little
more sleek you guys probably can't tell
the difference on my hand however I just
do want to say pink power and supreme
the other two are just like I'm guessing
their regular format because they don't
write high gloss or matte or anything on
them so those are just the regular
formula but wiki is a high gloss and so
it does look a little more shiny I
really don't think you can tell when i
swatched all three but I will say that
this one is not nearly as opaque as the
other two but again that's probably
because it has more of a glossy finish
so that metal one right there is Wiggy
again it has that great scent just
smells exactly like a matte lipstick or
like frosting and it's just a beautiful
beautiful color and when you look at it
you're like is there like some shimmer
in there and there may be the tiniest
amount of like silver but I think that's
what gives it it just doesn't you know I
think that's what gives it's kind of the
sheen that you know they're looking for
the high gloss finish however it really
just doesn't show up on the end or on
the lips so it's really just I guess
it's just supposed to be a lot more
glossy than the others however because
it is so glossy it's not as pigmented
but I still like it I love the color I
think it's beautiful
and the last color we have which is this
one right here which i think is a
beautiful kind of peachy nude color not
too um not too Brown not too like dark
you know it's really really beautiful
and this one is called pink power number
567 and I just love this one I think
it's beautiful this is like a my lips of
a better kind of shade and it's just so
creamy it really reminds me of um
supreme it's the same exact format our
formula as supreme so you get that
really full opaque pigment and is not as
alongside someone's calling me it's not
as glossy as Wicky
so anyway those are the three swatches
like I said I'm really loving these
products I think they are beautiful oh
now you can see it kind of when I go
like this you can see wiki is a lot more
glossy but anyway I'm really really
impressed
they all smell really good they have
amazing pigmentation I would say the
best in the batch in my opinion are pink
power and supreme Wiggy is good but I
just don't really love the formula as
much as I like the pink power and the
supreme so anyway that is my review on
the Melissa Autry cosmetics line I'm so
happy that she came out with something I
think it's awesome I love her I will
like I said I will link her channel
below she's just a really really
wonderful person and she just makes me
laugh
all time all of her videos are funny
she's really raw and she doesn't edit
any of her videos which I love because I
also don't edit my videos so I just
think it's very cool that she does that
and she's just like you know exactly who
she is because she doesn't you know cut
and edit clips together she's just who
she is so anyway on congratulations
Melissa on your cosmetics line your
lipsticks are awesome I'm very very
happy I will definitely be looking for
more products that come out from the
line because I am impressed so I hope
you guys enjoyed this I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
