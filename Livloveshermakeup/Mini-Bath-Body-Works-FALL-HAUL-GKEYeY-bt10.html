have a little Bath &amp;amp; Body Works haul to
share with you guys I am behind the
camera again for this video I feel like
the past like five videos i posted I've
been behind the camera the reason for
that is because I got home from work
today and I'm not feeling very good
there are a lot of kids that are sick at
work right now not it's take it work but
sick at school right now where I work so
I'm hoping I'm not getting a head cold
but there were quite a few kids sneezing
on me today and I was like stay away
stay away from me but anyway I wanted to
share with you guys some items that I
picked up from Bath and Body Works so
let's go ahead and get started it's not
too big of a haul we just picked up some
wallflowers a few body products and then
also some three book candles of course
we are all stocked on a fall deep
cleansing hand soap so we don't have any
of those in this hall but let's go ahead
and get right into it so we got two
leaves wallflowers this is the first one
in here is the second i love the leaf
scent and last time when i picked up
false scents I got all of the sweet
scent so this time we are going for the
fresh scents next we have the pumpkin a
marshmallow lot a little wallflowers
here those are going to go into the
beauty room and we also picked up one in
the autumn scent which is a very nice
fresh scent as well just kind of like
leaves but a little more fresh I would
say and this one is going to be in the
hallway alright and then we did go ahead
and pick up kind of like matching
campbell's I guess you could say so we
got two of the leaves candles and leaves
just smells incredibly good the
fragrance notes in here are crisp red
apple golden nectar and warm clothes
spice and they just smells so good I do
like the way that the three but candles
burn so we did pick up two of the leaves
candles and then i got this one for the
beauty room a look at this isn't the
packaging gorgeous this is chestnut and
clove i love what they're doing this
year for the lids i think it's so so so
pretty but anyway this is chestnut and
cloves and look at the packaging on this
isn't that gorgeous it's just got all of
these gorgeous leaves on it and I was
like that's gonna look amazing in the
beauty room on my little stands so
anyway this is a really really nice
scent as well and I do like to burn
white candles in the beauty room since
everything is white in there but the
fragrance notes in here are roasted
chestnut cloud buds pine cedar wood and
velvety moss and the scent throw on the
chestnut and clove it when it comes in
the white barn version I've never found
that it as a strong as the other version
but it's still pretty good and I like
once all right and then we also picked
up to autumn candles autumn is like the
epitome of fall is the epitome autumn
what can I say it's a beautiful
beautiful fragrance if you've never
smelled this you really really should
the fragrance notes in here are bright
red gala Apple juicy fig eucalyptus leaf
and Ferb balsam so we got two of those
so he's are going to be in the dining
room the to leave scandals will be in
the living room and then we will have
that in in my room and then I did pick
up two other um what are these foam bath
oh my god they brought back my all time
favorite scent this is sandalwood rose
they rarely bring this back but every
time they do I have to stock up on it
this is the body wash and foam bath in
the sandalwood Rose scent it smells so
good just like sandalwood arose and then
I also went ahead and picked up night
time T and I'm super excited to try this
one out as well and this is the sleep
version so anyway that's my little Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works haul hopefully I feel
better enough to get back on camera
