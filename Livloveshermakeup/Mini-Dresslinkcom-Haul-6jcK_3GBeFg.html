all cozied up here um I wanted to show
you guys this was like um some stuff
that was shipped to me I ordered from
dresslink.com which is out of China and
the Box got here and I just didn't end
up doing like a halt on it it I only
ordered a few things but I thought you
don't what the heck I might as well show
you guys because the deals are so good
this hat was only I believe like three
or four dollars and it's very very warm
and comfortable and i also got two other
hats that were i believe under five
dollars either 5 or 10 one in black like
this that's nice because it does cover
your ears um but then it keeps the hair
open so it doesn't miss your hair up so
i like that and then i also got one in
gray so love these and I've seen these
that other stores for you know like 30
bucks so I think it's really cute it's
kind of like uh I don't know this
reminds me of like Soho I don't know
maybe I can see that because I live in
Manhattan but um I think they're super
super cute and they were only you know a
few dollars and the next things I wanted
to show you guys again this was just
like a really small alcohol but these
like scarves that you guys probably see
me wear all the time these infinity
scarves I also ordered on dresslink.com
and I believe they were like two dollars
piece and they're really really cozy and
I love them I love the texture i love
the fabric i love that they wrap around
really nicely and i just got one in like
every single color because it was so
cheap you know my order was like twenty
dollars so um anyway just wanted to show
you guys the cute little winter
accessories in case you want to do some
holiday shopping for someone and you
want to get them like multiple things
dresslink.com is a good place to do that
from um I don't know I just think these
little hats are so closing and cute and
um you know you can get three for the
price of one here in the US so why not
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
