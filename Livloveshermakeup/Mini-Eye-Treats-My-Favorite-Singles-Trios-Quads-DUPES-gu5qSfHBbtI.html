my channel today's video is going to be
all about mini I treats I'm very excited
because I really do have quite a few
singles trios and quads in my collection
that I am crazy about I know I'm
normally talking about eyeshadow
palettes like big high-end eyeshadow
palettes but there are some awesome
awesome products at the drugstore as
well as some other high-end products
that are really really good as far as
being like small travel friendly little
country so I thought we would share
those today I do also have some dupes
for you guys that I thought I would just
throw in in this video because as we're
going through these you will notice that
there is a little bit of a trend of
single eyeshadows from the drugstore
that are actually dupes for high-end
highlighter so I thought I would go
ahead and share those because why the
hell not everybody loves a good do so
yeah let's go ahead and jump right into
it the first two items I want to talk
about are these a little eye shadow
singles from Palladio these are the
crushed metallic eyeshadows they are so
good you guys the first shade I have
here is called xenon which is kind of
like a greenish goldish shade really
really beautiful and then I do have this
one which is called Eclipse and this one
is absolutely wonderful paired together
with the peanut butter and jelly palette
from Too Faced I wear this a lot with
that palette but this one is definitely
more of like a kind of antique gold
color or kind of like a bronze shade so
both of these are really really
beautiful they are so buttery and soft
and as you guys can see they go on like
full full pigment so there is the swatch
of Eclipse and then xenon is right here
let me swatch this one for you guys this
one definitely feels a little crispier
to the touch and may have a little more
glitter in it but as you can see really
really beautiful colors and they go on
Ruby really nicely so I love those I
also really love these little trios
right here from Wet n Wild I'm actually
wearing this one today this one is
called I'm getting sunburned both of
these are from the permanent lines you
can definitely pick them up so today I
have this on I have the pink shade on my
lid I have the gold in my priest and
then I took on the definer shade or
their crease shade which is that darker
Brown kind of smoky color I took that on
my lower lashline smoked it out and then
also put it in the outer V really good
quality absolutely beautiful you can get
these for like 399 at the drugstore they
are ultra pigmented and honestly they're
pretty darn easy to blend normally when
I work with a shape like this I'm always
very very worried especially if it does
have glitter infused in it but I do not
personally feel like the glitter really
shows up in this when you do get it onto
the eyes and it does blend out
rather well you do have to spend a
little more time because it's just one
of those kind of shades but for the most
part very very impressed with those and
then I really do love these spoiled brat
trio as well so spoiled brat is more
cool toned as you guys can see you have
a pink shade here which reminds me of
the two face totally fetch eyeshadow and
then you do have one of the best blacks
ever it's gorgeous it does have a little
bit of a silvery iridescence or sparkle
to it so now you do not notice that on
the eyes whatsoever and then you do have
a true silver so I really like these as
well super super beautiful as you guys
can see I'll just go ahead and swatch
those quickly for you as well so yeah
really really happy with those little
trios next we do have a more luxury sort
of quad this is actually from Charlotte
Tilbury and the reason why I wanted to
share this is because I actually have
found some drugstore dupes for you guys
so this is the Charlotte Tilbury the
sophistic it a luxury pallet or luxury
quad this was sent to me up in exchange
for an honest review for PR basically so
I got this for free and I feel like it's
really really beautiful and I really do
like the quality of it but honestly you
guys the little Physicians Formula
Canyon classics quads are so incredibly
similar they are just as buttery just as
smooth I did use this little guy right
here today which is from the Physicians
Formula Classic nudes that's what it
looks like so that is from the Canyon
classics a little collection and as you
guys can see very very similar things
going on here now this one's more warm
tones but this one is more cool tone so
this is the Canyon classics and then
here is the sophisticate palette you
guys can see very very similar shades
going on here they both feel very very
buttery I will say these blend just a
little bit better it is Charlotte
Tilbury but this is extremely extremely
expensive I would highly recommend
saving your money and going for this so
I just wanted to kind of share that with
you guys but all three of these are
really fantastic and I do enjoy having
them in my collection the two little
Physicians Formula quads reminds me a
lot of The Naked basics palette as well
I reach for these more than I reach for
my Naked basics palette alright moving
on we do have a little quad here from
Maybelline that I wanted to talk about
and I know that I recently talked about
in my consistent versus unreliable
makeup brand series how I am NOT a huge
fan of Maybelline eyeshadows and I stand
by that however they do a make a wonder
formula that is really really good this
is the eye Studio formula and this
particular quad right here is called
copper chic I also have one that's call
like marvelous mobs or something like
that all of these are really really good
you guys they're very soft a very
pigmented very very buttery and I find
that they are very goof proof like you
can really kind of layer them on and
build them up which I do like but they
just go on it beautifully so let me go
ahead and swatch these for you guys they
definitely are not as pigmented as say
the Palladio crush metallic eyeshadow
singles if you really want something
wham bam in your face I'd go with those
but this is still a really nice way to
get some colors um they're pair together
really beautifully and get like a really
nice kind of bronze II I look so I
really do like those like I said not a
huge fan of like the other eyeshadows
that they do but this particular formula
is really darn good and now we're gonna
go ahead and talk about some eyeshadow
singles that actually are dupes for or
they have like a dupe that is a
higher-end highlight so the first two I
want to talk about are the L'Oreal
infallible singles so the one I have
right here is called a eternal sunshine
yeah eternal sunshine this is actually a
do before what is it Prosecco pop from I
was gonna say champagne Prosecco pop
from chez fake pop now that's I've been
teaching all day I'm totally out of it
this is actually do for Prosecco pop
from Becca cosmetics so it's a really
really beautiful yellow tone shade and I
actually do have my Jaclyn heal palette
right here so I'm going to swatch let's
see here Prosecco pop next to that shade
for you guys you can actually see so
here is a shade of Prosecco pop it's
just a beautiful beautiful kind of
yellow tone to highlight well this
particular shadow right here is very
very similar from L'Oreal so I'm going
to go ahead and swatch that right next
to it this one may be a little more
yellow tone but honestly guys they are
so friggin similar so on the top we do
have Prosecco pop and then underneath we
have the eternal sunshine single from
L'Oreal and I feel like you could go
ahead and use this and it would take you
a very long time to get through it
either as an eye shadow or an actual
highlight so I really do like that and I
love the eye shadow formula I mean the
infallible singles now I will say the
only thing that I notice is that they do
Crace quite a bit this one is my
all-time favorite this particular shade
is called amber rush and it's really
really beautiful again kind of coppery
shade I do prefer the Palladio crush
metallic eye shadows over these but they
go onto the lid quite nicely I just wish
they'd increase as much so here is the
other one as you guys can see super
super beautiful and then
talk about some eye shadow singles from
the drugstore that are cruelty free that
are awesome they are the NYX prismatic
eyeshadows I don't know if you guys have
tried these um the first one I have here
is called tin these are like a big shell
a kind of formula so let me go ahead and
swatch this one for you guys super super
beautiful so there is the shade tin and
then the next one I have is stunning
it's called mermaid and it's kind of a
little bit of a duochrome it's kind of
like a seafoam green kind of color I
love that name seafoam green it really
does remind me of like a mermaid color
it definitely isn't as a pigmented but
it still is super super gorgeous and
then there is this little guy right here
this is actually called girl talk and
one of you told me that this is a doob
before the Dior glowing gardens pink
highlight and you guys they are hella
similar let me actually show you so here
is the Dior glowing gardens highlighted
this was like a limited-edition
highlight so there it is
swatched as you guys can see super
beautiful and let me go ahead and swatch
it girl talk so you can see them next to
each other I will say I do think Girl
Talk has a little more of like a pinky
base but look at these do you guys see
that so we have Girl Talk and then we do
have the Dior glowing gardens if you
ever wanted to try out that highlight
but you don't want to spend fifty four
dollars you can go ahead and pick this
up it's also very similar to the makeup
forever
um what is it profusion undetectable
Luminizer I think it's called in 0:01 so
really really cool so anyway guys those
are my favorite little mini eye treats
definitely let me know down below what
yours are and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
