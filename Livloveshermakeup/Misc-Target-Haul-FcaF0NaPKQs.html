guys this is gonna be really like
miscellaneous things i have some home
decor some skincare some makeup so let's
just get started the first thing i got
were these little chart string lights
these were three dollars this was kind
of in that section where when you walk
into target they have those like the
little like dollar to dollar three
dollar like under five dollar sections
basically and they have all these cute
little things in right now at the theme
is Valentine's Day sense you know new
yours is done and Christmas is done so i
saw these these are little heart string
lights and they're actually
battery-operated and there's just cute
little pink lights like this and i just
thought they were so adorable and I
thought I have to get those so that is
the first thing I fixed up the same
thing I picked up in that section where
these cute little ten count of pencils
plumbing a dollar and I thought these
pencils were adorable they just a little
polka dots on them and they'll be great
to take back to school with me um
another thing in that section raised
little chart decor and these were three
dollars and basically it's just a little
like it's like a little like garland of
little parts and they're sparkly I
thought they were really really cute you
can put this again I'll cross your bed
or just I don't know across you know
something like up of you know adore
things like that just really really cute
decor and also I think this can go past
Valentine's Day little hearts are
adorable so love that I love that little
section up there aha by target is just
so cute and the last thing I got in that
little section without the one dollar
these are just many erasers and they're
actually little mini cupcakes and I
thought they were just so so cute i'm
going to take those back to school with
me because i'm always in need of an
eraser they always come off you know my
pencils and i always have to ask someone
so anyway the next thing about what this
was this glitter pen it's just black
glitter and it says that it's actually
made with genuine crystals i thought
that was kind of cool and it was like
under five dollars and I thought I was
pretty and I'm just going to add that
into my pencil pouch
the next thing I got was the ship
intuition pure nourishment razor look
how big that thing is should I actually
forgot me breather on this trip so i've
been using disposable ones and i find
you know I really should just go you
know get one and I saw this and it says
it's new and it has coconut milk and
almond oil in the actual like razor card
so you can like shave and it just
lathers moisturizes while you shave and
I just thought it was just it's such a
big razor i just thought oh my gosh it
looks so interesting I want to try it so
I thought I would and um I you know I
hope it works well I just was really
really interested in it I really love
the ones that you have like the
moisturizers or things in there that
help to nourish the skin because i
usually use these schick hydro and those
are really really good they have a lot
of moisturizing properties than that man
so I thought I'd like that one the next
thing I picked up was this Garnier clean
plus makeup removing Clinton makeup
removing lotion cleanser and this is for
sensitive skin and the reason i picked
this up was because it said it said that
is for sensitive skin I get pretty
sensitive sometimes when it comes to
removing my makeup and not remember
wipes which I usually use but with oils
or with like cleansers so I thought I'd
try this out because I have tried the
clean plus line before and I did try the
oil removing uh what is it it's like the
you know the oil I think it was
macadamia oil or something and you put
it on your face and it removes the
makeup it's from the same garden a green
plus line and really really like that I
think it was called the nourishing oil
cleansing cleansing oil or something
like that but it worked really really
well so I thought to give this removing
motion cleanser a try and because it is
for sensitive skin I do get sensitive
when it comes to skin care so I hope
this works out and I hope that it does
remove you know my makeup well it says
that it dissolves even waterproof
mascara and it gently called
foreskin all you have to do is apply
lotion to dry skin with fingers gently
massaged into skin around eyes removed
with cotton pad or just rinse clean with
water that's probably what I'm going to
do just rinse clean with water so i'm
going to try that out and see how that
goes the next thing I picked up was this
Sonia Kashuk sheet luminosity glow
powder it looks like this and it's just
like this solid white powder and I don't
know if this is an actual powder like to
set your makeup or if this is a
highlighter i'm not sure i just thought
it looked interesting and i like that it
was kind of like a texture here i
thought that was kind of cool so either
way if it is a setting powder i will
definitely try it if it's a highlighter
that's fine with me I just thought it'd
be nice to try some more things from
somebody Akasha because I do like her
life let's see here the next thing I
picked up was the elf prism I shadow
palette in sunset it comes with this
little duel and it's sponge tip which
i'm going to talk right now i know i
won't use it but these are the colors i
think they're beautiful and i already
dipped my finger in a few of those and
they are super soft you guys and
pigmented so again i think the colors
are gorgeous and they are pigmented and
soft so definitely a winner in my book I
know they also have a neutral palette
just like that the perth of my shadow
one they didn't happen in stock at the
target i was at but i will be looking
for it definitely if I'm pretty
impressed so far with the swatches um
another thing from ELF I got was the
baked bronzer in Maui it is just this
nice um kind of i don't know i feel like
it has a bit of an orange eat own in it
without looking to money but there was
another one there that just looked too
dark it was going to be too dark for my
skin so i picked up this one I feel like
it's the in-between bronzer from their
baseline and I just really think it's
beautiful it's got a lot of luminosity
to it I think it'd be nice right on the
apples of the cheeks so I'm excited to
try that and the last things like that
I actually took out another packaging
already but I saw that they were having
like this huge lips macro thing at
target and i remember back in the day i
had all the lip smackers when i was
younger so I went ahead and got let's
see five of them so the first one I got
came separately this is just a dr.
pepper classic classic lip smacker you
have to have this one it smells exactly
like dr. pepper which is one of my
favorite soda so I love that and then
the other one I got within a four pack
and it came like this and the first one
is white chocolate lemon the second one
is royal red velvet the third one is
strawberries and cream and the fourth
one is vanilla buttercream so I did
already smell alize and put some on my
lips they just feel great I feel like
lip smackers just bring back like with
memories of my childhood and honestly
they smell good and they do moisturize
my lips so I was happy to pick those up
and that looks like it says that was my
little target haul I hope you guys
enjoyed this i will see you my video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
