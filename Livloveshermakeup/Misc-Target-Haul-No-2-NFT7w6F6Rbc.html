have yet another target haul for you
guys i guess i will go dig in actually
the first thing i got is right over here
we already started burning it we
literally just got home probably five or
ten minutes ago but my boyfriend already
limp asst but it is brand-new as you can
see we have not used it it smells
amazing this is the Yankee Candle
America's best-loved candle in pumpkin
wreath with pure natural extracts so
this was on sale at target for I believe
1299 or 1399 which is a really really
good deal for yankee candles normally
these are like twenty seven dollars so
this is actually the large container so
I highly recommend going to your target
and checking out the candle section
right now because they seem to be having
a lot of things on clearance especially
being a channel anywho the next thing I
got was the suave professionals with
Moroccan and argan oil Moroccan
infusions long proven color care shampoo
for color treated and dull hair I've
heard really really good things about
this I ran out of shampoo so I thought
I'd just pick up a new one this was only
299 which I thought was a great deal and
it smells really good yeah it smells
really really good and it is for
color-treated hair which my hair
currently has been very much it's very
very very much how it treated so I was
happy that I picked it back up the next
thing I got was the hydrating argan oil
of Morocco lotion from organics this is
actually a body lotion I've been picking
up a lot of the organics brand for hair
treatments and hair oils and serums and
things like that so I thought I'd go
ahead and try out the lotion people talk
about this and rave about it on
makeupalley so i hope i was like to like
that the next thing i got was this
Burt's Bees avocado butter pre shampoo
hair treatment with nettles and rosemary
so what you do with this is a pre
shampoo treatment so what you do is you
wet your hair completely you massage a
teaspoon rxr a tablespoon of this
product onto your hair comb it through
leave it on for 15 minutes and then you
head and you use your shampoo yeah and
then you don't even have to condition
after so I thought that was kind of cool
it does have latina olive oil avocado
oil sweet almond oil and you guys know I
love my oils so I'm definitely excited
to try that out the next thing I got was
the Aussie three minute miracle a deep
conditioner oh this is the color one so
all of these actually smell different I
didn't realize that they had new ones
besides the moist one the moist one
smells like coconut this one smells like
a Pantene hair product to me yeah
definitely Pantene ish uh-huh let's just
got that really nice fragrant pretty
smell to it and this one says it helps
protect color for treated here from
damage so 10 times more protection in
three minutes so I'm excited to try this
one out i do love the original aussie
moist ones like they call like that the
next thing i got was the freeman
barefoot dragon fruit foot lotion with
tea tree oil to help soothe tired feet
my skin just has been really really dry
everywhere including my feet so I
thought I'd try that out next thing I
got I already took out a bit packaging
because I wanted to fool it all my hand
and see how it felt I got the Garnier
five-second blur skin renew instant
smoother so this is like a primer and it
feels very very silly pony I already put
a little on the back of my hand it just
feels very very like silicone e um and I
hope that it does blur imperfections and
things like that i have heard good
things about this so I'm excited to try
it out we'll see how it goes and i will
be using it as a primer before my makeup
the next thing i got i got let's see
here too yeah two foundations that i
haven't tried before i picked up the
revlon h defined with DNA advantage
cream makeup it looks like this and i
picked up another little swirly one both
of them have squirrels and then i
thought that was kind of cute so the one
from revlon is an 05 fresh ivory and it
looks like it just has like a swirl of
I guess the DNA advantage stuck which
would be like a lotion and a swirl of
cream foundation so i excite you try
that out and also I got the Maybelline
instant age rewind thing lifter and it
has primer mixed in with foundation so
excited to try that also hopefully those
colors will match me I got them in the
lightest shape that they had the next
two things I got are just for like
pencils erasers whatever you want that
you just put on your desk I'm going to
fill this one up with little erasers and
this one with pencils or pens they're
just nice to have I got those in like
the dollar section of out of the store
um let's see here the next thing I got
are just a little thing of erasers their
cute little owls and probably gonna put
those in one of those hands um let's see
here next I picked up oh yeah I picked
up two of these um let's see I guess you
could call these little like duo's
eyeshadow duo these are actually from
Maybelline and I've never tried these
they're from the eye studio line and
these are what it called I studio
they're just duos so you get 12 like
this and the other like this and they're
kind of like the dual sided one so you
get one thess I already swatch them I
guess I can kind of show you guys one
side is completely just color and the
other is like marbleized and when you
swatch the marble I section it actually
just blends into all one color on your
finger on your eye so I would say that
you get a nice plum shade and the kind
of a brown color there I thought it was
really really beautiful like when i
swatched it and also oh my god these are
super premium super luxurious so really
really excited to try these and the
other one that I got is like blue and
then it has gold on the other side when
I swelled it together was like a Goldie
color so really really excited to try
those out sometimes I just like to try
um you know products that I've seen in
the makeup aisle but haven't tried and
maybe they're a little older or I just
never really gave them a full shot or I
just thought oh those are going to be
you know I looked at those and thought
oh they're baked so they're going to eat
like rough texture and things like that
they're actually really really creamy
and beautiful so I am definitely excited
to try those out also in the makeup
I picked up the knicks natural palette
it looks like this you just get some
nice neutral natural shades in there and
some of them have shimmer others are
Matt I just thought this would be nice
to try out and you know it's just an
everyday kind of neutral naked naked
Duke ish Calot in my opinion the next
thing I picked up was the body fantasies
japanese cherry blossom fragrance body
spray I ran out of my perfume and my
body mist on this trip already which is
crazy so you guys should stay updated on
that when my next empties video comes up
because those will be featured in there
but ah it's really crazy a really
shocked that I already went through a
whole perfume n equal body mist it just
shows that when you don't have a
bazillion different perfume so you just
have one or two you can go through them
so quickly so that was kind of crazy um
let's see here the next two things I got
are also makeup related these are the
last two I got another color whisper I
think this yet this was the one shade
that I don't currently own so this one
is in pink possibilities and it looks
like this just a really really nice pink
color I think it's a little deeper
deeper than petal rebel um but it still
has that nice bright pink color I love
the formula and texture of these on the
lips they're just really really
hydrating and nice and the last thing i
got was i looked at these for a while
and i don't know why I didn't pick one
up but I'm a blush addict so I should
have known that it would happen sooner
or later this is the Maybelline fit me
blush this is in light nude it comes
with a little brush and in this color I
know this color looks really
unremarkable but when I was really
looking at in the store in the light it
just seemed very in the store lighting I
mean interesting like that could really
work nicely on light skin tones so I am
excited to try that out I think it kind
of comes with a useful useless little
brush but it is cute the packaging is
really really cute so excited to try
that out and I'm really just excited to
try it all my new goodies out um let me
know below if you have tried any of
these products and if you like them and
I guess healthy you guys might
video thanks so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
