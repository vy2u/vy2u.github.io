channel and welcome back to
miscellaneous Monday where we talk about
non beauty related topics today I have a
story time video for you guys never
thought I would film a story time video
on this channel but here we go I'm going
to be telling you about the time a view
were actually called animal control on
me and animal control showed up at my
apartment in Milwaukee so if this all
occurred basically a year ago I never
actually brought it up on snapchat or on
any other social media even though I was
very open on there because this was
around the time that unfortunately my
information as well as my partner's
information was leaked and basically
docked on a particular website so we
were trying to be a little more cautious
about the information that we put online
and the information that we put out
there so on and so forth so if you guys
didn't know I do have two different
ferrets a one is a mr. badger and the
other one is Khaleesi now mr. badger is
obviously named mr. badger aka honey
badger
the ferret that is how I had him listed
on his Instagram page if that's his true
name is honey badger and I just want to
say before we get into this honey
badgers are not legal pets in the United
States or anywhere that I know of I will
go ahead and insert a photo of an actual
honey badger here so you guys can see
that they are a little more wild
creatures money badgers are part of a
family called the moose to lead a family
that includes weasels it includes otters
it includes Wolverines and it does
include a ferrets a lot of people seem
to think that ferrets are rodents oh
they are not they are part of the Moose
today family they're obligate carnivores
they're a little different so that's why
I named mr. badger honey badger the
ferrets he is a ferret and I think that
the name obviously threw someone off now
at this time I was doing a lot of
snapchats and I would show mr. badger
all the time if this was before I
adopted Khaleesi and mr. badgers didn't
have a friends so I used to take him out
all the time in the apartment in
Milwaukee and I used to do so many
different snaps with him and I started
to get these messages one day from a
certain person and they were saying
things like why do you have a honey
badger why do you have a honey badger
why do you have a honey badger and I
kept responding to this particular
person saying he's not actually a honey
badger mr. badger is a ferret the reason
why I named him honey badger
it's because he is part of the
mousseline a family which does include
honey badgers but also he has the same
sort of markings as a honey badger
unfortunately like I said at this time I
had been docked so my workplace as well
as my partner's workplace as well as my
home address was put out online now one
day I got a call downstairs from the
front desk in my building and they said
we have animal control down here for you
and I was like I'm sorry what now if you
guys didn't know animal control does
technically need a warrant it's not like
the police where they could just like
come in they kind of need a warrant to
actually search your place but I had a
feeling that this was obviously involved
with that person who had been snapping
me and doing all those things folder I
said okay let him up and I was very
confused when I looked out the peephole
and the guy came and he actually knocked
on the door and he was like this big big
guy with like a cap on it he had that
 little thing you know that like
 utensil and if they use when
they're catching like stray dogs and
 off the street he had one of those
and I was just thinking what the is
going on here he knocked on the door and
I did open up and I so strongly wanted
to be like get the out of here but
I knew that I needed to deal with this
immediately and that if I just got it
done with it would be okay I did let
this guy in and he basically was saying
we heard that you know you have a honey
badger here and I'm looking at him like
dude no how the would I get like a
big-ass honey badger from downstairs up
in the elevator all the way to like the
20th 22nd floor whatever floor we were
on and he was really really kind of rude
to me I didn't like his vibe I just
realized this turned all the way around
so he was in my apartment he was kind of
yucky I didn't like the vibe I was
getting from him and he's like so where
where's the animal we know that you have
it
we got anonymous calls and tips and blah
blah blah we got emails we got phone
calls and I'm like dude I have a ferret
I said you can search my whole entire
apartment which he did he never took his
shoes off he just kind of walked around
all dirty mudding up my floors and
and I bring him immediately to see a
badger and I said this is honey badger
this is my ferret
they said ferrets are legal here in
Wisconsin now to be fair ferrets are not
legal in every single state but in
Wisconsin and they are you can have them
as pets and he
did up looking all around the rest of
the apartment he was opening up
 like drawers and stuff he was
opening he literally opened my fridge he
opened my refrigerator you guys I was
like do you think I'm hiding a honey
badger in the fridge he then asked to
see mr. Rogers carrying case which I
showed him because he wanted to see if I
had carried an animal out and then I
told him I also have people downstairs
that actually babysit in mr. badger when
I am out of town let me take you
downstairs the girl at the front desk is
literally the one who watches him let's
talk about it so that you know it's just
a ferret in there it's no honey
badger he ends up at the end kind of
like picking up mr. badger and I could
not tell you like the fear in my chest
it was just so weird again I got weird
vibes from this guy some people you can
see they love animals and some people
you can just and see they don't and
the way he was like holding badger and
 kind of holding him by the neck I
was totally freaked out and I was like
can I take him please thank you so he
finally did leave and we brought him
downstairs and I did haven't talked to
the girl at the front desk who does
babysit or used to watch mr. badger
people I guess we're taking screenshots
of mr. badger when he was like running
and it kind of looked like he was bigger
like a honey badger
it's just absolutely ridiculous and
obviously this guy knew right away when
he saw badger that he was a ferret but I
yeah and that is the story time of when
a viewer or a so-called fan of mine
ended up calling Animal Control on me
whoever it was whether it was that
person that had been snapping Mia or a
different person I don't know how many
times I had to explain on snapchat mr.
badger is not an actual
badger but people just love to jump to
assumptions and conclusion will take
things very very literally and when you
say things like Oh who's a good little
honey badger or whatever you know that's
gonna that's gonna rub people the wrong
way or some people are not going to
fully understand and again because
ferrets you know you can get them at pet
stores and things like that but they
technically are semi exotic you know I
take mr. badger and Khaleesi to exotic
vets all that kind of stuff a lot of
people don't know a lot about ferrets
and that's why I want to do a whole
different miscellaneous Monday talking
about ferrets letting you guys know how
to take care of them which states
they're legal in which states they're
not legal in because I think it's really
really good to have knowledge and know
about the animal that you're about to
adopt or buy
and obviously know about the animal that
you are watching on snapchat so I hope
you guys enjoyed this little storytime
I'm not as salty about it anymore but at
first I was really salty about
it I was not showing badger at all on
snapchat coz I was so paranoid
but luckily all that that has now blown
over so I hope you guys enjoyed this
miscellaneous Monday thank you so much
for joining me let me know down below if
you want my ADHD story or my lupus story
next week for Monday's video and I guess
I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
