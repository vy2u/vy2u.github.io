welcome back to you what my channel it
feels really weird to sit down and
actually be a filming on my last video
was pre filmed as well as a ton of
videos from last week we're pre-filmed
so I'm sorry I've been a little m.i.a
this weekend we had family visiting as
well as friends and visiting so I have
not really been on my social medias but
I'm back I'm here and if you caught my
livestream from a few days ago you know
that I am starting a new series on this
channel and some new content so that I
don't get too bored and today's topic is
miscellaneous monday.a bisexuality q and
I'm going to be answering some questions
that you guys ask about my bisexuality I
got some really private DMS as well as
people asking over a hundred questions
on this particular post on Instagram so
what I'm going to do is a lot of you
were asking the same question it's like
the same thing just with different
wording so I kind of pieced everything
together we're gonna answer today so the
first question I have here that a lot of
people were asking was how did you know
you were a bisexual so at first I feel
like I didn't really know I was bisexual
my first sexual experience ever was with
a girl my cherry was topped by a girl I
didn't really get into guys until I was
about 15 years old so my first sexual
experience was with a girl it was a very
close a friend of mine and I think she
was definitely more into a experimental
phase and just kind of at a young age we
were about 12 years old and she is now
happily married with three children
husband so it just goes to show you I
feel like everybody is on the spectrum
you know what I mean and I think that
for her it was more so just fooling
around but for me and that's a lot to me
not actually have sex with a boy until I
was about 15 14 15 years old and when I
did like I said my cherry had already
been popped by a girl and I had already
had all of those experiences done so
when I actually did have sex with my
boyfriend at the time it was interesting
and it felt right just like how it felt
right to be with a girl so that's kind
of how I knew I was bisexual I would say
by the age of 15 I could definitely say
hey I like both girls and guys I wasn't
more attracted to one over the other
there may have been times in my life
where I dated women more frequently or
I've dated men for it more frequently
but I would say at the end of the day
yeah you know I'm definitely bisexual
because I'm attracted to people not
sexist alright the next question
is have you been with more men or women
I have definitely been with more women
in my life like I said I've gone through
phases where I've really been with a lot
of women or like a lot of guys or it's
been interchanging but yes I have
definitely been if you're looking at the
ratio I have been with more women than
men we have how does your boyfriend feel
about you being a bisexual and are you
two currently in a polyamorous
relationship no we are not currently in
a polyamorous relationship and he has
been nothing about supportive about my
bisexuality and he definitely fulfills
my needs both emotionally as well as
physically but also he is incredibly
supportive of me expressing up my
sexuality with other women which I
really do appreciate and we are both
comfortable with having some fun all
right up next we have what are your turn
ons and turn off so when it comes to men
and women I'm open to pretty much
everybody except I don't like dating
people or seeing people or hooking up
with people that are younger than me
yeah anybody under 25 or under my age
group I've never dated anybody younger
than me it's just never been my style
I've absolutely never been into it I
like people that are older than me I
like the maturity level and I just
prefer I know just prefer people that
are older than me up next we have how
did your family react how did you come
out I did not have to come out my family
is super chill my dad was great
my mom is great they're all
supportive even my brother so there was
absolutely no coming out because I
didn't feel like I needed to come out
and my family got to just fine when I
grabbed him a girl I bring home a girl
when I brought home a guy I bring home a
guy they didn't have any opinion on it
and finally I did get a lot of questions
about what is your advice on coming out
to your family coming out to your
friends as being bisexual in this day
and age it really shouldn't be a problem
and I'm very very sorry if you have
somebody in your life that is
troublesome with this if they are giving
you a hard time or if they're just being
a burden and not happy with you being
bisexual or you bring me home a girl or
bringing home a man or whoever the hell
you want to bring home or if you're in a
polyamorous relationship but I can't
specifically put a label on it for you I
know some people were telling me
bisexual if I just open up a magazine
and I can appreciate a woman's beauty
abut I don't want to be with them
sexually in the bedroom does that still
mean I'm bisexual like I said everybody
is on the spectrum in my opinion both
females and males are on the spectrum so
there seem to be a lot of comments of
people being like oh my god I'm worried
that I'm bisexual and I mean you
shouldn't be worried it's just it's okay
it's totally fine I mean I'm really
sorry again if you have someone in your
life that is being particularly harsh on
you or they don't want you to be
bisexual III don't I don't go that way I
don't hang out with people like that
I've never had anybody in my life that
has completely shut me down like that or
turned me down and said no I can't be
with you because you're bisexual or I
can't I can't deal with you because
you're bisexual I've never had that
issue but again it's just about how you
feel you want to identify yourself you
don't have to put a label on it and just
do what you're comfortable with and be
who you are it's totally fine
so anyway that is it for this video guys
like I said next week's the
miscellaneous Monday will be all about
polyamorous relationships I'm going to
talk about what polyamorous
relationships are like what it was like
being with two guys in a relationship as
well as two women in a relationship how
the sex looks different
what happened why they didn't end so
well and I'll update you very soon so I
hope you enjoyed this video I will have
a new Beauty video going up for you guys
tomorrow and I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
