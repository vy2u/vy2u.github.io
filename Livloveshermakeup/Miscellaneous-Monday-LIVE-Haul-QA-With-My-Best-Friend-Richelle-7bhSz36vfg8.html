different Jack's in March okay

going to do is we do want this to be a
playback so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you guys all the stuff that we called
and then we will do a Q&amp;amp;A and take a
look at the chat after so if you want to
start asking certain questions we will
scroll back but yeah let's go ahead and
jump into the hall I will start you amou
sir yeah okay I'm gonna start I only got
a few things I went to lush so we went
to lush where else do we go we went into
the body shop right and Macy's may see
it's got Macy so the first thing that I
got was the no droughts dry shampoo this
is from lush it smells really really
good it is I believe grapefruit and lime
powder and I thought I could make my
hair a little stiff you guys know I like
to wear my hair up you liked
her down so you would know better how
where's your hair down but yeah it just
as a quick brush through your hair after
you so much
these are Dean facts okay first of all
okay so these are the mouthwash tabs
from lush and the girl there she was so
sweet but we went in and we were looking
at these because I've heard about their
mouthwash as well as their toothpaste
tabs and I was like I really want to try
this and she goes go take a sip of water
pop one in your mouth do it in the
drinking fountain go the drinking
fountain that doesn't work it doesn't
work so we're literally you know where
you wash your hair absolutely wash your
hands at the sink at lush we have to put
our mouths like on that stabbed people
we're looking at us like we're
rude and crazy we're in the natural
dyeing I know so what you do guys is you
take one of these you fill your mouth up
with a little bit of water then you chew
it and then you gargle and it's like a
mouthwash in a tab so very convenient
and I really like those so far and then
I only got one other thing and that was
a lip scrub but this one is honey so
I've tried all of them I love honey I
love mint juleps and I love at Bubba
cotton so that's everything that I got
okay you go ahead okay well I've never
been inside a logue wait let's just
check it out really quickly let's check
this stream here yeah let's see here my
first time watching a live stream it
loves sassiness
Oh Congrats Rochelle wish you happiness

collab coming up on I believe Tuesday

beautiful congratulations what is your
absolute favorite highlight highlight ly

blossom blossom the pink one what about
you what's your favorite I love mixing
shades from the moon chang-keuk mood now
glow cat
it's really good yes sir exactly exactly
all right guys so we're gonna continue
on to the hall here and then I will come
back to the shack yeah so much good I've
never been in a lush before I've only
ordered online and so I wanted to get
one of the homemade masks we got beef
seaweed please
I liked it it's very thick there's a lot
in here it does look like that you know
what this reminds me of it reminds me
exactly of the what is a glam
glow with the tea leaves in it yet I
have you have to like scrub it off and
it's hella messy but it's one of the
Refresh masks you know yeah there's I
think there's rosemary and lavender
thank you guys so I'm a little sensitive
to lavender so it's not amazing for me
um but she likes him she has like red
skin she gets a little bit of Asia I got
one of the lotion bars
I need of the tin and this is in Pearl I
really like this I've used this once out
of the shower and this smell six would
be like I don't Williams how you do this
so those bars that you massage into your
skin you get out of the shower or even
dry yeah your skin doesn't have to be
wet bygones ugh it's just with you know
the more similar hands they say to rub
it in your hands so it starts to melt
and then warm up rub everything yeah
it's nice it's really nice it smells
great Tyler said it's good for stretch
marks and all your stretch marks I don't
believe any of action it's like the
Brazilian booboo cream it looks like
you're stretching I'm like nothing can
get rid of all that cellulite on that
ass let's see what the chat says here um
did he do anything for National Fair Day
today will you guys I'm in Michigan so
I'm not with the babies but I did post a
photo my dad is taking care of them it's
not like here you guys we have a kitty
we've got a kitty here and she's crying
and she clearly doesn't want to be on
camera support your energy in her chance
for Nala this is her adopted kitty we
also have her dog
right next to us and she also has a
cockatiel who is adorable you guys are
too funny all bags strange bloody fella
I don't know do we have a pervert in
here do we have sir are you all going
dress shopping together I actually have
my dress already it is so beautiful you
guys when the wedding day comes I'm
taken
yeah I don't want it posted online
anywhere before the day or else you will
be all we don't want policy it exactly
yeah yeah you've never tried anything
from lush yeah it's kind of like you
look I've sent you a few things from
lush but you've not any one store I've
never been in exactly I also got the key
not sure what I'll say this is the key
lime pie lip balm this is really nice
it doesn't show up green on your lips
it's just glossy you decide if you liked
it good if you guys are into lime it
smells like yeah really smells like a
piece of I know guys it's not a gene
it's got sparkle in it you don't see
that you don't it's just it's reflective
but it's not it's not glare and then
went at the body shop was wow you guys
know I'm obsessed with Satsuma I know
he's so orgasmic it's the best
thing ever and this smells like just
fresh cuts oranges and clementines yeah
so I got the hand it seems really good
so she got the hand cream and then she
also got the lip butter and this is nice
I think these are rather new because I
used to have the stick one and allow us
some more Adonis cuz it's thicker it's
just a different touch it earns a little
bit of a white cast so but it's too much
if you work it and it's fine
right okay so what else okay that was
everything I think those everything from
a lot okay cool um the main reason we
went to this mall is I needed shoes I
needed some heels for my dress we went
to Macy's first they didn't have
what did they say the two old lesbians
are watching we need to hear your
channel
[Laughter]
no I'm not a perv I said I worked for
less as a student he's the owner I said
strange fella okay no I thought some of
you guys sometimes creepy guys come into
the street and they say things like hey
girl take your shirt off
hey girl take that off you know
that's what I thought you show them this
shows okay oh yes
I got these from actually JCPenney and
they see it lets okay I'm from JCPenney
I needed something nude on my dress is
actually not completely white the bust
area is and it is a ball gown but the
bottom is like a champagne II very like
pale pink it's a pure a super-pretty
so or just not that you can see the
shoes with a dress there's so much poop
but something like this that's kind of
like topi or nude and this is something
that can go with everything so if you
want to wear these to you know your
grandma's birthday everywhere she can
reuse these obviously well and I yeah we
already planned the honeymoon is gonna
be a Royal Caribbean cruise yes and then
also the fat last little thing she got
this is so cute you guys yeah I'd when I
saw this look at this delicate little
neck oh and a show it's not alright
there is rose gold silver and gold and
you can see the price on this was
ridiculous and then on top of that she
gave me like a 35 sounds like $8 but
it's so delicate and I feel like when
you have kind of a big cupcake down
something nice and delicate and that's
gonna be well because I wanted to wear
rose gold but the beading on the dress
on the straps actually had silver in it
so I just figured out this is my way of
getting a little beautiful shoes there
we go let's see here weird oh where did
you get it they're worse the shoes and
the necklace
JCPenney believe it or not he went to
JCPenney
and I got the shoes and the necklace for
$35 it was all on sale for the week Oh
exactly
ya'll cracked me up
like me might be so nice you guys to
take a break I know that for a while
there I was not inspired by YouTube for
a while and I've been a lot happier now
that I between the miscellaneous Monday
and I know I've only gotten really
technically one mystery video out but
it's been helping me because like all
the beauty stuff all the time is just
not enough for me and but yeah I will be
back with my normal videos on Monday if
you guys are curious is that everything
that we hold I think so okay so now if
you want to ask us some questions and
we'll go to the top segment let me
scroll up and see when is your wedding
my wedding is in December December 15th
someone said take a shot every time they
drink or they talk or just excited we're
excited alright so when is the wedding
December fits yes there you go um
someone said hey Liv are officially off
snapchat I am off snappy shot you guys
they deleted it I just can't
yeah first of all that update is
it's it's okay I never
posted on it but I don't know I I hate
it I absolutely hate it and second of
all I felt like I was spending way too
much time doing that and again I kind of
had this thing about a month ago where I
felt like I was spending too much time
just on YouTube and social media in
general which is why I have taken a step
back if you haven't noticed that other
than focusing as much but I think it's
important to just remember what's most
important to you what you want to be
doing like spending your time on and
like my boyfriend and stuff that means a
lot more to me than you know constantly
being on snapchat and showing what kind
of food I'm eating that day favorite why
what are we drinking right now if we are
talking over each other you guys okay
what are we having what is this wine
that is my stellar Ossa mhm and it's a
Moscato too Moscato it's got a little
bit above mine um but I am drinking coke
with this like moonshine it's got Mary
shine you guys damn and those cherries
are filled with alcohol oh I
look - yeah what did she say I hate snow
now that update was terrible and they
should have swallowed their pride and
reversed it but they didn't so they're
dead now they're dead
it's Lucci and I would say they're
cancelled let's see here glad I'm not
the only one who hates the new snapchat
yeah it really is annoying isn't matter
for you yeah we'll keep going up is
instant better for you yeah I like insta
because I feel like I can go on insta
stories but I definitely don't post as
much as I did on story on it's all in
one place someone wants to know what are
your wedding colors well I'm not doing
too much for decor on because of the
venue it's right it's an old-school
place that we're getting married um but
she's going to actually be wearing this
color go Yuri enough it's I know I look
like a potato right now I'm wearing a
big water it's like a silvery gray with
like a hint of wine left
yeah I think of lilac and then she has
kind of that peachy pinky dress yes
so yeah the groomsmen are just gonna be
wearing you know black suits with a
silver tie exactly yep again simple it's
a small wedding someone said I got
married December 22nd graduation can't
wait for Mondays and Wednesdays videos
thank you guys I appreciate that you
guys are enjoying this on Monday I'm
going to have the video all about that
time somebody called animal control on
me because they thought mr. badger was a
honey badger like a real badger me all
about that I'm someone said Olivia at
least you knew what the hell I'm talking
about yeah I did know what will your
makeup you like I think I'm going to be
doing like a rose gold eye looks I want
to try the steal a kitten like that
glitter and glow and to do the glitter
and glow in just on my lid and you guys
know I don't wear too much face makeup I
like my freckles to show through but I
do like glowy makeup yeah she'll
probably do NARS sheer glow foundation
that's my favorite collection you're a
collector there you go yeah see Tony
said 18 years ago I see you Tony I know
okay yeah have live do your makeup we
have to do like a practice session
because you were a lot more makeup than
nothing right now

afraid of me doing it is really into
natural makeup and tonight's our finals

 get that cake on there he's live
doing your makeup most likely no I
wonder how I can help it the hair help I
don't know with my hair but I could
help with hair all right let me scroll
up message retracted I don't know what
that means how did you guys meet you too
she commented on one of my videos okay
they created the freaking mermaid
palette and I was interested in it so I
took it was the first one so look two
years ago yes it was two years ago and I
googled it and she had her review up and
I commented and you know you had a
smaller channel then you gotten it back
again I subscribe yep then we started
talking you know when you have a smaller
channel it's easier to get back to
people it's easier to talk to people you
become friends with people it is harder
when your channel starts to grow not
that I have a huge channel in any way
shape or form but even with 7470 how
many I don't even know how many no it's
harder to get back to people and to have
that really like like you know like
friendship kind of thing going on when
you have a thousand subscribers it's
easy to do and we immediately hit it off
well and you you commented on my profile
picture exact hit selfies with my dog
you know someone said I just heard a
strong Midwest accent well she's from
Michigan you guys know where I'm from
okay so I graduated with my BSN I'm
about to celebrate 10-year wedding
anniversary be friends with me I'm in
England girl Sean Overland line let's do
it someone said the mockery
I hope she comments on that as a cool
question the new curry what is that
I'm so confused I do not want to write
oh yeah beginning
are you doing the traditional something
well why technically the only thing I
would need to figure out something
borrowed because I'm wearing sapphire
stud earrings so that's my blue they
might dress and my shoes are new so I
could do something like that I haven't
thought much about that but maybe yeah
that'd be cool easy how do you come up
with your ferrets names okay so mr.
badger if you've ever actually looked up
a real honey badger he for real looks
like one now honey badgers are extremely
aggressive wild animals and their big
big they're vicious but they have the
same sort of feet and he has to seem
sort of marquees and honey badgers are
in the same animal delete a family so
that's how I came up with badgers name
and then when it came to Khaleesi I knew
I wanted to name her at something that I
had to do it gave him Thrones because
Game of Thrones had just ended and I was
missing the show so we went for Khaleesi
and that is the perfect name for an
she's crazy somebody said can you do
another shot my snaps video live yes I
will be back to posting normal videos
starting on Monday so next Sunday I'll
have fields of holy grails and shop I
stash I know that I've really been
absent on my channel lately you guys and
I apologize but I think it's important
to remember what's important to you and
what you really want to be doing with
your time and I needed a break it's been
so nice visiting you because I needed
that break it was really it was a lot of
waiting for you to get here exactly all
right so let's oh yeah what is your
favorite game of Thrones character Danny
Lacey yeah Khaleesi for sure I love her
mother of dragons
sure go badgers I have been suffer a
little more than a year and I just want
to say that your channel has been there
for me at times when I feel like I
didn't have anyone to turn into you
thank you that is so sweet if you think
you may I appreciate that someone said
what did you do about the tart April
Fool's right what did we do
we watched Peters video Liam on Peter we
grew a theater in what's gorgeous yeah
like it was so fun there David there's
you guys know I'm boycotting them but I
saw that palette and I'm away oh my god
oh my God look at all the cool tones the
jewel tones I was so into him
Green in there and it's not that I would
have purchased from them I still
wouldn't have but I mean I thought that
was gonna be for real then they said it
but then they deleted the photo story it
is crazy
live will you did some IG stories at
their getting ready for the wedding and
the reception so fun I'm not sure about
the reception this one over here is kind
of like my boyfriend she likes to remain
a little more anonymous I see a lot of
there but I we do behind the scenes like
getting mighty good well we can do some
sex would be fun that would be fun
what zodiac signs are you I'm a Leo how
much Horace oh there you go someone said
it's a shame that the most interesting
thing is it was extremely like
cringe-worthy and I don't even follow
them on Instagram anymore but we saw
Peters video and you know he was on time
how do you do things now we love and we
love Peter Maude
how long have you known each other two
years we talk over each other cause
we're twins and there was an April
Fool's joke for benefit and an arch
spray oh that would be funny like you'd
see though that shouldn't exist so that
actually works as a joke exactly Hart
showed you something that they could
potentially do and then they
decided not to oh okay Elena yeah I do
have some Pinterest boards I have one
for dresses and one for the wedding
I have been on private because it took
two months for me to get my ring so I
couldn't have it public but I can put it
public or be bad and then then people
can see it exactly and I didn't tell her
a lot on my Instagram so if you guys
want to find her social media stuff you
can go and look at my yeah I knew this
message game if he's asked you on
Instagram someone said a Leo here and
the hubby is a tourist so I knew I'd
like any crazy stories between you two
you know I don't feel like there's been
anything crazy it's funny because I'm
really obviously extroverted now
resulting in gibberish you have a grad
and I feel like that plays awful really
really nicely with our friendship I've
had a lot of close girlfriends but
nothing like really really like this
friend-ish women have always been a
little catty to me and I think I was a
little catty to women I get along with
men better to be completely honest you
guys I've always had more guy friends
than girlfriends but we just go together
really well I'm not an intern here all
for me being an extrovert so it's or not
it's nothing wrong yeah well tart is
ridiculous and why would you want to do
that I don't know we're all wondering
we're all wondering and yeah yes siree
that's what I feel like for sure for
sure someone said I love you you two
together I've had a wedding Pinterest
board since I was 12
oh my gosh can we see your ring it was
way better than nails pretty yeah all
right let's see here let's I'm gonna
scroll up a little bit here in case me

like that she's not competitive what are
you getting from these Sephora sale I'm
gonna do a recommendations as well as a
wishlist video for you guys very soon so
I will share that probably on Wednesday
or Thursday but I'm excited for that did
you recommend anyone and get a teaching
degree after you've worked for the job
for a while I would absolutely recommend
it if you are someone who is very very
into the education system I mean it
depends on what you're doing if you're
teaching at a public school if you're
teaching a conservatory like I knew
there is a huge difference between the
two and I would love to make a video on
that talking about the difference
between teaching at a public school
versus teaching at a conservatory
because I get so many questions how can
you do this how can you post this what's
going on how does your contract allow
you to do this and every school is
different and it's very important to
remember in the arts it is a little more
open and specifically the school that
I'm teaching at they kind of acquired me
for something specific and Rachelle
knows what I'm talking about there are
certain things I'm not sharing with you
guys on here but I'll just put it this
way she shares a lot but yes I would say
if you are passionate about teaching if
you are passionate about helping other
people absolutely I would recommend
doing it I know that it is tough to be a
teacher it's hard okay in there
an age where I'd be really yeah you know
teachers yes young yeah kids can be
there they're ballsy they're ballsy you
know you got to be ballsy with them too
you know you have to sort of but yeah if
you're teaching younger kids like I do
as well you'll you'll see that but
absolutely if you are in cue the
education system if you believe in
education all that kind of stuff and you
really really feel like you have a
passion towards helping other people
especially you know yeah and stuff like
that or it absolutely go for it um let's
see here
Liv you're amazing thank you hobbies
