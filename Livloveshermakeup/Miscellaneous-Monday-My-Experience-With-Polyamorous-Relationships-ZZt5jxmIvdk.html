welcome back to a miscellaneous Monday
today's topic is going to be polyamorous
relationships I am going to be talking
about the two different polyamorous
relationships I was in when I was in
college I've only been in two so I'm not
super super experienced but a lot of you
still wanted to hear the story so I was
with two different men for four to five
months and then I was also in a
relationship with two different women
and that only lasted about 3 to 4 weeks
I feel in contact with the two men and
we remain close friends however the two
women it did not end so well so I
thought I would just kind of walk you
guys through first of all what poly
means to me I think that's very
important you might have heard of the
word polygamy that means many marriages
you know what people talk about multiple
wives multiple marriages things like
that whereas polyamorous technically
means many loves so that could mean
you're in a relationship with more than
two people more than three people more
than four people everybody in the group
and knows that you're in a relationship
with each other whereas if you're with
your partner and you're hooking up with
other people or you're having one-night
stands or things like that
I personally don't consider that to be a
polyamorous relationships but everybody
has different definitions I think it's
very important that you go ahead and you
identify yourself the way you want to
identify yourself but you don't
necessarily have to put a label on
anything so anyway let's go ahead and
talk a little bit about my first
polyamorous relationship I was a 19
going on 20 and a relationship a prior
to that was very very debilitating for
me I had been in a relationship with a
man who was incredibly not only a
mentally but also physically abusive and
I would love to do a miscellaneous
Monday on that topic but you guys it's
gonna be an emotional one for me I could
not even think about this guy to this
day without cried ok
he literally squashed me down to a
little tiny ant and I still have not
gotten back to my full size you know
there's something about being in an
abusive relationship that really hurts
you forever I'm just gonna leave it at
that so anyway I'm not gonna get all not
gonna get all teary-eyed in this video
we're not going there but
so I was about 19 going on 20 and I was
out with my friend who what should we
call her she kind of looks like a Julie
will call her Julie I was not with my
friend at julie and we went to an Upper
East Side and that Club this was
something we like to do on the weekends
and we would have a great time
we ended up at this kind of like a
bougie lounge a sort of nightclub we
thought that was really really cool so
we go over and we sit next to these two
guys that are hot okay if
they're hot and I'm gonna call
them Jake and Joe let's call them taken
Joe I'm sure they're watching this video
and they did give me full permission to
go ahead and talk about this particular
subject if you guys are curious and Jake
and Joe were very handsome and Julie and
I were like okay you take him and I'll
take him story short we both ended up
going home but with Jake and Joe a
little did we know we ended up at the
same apartment because these two guys
live together because they were
currently in a relationship you know I
know people talk about having a gator or
people talk about like oh I can usually
tell if someone's bisexual or lesbian or
this or that or gay and you know I like
my said I don't believe in labels all
the time because it's very hard to see
what somebody is especially if they
don't want to put a label on it so Jake
and Joe were in a relationship together
Julie thought this was weird and
she pieced out and I stayed I stayed and
all three of us hooked up and now I was
originally going to talk a little bit
about the sex but I think you guys know
where I'm going with the sex so we're
gonna leave it that part out but yeah we
ended up basically having a threesome
with each other and it was a jolly good
old time I think sometimes when people
hear this story they worry that like I
got taken advantage of or something like
that but I was very into it it was very
intimate and honestly it was very very
beautiful I don't know how else to
describe it but the way that we were all
together with each other was beautiful
I've always found as a bisexual woman
that I tend to have a more sensual
experiences with women over men but
these two men were like on it I mean
they were really really sensual I loved
the way they were touching me I love the
way they were touching each other and
again I'm not gonna get too graphic here
but it felt good and it felt right at
the
to the night I think we all mutually
almost immediately agreed that this
needed to happen again
and I had never been in a relationship
with more than two people at once but
they basically it's not even like you
know I feel like sometimes people talk
about polyamorous relationships like
we're gonna invite this person and it
wasn't even an invite it was just like
we loved that that was beautiful what
just happened was great it felt good it
felt right let's do it again
so it ended up just being the same where
we were kind of casually hooking up and
I started to see them once a week and
then I started to see them twice a week
and then I was over there the whole
entire weekend I felt like I practically
had moved in with them at one point and
had my two cats Lily and Jack living
over at their apartment I mean it got
pretty damn serious now let's go ahead
and talk about what happened and why for
me polyamorous relationships just never
really ended up being something that
I've had a great experience with I think
after about four months we started to
notice or at least I started to notice
that it's hard there's always going to
be someone that is the third wheel and
this tends to happen with polyamorous
relationships and I am not the jealous
type whatsoever but there was something
about the way that Jake and Jo touched
each other and they didn't touch me that
just made me feel not included and I
wasn't the one who broke it off actually
they broke it off with me so I know it's
a little bittersweet but they loved each
other
Jake and Jo loved each other you're
happy to let you guys know that they are
currently together they are married and
they do currently have two adopted
babies which is wonderful and amazing
but yeah my experience with the two of
them was a little different because I
think I got very very emotionally
attached to both of them but I was also
in love with their relationship with
each other and I know that might sound
very very strange and very very weird
but the way that they loved each other
made me want to love them and
a lot of work no matter if you're in a
relationship with a man a woman one
person two people three four five all of
them are a lot of work but they are
absolutely a hundred percent made for
each other and I could see that back
then as well and it wasn't that they
wanted to leave me out and it wasn't
that I was feeling jealous it's just I
could see this was not going to work
because they were made for each other
the two of them are together and they
did tell me that I can update you guys
they have not sense had any other
polyamorous relationships they said that
the relationship that they had with Mia
made them closer with each other and at
the end of the day that makes me so
happy to know that my experience pulling
me in and us doing things together and
again we had a beautiful relationship
okay and even if it was a little more at
one-sided or the other we all three
learned a lot from this and ended up
being kind of a happily ever after in an
odd sort of way because obviously they
are together now and I absolutely adored
them and we still talk a lot so even if
that relationship it didn't end up a
blossoming the way that I thought it was
going to or the way that we thought it
was going to it ended up being a good
thing and I am so incredibly happy that
they are still together and I have so
much love and appreciation for them oh
my god okay let's move on to the next so
I being a bisexual woman found myself in
the middle of two different women it was
kind of like a little love triangle and
I feel like when you have a love
triangle going on instead of everybody a
mutually appreciating each other it's
never gonna end well and this did not
 end well so I was the seen a
girl and she actually went to school
with me at the time or she was at a
mutual conservatory so in Manhattan
there are three different conservatories
and she went to one of these
conservatories we were pretty much into
each other I think she had a lot more
feelings for me than I did for her I was
kind of in and out of relationships at
this time doing a leather hooking up not
so much being with someone like super
super intimately go through this phase
where you're just like I'm just gonna
love myself I'm just gonna have a good
time and I was basically just having a
good time with this girl know I could
it's how
that she had stronger feelings for me
and I look back on that and I don't
think that was fair of Mia to a pursue
being with her as well as pursue of
bringing another girl into this kind of
relationship again the only polyamorous
sort of relationship I had before that
was with two men and I'm not gonna lie I
was feeling a little experimental at
this time of the reasons why it is so
important to be a very very open book in
a polyamorous relationship is because
it's very easy for one person to say oh
sure yeah you can invite her into the
relationship for sure she can be in our
little relationship it was very easy for
someone to say that but maybe they don't
mean it and again it's one of those
things where a lot of polyamorous
relationships do end up with kind of a
third wheel behavior now that I look
back on it I should have known that she
would not have been comfortable with
this I could see that she probably now I
can see if she probably would have just
wanted to date me separately but I was
also kind of seeing this other girl and
I we hadn't done anything sexual or
physical with each other yet but I did
end up asking the other girl I said hey
can we add her in can we do a little bit
of something actually I'm sitting there
being the asshole over here and I'm
taking a girl who's already into me and
then this other girl was already into me
they don't even know each other they're
not into each other and I was basically
pushing this sort of a relationship or
this kind of sexual fantasy because I
wanted it and again this is kind of
another reason why polyamorous
relationships didn't work for me was
because this one I tried to make
something happen that obviously was not
going to happen and that was so
incredibly inappropriate of me not only
did I have this sexual fantasy that I
wanted to live out I wanted it to
literally be a relationship for the sake
of it being easy being in college all
three of us were very very busy and I
just thought it'd be kind of cool we all
live together an apartment right we all
will be there for each other sexually
and again it comes back to me really
just wanting to be with them sexually
and I should have just been hookups but
unfortunately I tried to push something
that just didn't end up happening so you
could see what we were in the bedroom
that again these two girls were very
much into me and not each other they
were barely speak to each other they
were barely look at each other and it
ended in basically disaster I had one
them coming to my door in the middle of
the night pounding on the door screaming
are you in the room oh you know I had
around telling people that I'm a huge
 and that I'm a horrible person and
at the end of the day yeah I kind of was
a bad person for trying to push a
relationship like that that wasn't going
to happen it would have been one thing
if I just said hey let's just hook up
and have a little menage a 12 let's do a
little threesome but it was another to
be like why don't you guys move in with
me let's try and make this happen I want
you there all the time because I wanted
to fulfill my sexual fantasy so that is
my second polyamorous relationship that
ended very very quickly within three to
four possibly five weeks and it's
because I tried to make it happen with
two people that were not comfortable so
I think the polyamorous relationships
are meant for a specific sort of person
you have to have a sort of mentality as
well as a certain desire to be with both
parties at the same time like I said it
is one thing if you and your partner
want to hook up or do one-night stands
with people that you're probably not
gonna see again but it's another to be
in an actual relationship with a third a
person it's very hard not to have that
third wheel mentality but if you can
make it work that's fabulous a
lot of polyamorous relationships do work
and a lot of them do not and I yeah
those are kind of my experiences and my
stories next week's miscellaneous Monday
will be all about that one time a
so-called fan called animal control on
me I think you guys will think that's an
interesting story so we're gonna talk
about that but yeah thank you so much
for joining me guys I do hope you
enjoyed this new series and I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
