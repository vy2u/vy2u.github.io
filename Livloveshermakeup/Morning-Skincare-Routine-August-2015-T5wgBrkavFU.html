thank you so much for joining me in this
video I'm going to be sharing with you
guys my morning skincare routine for
August 2015 um I wanted to do an updated
one of these because I would really like
to be filming them every single like I
don't know every season if that makes
sense so like basically every three
months just because I do have
combination skin that tends to change
throughout the year so I tend to be a
little more oily during the summer and
then a little more dry during the
wintertime so um you know I would love
to be able to film it every three months
but I forget so if you guys could remind
me that'd be great just tell me you know
all updated skin care routine that'd be
great um anyway I want to put a little
disclaimer out there right away not
really a disclaimer I just want to tell
you guys that I am one of those people
that has a lot of like bath products a
lot of skin care products they're all
for just by me but I just wanted to say
that um I do not use the same thing
every single day I tend to really swap
things out weekly so it's kind of hard
for me to film a skincare routine if
that makes sense because I literally am
swapping things out so often so um I
kind of have like a whole little
grouping of things here for you guys
today so I can show you what i've been
using the past couple of weeks but
overall i just want to let you guys know
i do change out my serums um well not
really my serums on a weekly basis but
um i do change them up once in a while I
don't use the same thing every single
day if that makes sense also um you know
I change out I guess you know I creams
weekly a change how I moisturizers
weekly so I just wanted to let you guys
know that ahead of time I am barefaced
for this video because i am going to be
applying them with you guys on camera
because i have not yet applied missing
care for the day so anyway let's just
get started the first thing i do usually
when i wake up in the morning is I grab
a my little jar that has my cotton balls
in it and I go in to my micellar water
and I make sure that I have no like
reminiscences nothing is remaining I'm
leave my eyes because I tend to wake up
with a little bit of eye makeup
underneath even though I really really
cleanse my face very well at night it's
such a pain in the butt I wish it wasn't
like that but normally I do wake up with
a little bit of it I do want to tell you
guys right away I already took care of
that and what I use is a micellar water
this one I do not recommend I really
don't like it but i am using it up
because it was you know it's important
to at least use these things up this is
the Sephora triple acting or I'm sorry
triple action cleansing water for face
and eyes makeup be gone I really just
don't like this product it the only
thing I love about it is the fact that
it has this little opening and you just
twist it and then you can push down and
get the product out and it distributes
really really nicely and beautifully but
the actual product just smells really
bad it smells like chemicals and
coconuts um like chemical coconut not
real coconut chemical coconut and I'm
just not a fan of that I don't like it
um and this has taken me forever to go
through of course I decided to get the
big one such a mistake um but you know
I'm almost through it and yeah so I do
want to say i don't love this micellar
water but every single morning I do take
two cotton balls and I'm you know pump
it into this and I make sure there is no
extra makeup underneath my eyes um and
yeah micellar water is like do you want
to recommend to you by that absolutely
love is the one from simple that's
probably the one I'm going to be picking
up after this um so just have to make my
way through this one first the second
thing I do in the morning is pop in my
um I was going to take contacts I don't
wear contacts but I pop in my eye drops
um this is the one I use this is the
clear eyes cooling and redness relief
cooling comfort red risk redness relief
so it it's kind of like those ones from
roto if you've ever tried them the rho0
oh my gosh 02 Oh guys it's early in the
morning this will probably be posted in
the afternoon but it's early right now
rh 0 t 0 the roto ones they have like
this like a stringent feel to the eye
and I actually really really like that
feeling so I did find this one from
clear eyes and it's basically the same
kind of thing so it's got the lubricant
the redness relief and then it's got the
astringent so it really really kind of
cooled and almost stings like burns a
little bit but it really really wakes up
my eyes and really helps with redness
relief so I pop those in I have already
done that too and then the last thing
that I already have done also because it
requires me to be at the sink is um wash
my face so I right now and using a
cleanser i normally use a scrub I like a
scrub in the morning however i recently
picked up and literally this week this
has been a favorite it is a new product
this week to me this is the clean and
clear morning burst facial cleanser and
it has these tiny little micro beads in
it if you guys can see but I do find
that they do kind of exfoliate my skin
so this is kind of in replacement of my
scrub in the morning and this is the
morning burst facial cleanser oil free
with bursting beads it wakes you up
rinses clean with vitamin C and ginseng
and it is so good like it really really
wakes me up in the morning it smells
really really nice and citrusy and I'm
just absolutely loving that this week so
that is what I do it wash my face and
then I pat dry with a towel and then I
get into you know my toners and things
like that so um the toner that i'm using
right now and i do want to say i change
up my toners all the time once i get
through a bottle I changed them up the
one I'm using right now that i'm almost
out of this will probably be in this
offense empties this is the hydroxatone
balancing toner this is just okay it's
got i think some witch hazel in it it
kind of balances out my skin but not
amazingly um it's just you know it's
just okay it probably wouldn't um
repurchase but i just wanted to use it
up because i had it something else that
i did pick up a recently and at the i
was gonna say drugstore at Ulta in the
drugstore section which will be my next
one once I run out of this one this is
the l'oreal hide refreshed owner and i'm
excited to try this one out it is
supposedly alcohol free and i really
just like anything that's just going to
take any like reminiscent my gosh i
cannot say this work
any kind of remains of like skincare or
um makeup that the cleanser didn't get
off in the morning or right before that
this is just what I use for my toner
force so anyway I'm going to apply that
with you guys I'm going to take my
cotton balls again I go through quite a
few of these I prefer the cotton rounds
but again this is what we had and i like
to use that products guys i just like to
use them up so um you know whatever
anyway so i'm taking my hydroxatone i
just put a little bit on to the actual
cotton pad and then i'm going to start
on my forehead and I just start applying
that everywhere and this one is kind of
interesting I really want to make sure I
put it on the area where I have a little
break out there this one's interesting
because it um I guess you could say it's
like it's very very wet formula if that
makes sense so it kind of takes a while
to dry which is interesting because
normally toners are quicker than that so
I'm taking another one going on my chin
and then my nose and it really really
smells like witch hazel but really what
I try to do is my toner is just make
sure that I am you know picking up any
remains of product that the cleanser
didn't get off I take another one I know
so wasteful with these cotton balls that
you guys I mean I normally like the big
um what are those like the big thick
like pad kind of things because you can
use like one of those for your whole
face um to do your toner but
unfortunately this is what we had and I
just want to get through it before i
purchase the big cotton rounds because I
mean if you already have it you might as
well just get through it right I know it
takes forever but it's worth it so yeah
I'm literally done with this toner now
so I will start to use that l'oreal
Hydra fresh tomorrow and I am going to
be doing a follow-up hall in with you
know I I hold that product so i will be
doing a follow-up hall with all the
makeup and beauty products
that I did my hall for the mac Alta and
sephora one so you guys are interested
in that keep you know keep up to date
with my videos so I'm just going to wait
for that to kind of sink in like I said
this one is a little wet on the skin
which I'm not a huge fan of but that's
okay so just letting it kind of sink in
and it's okay that I'm not a huge fan
because literally gone now um so let me
just say quickly i do have combination
skin I've been having some issues right
here around my nose and my mouth lately
I've been very very dry and then I do
get the occasional little you know where
to go little pimple right here and here
um but right now my skin is just more
dry than oily which is interesting
because it is summertime so basically
what i like to do for serums I either go
in with a serum that has like scar
reducing properties that can help with
hyper pigmentation that I have because I
used to have acne so one that I do like
is the polished choice clinical scar
reducing serum I don't know if I would
repurchase this but this is something
that I do like it's just okay it looks
like this and this is I believe the full
size and it is quite expensive but it
has that really silicone II slip that
kind of lets you go over the scar I have
noticed or the scars on your face I have
noticed a difference when I use this
product so that is good you know that
can be a good thing but for today I'm
going to go in with an anti-aging serum
the one I'm going to use is the clinic
smart custom Repair Serum it looks like
this this is just a little um you know
not a sample size but like a um I don't
know it was like a hundred point perk or
something from Sephora another
anti-aging one that's really nice is the
Estee Lauder advanced night repair this
is also a very good one and I do use
this as well so today I am going to go
in with the clinic custom repair one and
I just start pumping that out onto my
hand and I start with the upper half of
my face and I just kind of start
applying that and I like to take the
remains and kind of Pat it over my
eyelid
so I really like the texture of this
product it really really has like a
buttery texture to it which normally I
feel like um I don't know if you guys
yeah it really has like a nice buttery
texture to it which normally students
don't have you know they're a little
more thin so I really really like this
I'm to find that it moisturize as well
and like I said I really really like a
serum that either it does anti-aging
properties like this one or one that's
going to help take care of acne scars
and hyperpigmentation
smells a little weird but okay
alright so we are done with our serum
and then the next thing I go into is
moisturizer so I'm going to talk about
moisturizer first because i do have so
many moisturizers that i tend to like to
change them up so i have a lot of
different like variants i'm going to
pull out the couple that i have been
using the past couple weeks or the past
like three weeks i guess um so i can
show you guys the first one i really
have been liking is the semenza
biosilver pro cream this is an chinese
herb like cream it's really really nice
it comes in with those little like pearl
bubbles and you mix it together with the
gel and it comes with this cute little
spatula you guys isn't that adorable so
it comes with a little spatula you pull
it out and you put it on your face this
is really nice for mattifying I find
that if I am particularly oily one day I
like to pull out this one so that's
really nice on the days where I'm super
oily another one that I do like is where
is it where is it where it went oh there
it is um this one from oly henriksen
these sheer transformation face creme
this is just a little sample thing again
but this is really really nice it's
quite a thin consistency it is oil-free
really really nice and something i do
like doing with something that doesn't
already have any oils in it is popping
in my polished choice resist moisture
renewal oil booster for dry or very dry
skin this is just one of those products
that you add in to a serum or to a
moisturizer and it gives it that extra
boost of moisture it has ceramides and
argan oil in it so anything that you
combine it with can just help like vamp
up the moisture properties in it so it
says apply once or twice daily after
cleansing toning and exfoliating I only
do it once daily and it says to dispense
two to three drops and add to your
favorites here and more moisturizer so I
like to add that into anything that is
not does not already have like some kind
of oil in it and the last moisturizer
that I've been loving this week has been
the josie maran argan infinity intensive
creamy oil and that's because I have
been dealing with very very
you know dry skin this week so yeah and
this is basically one of those products
i'm going to apply it right now it's one
of those products that comes out like a
cream you guys can see and then you rub
it together and it turns into an oil so
there's no need for the Paula's Choice
resist you know a little oil booster
because this turns into an oil basically
on contact with the skin and it has like
omega fatty acids in it which is really
nice for plumping up the skin and then
it also has um you know the argan oil in
it of course it's josie maran I've got
to have our gun oil in it so I just take
it all over and I like to just really
kind of massage it in there especially
when it comes to oils i like to make
sure that they're really really
absorbing well into the skin um hold on
one second I'm gonna grab a tissue just
so I can wipe my hands and but yeah so
you guys can see that it really kind of
comes out like a cream and then it turns
into that oil smells really good it
smells like citrus own again like as an
everyday sort of moisturizer this
actually really doesn't do it for me
because it is quite oily however I'm
really having some dry patches lately
and this is one of the only moisturizers
that really helps to take care of it so
I kind of let that sit for a little bit
I try and rub it in as much as I can but
really there's only so much you can rub
it so I let that kind of sit for a
little bit um and then I go in with my
eye cream so um I have to well I have an
eye gel and then an eye cream I want to
show you guys I really like gel formulas
I find that they're just very very nice
during the summertime they really um
just kind of like invigorate the skin
you can pop them in the refrigerator and
it just feels really nice and cool on
the skin this is the peter thomas roth
anti-aging cellular i repair gel this is
a really really nice one I like it a lot
I'm sorry guys it's like
I'm doing a weird thing here i'm using a
different camera today so i'm a little
like who how can i set this up so anyway
um that is what it looks like it's
really really nice that's not the one
I'm going to be using today but I really
do like that it's very refreshing the
one I am going to be using today is the
royal apothic t bomb this is a firming
eye treatment so again I try and go for
anti-aging eye gels or eye creams just
because I don't know you know I tend to
have fine lines around my eyes and I
really want to you know take care of
that problem and make sure that it
doesn't get any worse so this is the
royal apothic t bomb like i said i got
this in my um popsugar must have match
box for the month of august i really
really like it uh hold on one sec grab
another tissue can't open it up it's too
slippery from the oil so um yeah so I
mean I like to just trade off again like
i said i have so many products that um
like in my collection overall that I
really literally could change out my
moisturizer and toner all that kind of
stuff every single day but I don't want
to do that so I like to just trade it
out weekly so um the eye cream will be
traded out probably this week too but
this is just the one that I've been
loving the past couple weeks I'm sorry
you guys I cannot open this fiddle to
save my life yo okay they're finally got
it it's hard that josie maran product is
very oily so this is what it looks like
it's just a really nice thick cream and
I just take a little bit of it and I
kind of warm it between my fingers first
because you guys can see kind of just
sits there like a blob so I kind of warm
up between my fingers and then I start
with my eyelids and I kind of just Pat
that in
and then I take another little glop of
it warm it between my fingers and apply
beneath my eyes
I'm tempted to put it around my nose and
mouth it's been so dry it's like one of
those things where like you put certain
products on it just starts burning and I
think it's because I've been playing
around with retinols a lot this week so
I think that's why it's so dry there but
no it is what it is Right girls so
anyway that is my morning skincare
routine i will now uh excuse me i will
now go on and um apply it on my make up
for the day and yeah so i hope you guys
enjoyed this updated morning skincare
routine please remind me once like fall
time hits like once it's like november
december to give you guys an updated
version because i'm sure my skin will
change again so i hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you did please give it a
thumbs up and i'll see you in my next
