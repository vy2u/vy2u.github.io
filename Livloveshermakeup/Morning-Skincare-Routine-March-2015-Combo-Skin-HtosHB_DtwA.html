6:18 whoops can you guys see that 6:18
in the morning right now on Thursday
March 12 and I am going to film for you
guys my morning skincare routine for the
month of March these are the products
I've been using to get my face already
in the morning for makeup and things
like that um I am having some hormonal
breakouts here on my chin right now got
some stuff going on on my forehead I'm
tired my eyes are red I thought you know
what I'm not gonna you know put together
a morning skincare routine video for you
guys in the afternoon I'm gonna go ahead
and do it right in the morning when I
look sloppy because I want you guys to
be able to see um you know how I do
everything so anyway let's get started
I'm gonna untuck my little thumbs there
and I'm going to take a headband and
just pull my hair back I did already do
one step the first step I always do is
cleanse my face and I always used to
scrub in the morning just because I
think that really helps prep for makeup
it makes it nice and smooth nice smooth
canvas I mean so right now I'm using the
Clinique 7 day scrub cream it looks like
this this is okay it's not amazing it's
okay I think I got this in I haven't
purchased any new actual like scrubs for
a while now because I've been getting so
many in subscription boxes so I think
this might have been in like a glossy
box or something but I I did not buy it
so anyway it's okay it doesn't smell
very good I like for my like scrub in
the morning to smell really nice and
uplifting and this is just very basic
and it has like no scent because you
know it's honey canned they're dealing
with people with sensitive skin but my
skin isn't that sensitive it is
sensitive but not that sensitive I could
use a little something with a little
more fragrance to it I have a few more
under the little I'm pointing under the
cupboard here I have a few more samples
that I have to go through I have like a
ura one that I was sent in a glossy box
and also a I don't even know what
subscription box but the other one is
mercier one so I'm just kind of going
through the ones that you know I got in
boxes before I go and purchased you know
the one I actually want which is I don't
even know right now because I just want
one that smells really nice and does a
good job at exfoliating the one I had
before this was the state eyes was it
Mandarin and pink grapefruit scrubs nice
anyway Wow I am just blabbing about that
okay so anyway I already washed my face
with this Clinique 7-day scrub cream the
next step that I always do is insert
eyedrops the ones I like are these
little grow to ones they are wrote oh
cool redness reliever lubricant eyedrops
and um I do not wear contacts so I'm not
sure if these are safe for contacts lens
wearers and also if you have sensitive
eyes you're gonna hate this it really
kind of burns it's almost like and it's
struggling for your eyes and an
astringent for your eyes where did I say
a stream usually a stringent for your
eyes and um I really like it like it
feels so icy cold but some people could
probably be really bothered by that so I
mean you know you really can get any
kind of I dropped it you know you want
but I really like this roto brand if you
have redness and I don't get a lot of
sleep at night I have insomnia and I
also have a habit of waking up early so
I get maybe you know five hours total a
night then I like to just dab with a
tissue any remaining um but I feel like
that just makes my eyes a lot more like
the whites appear a lot more white the
whites of my eyes appear a lot more
white like I said guys it's 6:15 in the
morning anyway but I really like these
and I need eye drops in the morning
cause like I said I only sleep on
average probably five hours a night and
I always looked like red in the morning
so next I apply my toner and I use
cotton ball so that I'm a little taco
theory topper Theory apocrypha popper
you guys know what I'm talking about
these cute little jars and so the toner
that I'm using currently is from the
shop it's the vitamin e hydrating toner
alcohol-free toning liquid with a shot
of vitamin E protection for all skin
types
I'm really liking this for this time of
year I'm really excited I already have
the next one then I'm going to be using
pulled out and it is actually from a
glossy box again they sent me like we
every buddy not just me I wasn't like
sent it I you know I purchased basi box
but it's like this huge big pink toner
that like smells like peaches I can't
wait to use it but I want to make sure I
use this up first because that other one
will be really good in the summer time
nice and fresh and this one is more
hydrating for the winter time so I just
take I start with one cotton ball and I
just put a little on there and I start
on my forehead and I just start
lightening away and you can see that
like gunk comes up on there and that's
sad because it's like what I just washed
my face though so I actually went the
other side and I go over my forehead
again just because that is where I'm a
little oily and I just want to make sure
I get all the gunk off by the way I have
combination skin it is a little
sensitive and I have a lot of acne
scarring so well you know also I did
derma roll last night that's maybe why
it looks a little more rough today
because the derma roller actually makes
like little holes in your skin like
needling basically so if you see extra
little bit of redness it could just be
tiny little holes but don't worry they
will fill in and skin will look better
than it ever has so I'm going to take
this and just go on my chin and then I
went the other side and then I do my
notes and five of my nose he's on
basically which is where oily waste so
many cotton balls then I take a third
one and I pour more to the left side of
my face or can you guys I guess it looks
like the right side of my face and you
guys can see like as I do this even
though this is a very light easy toner
like I do have sensitive skin
read pretty quickly I went the other
side and then I did the other key and
normally I would bring all of the
products that you're about to see
including this toner down my neck but
I'm waiting
turtling right now it's just not going
to be easy but normally I do take
everything down my neck
including my serum and moisturizer my
toner everything okay
once I'm done with that I kind of let it
dry for a second just so we can you know
sink in because like I said this is a
little bit hydrating so you kind of want
to let it sink in almost like they liked
moisturizing milk I'll read a little bit
on the back what it says I've done the
same thing it's just as so common a
sweep of her face okay new that it says
it prepares the skin to better absorb
other vitamin E products I'm not using
other vitamin D products but I do like
this toner I've heard of people also
just like put in their hand and rub it
on their face like aids liked
moisturizer like if you have really
really oily skin I'm sorry I keep
messing with my hair but it just won't
stay back if you have fine hair you know
what I'm talking about um so yeah I've
heard people just put it on their hands
and like rub it in maybe if you have
really oily skin but like I said I do
have combos gonna get a little droid
cheeks again weren't lately in the
t-zone so I do need a moisturizer or not
just that but I do like this for the
winter pen okay after that is kind of
sunk in I go in for my serum and right
now just like the donors and the face
scrubs I have not been purchasing my own
because there's been so many samples
that are not samples but you know things
that are being sent in boxes and then
this one was like a 250 point perk from
Sephora and you know I've never found a
serum that I'm absolutely in love with I
just finished up and at Estee Lauder
advanced Night Repair Serum I thought it
was nice it wasn't fantastic
Lily sorry my cat is meowing um she
wants to come in but she can't um and I
don't even know where I was going anyway
like I was
I haven't found a serum that I
absolutely love yet so I thought you
know what all these little ones that you
get I'm gonna try all of them and the
one that I like I'll go and pick up a
full-size so this one was sent in my
Elora sample Society box
it's the ster Beckton intensive
illuminating serum and the reason I
pulled this one up is because it turns
almost gone so see if there's any left
in here I did really like this yep
there's so much a lot in there so just a
pie pick all over I love the glow that
this gives to my skin it's really really
beautiful you can see that it's kind of
like a sheen without um like bothering
my oily parts I do take it around my
eyes it doesn't bother my eyes and
normally I would take it down my neck as
well I don't wanna get my turtleneck
color yucky okay there was plenty left
in here so I'm not moving on to that
only Hendrix than one yet but I'm
excited for that one that's the next one
I'm gonna try and it is the truth serum
collagen booster potent vitamin C
complex I've heard lots of great things
about vitamin C and I can't wait give it
a pat because serums are the one product
that really get all the way down you get
into the deeper layers of the skin
they're not like moisturizers that come
to sit on the top
I think moisturizers only go correct me
if I'm wrong I'm not a dermatologist but
I have heard that they only go one or
two layers deep whereas serums really go
like three or four they kind of create
very well through the skin so you kind
of want to press it in there I think
it's because there's so they're kind of
like Remy you know moisturizers are kind
of thick and it can be problematic your
skin weren't always taking all that
moisture I think we've all had that
problem where we wake up in the morning
and our moisturizer is still you know on
our skin and were like it's actually
working it doesn't seem like it's taking
it
but anyway so that is the serum I think
it's going to be more left in here too
awesome so yeah based Rebecca Jim
intensive illuminating serum I really
like this one I would definitely
purchase a full-size of this but then
again I have so many samples I want to
try first our little ones that have been
sent in boxes that I want to go through
all the first and then pick the top ones
to purchase okay I'm gonna let that kind
of dry a little bit let's chat about
this Olay Henriksen
truth serum collagen booster so I use
retinol at night so I have heard that
vitamin C during the day and retinol at
night is like the best thing you can do
for your skin so that's why I believe
excited to try this
it says potent vitamin C complex to help
brighten smooth and improve the
appearance of Aging and I've heard a lot
of people talk about how any
hyperpigmentation or dark spots vitamin
C it really takes care of that I don't
really find that retinol does retinol
helps with like wrinkles and acne and
fine lines and things like that
and overall complexion kind of evening
it out but I've heard that vitamin C you
can even make your own serum at home or
moisturizer I hear that it really fate's
things nicely so scarring or even like
each spots with a little Franklin tear
stuff like that alright and next I use a
moisturizer again I apply this to my
neck and my face just my face for the
sake of this video right now I will
apply to my neck later I am using today
the Neutrogena hydro boost water gel
with hyaluronic acid I purchased this
maybe like a week ago and I'm really
liking it so far I have quite a few yeah
I have the Clinique Moisture Surge and
the red Lonnie Turner lanique I have
lots of moisturizers and I don't have a
specific one that I am attached to so I
like to have lots of different ones for
different occasions the revlon eternal
one is really really heavy-duty a5 dry
skin that day and then this one is like
basically a water gel and the cleaning
ones like a cream gel this is the leg
assort out of all of them and now that
the warmer months are coming around I
think this is going to be fantastic for
summertime so it
with an eye cream that I did pick up but
that's not the eye cream gaming news
today though this is what it looks like
it's like this watery gel actually moves
around so I just kind of dip my finger
in there and pick some up and I just
start applying it and this stuff like
has that can't decide if I love the
fragrance or if I hate it I do put it on
my eyes to it because it just doesn't
bother them and yes I put eye cream over
it but you know what the more the more
the more room the more moisture the
better when it comes to those areas
that's all I can say so yeah and if you
don't want to invest in an eye cream go
ahead and just use your regular
moisturizer and eye cream it works just
as well
I know this is like kind of sweet like
candy and then there's like a chemical
undertone it's like whoa that is not
candy that's like poisonous candy that
creepy people hand out on Halloween or
something trying to poison you but it
smells good at first and I was like oh
my gosh what is that but it doesn't
actually um you know translate onto the
skin I can't wait smell it of course I'm
not smelling my face but you guys know
baby so as you can see that absorbs
really quickly really nicely I'm just
gonna be a great product for the summer
time I replaced it with the Dr Lin
hydrating gel which I also love and I
went through it took me like a year I
bet I've used it all summer last year
and then into this year and that's
really nice too it's actually less
expensive drugstore skincare has become
very expensive this was like twenty
dollars and the eye cream was like
twenty dollars but whatever it works and
I do like it and I love the packaging
but um anyway my point was
I forgot rising oh yes dr. Lin hydrating
gel is like $4.99 and it's kind of like
this
as LOV Arnett and hyaluronic acid same
as this and it has like more about like
minty smell to it
but like I told you guys I get bored
with moisturizer serum I like to try new
things face scrub so anyway uh okay I'm
gonna let that kind of see and then I go
in with an eye cream again I'm gonna
open this so I can see do you guys see
that yes I do write out every single day
I have a schedule that I follow in the
morning or else I forget to do something
I'm just anal retentive like that I have
to have everything right now but um so
basically for like I just want to state
quickly for moisturizers if you guys saw
my skincare collection and organization
video you would have seen that I have a
lot of oils too
and I don't use oils and moisturizers at
the same time I would use my serum and
then pick between using like tarte
maracuja oil or the l'oreal oil or you
know whatever kind of oil
I have around if I'm having really dry
skin I think oils are better than
moisturizers um but if my skin is just
being its normal self I kind of like to
stick to the just moisturizers but what
was I going to say why am I looking out
there now confused
oh I creams so this is actually again
deluxe sized sample from Sephora it was
like a perk or something like a hundred
point four and this is the fresh black
th delay eye concentrate and I've had
this forever it's taking me forever to
go through if smells like black tea it's
so delicious and I recently picked up
the black teen firming overnight mask
which I'm obsessed with it's like $90 at
Sephora but I love it it's perfect for
those nights where you're in a hurry and
you're like I have time to put all this
crap on my face you just pop that on and
you wake up in the morning your skin is
beautiful but this eye concentrate
oh my gosh when I run out of this I will
definitely definitely be picking up a
full size of this I don't know how much
it is but I hope it's not $90 like to
get a face mask is but I
solutely love it it's like a big kind of
jelly it's just it smells good it sinks
in right away but I have a lot of eye
creams I have that Neutrogena hydraboost
gel cream I have the Clinique all about
eyes I just have lots of I like to
change my skincare up the only kind of
skincare I don't really change up is my
I always use a acne cleanser at
nighttime so no matter what I never used
to scrub it always has to have either
salicylic acid tea tree oil tea tree oil
or benzoyl peroxide in it and then I
also use strictly retinol products on my
skin at night but when it comes to
during the day I like to play with
different stuff I like to have different
moisturizers for different occasions and
I like to have different eye creams
different serums you know try and stuff
out not really serums I'm just trying
serums out now and see which one's best
but you know I like to change it up but
yes so today I'm using the just I'm
using the black tea age delay eye
concentrate
I'm fresh just gonna take a little bit I
do it with my middle finger it's just I
feel like I have more control with this
I know people say use your ring finger
but it takes forever for me to Pat it in
it's like I just don't have good enough
control so I kind of smooth it and then
I Pat and I get way up to the lower lash
line and I take all the way down to the
orbital bone and over here and then I
take a little more and then I take it on
my eyelid right here Pat and then I take
a little extra and I put it specifically
right here on the sides of my eyes
because you know people always say oh I
cream put it underneath your eyes but
this is the area where people get crow's
feet it goes up this way you know so you
want to make sure you fight with that
whole area and then I have a weird
person and I use my eye cream on areas
where I know my makeup creases um
I'm 21 years old but I do get some it's
not fine lines it's one of those things
where it's like explain it if I put too
much makeup on like on my face one day
and I put too much powder or something
which is like every single day I love
how very lovely to cake face uh-huh I
get like soft lines like the makeup
creases and then it looks like I have
like wrinkles here and here and like all
over when in reality you know I don't
yet um but just to make sure that that
really doesn't happen during the day
besides using a good primer I like to
use my eye cream on those specific
places also because eye creams are
really my creams are really really
potent and it's just one of those things
I know like you know I know I just put
my moisturizer all over my eyes too and
then I put this on and people are gonna
say oh well both of them won't sink in
but they do and that's the thing is that
those areas need extra moisture and the
more you put on the more you're going to
fill the fine lines or creases or makeup
creases and so they're gonna be plumped
out and you're not gonna see them the
only little fine line I really have is
right here because I go like this it's
like right there but in general
throughout the day makeup tends to do a
little crease here I play flute so I'm
constantly oh for sure so it's always
being pushed out here so the makeup
creases going on like a huge huge
tangent about it but you guys know what
I mean so basically what I like to do is
the eye cream that I use that day if I
trust it around my eyes I trust it
anywhere else on my face so I take it
and I put it here and even if it's not
just like false makeup lines that your
being throughout the day even if you
have fine lines the more moisture you
put on areas where you
wrinkles or fine lines the better it's
going to look so during the day from me
at nighttime I'm all about repairing my
skin I put acids on it at night you know
gamma acids lactic acids and then I use
retinol I really really go hard with it
at nighttime however during the day it's
really about having a nice base and
making sure that the makeup looks
beautiful yes you should still protect
your skin and yes you should still wear
sunscreen and have a foundation that has
sunscreen in it and all that kind of
stuff but um for me during the day I
find my makeup looks the best if I have
really really kind of like plumped it up
like moisturize that you know I'm not
taking this eye cream slathering it all
over I just do it on the areas where I
make it false advertised creasing it's
just right there cuz I go like this and
then of course here and then here and I
just noticed that when you do that and
then you're giving it more time to sink
in by the time you go to do your makeup
it will be you know completely sunken
and when you put your primer on able
just glide on effortlessly and like okay
so what I was saying before was just
that in the morning I could look for a
skincare routine that's going to make my
makeup look good that's kind of what I
do because I use really strong stuff at
night I know that I use enough anti
aging stuff at nighttime that I don't
need to go super super hardcore during
the day so my primary focus during the
day is to get moisture back into my skin
so that my makeup looks good on top of
it but not you know greasy I'm not
looking for like a greasy face I'm just
using a nice light moisturizer
everywhere but then taking you know the
eye cream putting it in areas where I
know you know I tend to get dry looking
or I know that it's going to crease a
little bit just yeah anyway oh my gosh
this video is so long you guys
apologize anyway um now it is what 642
am
yeah these are days where I'm like I
wish I added in my videos but I do not I
don't know how to edit I don't want to
edit I like you guys just to see it nice
and raw as it is and even if I'm just
super super hyper and talking which I am
always in the morning so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this
that was my morning skincare routine I
if you guys are wondering like you can
see that I am breaking out right now um
um too low yes underflow our mother
nature is coming to visit me in about a
week I get to very very p.m. se yucky
break out and I eat bad food and just a
hormonal anything that you have on your
chin is usually hormonal um but like I
said um I don't even know what I was
saying it's like the worst video ever I
can't remember but this was my morning
skincare routine uh this is what I can
say you guys are wondering about you
know oh you have active breakouts what
do you do to combat those I never use
acne medications benzoyl peroxide
salicylic acid tea tree oil during the
day because they make my makeup look
like crap absolute crap they're too dry
they shock up I don't know how people
can use like salsa like acid toners in
the morning and stuff like look no it
just looks bad with the makeup and my
goal like I said my morning skincare
routine my goal my ultimate goal is to
make my makeup look good because that's
when I'm wearing makeup during the day
at nighttime it's a whole nother thing
you know I'm all with everything I mean
I right now I'm using the tea tree
facial wash and then I use retinols
acids and then I also if I have any
breakouts I use the person gel ten from
what is it clean and clear I also have
the acne stress control night cleansing
pads with Neutrogena and they just your
body stuff so you know yes I am breaking
out but that will be my job tonight to
go
and put acne medication on top of that I
never do it during the day it just
doesn't look good with my makeup even
though I am combo skin it just it
doesn't work for me maybe if you're
really really oily you can get away with
putting benzoyl peroxide all over your
face but I don't
and also another reason is I'm quite
fair and I am sensitive to the Sun and
any medications like that and you know
retinols and things like that there's a
reason I use them at nighttime it's
because they make you Sun sensitive so
you should be really careful with that
if you are using stuff like that whether
it be a AJ's retinol really anything
besides you know basic basic things like
obviously this isn't gonna make you
sensitive to the Sun but you know
benzoyl peroxide it specifically states
on the back of basically every single
thing you know keep away from your
towels which all of my towels are
bleached um and then it also says do not
go into the seminal that you're wearing
like a really high SPF so yeah anyway
this was super super long and chatty
I apologize um all my skin is my skin
almost all of my skin is on my face yeah
yeah love you okay oh my god all of my
skincare is complete and I am ready to
go ahead and prime my face and put my
makeup on so I hope you guys enjoyed
