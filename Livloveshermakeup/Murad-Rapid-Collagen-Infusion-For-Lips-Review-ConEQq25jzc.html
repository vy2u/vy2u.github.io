doing a lip product review for you guys
right now and it is not a lip balm it is
not a lipstick it is a lip treatment
from Murad that I purchased on the
Sephora website for $24 I will link
below where you guys can get this this
is the Murad age reform rapid collagen
infusion for lips it comes in a little
box like this and the actual packaging
looks like this it comes in this nice
long slender tube and you just unscrew
the top and you can see that the
applicator has like the rubber wand and
then you get like four little holes that
you can squeeze the product through so
what I really like about this is the
fact that it is not a lip balm it is not
a colored product it is strictly
something that's going to help make your
lips look plumper and make them look
more moisturize just help with the
overall health of your lips I'm a flute
player I've mentioned that many times on
my channel but my lips are very very
important to me and it's really really
really critical that they're not sore
and chapped and look hot massive so I
really really wanted to try this product
I thought oh $24 you know I don't know I
could just get another you know bite
agave lip mask or something like that
but I was thinking you know what this is
different this is like a serum for your
lips it's not a moisturizing a super
super emollient moisturizing product
it's more like you know kind of makes
sense when you do your skincare you put
the serum the serum on that kind of you
know seeps into the deep deep parts of
the skin and then you put the
moisturizer on which only goes to the
first couple layers of the skin so the
thought behind having like a serum for
your lips just kind of made sense to me
and I thought I really need it so
basically this is supposed to be a
product that's supposed to pull collagen
towards the front or to the top layer of
your lips so basically it's stimulating
like blood flow however it's not one of
those products that's gonna be tingling
and stinging like I know people read
rapid collagen infusion for lips and
they're probably thinking oh it's gonna
sting and it's gonna feel tingly that's
more like those instant kind of products
that I like lip plumpers this is more
one of those things that you're going to
apply
you're not gonna feel anything so as I
put this on my hand you guys can't even
see because it's not tinted it doesn't
have any color to it it's not glossy it
literally just goes right on and within
a few seconds it has completely
dissipated and sunk into my skin which i
think is awesome so the fact that it's
you know absorbs so quickly allows you
to go in with whatever lip balm you want
to use whether it be your agave lip mask
at nighttime or you know this mojito lip
balm whatever you want to put on it's
gonna be ready to take that in right
away so this is really going down to the
deepest layer of the skin in your lips
and then you can put a moisturizer on
top of that to come back dryness and
things like that so I really liked the
thought process and I have to tell you
guys I've been using this for about two
weeks and I have really really noticed a
big difference with lines and crevices
in my lips but also just the overall
health of my lips like it it just helps
so that I don't have to constantly every
single night be you know thinking about
over my lips gonna be dry in the morning
or oh I have to make sure I use a lip
scrub and things like that which I do
every day
anyway but it's just like one of those
conscious things where it's not like oh
I have to you know make sure I don't use
that lipstick because it's really drying
and it will show up on my lips or things
like that this really makes sure that
like you can wear any lip products you
want and not have to worry about it
which is awesome so you can wear this
during the day I could put it on right
now and then put you know a lipstick or
a lip gloss on and also you can wear it
at nighttime I personally wear mine at
nighttime it says smooth a thin layer
over lips and lip area use under
lipstick gloss or Bob or at nighttime it
says is derma dermatologist developed
not tested on animals tested on people
which is great I prefer testing on
people than animals but like I said I
just think it's so cool I love the
concept and I think that Murad really
does have these products that do work
and I have noticed a difference with
little lines and fine lines and crevices
within my lips so I would say if you are
someone who's really conscious of your
lips and you really battle your lips
every day like you you know you put a
make up on everyday or you wear really
drawing lipstick every day this could
definitely be a good thing for you to
pick up also if you are older and you
have little fine lines and wrinkles in
your lip area already this would be a
great product to pick up also so I'm
gonna read for you guys a little bit
about what it says on these of our
website it says the mirror a crafted
collagen infusion for lips $24 what it
is an innovative lip serum formula to
help support natural collagen and micro
circulation for a fuller more youthful
appearance
it says this groundbreaking lip formula
infuses lips with collagen amino acids
to help reduce the appearance of
vertical lip lines and wrinkles for a
plumper fuller and more youthful
appearance it promotes healthy natural
collagen and micro circulation instantly
smoothing and softening the lips and the
entire lip area this is soothing
yes soothing yes well thanks soothing
silly serum does not contain color or
shine and builds a look of lip volume
without aggressive exfoliation or
irritation it is formulated without
parabens and sulfates and it also has
replenish sal which is a mere ATS
patent-pending proprietary technology
that turns water into a performance
hydrator for ultimate skin health and
beauty it helps skin act younger in
three ways it helps skin attract water
it binds water to the skin and helps
skin retain water so we're talking about
moisture it says this product is
scientifically proven dermatologist
developed and tested on people Mac
animals so like I said if you're someone
who deals with sore lips or you're like
a flute player or like a musician like I
am and you use your lips everyday and
you want to be able to wear those you
know really drying lip liners or
lipsticks or things like that without it
looking like a mess within your lip area
I would definitely recommend picking
this up I think that the next big thing
that's coming around is lip serums it
just makes sense it makes sense not to
just throw moisturizer on top of the you
know top layer of your skin because
that's only going to heal so much what
if you really have cracked dry lips and
little lines that you know are even
further below the top layers of the skin
it just makes sense to use the lip serum
too so I really like this it doesn't
feel like a lot to be throwing this into
my like it doesn't feel like oh you know
added this whole new thing and it takes
up so much time at night like I said it
literally um just sinks and absorbs into
the skin so quickly that it's not
something that's like Oh time-consuming
you know like waiting waiting waiting
until I can put my lip balm on at night
it's really just I put this on I wait
two minutes I put my lip balm on and I'm
good to go and I know I'm gonna wake up
with really nice healthy soft plump lips
so yeah anyway that's my review of the
Murad rapid collagen infusion for lips I
hope you guys like this I will link
below where you can pick it up and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
