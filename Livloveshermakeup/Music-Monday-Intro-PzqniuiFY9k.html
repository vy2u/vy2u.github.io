music Sunday it looks like I'm doing an
outfit of the day right I'll go down on
my knees anyway welcome to music Monday
this is just a little intro that I will
be showing you guys um I will be posting
a music video every single Monday
starting next week on my channel and I
just thought this would be a nice way to
start to put some music out there
because this is my number one love in
life
of course the sides makeup and skincare
and all that kind of stuff this is
number one and if you guys didn't know I
went to school for modern flute but I
also play recorders I play soprano alto
tenor bass recorder and house to play
baroque piccolo I play so many different
sort of flute instruments and I thought
it would be fun to come and play a piece
for you guys every single Monday it's
not going to interrupt any sort of
filming scheduled I already plan like if
I have a video plan that day and that ud
video will go up but I'm just going to
be posting these probably later in the
day around 5 or 6 o'clock on Mondays and
yeah I just thought it would be fun to
start doing that like I said it's not
going to interfere with any sort of
beauty video so if for some reason you
don't want to watch you definitely don't
have to this is just so that I can share
something that I love with you guys
besides makeup and hair and skin care
and all that kind of stuff so anyway
that is what we will be doing and if
you're
curious yes I have a little sticker on
here this is my soprano recorder and I
was just playing some little bits of a
van Eyck they're sort of like a toots
and they all start with a main theme and
then go into variations that was what I
was just kind of playing for you guys
kind of fooling around I have another
one that I posted on Instagram do you
guys really like so I'll play a little
bit of that so yeah I will just be
coming on here every Monday and playing
something for you guys and let me know
what you would like to hear down in the
comments section I'll just kind of you
know change up with the instruments on a
weekly basis and if you have something
you would like me to play I can
definitely do that so I just wanted to
let you guys know that's what I will be
doing on Monday nights now like I said
won't interfere with any sort of beauty
video that goes up earlier in the day
but I thought it would be fun to share a
little piece of my life with you guys so
yeah this is the little intro for that
and I shall see you guys next Monday for
music Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
