thank you so much for joining me and
hope you guys are having a fantastic day
today I am sharing with you guys my
must-have makeup brushes I tried to
choose a brush from each like area of
the face or each like you think you guys
know what I made each category basically
I fixed like a blush brush a foundation
brush some eye brushes things like that
so anyway I do want to let you guys know
before I get into this video this is a
collaboration with one of my newer
friends here on YouTube her name is Amy
and her channel name is makeup by Amy
Michelle and I really really like this
girl she is very very sweet I like the
way that she approached me we talked
about collabing and I feel like she's
very very like headstrong kind of woman
and she really is very very motivated
she did start YouTube relatively
recently I would say yout recently very
recently about three months ago I
believe is when she started her channel
and she really comments a lot on my
videos she's very very sweet to me and I
actually didn't know that she had a
channel until she really reached out to
me and I went over and checked her out
and she does beautiful beautiful makeup
tutorials she's very very sweet and I
think she's really relatable and easy to
watch like on camera and another thing
is that she posts very very frequently
and she does it consistently I know one
of the reasons you guys like to watch me
is because I post quite consistently or
at least I try to
and she really posts frequently and
consistently so I think you guys would
really really like that about her and
what I like I said she just um I love
the way that she kind of approached me
and she's just a very very like I feel
like she's very powerful and she really
wants to do this YouTube thing and get
this YouTube game down and under her
belt and one of the hardest things when
you first start YouTube if you have a
channel any kind of channel it doesn't
just have to be Beauty related if you
have a channel you know of how difficult
it is when you first start like the
first six months you usually only have a
couple hundred subscribers and it can be
kind of difficult and I notice the
difference from having a
hundred to a thousand subscribers is
when people start to like your videos
and share your videos that's a huge
thing so I really see a lot in Amy I
think she's really wonderful and she
does live relatively close to me we were
actually talking she lived in the
Chicago area so that was kind of cool
that she's in the Midwest like me too
but I really really like her and I feel
like she is very professional and just
like on top of her game if that makes
sense and I feel like when you see
someone like that on YouTube and you
know that they're very very serious
about what they're doing I think it's
really cool because I feel like you know
people like that go very far when it
comes to YouTube and I think that she's
one of those people she's gonna go very
far so I'm I'm gonna link below her of
course her YouTube page and also her
Instagram it will be the first thing you
see in the description bar and I highly
recommend that you guys go and check out
her channel and obviously subscribe if
you are interested in what you see
subscribing and liking and you know
sharing videos is huge like I said when
you're first starting out on YouTube
like I said I keep saying like I said
but she only started her channel three
months ago and I really think she is
going to go far I really really like her
and her personality so I highly
recommend you guys head over to her
channel subscribe share her video like
her video if you obviously want to and
yeah so thank you Amy for reaching out
to me I think you're wonderful and I
think you do absolutely gorgeous
tutorials and you're just a really
beautiful person yourself so anyway
let's just get into the video I have all
these brushes in front of me and I'm
going to show you guys from each
category what my favorites are so the
first one I want to talk about is from
this tiny cosmetics it's this beautiful
beautiful boudoir finishing brush now I
want to say before I go any further a
lot of these brushes do not have the
names on the actual handle so everything
will be linked below with the names of
every single brush it will be in order
below okay so look in the description
bar if you want the full name of the
brush because some of them don't
actually have it written on them but
anyway this is the event best on me
finishing a boudoir finishing brush it
feels like absolute silk and what I love
about this is that it's huge so I like
to take it and
from my face down to my neck that's one
way I use it the other way I like to use
it is to just kind of dust over my face
to pick up any excess powder that might
have gotten really like cakey or stuck
on my face basically especially when I
use my it cosmetics sometimes it can
take up into certain areas the it
cosmetics what is it
b-bye-bye pores powder so I'd like to
just dust this over those areas
especially around the hairline and
another way that you can use this is if
you have any follow up from your
eyeshadow it's wonderful you can just
swipe it right underneath and it's
really really good so that is my first
favorite or must-have brush the second
one I want to talk about is well
actually there's two of them
so one is for bronzer one is for blush
these are from the up and up brand which
is the compareto brand from Target I
watched a whole video from emily noel 83
here on youtube or Emily Eddington she's
fantastic she did a whole review on like
all of the brushes from this line these
are fantastic again they don't have the
names written on here but I believe this
one was called the powder brush it's a
very very silky and soft and what I like
to use this for is for bronzing or
contouring my face lightly I am quite
fair so when I go into a bronzer with
like a very very densely packed brush or
something that's not super fluffy and
soft it just looks like too much too
harsh on my skin so I like to put this
in swirl it around tap off the excess
powder and just dust it over my forehead
down my cheekbones around my neck area
it takes up a lot of surface area
because it is a big Brush and it's just
not super densely packed so it's very
fluffy and it doesn't put too much um
you know product on to your face so that
is definitely a favorite for me when it
comes to bronzer or contouring products
and then the blush brush I love because
it is very densely packed and it is very
very small as you guys can probably tell
it fits perfectly onto the apples of
your cheeks which i think is fantastic
elf also makes a very similar brush like
this one and it's very very small it's
densely packed and it doesn't take up a
lot of surface area if that makes sense
I do use blush brushes that take up you
know more surface area or a bigger or a
fluffier those work for me too but when
I really want to be precise I reach for
this one and it is definitely my
favorite alright so the next one I want
to talk about is from Tarte this is
their airbrush finishing foundation
brush I believe that's what it's called
this one came in my touch stroke of
midnight brush set that was out for the
holiday 2015 for this year however you
can get it in like their regular line it
is a permanent addition so you can get
it it just won't have this cute little
gold handle huh unfortunately but this
is an amazing brush it's kind of shaped
like a kabuki brush and it really blends
into the skin beautifully if you want to
apply foundation I will say my favorite
way to apply foundation is with a damp
Beauty Blender or my Real Techniques
sponge someone asked me the other day
which one do I prefer I actually prefer
my Real Techniques over my Beauty
Blender if you guys were curious but as
far as foundation brushes go I think
this one works the best because it takes
up a lot of surface area you can blend
it in really quickly you can stipple it
if you want more coverage or you can
kind of blend in circular motions I've
used it today with my foundation and I
honestly feel like it took me 45 seconds
to put all of my foundation on so that
is definitely of my favorite foundation
brush the next brush I want to talk
about is a recommendation from my friend
Leora here on YouTube this is the be you
beautifully Pro flat kabuki you can only
find this on Amazon she has the one with
the white handle I got the black handle
just because I don't know I preferred
that one but she recommended this for me
she loves using her foundation with this
brush I personally don't I feel like
it's too soft it is like literally the
silkiest brush I've ever touched in my
life honestly it's almost softer than
the best sunny one it is softer know
that I'm feeling it it's softer than
this one and that one has really really
nice long synthetic bristles but this is
just gorgeous I feel like it's too soft
for foundation I think I wear a little
more foundation than Leora does so what
happens is when I'm picking up the
foundation and I keep applying it
because it's so soft it really really
kind of gets into the bristles and it
starts to kind of clump up the bristles
together and I
don't feel like it blends CMAs
seamlessly into my skin however I love
using this for the buffing technique
which is where I take one of my
finishing powders like the it cosmetics
bye bye pores and I basically take it at
the end of my makeup I just buff it over
everything over my blush over my
finished face and I do circular motions
and it's amazing because it is
completely flat but it has a lot of give
to it because it's so soft it is just
amazing at that so I love using that for
the buffing technique that is definitely
one of my favorites or any kind of
finishing powder like loose silica kind
of powder great alright and the next one
I want to talk about is from Sigma this
is the Sigma f-35 tapered highlighter
brush I love this because it is kind of
like dome shape but it's obviously
tapered and it does have a lot of give
to it but it picks up the perfect amount
of product every single time and I love
the way it fits into all the areas where
you highlights like down the nose on the
cheekbones and also the chin area it's
just the perfect size it picks up the
perfect amount of product and it's just
the best highlighting brush I have ever
used highly recommend the next one I
want to talk about is what I use when I
am setting my foundation I like to take
a powder and I like to stamp the powder
onto my face I feel like it really locks
it in nicely and also it leaves a very
very beautiful finish to the skin so my
favorite brush to use that for is the it
cosmetics Buki buffing brush and it
looks like this this was from the
holiday set from last year you can see
it's very densely packed and flat so I
won't be able to link this for you guys
down below however I will go ahead and
link to a very very similar brush that
they have and you can get that on the
alte comm website it's a very very
densely packed and again it's a flat top
kabuki and I just love this for packing
my powder on I feel like it just gives a
very very beautiful airbrush sort of
look especially when I go over it with
my buffing technique with this with this
bu beautiful brush but it really really
packs it on there I don't have any
issues with like oil breaking out
through you know throughout the day have
like a shiny T zone or things like that
I do have combination skin so that's
always something I watch for but I feel
like this really packs the powder in and
keeps me matched so I absolutely love
this brush or any kind of brush like
this to set my foundation in the next
one I want to talk about is from Sigma
again this is the tapered kabuki f-86
very simply I just like to use this to
blend all of my foundation into my
hairline and down my neck so down here
and then also all around my hairline I'm
one of those people that I don't know
what it is with foundation but sometimes
it just doesn't look as blended as it
could so what I love to do is just kind
of blend in the foundation to make sure
that there's no visible line between
Foundation and hairline so that is
basically what I use this brush for it
is definitely a favorite I use that on a
daily basis and now we're gonna get into
some eye brushes the first one I want to
talk about or the first two I want to
talk about our dense crease brush is
just basically packing color into the
crease before you blend it out I love
using these two brushes here this is the
elf professional blending eye brush I
love this because it's densely packed
and it's small and it's kind of tapered
it looks like that and it really just
packs color into the crease really
really easily so that's my first
favorite the second favorite is from
morphe it's the m5 11 it does the same
sort of concept it is a little bit
fluffier but it's still very very dense
and I just love packing color into the
crease
with that and then as far as blending
goes I'm after I've packed color into
the crease I love this BH Cosmetics
really really fluffy crease brush I like
this more than the Sigma e-40 honestly
it's just softer it's got more bristles
and I feel like it keeps its shape the
Sigma e-40 is when I clean them and
things like that they tend to shed a lot
over time they've gotten more and more
like crispy feeling like they're not
nearly as soft and also I feel like they
just um they've started to kind of
because they do shed so much they
started to kind of become uneven if that
makes sense so I like this one because
no matter how many times I've washed it
it's
the same I don't lose any bristles super
soft and easy to go on whether you're
doing it back and forth wouldn't shield
wiper motions or blending in circular
motions it does the job amazingly as far
as like outer-v colors I really really
liked using this morphe and b13 brush or
anything similar to this it's kind of
flat when you look at it like this or no
yeah it's kind of flat when you look at
it like this and like this but what I
like this for is taking whatever color I
want to put on my outer-v I pack it on
and then I can tilt it up and get it
into the crease so really really easy to
use that way I really really like it and
then I will go and I will blend it out
with something like the BH Cosmetics
fluffy brush or that exact brush and
then the last brush I want to talk about
is for smudging underneath the lower
lash line I use this today actually used
all of these brushes today by the way
but just a smudging color underneath the
lower lash line I like something that's
densely packed but have a little bit of
gibs so that it can kind of blend
because you really want it to look nice
and smoky under there not just like you
put a harsh line underneath so this is
the elf professional eye crease brush
and like I said it's very very short
it's got tiny little bristles it's
densely packed but not too densely
packed where it's just putting a line
underneath it really does kind of blend
it out so this is what that brush looks
like and I love using it on the lower
lash line it is a slightly scratchy I'm
not gonna lie I think this is one of
their one dollar brushes but I think it
just does the job beautifully it smokes
it out without having to go underneath
and blend it out with something fluffy
like that so anyway those were my
must-have makeup brushes or my top
favorite makeup brushes of all times I
