this video I feel like I'm sitting very
close to the camera right now I'm
looking in the viewfinder and it's like
boom anyway in this video I am sharing
with you guys and I must have summer
essentials and this is actually a
collaboration with my friend Rochelle
here on YouTube I'm going to go ahead
and link her channel in her video down
below she is so sweet and so supportive
of my channel so i really would
appreciate it if you guys went over
checked out her channel tell her I say
hello and yeah I asked her if she wanted
to collab and she came up with this idea
and I think it's really cool so I'm
gonna walk you guys through some
skincare items some perfumes I'm wearing
some of the makeup that I'm going to
talk about my favorite summertime
hairstyle things like that so let's go
ahead and get right into it so I guess
I'm gonna start with this I love
throwing my hair up in a messy bun
during the summertime I've been doing
this for like two months straight I've
been getting a lot of slack in the
comments section people are like are you
ever gonna wear your hair down ever
again the thing is is that once I cut my
hair to my shoulders which I should be
getting my hair done soon I probably
will because I probably won't be able to
throw it up but honestly I have hair
that is almost down to my bellybutton
you guys so during the summertime I like
to just get it off my face and my
favorite hairstyle to do is this
hairstyle and a lot of people think this
looks super messy and textured but
that's what I love about it I have very
fine flimsy flat hair so what I like to
do is tease my hair a little bit I put
in some sea salt spray and then I just
throw it up in a bun I don't even use a
bun maker and it puts together this
awesome textured bun and then also
during the summertime I usually throw a
little headband on as well so that is my
first summer essential just getting my
hair out of my face let's talk about
some perfumes that I love to use during
the summertime and I kind of reserved
these sent for the summer time if that
makes sense so here is the pairing that
I really liked together during the
summer the first is the pacifica malibu
malibu malibu lemon blossom perfume it
smells just like fresh cut lemons and I
like to pair that with the body shop
Satsuma body miss this smells like fresh
oranges so you have fresh lemons and
oranges I feel like citrus is one of
those sense that you can wear all year
long but especially
in the summertime it's really really
nice and I really adore those two I have
another one from Pacifica that is
amazing I want to spray this on me right
now hmm not gonna open my mouth or else
I'm gonna swallow it okay anyway this is
the Pacifica resilient mango grapefruit
perfume oh my god it smells so good it
honestly just smells like fresh mango
and fresh grapefruit combined together
and I feel like again fruit scents are
just so nice during the summertime so
this is definitely a summer essential
for me as well and then the final
perfume that I absolutely love during
the summertime I'm almost out of lookit
they're like literally the tiniest
amount left this is the coach poppy
citrine blossom so again we have a
little bit of like verbena mixed in with
some sweetness in here some floral
scents and then of course you have the
citrus it smells so good and I just
really really love this scent so I love
those perfumes during the summertime I
have to like kind of firming body
products that i like to use during the
summertime I have a lot of cellulite on
my lower thighs or might not my lower
thighs on my upper thighs and I asked so
i like to use these kind of products as
a quick fix before i go to the beach or
maybe if i'm wearing short shorts or
like a short sundress I like to use
these products I don't think over time
they get rid of your cellulite I don't
think you really can get rid of your
cellulite but this definitely firms
things up temporarily and I really do
like them so the first one is the nivea
skin firming cellulite concentrated
serum this one is nice it actually
leaves a really nice like sheen on your
skin as well so if you like having that
summer glow that is a nice product and
then this one is my favorite this is the
soap &amp;amp; Glory sit tight super intense 4d
well-targeted firming smoothing lower
body serum it's a really cool it
actually has like a peppermint tea sort
of sent it has caffeine in there so it
stimulates the actual like blood flow I
think that is so yeah it stimulates the
blood flow so that everything kind of
plumps up like wherever you want to put
it but this is where your lower half so
for your bum and for your legs I
absolutely love this stuff so it has
these little beads and it just rolled on
rolls on so nicely you press the actual
product it smells good and I really do
feel like you can feel this working it
starts to get kind of tingly and then i
will look at yet on my bum in the mirror
and it looks a little smoother and a
little more compact
tight so I really do like this product i
highly recommend checking that out for a
quick fix i have like okay I should say
it's not just this particular foundation
i am wearing this right now but i have a
lot of foundations during the summer
time that i like to wear i just wanted
to talk about this particular one
because i've been using it this week if
this is the smashbox camera ready BB
water drops so i like to wear CC creams
BB creams tinted moisturizers products
like that during the summertime because
they're very light weight on the skin
and honestly my combo oily skin goes
crazy during the summer and I'd get so
so so oily and anything just starts to
look textured on my face it starts to
gunk up if I have anything on like the
kat von d loc a tattoo foundation or
even my Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage it just looks horrible on my
skin I just can't pull it off during the
summertime so I really just wanted to
recommend either this particular product
or anything that's like kind of in that
family so like the Stila off with low
serum foundation is beautiful any sort
of product like that that's a very
lightweight on the skin especially if
you do have calm or oily skin I really
really like products like that so not
just this particular foundation this
one's really really good but any sort of
serum or like water foundation I really
really like to have during the
summertime and those are definitely
essentials also on that topic the tart
ring force of the sea aqua sealer this
is going to be like my go-to concealer
this whole entire summer I have a
feeling everything else feels so cakey
and horrible on my skin especially when
it starts to get warm and I get more
oily everything starts to gunk up
underneath my eyes nothing looks very
good I've been using this all week and
this is just going to be my go to
product this summer I already know it
because it's so lightweight and
beautiful again it's sort of like a
serum concealer or serum um well no wait
zero concealer or like a water serum
kind of like the water foundation or
water our serum foundation because I
can't talk you guys know what I'm trying
to say it's a very lightweight it's very
beautiful on the skin they both give
sort of like a satiny finish and it's
just so nice and lightweight but it will
cover like you know some basic dark
circles and like veins around your eyes
and things like that so I really
like to use that and that is going to be
a go-to for the summer for sure all
right the next two products I want to
talk about our powder foundation so
because i am oily during the summertime
i love to reach for something like this
it actually gives a really nice glow to
the skin today I do have on that
Smashbox camera ready BB water drops
with the tart aqua sealer and then I
went ahead and set everything in with
the Laura Geller balance in Brighton
foundation spf15 in the shade porcelain
so I have two shades here this
particular one is porcelain and then
this one is fair so you can definitely
see the color differences here it's
crazy the shade selection is not that
great so this one is fair it is too dark
for me this one is porcelain it's a
little little light on my skin tone
right now while I am self tanning so I
like to mix them together they give it
beautiful beautiful like satiny finish
to the skin it looks gorgeous and I feel
like it gives you a little bit of extra
coverage since during the summertime I
personally don't like to wear anything
too heavy on my skin I feel like it
gives me a little bit of extra coverage
but also it gives me like a nice glow to
the skin so I love those those are
definitely summer essentials the next
two items I want to talk about are
probably my favorite eyeliners ever for
the summer time the first one is the
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil in
the shade Roche which is a beautiful
kind of like bourbon color I love this
and I think just because I wear less eye
makeup usually during the summertime or
I like to wear eye makeup that's kind of
like flattering for my eye color like
lots of bronzy shades and you don't like
summary gold shades and I just find that
that is so flattering on the waterline
and this one is really really nice as
well this is the next slide I'm glide on
stay on and definitely a turn on
eyeliner in the shade golden bronze it's
absolutely stunning as well and it's so
beautiful on the waterline it has a
little bit of a red undertone but it
just makes your eyes pop especially if
you do have blue eyes like I do so I
love those two the next item is kind of
like a recent favorite but I know this
is going to be something that I reach
for all the time this summer this is
same alley ever color poreless face
defender and this is like the strangest
thing ever it's basically a silicone
primer in like a compact form and what
you do is as you get oily throughout the
day sometimes if you have oily skin or
combos
like me you know that when you just keep
applying powder it starts to just break
up throughout the day and you can use
those little like blotting cloths but
sometimes they do take off your
foundation this is awesome you go in
with a sponge or even just your finger
and you tap over the areas that you want
to basically get rid of the oil and it's
like a silicone primer so it's not
adding any coverage it's not taking away
coverage it basically just mattifies
your face it's awesome it really makes
your pores disappear and it really helps
with oil so that is definitely a summer
essential for me alright the next two
items are also summer essentials I pop
these out every single summer I've had
these for like two years now these are
my NARS illuminators liquid illuminators
in the shades Copacabana and super
orgasm I love mixing these into my
lightweight foundations during the
summer this one is really really nice if
I do have a foundation that is a bit
dark and then if I want to add a little
bit of a glow to my skin I will mix in
super orgasm which definitely has more
orangie reddish tones I just think
they're absolutely beautiful they give a
beautiful Sheen to the skin and I think
that's perfect during the summertime
alright the next item I want to talk
about is definitely micellar water I
don't know where like where I would be
what I would do without micellar water
especially during the warmer months so
when I remove my makeup I usually use my
bosha makeup break up cool cleansing oil
and during the summertime I have to go
in and cleanse my face with the micellar
water after i cleanse it if that makes
sense so I'll remove my makeup I'll
cleanse my face with my rock resurfacing
disk and then I have to go in with this
as well because i am that oily so i
highly recommend these simple micellar
cleansing water or the Gagne with the
pink cat version if you do have you know
combo to oily skin if you have dry skin
check out the blue cap version but yeah
my seller waters are awesome it's a
quick way to clean your face really
really quickly remove I makeup and also
it just helps pick up excess residue
that is on your skin alright the next
item I want to talk about that I know is
going to be a favorite this summer is
the milk makeup this is the cooling
water stick anything that is super super
lightweight on the skin during the
summertime is definite
going to be a favorite from me I think I
had another item oh here it is um this
one is good as well this is the
Neutrogena hydroboost water gel these
are just really really lightweight
moisturizers and no matter what even
during the summertime you do need to go
ahead and still moisturize your skin
even if you are oily and I really like
the two of these this one is sort of
newer to me but I've been using it
throughout the spring and it doesn't
make me oily it doesn't leave a residue
on my skin it's super super beautiful
and very easy to use this is what it
looks like and you just kind of put it
all over your face it's kind of cooling
it moisturizes your skin and it just
leaves a beautiful beautiful finish and
it doesn't leave you I Lee and then the
Neutrogena hydroboost water gel with
hyaluronic acid is amazing as well I
feel like if you do have combo oily skin
it gives you just the right amount of
moisture without going overboard and
they also do have a version for dry skin
all right let's see here moving on oh
yes the last two items I wanted to talk
about are more like sun care or sun you
know related items so for me personally
this is a summer essential for me I am
the kind of girl that does carry an
umbrella around during the summertime I
am very sensitive to the Sun and I just
like to carry an umbrella with me i'm
not gonna open it because I heard that's
bad luck um anyway I do like to carry an
umbrella with me if you are really
worried that you are going to get burned
or if you're going to if you're going on
holiday or something like that and
you're spending long days in the Sun
sometimes your sun protection just isn't
going to cut it so i highly recommend
just carrying like a black umbrella with
you and that will block the race that
will block the race from you know
burning your face off or your body off
like me all right and then the last item
i want to talk about is this adorable
hat here i feel so like retro when i
wear this style retro but i feel very
like classy i don't know why i think
it's because it's one of those really
big floppy hats and you can kind of like
design the little like hood here or
whatever this is called what is this
called a little flap here you can kind
of put it like how you want it so i like
to put it like up high and then like
download yeah ok so when i wear it it
looks like I'm just kind of like oh so I
really really
like this I got this at TJ maxx it was
like 399 it's so cute and I like to wear
this one I'm at the stage alright guys
so those are my summer essentials these
are the items i will be using this
summer these are items that i am super
excited to use i know i will be using
and some of them are new and i've only
been using them during the spring time
but i already know they're going to be
favourites and then others i use
consistently every single summer so i
