thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day I
don't care to share a video with you
guys so I'm very excited about it was a
requested video and I just want to say
right away I love when you guys request
videos I do plan my video is about a
month in advance so sometimes I don't
get to the video idea right away but I
want to let you guys know I do write
them down I do keep track of them so
please keep giving me your requests on
videos that you want to see but anyway
because you guys know I try and film
every day and sometimes I run out of
ideas and I'm curious as to what you
guys want to see so please let me know
below but anyway I am here with a
viewers request today this is my
favorite drugstore makeup I went through
my whole makeup collection and I picked
up the items that I absolutely adore
from the drugstore and I have a lot of
stuff to show you so let's just get
right into it
the first thing I want to talk about our
baby looks and I didn't just pick one I
brought this whole little container and
I have even more of them actually they
just I wish that this thing was like
three little rows because then I could
probably fit all my baby lips but I love
all of these I love all the formulas I
love the electric ones I love the doctor
rescue I like just the original ones
this is the newer one this is the Baby
Lips and spice it up it's a beautiful
kind of reddish color I just love these
these are my favorite formula of lip
products like in general literally from
the drugstore and like high-end just
because I am a flute player and I'll be
completely honest most of the time I
have to wipe off the lipstick that I'm
wearing for the day or the lip product
that I'm wearing for the day and
basically wipe it off with the white
before I go and I practice my flute
because then it gets really gunky and
disgusting like my actual flute head toy
does so baby lips are something that I
can actually wear while I'm playing
flute so I've read them on stage I wear
them while I'm practising they're just
my favorite favorite formula so that is
definitely the first thing the second
thing is one lipstick from Maybelline
this is in six sixty a touch of spice
this is one of their matte lipsticks I
love this lipstick it is the most
gorgeous color ever I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch it for you guys and I don't
know I just literally would wear this
color every single day
if I could it smells really good it has
a wonderful formula it lasts all day and
that is what it looks like I think it's
beautiful you can wear at any time of
the year absolutely stunning and then
another lip products that I absolutely
love from the drugstore is this revlon
colorburst lacquer balm and this is in
the shade 115 whimsical and you guys can
probably see I really love this like the
tip is basically like falling off
probably need a new one of these but
that is the shake right there it is a
beautiful kind of berry like lacquer
color like it's super glossy on the lips
that lacquer kind of stain and it's
beautiful and it really does leave
behind a gorgeous kind of berry colored
stain but that is the touch of spice and
there is the lacquer one lacquer balm
from Revlon in the shade whimsical it
does have chunks of glitter in it but I
don't find that the formula like it
bothers my lips of whatsoever I actually
think it's very very comfortable on the
lips and I love the stain that it leaves
after alright so those are my favorite
lip products from the drugstore I want
to go ahead and talk about favorite
foundations from the drugstore there are
two the first one is from L'Oreal this
is the infallible Pro matte 24 hour
foundation it is a demi matte finish
it's air light oil-free this is an
amazing foundation from the drugstore my
shade is 101 classic ivory and I just
love the finish of this foundation I
think it really has like medium to
buildable full coverage like you can go
full on out with this foundation I think
it's a wonderful option from the
drugstore it's not as drying as the
Revlon Colorstay sometimes I find the
Revlon Colorstay to be a bit drying on
my skin no matter if I pick up the
combination formula or the one for dry
skin I just find it dry but this is
absolutely gorgeous on the skin and I
really love that you can build up the
coverage and then the other thing I want
to talk about I am almost through with
can you guys see that I feel like I
don't talk about this very often but
this is a product that I reach for if
I'm in a hurry in the morning two pumps
of this is perfect all over my face it
is the covergirl plus au lait CC cream
this is the tone rehab foundation in 105
ivory I love the formulation of this I
believe they are repackaging this their
newest foundation that
we came out with like the swirly thing
going on in it it's like it's called the
moisturizing like anti-aging like oh
sorry my hair it's all dumpy it's called
the moisturizing anti-aging foundation
or something like that that is actually
I'm pretty sure just this repackage it's
amazing it's got like a built-in
moisturizer but it has that color
correction thing going on and it's just
it's beautiful
it does tend to oxidize a little bit it
gets a little orange II and pink on the
skin but if I top it with a really light
powder I don't have any issues so that
is such a favorite from the drugstore
all right as far as concealers go
there's really one that I reach for on a
daily basis I'm wearing it today I wear
it almost every single day it is the
maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser treatment in the
brightener shade I've gone through so
many of these I love this underneath the
eye area I go in the little triangle
I'll bring you down the bridge of my
nose a little bit up onto my forehead
and then I do it on my chin as well it
is beautiful it just brightens up
gorgeously it doesn't settle into fine
lines or wrinkles or anything like that
it's really a fantastic fantastic
concealer from the drugstore
as far as primers go I would say my
favorite face primer from the drugstore
is from Garnier it's the five-second
blur skin renew instant smoother this is
kind of categorized as like a skincare
item however I use it and most people
use it as a primer it's just a really
nice kind of silicone II primer that
really really really fills in pores and
fine lines and things like that and it
looks absolutely beautiful you want to
make sure you really really moisturize
before you use this because it kind of
makes your foundation sit a little funky
on your skin if you are not completely
properly hydrated before use but it's
amazing I love it another product that
you guys have probably seen me talk
about is this little Revlon age defying
wrinkle remedy line filler this is what
I use around my eye area underneath my
eyes and then
I moved my forehead I love to like these
scents so I like to put it on to little
areas where I do that and basically it's
just a heavy-duty silicone sort of
primer and it basically just fills in
the pores fills in the fine lines and
have a very silky silicone II texture to
it and I really feel like that targets
certain areas that have like crevices or
texture and it really just kind of like
fills them out if that makes sense so
really really love that product I use
that basically on a daily basis all
right as far as setting my foundation I
love a lot of drugstore powders I really
love the Revlon Colorstay this does any
shade translucent you guys can see I
have hit pan on that I love it I also
really love my Rimmel stay matte this is
Ian a zero zero one transparent I also
really love this is you guys could
probably tell when my fit fan on a lot
of these but I must say I recently found
a new like tried-and-true amazing
amazing setting powder from L'Oreal this
is the True Match mineral instant shine
eraser powder in the shade n12 I got
this like two weeks ago and I have
already hit pan so I really really love
this it is so finely milled like you can
barely detect it on the skin and I love
powders like that because you know you
want your powder to be undetectable I
wear a lot of powder and I don't want it
to look cakey and this just looks
absolutely stunning on the skin so I
really really love that powder all right
as far as the blushes are concerned
there are serene from the drugs starting
away for from the drugstore that are
like a ride or dies for me the first one
is from L'Oreal this is a cream blush
this is called the L'Oreal visible lift
color lift blush this is in the shade
rose gold
oh my gosh and guys this is a stunning
blush can you guys see that your ad
essence I'm gonna have to swatch it for
you so you guys can fully see this is
one of the most gorgeous blushes like
ever just in general but also definitely
from the drugstore it is just so
beautiful it's gorgeous on the cheeks
and it just has this gold iridescent to
it that is absolutely stunning I highly
recommend checking out this formula it
sits beautifully on the cheeks I don't
find it to be like Bob it doesn't
irritate if I
have powder on top of like my foundation
and then I put a cream product on
sometimes it irritates it doesn't
irritate it you guys know what I'm
trying to say it goes in and kind of
breaks up that powder and it looks like
oh I just put a liquid product on top of
powder and it looks messy this blush
does not do that whatsoever has a really
silicon e sort of texture to it it's
absolutely stunning the second one I
want to talk about is from where is this
from Milani I can't even I don't even
know anymore because it has completely
rubbed off but yeah it's from Milani
it's the Luminoso baked powder blush in
0-5 this is the stunning stunning blush
you guys will see I really love these
kind of Corley iridescent shades this
used to be like a bubble and you guys
can see it's like totally it used to be
like a dome and now it's literally just
nothing I have used this so much so that
is what the color looks like it is
beautiful on everybody skin tone you can
wear this if you have dark skin tan skin
pale skin just you know if you're
completely transparent like me this will
look beautiful on you it's a gorgeous
blush it's got lots of glow and I really
do like a lot of the Milani baked blush
this I think I have every single one of
them but this is by far my favorite by
the way the L'Oreal visible lift blushes
they have other ones too i think i have
nude lift and what's the other one
called coral lift I believe it is
they're all beautiful but this rose gold
shade is my favorite and then I have a
favorite from L'Oreal I love these True
Match blushes these are fantastic this
one is in innocent flush and 3/4 and it
is a super blendable bra blush and
that's what it looks like again that
kind of beautiful iridescent sort of
peachy color I think I really like these
colors which they have like a silver
undertone and I have a cool undertone in
my skin so I feel like they just are
very flattering on my skintone but that
is what that color looks like it is
absolutely gorgeous I just love that I
love the formula these super blendable
and blushes are really really fantastic
and you get a lot of product in here and
then the last potion I want to talk
about is from cover
I love these classic color blushes this
is old school old school packaging
literally smells like old school makeup
I kind of like it though but it smells
like old school makeup really old school
packaging like I said and this shade is
called 540 rose silk there's another
shade called soft mink which is also
beautiful but this is super gorgeous and
it has that kind of beautiful iridescent
to it again that silver iridescent sort
of color but it's more of a rosy pink
tone than a peach toned any peach tone
so this is what it looks like so that is
it right there hopefully you guys can
see it I feel like sometimes with the
lighting and also the fact that it's so
your deffence
all that shows up the silver it looks
like I'm just putting stuff on my cheeks
but anyway that is definitely a favorite
of mine as long as you can get past the
old school packaging and the smell
you're good to go alright I share this
from the drugstore the l'oreal
infallible shadows are incredible and i
have two that i highly recommend these
are my favorites the first one is 892
amber rush these feel like butter they
glide on like butter this color in your
crease with the other color that I'm
going to mention on your lid is amazing
so that is what the color looks like
that is amber rush and it just goes on
so beautifully so there is amber rush
it's definitely a favorite and then I
love putting this one on my lid this is
997 eternal sunshine which is a gorgeous
or just gold color
I mean it's so beautiful that's what it
looks like I would say if you're gonna
get one of them get the amber rush one
because it literally it's will make any
eye color pop so there's eternal
sunshine on the bottom really really
really gorgeous love these they haven't
gorgeous formulation they last all day
they're buttery they're smooth they're
easy to blend everything you could want
literally everything you could want in a
single eyeshadow as far as palettes go
from the drugs
I love these Maybelline eye studio
palettes but this one is my definite
like Holy Grail
go to this isn't number 70 copper chic
you've probably seen a lot of these they
do limited-edition ones they have a lot
just regular ones in the collection but
this is copper chic it's absolutely
gorgeous it has a nice highlight shade
these feel so good they are so buttery
you guys those are the sheets right
there and they are just absolutely
stunning I don't know what else to say
they're so easy to blend and I feel like
this is like the perfect neutral
everyday sort of look copper colors look
absolutely stunning on I think every
single eye color especially if you have
green eyes like yes girl yes so yeah
that's definitely a favorite I just wish
you got more product in there and then
the other two that I want to talk about
are from Physicians Formula these are
the matte collection quads they look
very basic and boring but these are
amazing the first one is a warmer color
this is in classic nudes and these are
just all matte shadows you literally can
do anything with these so that is the
first favorite the second one is a
little more cool tone this is Canyon
classics again super super gorgeous
great to find really really nice quality
pigmented blendable buttery matte
shadows at the drugstore all right now I
have another little eye shadow single
that I want to talk about here I'm
wearing it today are we're effectively
every single day this is the wet and
wild creme brulee single and it's
amazing it's like $1.99 at the drugstore
it literally you just put this all over
your lid from your eyelid all the way up
to your brow bone before you put on your
highlight or even your like your brow
bone highlight or your the transition
color this is amazing it evens out your
eyelids it works for everybody's skin
tone I don't know what the deal is it
works for my skin tone it works for
people that have darker
in towns danced in tongues it just evens
it out and makes it look buttery and
beautiful and it will just even the
color out on your lid I can't even tell
you it's so creamy and so smooth you
can't even take this underneath the eye
and it really really looks beautiful as
well so love that and then something I
don't talk about enough and I literally
wear every single day is the Physicians
Formula
eye brightener in natural eye light
really really strange weird ugly
packaging but this is what it looks like
it came with a little brush that I threw
out but it's basically this little white
opalescent shadow that has tons and tons
of color correctors in it it's got green
yellow pink and when you swirl it all
together you get something like this and
this is beautiful on the inner corners
of the eyes and that is what I use it
for and I use this literally every
single day and it really does brighten
up your eyes you can take this
underneath your lower lash line if for
some reason you're extremely tired but
for the most part I put it on the inner
corners of my eyes and I absolutely love
it
alright guys umm mascaras covergirl the
super sizer I don't know what it is with
this but it is the best when you first
get a new tube of it as it starts to dry
out it's not as good but this I don't
know what it is at this master it is
fantastic it makes my lashes look very
volumizing very lengthened this is what
the brush looks like it's very very
interesting it's kind of like smaller at
the bottom and then it tapers up and
gets bigger towards the top and it's
just got tons and tons of little spikes
on it and you really just pulls those
lashes up I mean it looks beautiful I
have not tried the waterproof formula
but the regular formula just stays
really nicely on my lashes I don't have
any issue with transferring I absolutely
love this mascara best one from the
drugstore in my opinion and then let's
talk about highlighters there is one
that I love from the drugstores so much
I love these wet and wild Fergie
highlighters you get a lot of products
in here and they're gorgeous or just
highlights but this particular one is so
creamy and beautiful this is the a 0 6 5
Hollywood Boulevard center stage
collection to reflect shimmer palette
this is what it looks like and I am a
huge fan of gold highlights
especially on fair-skinned a lot of
people are like I can't do a gold
highlight on fair-skinned and I'm like I
do it all the time and I love it this is
what it looks like it literally feels
like butter the formulation is just
different with this one than the other
ones the rosacea champagne glow and the
what's the other one called like blush
copper no blush I think that's Rebecca
they have a copper one - that's
beautiful but this is gorgeous it's a
very deep so I try and use it very very
lightly I like on my cheekbones but you
can top a blush with this you know this
would be gorgeous on medium to deep skin
tones just absolutely stunning and
literally the formulation of this one
just feels like butter I don't know why
I felt like the rosacea Champaign glow
one or really really has like a lot of
texture to it it still looks beautiful
though on the skin but this one feels
like butter I really don't know I don't
know and then the last product that I
want to talk about that is a favorite
from the drugstore is the NYC smooth
skin bronzing face powder in sunny I
love this I've heard a lot of people
can't really use this for contouring or
bronzing because it looks a little too
orange on their skin I'm very fair and
this looks absolutely stunning on my
skin I really really like it if you have
fair skin this is a beautiful bronzer
you can even probably contour with it a
little bit but it's fantastic it's in 7
to 0 a sunny and it will last forever it
is completely matte it's just absolutely
beautiful so anyway that is it you guys
those are my favorite drugstore makeup
items I hope you guys enjoyed this video
