today and this is my Becca cosmetics
flying-saucer collection I call them
flying saucers because they basically
look like little spaceships to me these
are basically my Becca singles they do
include the light chaser highlighters
the luminous flush of blushes the
mineral blushes the shimmering skin
perfecter press as well as some bronzers
and split pans and I just thought today
you know this is a part of my collection
that I really do enjoy it's actually
what's right behind me when I'm filming
up my videos now and I thought maybe you
guys would be interested in me going
through and showing you everything one
by one so the first thing I want to
touch on is this little acrylic
organizer right here so I stored them
like this this is actually something
that was supposed to be mounted on my
wall but it's actually technically a
nail polish rack it fell off the
walls so I ended up just laying it flat
and popping these babies in here
currently I believe I have 22 or 23
singles so let's go ahead and start with
the light chaser highlighters I'm gonna
go ahead and show you guys them one by
one and then I will show you all of the
swatches side by side this first one
that we have here is called topaz
flashes guilt if you are a lover of
really really unique highlighters you
would enjoy this quite a bit I would
recommend it from medium to deep
complexions if you are super fair
complected this might be a bit dark on
you but I don't know if you guys can see
it really has a nice duo chrome almost
like a tri chrome sort of thing going on
here so you have some yellow some brown
as well as gold mixed in here so that is
the first light chaser highlighter the
next one that we have here is amethyst
flashes geode this one is a true blush
topper on my skin tone even if you do
have a medium complexion this is still
probably going to be more of a blush
topper now if you have a very very deep
complexion this is going to be a
beautiful beautiful midtone pink
highlight it does have a lot of silver
reflex to it and the formula on this one
is just a little more on the chunky side
so I wanted to give you guys a heads up
alright here we have let's see here rose
quartz flashes see Shelley I always
forget the name of this one and this is
beautiful if you have a fair complexion
especially if you do pull a cool
undertone you can see this is a gorgeous
kind of light pearly pink color and it
is very very beautiful
if rose quartz the limited edition rose
quartz shade is a little too dark for
you I would definitely recommend looking
into this one moving right along to
pearl Flash's gold if you have the
original pearl shimmering skin perfecter
press
you know that it's a beautiful
opalescent white color I actually
recently decluttered mine it because I
feel like I'll have a little more of a
tan down here in the desert and it just
doesn't really suit my skin tone anymore
it kind of looks like a white line on my
face and this one however has a very
strong gold shift to it it is quite do
pible makeup revolutions and baked
highlight in the shade is it called
golden light yeah I believe it's called
golden lights is pretty similar to this
one so if you do have that you probably
don't need this but it really is pretty
and it does have that kind of a
duochrome tendency where as you can see
it is like a beautiful white color with
a strong a goldish shift moving on we
have this really unique one as well this
one is called opal flashes Jade if you
have a fair complexion this is gonna
look like a little bit of a bruise on
your skin tone so again I would
recommend this mostly for those of you
with a medium to deep complexion it's a
gorgeous a purpley neutral color that
does have a strong green shift to it so
this is very very unique when you do hit
the green in here it's more like a
really really light minty green so it's
not anything that's gonna make you
straight-up look super super sick unless
like I said you do have a very fair
complexion there's something about this
that just doesn't wear the right way I
only wear this when I am self tanned but
it really is gorgeous and like I said
very very unique if you are looking for
something along those lines and then
finally guys the last light chase or
highlighter that we have here is my
all-time favorite this is champagne
dream of flashes of Bellini I recently
picked up the matching lipgloss and I
have to say definitely prefer the
highlighter over the lip gloss this is
just gorgeous it is this beautiful a
beautiful apricot peachy color and it
has a little bit of a pink shift to it
so if you do have a fair complexion and
especially if you do pull a warm
undertone and this would be a very very
gorgeous on you here are the swatches at
the top we have the shade at topaz
flashes gilt the second shade is
amethyst flashes geode up next the third
shade is the beautiful rose quartz
flashes seashell which is the baby pink
the goldish color is called pearl
flashes gold then we have the very
unique opal flashes Jade and finally
champagne dream flashes Bellini
alright let's move into the mineral and
luminous flush blush singles that I have
this first one is one of the mineral
blushes it is a matte technically but it
has more of a satin finish this is
called wild honey it is great for a
multitude of different complexions in my
opinion if you are very very deep this
might not look great on you it might be
a little too light but I feel like if
you have a ferret light or medium
complexion you would enjoy this if
you're super super fair you can actually
wear this as a bronzer as well so that
right there is wild honey up next we
have the shade a songbird songbird is
sort of similar to wild honey but this
one has a little more of a sheen to it
when I tell that you guys should be able
to see here it has a little bit of a
golden undertone so again very very
neutral and very pretty on the skin wild
honey and songbird kind of reminds me of
like a tart blush so if you're really
into that very very neutral natural look
I would highly recommend checking out
wild honey as well as this one which is
called songbird let's move into my
all-time favorite blush formula from
becca this is their luminous flush a
blush formula and this guy right here is
called Tiger Lily it is a true hot coral
shade and it does have a ton of shimmer
to it it may look like glitter but I
promise you it's not glitter these go on
very very flattering and they are
incredibly pigmented the next shade that
we have here is called a fox club this
is a gorgeous gorgeous a Barbie pink
however it has more purple undertones
then like ballerina pink undertones I
will show you guys camellia in a moment
and that one definitely has more true
pink undertones but this one is a little
more of a purpley lilac color absolutely
beautiful if you do have all sorts of
different complexions or skin tones and
then here is camellia this one I would
definitely recommend if you have a fair
complexion there's something about this
that really does brighten up the
complexion it does look quite similar to
foxglove but when you get them on to the
actual cheeks I personally see a
difference especially if you pull a cool
undertone when I do swatch them out
you'll see they look quite similar you
don't need both but I personally have
both because like I said I'm obsessed
with this formula and then finally we do
have snapdragons Snapdragon is a
gorgeous gorgeous hot coral this is
definitely one I would recommend for a
ton of different skin tones it is very
very unique I don't feel like I have a
lot of blushes that look like this so I
really do enjoy that one starting
at the top with the warm tone two
blushes we have a wild honey
the second shade is called songbird
which is a little more of a peachy terra
cotta underneath that we have the
luminous flush blush in the shade at
Tiger Lily which is number three and
then getting into the more cool tone to
blushes the first one we have is
foxglove which is a little more purple
toned underneath that we have the
ballerina pink which is called camellia
and finally we have Snapdragon which is
the hot coral let's move into the full
size limited edition shimmering skin
perfecter press this first one that we
have right here is called rose quartz a
lot of people know about this highlight
and I know that I'm showing limited
edition of products but keep in mind a
lot of Becca highlights that are limited
edition do you come back in stock at
some point and they end up being
permanent so if this is a really nice
mid tone pink shade it used to be one of
my favorites until lilac geode came out
this is very flattering on so many
different skin tones if you're very very
fair just be aware that this might be a
little dark on you moving on we have
prismatic amethyst this was definitely
one of my favorites when I first got its
because it is great for fair complexions
you guys can see it's a true white
opalescent shade but you do have a
little bit of a lilac as well as a
little bit of a pink shift in here it's
gorgeous on the skin again really really
nice if you do have a fair complexion
but right now I'm finding it a little
stark it's like a stark white on my skin
when I am self tanned so I don't where
it's super super often here we have
lilac geode I love this one this is
amazing if you do have a little more of
like a light medium or deep complexion
it is absolutely stunning you guys it
has this lavender hint to it with a gold
shift and this is definitely one of my
favorite shimmering skin perfectors as
of right now so definitely would
recommend looking into that baby if you
can pick it up the top we have rose
quartz the middle shade is a prismatic
amethyst and finally at the bottom we
have lilac a geode up next we have the
Becca gradient glow shimmering skin
perfecter press this is basically a
mixture of all of the Becca shimmering
skin perfecter press in one or at least
the majority of that
I swirl it together and I usually use it
as a blush topper it's great if you do
have a medium to deep complexion I think
you would get a lot of use out of this
the only problem with this highlight is
you can't really dip in one row
specifically this guy was actually sent
to me from Becca for PR so I was happy
to get it but it's definitely not my
all-time favorite shimmering skin
perfecter press I might actually
declutter this one so I did want to
still show it I have no idea if this one
is permanent or limited-edition I'm
pretty sure it might be a limited
edition and then up next we do have a
champagne pop now this one is a brand
new at my friend recently sent this to
me so thank you Samantha she sent this
to me for Christmas but we like to send
each other packages back and forth so
this was very very sweet I had been
wanting a full-size of champagne pop
especially when I am self-tan and this
is a beautiful beautiful color if you do
have a very fair complexion this is not
going to work for you I know it is a
cult favorite and everybody loves this
shade but just know that if you are very
very fair complected you would probably
be better off with Prosecco pop now
Prosecco pop looks a little something
like this it is a true yellow toned gold
and you may be thinking that also
probably wouldn't work for me if I'm
fair complected but if you use a light
hand it would be better now again a
Prosecco pop as well as champagne pop in
my opinion look best on light to medium
and deep complexions um but still this
is Prosecco pop and I love mixing it
together with champagne pop I think it
looks amazing and then finally guys we
have a moon stone a moon stone is
definitely probably my most reach for
out of all of them I love this because
it does have a little bit of warmth to
it it has kind of like a yellow golden
undertone to it so if you don't want
something that's stark white like I told
you guys I did recently declutter pearl
I would highly recommend moonstone a lot
of people also love opal opals a little
dark on me so I reach more for moonstone
but I really do enjoy this little baby
so at the top we have champagne pop the
second shade is gradient glow which is
all of them mixed together then we have
a moon stone which is the yellow
opalescent color and finally we have
Prosecco
pop
finally we have my sunlit bronzers as
well as Maya Becca split pan so this is
in the shade Bali sands and this is a
really really nice light bronzer really
great if you do have a fair complexion
or a light complexion even possibly a
medium complexion if you're super deep
but this is probably not gonna go deep
enough for you but the good news is is
that Becca actually released quite a few
of these I believe there's 68 bronzers
that range any different a variety of
colors so that is valley sands and then
I also do have Capri coast which is a
little more cool tone and a little
deeper in tone so this one again it
would be great if you do have a deeper
complexion and also if you do have a
medium complexion I have compared these
to the Physicians Formula where more
butter bronzers so I'll go ahead and
throw that video up in the cards if you
would like to see the difference but
yeah those are my two of Becca sunlit
bronzers now we have the Becca split
pans the first one I have here is flower
child and champagne a pop and now I do
feel like champagne pop is a little
different in here than it is in the
full-size kind of like how it is a
little different in a palette form and
than it is in full-size but it's not
anything horrible I think this is
actually still very nice I love flower
child
I need a full-size a flower child as far
as blushes are concerned I don't need it
but I want it right now as you guys
could tell when I first showed the
collection this little container here is
not gonna allow me to get too many more
of these so if I ever do pan a specific
a blush from a Becca the first one I
will repurchase his definitely flower
child but they don't sell these anymore
but they definitely should this was
really really good quality it did come
out with the Jaclyn hill collection and
like I said a flower child is gorgeous
and champagne pop is very very nice for
a multitude of different skin tones and
then here we have hyacinth as well as
champagne pop bright bright fuchsia
right here absolutely gorgeous great for
a deep complexion light complexion
medium complexion fair complexion
practically everybody can wear this and
get some sort of color payoff and then
here we have champagne pop again so
anyway guys those are all of my little
flying saucers are from Abeka let's go
ahead and jump into the swatches of
these guys at the top we have the first
split pan we have champagne pop and
hyacinth which is that deep a deep a
magenta color then we have champagne pop
and flower child which is a little more
peachy and then we have bali sans a
bronzer and capri coast
so that is it guys I hope this video was
helpful I hope it was fun to see all of
these different highlights in natural
lighting and maybe it will help you guys
when you do go shopping for your next
little Becca's fine saucers but that is
pretty much it thanks again for joining
me and I guess I will see you guys
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
