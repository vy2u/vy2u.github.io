my channel today I wanted to walk you
guys through my favorite cruelty free
skin care products as of recently I've
been getting a lot of questions about
what I have been doing for my skin now
that it is more normal to dry I used to
have a more combo oily skin back when I
was living in the Midwest as well as
back when I was on a lupus trial I was
taking certain certain medications that
were making my skin a little more oily
and now that I'm done with that trial I
have dried out quite a bit and obviously
I live in the desert now so a lot of
people have been asking what exactly I
have been using what had been my
favorite product so I thought I'd walk
you guys through those today but let's
go ahead and just jump right into it I
want to start with some oil so are the
two oils that I have been reaching for
the most in my collection recently have
been the 100% organic cold-pressed
rosehip seed oil from the ordinary as
well as the charts of maracuja oil I
really really enjoy both of these I
really love the mark huija oil when my
skin is a little more inflamed if you
guys don't know I do have lupus which is
a autoimmune disease and I am left with
a lot of scarring and as well as just a
rough textured skin and also rashes when
I do have this flare-ups now I have been
very very lucky
ever since I changed up my medication
around as far as lupus is concerned I
have not actually had a flare on six
months now now that I have taken a more
natural Catholic approach but if this is
something that I go for it and time I
have rashes on my skin a lot of people
say maracuja oil is so hydrating and so
beautiful and it is quite hydrating but
it's not the most hydrating oil out
there really is actually made of for
inflammation so if you do have inflamed
skin at mark crude oil is fantastic in
my opinion and then the organic
cold-pressed Rosoff seed oil is very
calming on the skin and also very
hydrating I feel like my most hydrating
oil that I probably have in my
collection is my a josie maran argan oil
that can definitely clog your pores if
you are and not super super dry but I
feel like my dry skin just sinks you
know takes it right in drinks it up
basically but this is definitely like my
go-to go-to oil currently I love it in
the morning 11:00 at night I like mixing
it into foundations to kind of thin them
out and give them more of a skin like
appearance this is just absolutely
beautiful would highly recommend looking
into the Ordinaries 100% cold press
rosehip seed oil it is out so a very
very well priced so really enjoy that
alright moving on let's go ahead and
talk about them
favorite facial scrub currently it has
been the ocean salt so this is from lush
now this could be quite abrasive on the
skin you have to be very very careful if
you're a very sensitive skin do not
reach for this if you have open wounds
or open cuts or open pimples on your
face don't reach for this this does have
alcohol in it this is only something
that I've used before like a big show or
something that I use when I really need
that glowing skin and I really need to
swap off that top layer of dead skin so
I don't use this any more than once a
week sometimes I'll only use it once
every two weeks but it really does work
well it is kind of like there's a bluish
color as you guys can see and I don't
use this on my body because I feel like
it's a waste of money this tiny little
container here is around $30 but
wouldn't I recommend the ocean salt from
a lush if you are looking for a very
very deep cleansing sort of scrub all
right as far as toners are concerned I
have a couple here that I want to share
the first one is the pixie skin treats
glow tonic this is a 5% glycolic acid a
toner I also do have the Mario Badescu
what glycolic acid toner I feel like
they're very similar but there's
something about the pixie one it really
gives me just more radiance to my skin
and now glycolic acid is great if you do
have dry skin because it will exfoliate
your skin but also it's great for taking
care of breakouts and any sort of
congested skin problems that you might
have in general so I would recommend
this for all sorts of different skin
type except for sensitive if you do have
sensitive skin this is gonna be probably
a little too much for you you have to
follow up with sunscreen if you are
going to use this in the morning I would
not recommend using it in the morning go
ahead and use it at nighttime but it
really is fantastic I notice the
difference when I use this with my skin
so I really do love the pixie skin
treats plutonic I also love the layers
of witch hazel aloe vera formula in the
rose petal version I have not tried the
lavender one yet lavender is an
ingredient that can make me a little
sensitive on as far as my skin is
concerned I will be showing a cleanser
here in a minute but does have lavender
oil in it but that's definitely
something you should look out for if
your skin care ingredients lavender can
be a big-big skin irritant for a lot of
people so I'm just sticking with the
rose petal I love the scent of this it
is made in the USA and it is cruelty
free as you guys can see it this is a
very very basic witch hazel sort of
toner I don't find that it leaves me Sun
sensitive even though there is witch
hazel in here I would say it's currently
kind of up for debate on whether or not
witch hazel makes people Sun sensitive
some people swear it makes them Sun
sensitive and some people don't I don't
notice any difference I really don't
know
irritates my skin witch hazel tends to
get a little bit of a bad reputation
because a lot of people use this for
breakouts and they think if I have dry
skin I can't use a witch hazel because
it's going to dry me out I don't have
pimples I don't need it it actually is
fantastic for all sorts of different
skin types so I love the Thayer's witch
hazel
it is a alcohol-free toner absolutely
fantastic would recommend this for all
sorts of different skin types including
sensitive alright moving on guys let's
go ahead and talk about a neck cream
here quickly because I think it's very
important to go ahead and make sure that
you are taking products onto your neck
especially at nighttime when you have at
the time to kind of let your neck be
free you know what I mean I feel like
during the daytime I'm never really
prone to taking my skincare products
down my neck I always like to take them
on the back of my hand and then go in an
upward motion so I can get it onto my
neck easily and if you take the back of
your hand and you kind of woke up like
this it's easier than going like this
but anyway kind of a tip but anyway I'm
and what I was saying it was I feel like
during the daytime when I have stuff
around my neck even though I live in
Arizona I still bear like scarves and
stuff sometimes it's just weird to kind
of have a heavy cream like this but this
is the Mario Badescu vitamin A de
vitamin aid and neck cream it is
beautiful it is humectant it is quite
oily and you will feel it on your neck
so again would recommend using this at
night time instead of during the day
your hair will get stuck to it you know
it's just one of those very very heavy
neck creams but I feel like when I wake
up in the morning I see less little
lines right here and I really do like
that I feel like you need to take care
of your neck it's very important that is
the first area that I can always tell
someone's age is by their neck because a
lot of people forget to take their skin
care down their neck so what I they
recommend via Mario Badescu vitamin A de
and neck cream all right guys I'm moving
on to an essence I have the elf
hydrating water essence right here at
first I walked into absolutely in love
with the ingredients listed in here but
I will say this really helps so that my
makeup looks better throughout the day
so not necessarily may be the best
ingredients that you could ever find in
a hydrating water essence but I have to
say I even found a lot of essences that
on cruelty free so and this is a very
good one in my opinion it just retail
for ten dollars a little goes a very
long way what I like to do is if I go a
little too hamp with my toner and I do
take off a little too much from my skin
but the point of a toner is to actually
balance out your skin balance out the pH
it's not just strip it now we've all
been there where we have put on a toner
and it really does strip the skin this
is a great way to go back in and kind of
create that barrier again so you're a
little more pumped up before going in
with your serum
so I would take a little bit of this
onto my hands I just kind of rub it
together and then I pushed into my skin
I follow up with my serum and then I do
my day cream so anyway I do like this
during the day time it is quite
hydrating but not anything that's going
to interfere with certain ingredients so
if you do want to go in and we say like
the drunk elephants Ephrem add a serum
these are not going to eat your fear
with each other it's lightweight it's
beautiful and if you do have very oily
skin you can actually use this
technically as a moisturizer let's go
ahead and talk about my current favorite
face cream for both a day and night so
this is great because you can mix it
with all sorts of different things it
will not interfere what they see for my
base serum it will not interfere with
retinol it is just a great really
fantastic very very moisturizing cream
you are getting vitamin A I'm sorry
vitamin A and E in here as well as Josie
Marans 100% pure argan oil as well as
some essential fatty acids it's very
basic but it's beautiful and hydrating
if you have extremely dry skin this is
definitely something I would check out
if you are more common oil II honestly I
would skip on this one maybe go for the
argan oil light but this is a very very
thick creamy luxurious face cream and
honestly this is what has been keeping
my skin nice and pumped throughout to
these colder months it's not even cold
here you guys know what I mean actually
say these drier months here at Arizona
all right speaking of the drunk
elephants Ephrem add a serum this has
been my go-to serum I like to use this
at night as well as during the daytime
if you do wear it during the daytime of
course follow up with a sunscreen wear a
sunscreen every single day you guys is
very very important but this is great I
I really do enjoy it a lot of people ask
me what's the difference between this
one and the ola Hendrickson truth serum
which is a kind of serum that I like to
use in the morning as well what I like
about this one is it really does make a
difference with hyperpigmentation as
well as acne scarring I also find that
this can help to clear up breakouts if
you are dealing with that did you go
through a little bit of skin per G when
you first start this so I do want to let
you guys know I started breaking out
worse and when I first started using
this but a month into it it's absolutely
fantastic
I enjoy this quite a bit I've gone
through three full sizes of this I
believe and it's just a really really
good day serum if you want to serum
that's actually gonna do something would
highly recommend the drunk a low fantasy
furmity serum alright and finally I
thought I would go ahead and share my
two favorite cleansers currently the
first one is from Pacifica it is the
seafoam complete base wash this is 100%
vegan as well as cruelty free I got this
probably about three weeks ago on an
already down to here it took this on my
vacation to Hawaii it was the only
cleanser I used for ten
in a row and it's fantastic it really is
fantastic originally I kind of felt like
it didn't remove all the grime that I
needed it to but honestly it's just very
basic and very simplistic and good on
the skin it doesn't strip your skin it's
beautiful would highly recommend this
for all sorts of different skin types
except for sensitive it does have quite
a strong fragrance level here so that's
why I'm not gonna say that it's good for
sensitive skin I don't think you're
gonna like this if you do have sensitive
skin but I do enjoy the most of the guts
see a film a complete face wash and I
really want to try out to be elderberry
one neck so it's called berry berry or
some kind of berry I'm excited for that
one too and then here we have the chart
to reinforce of the CD type cleansing
gel remember how I talked about lavender
oil well this and there's lavender oil
infused into here a lot of the tart
rainforest of the sea a product I can't
use on my skin because it will have
inderal I get like a rashes okay but
there's something about this cleanser
that is great for double cleansing if
you go in at nighttime with a cleansing
oil or a cleansing ball and then you
want to double cleanse this is a
fantastic cleanser to do so whether it
really helps to take care of any sort of
residual makeup and I really do enjoy it
so anyway guys those are my current
favorite cruelty free skincare products
let me know down below what are your
current a favorite skincare products
then I guess I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
