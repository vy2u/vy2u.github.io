channel today I'm going to be sharing
with you guys my favorite products from
my least favorite brands now on Tuesday
I'm going to go ahead and switch it
around and I will talk about my least
favorite products from my favorite brand
so I hope you guys enjoyed this little
mini series let's go ahead and jump
right into it the first brand I want to
talk about is bare minerals I talked
about this in my series called a brand
that bore me I've been here when we did
like one little episode of that I need
to do another one but yeah bare minerals
is definitely one of those brands that
is very very basic in my opinion they
don't really go outside their comfort
zone it they're really really just
neutral and everything that I see that
they release kind of looks the same now
I will say be ready 8.0 eyeshadow
formula is fantastic and that is in each
of these palettes right here so these
are definitely on my favorite items from
bareMinerals hands-down so this is the
bare minerals ready i shadow 8.0 in the
shade of power and neutrals and this is
what it looks like it's just a really
really nice slim little compact and you
guys can see you get a bunch of
different shades in here I wouldn't say
that you get like the most diverse eye
looks with this I mean I feel like a lot
of the eye looks look very similar
because some of those are very muted but
I think the really really nice easy
palette to work with so I do enjoy that
and then this guy right here
my best friend Rochelle sent to me this
is the magic act palette and again it
has that 8.0 or 4.0 formula for the
eyeshadows and then gorgeous gorgeous
blushes as well as the bronzer and
highlight down here again the formula is
just really really nice and although the
shades look kind of similar to the other
palettes I will say this blush right
here you guys see this this is called
the Indecent Proposal honestly one of
the most beautiful blushes that I have
in my collection so really do enjoy
those from their minerals that let's go
ahead and talk about Bobby Brown now I
have tried it B Bobby Brown foundations
I have tried a lot of her skincare
products which I did like and I did try
the under eye corrector which I did not
get the hype about but these two
products right here I really do enjoy it
from Bobby Brown like I said there's not
a ton of stuff that I really try to
think I've tried maybe six items and I
liked to I don't suspect so I don't
really know why it's just that one of
those brands where I don't feel like
they're super super creative and they
tend to come out with the same thing
over and over and over again and I know
that she does kind of cater towards more
mature women that's what her line is
about but I will say I really do enjoy
her shimmer tricks
now this would be holiday 2016 at
pallets that came with three of them in
a pallet and you can still get these I
believe these exact shades for like
forty five dollars apiece but when I
first tried these out and when i
swatched them they were like they
literally feel like sandpaper
serious here that it literally sounds
like sandpaper it feels like sandpaper
but when you get them onto the actual
skin they're really really beautiful and
one of my favorite things about the
shimmer bricks is that they can actually
double and triple as eyeshadow and I
know some people use them as blush
topper and bronzer and it's just a
really really nice thing to have so I
really do enjoy that little palette
right there and then I do also love the
Bobbi Brown smoky eye mascara it's what
I have on today it's a super super Drive
formula so if you're not into that you
are not going to like this it doesn't
have a natural bristle wand as you guys
can see and this is not the full size
unfortunately Bobbi Brown does test so I
will not purchase the full size but I
haven't enjoyed my little deluxe eyes
it's a really really nice mascara and
although I'm not huge on the Bobbi Brown
brand I do enjoy that alright let's go
ahead and talk about to face the
Tuesday's have been on my list
lately now you guys know or maybe you
don't know two things used to be my
favorite brand of all time so I have a
lot of their stuff and that's why I talk
about it a lot but honestly lately they
have been disappointing me so they kind
of are on my list but I still
wanted to share my favorite items from
Too Faced so definitely the low flush
blushes b16 our blushes these are so
much better than the little sweethearts
boxed blushes or whatever this
particular shade right here is called
baby love which is a really really nice
and neutral shade I have all six of them
in full sizes they are really good and
they wear all day long and then as far
as eyeshadow palettes are concerned I
mean yes I can go get my chocolate bar
palette by semi-sweet and the bonbon so
honestly and these two 9pn palettes
right here are the best I really like
the natural matte this guy which is
called it be totally cute which is what
I have on my eyes today and then also I
adore my peanut butter and jelly palette
I actually prefer the formula and B is
over B chocolate bar palette so that is
just me I've always been a big sucker
for the 9 pan
formulas but not all of them are created
the same so I would say to be today are
currently my favorite alright moving on
let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about Laura Geller so Laura Geller is
again it kind of like a basic brand
remind me of bareMinerals a lot of base
stuff we never really get outside their
comfort zone but I will say they're
baked a lot of throw illuminators are
amazing I have peach whoa I have
charming pink and then I have this end
right here which is called gilded honey
I do have gilded honey swatched right
there is beautiful actually can work as
a highlight for me currently I really
love the formula on these it's just a
really nice smooth kind of baked shell a
formula so really adore that and then
also I do like the balance in Brighton
foundation and this particular sheet is
a little too light for me currently it's
called porcelain it does have SPF 15 in
it and honestly and this gives a really
really nice Sheen to the skin with a
little bit of coverage I have really
been enjoying it now that we are down
here in Arizona when I was in Milwaukee
I did notice I would get a little oily
and it made me look a little greasy
throughout the day but I have really
been enjoying this now I just take it
basically like a really really densely
packed Hino foundation brush and I kind
of just circle it all over my skin and
buff it in it looks beautiful and that
is definitely a product I would
recommend and just so you guys know
laura geller is now cruelty free whoa
all right guys and the final round that
I want to talk about even makeup forever
I have never been that big of a fan of
the makeup forever brand however I will
say they make some bomb-ass highlighters
and also bronzers so the first item I
want to talk about is something that I
have on today I have a little bit of
difficulties of blending the bronzer but
this is the makeup forever Pro sculpting
duo any shade at number two it has a
little sliver of bronzer and then a
beautiful gold highlight and I have that
on today I also have it on my lid this
is just amazing and very very similar to
the Laura Geller so here is the makeup
forever and then there is the Laura
Geller I was maybe Laura Geller's maybe
just a step deeper in tone but they have
the same sort of formulas super super
creamy and buttery and I also really do
like the profusion undetectable
Luminizer any shade zero one pink that's
also really beautiful and then I do have
this eyeshadow palette here and this was
the eyeshadow palette that really got me
into foiled eyeshadows this is called V
what's called Make Up For Ever a nine
artists shadow palette I think that's
the name of it I have volume 1 and I
have volume 2 this is what they look
like on the inside and you guys can see
this is a well-loved palette these are
just absolutely beautiful eyes they're
so creamy they're so buttery they were
like the first
they're going to come out with that
really really fine finish and make it
popular and I just think these are
amazing
I've had this palette in my collection
for over three years now they haven't
like dried out and gotten like kind of
goopy sometimes I notice that my foiled
shadows do get a little groupie like the
Tarte one so it's kind of weird but I
yeah I love this palette and this is
definitely a really really nice formula
so although I'm not a huge fan of makeup
forever I do enjoy that alright guys
that is pretty much it let me know down
below what products you love from brands
that you're not a huge fan of and yes
that's pretty much it I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
