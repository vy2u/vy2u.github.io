channel today's video is going to be my
five product wishlist for the Sephora
spring 2018 a vib sales reason for
products that are going to be
repurchases for me that are staples in
my collection that i want to save some
money on and then i have two different
products i have never tried and they are
more so in the warrant category i'm
going to start with the two products
that I wanted that I've never tried the
first one is from fenty Beauty this is
the new a body lava body Luminizer the
color that I'm most interested in is the
one called who needs clothes it's
supposed to be a glistening peach gold
and this does retail for $59 but you do
get three ounces of product in here and
this is an all over body Luminizer and
it is already 85 degrees here in Phoenix
Arizona I'm ready for summer I'm ready
for dresses and I love having a good
all-over kind of shiny a moisturizer or
shiny cream to put on my body especially
my legs if I'm on stage if I'm wearing
heels if I'm going out on date night I
just feel like I would really enjoy this
product so that is the first item that
is on my list
another want product is the Anastasi of
Beverly Hills powder bronzer in the
shade a rosewood I believe they have
five or six different shades to choose
from you do get a whopping 10 grams a
product in each pan which is amazing for
$28 and I fell in love with the Umbria
highlighter I think I will use that for
shot my stash at this coming week so on
Sunday I'll go ahead and choose that
highlighter with you guys but it is a
gorgeous gorgeous a champagne tone to
highlight and I love the texture of it I
love the consistency I love the wear
time and I feel like these powder
bronzers are just going to be as good
now I do understand that I have a lot of
bronzers in my collection mostly in face
pallets not so much in single bronzer
form but I'm very very interested in
testing this guy out I might purchase it
I might not now let's go ahead and talk
about the three different products that
are going to be repurchases for me that
are absolute staples in my collection
the first one is the pharmacy green
clean makeup melt away cleansing balm
with echinacea green and via it retails
for $34 and it is my all-time favorite
makeup remover currently I ran out of
this yeah
Knight and I have been using my makeup
eraser and it's just not the same I love
this bomb it's a great price if you're
ever you'd like to whipped consistency a
little goes a very long way and it
literally is air light when you hold the
jar you're like is there anything in
here I've been in removes makeup
beautifully and paired together with the
next product which is the drugged
elephant a jelly cleanser the bestie
number 9 jelly cleanser these really
really remove my makeup together very
nicely now that's another product that I
ran out of the other night so I'm
definitely going to repurchase it
retails for $34 for 5 fluid ounces of
product which I'm aware is a lot but and
this is a cleanser that works great for
me when I have combination skin it
worked great when I had normal skin it
worked great and when I have super super
dry sensitive skin it also works really
well you can add some sugar in there and
turn it into a scrub in the morning or
you can just use it to double cleanse or
even just wash your face whenever and it
feels so nice and light it never makes
my skin feel tight and I really do enjoy
a product that I know I will for sure be
purchasing is from Smashbox it is the
brow tech to go in the shade taupe I ran
out of mine the other day and I'm glad I
didn't have any backups of this because
they're really really reminded me that I
wanted to pick it up during the sale
this normally retails for $28 and like I
said the shade that I get is taupe which
is a medium taupe Brown it does run a
little dark but I kind of like that when
it comes to my brows I believe they have
four or five different shades to choose
from
taupe is currently sold out so let's
hope that by the time the sale comes
back it is back in stock if it's not I
will pick up these shade blonds but I
love this it's a beautiful beautiful
angled little brow pencil it has a lot
of precision to it I really can get
those nice sculpted brows and when I
don't use it my brows look like this
which is not as good so I really do
enjoy that brow product and absolutely
is something that I will be purchasing
one of my favorite products in my
collection and something that I have
found in 2017 that I am obsessed with so
anyway guys those are the five products
on it my wish list I know for sure I'm
gonna get those three different products
the two of makeup removers or the
cleanser the makeup remover as well as
the smashbox lab tech to go and then
possibly the body Luminizer as well as
the bronzer so if you have any thoughts
on this and any thoughts on what I
should pick up if you've tried out the
new
nice or even though just release like
last night or if you try it out the
bronzers let me know you think of that
and yeah that's pretty much it I will
see you guys tomorrow for my
recommendations video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
