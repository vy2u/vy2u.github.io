my channel or should I welcome myself
back I have been gone for about five
days now I got really stressed out last
week I had so much stuff going on with
work so many gigs you guys know work
always comes first over YouTube so that
is why I was gone for a few days and
then I did end up going into a lupus
flare it was super super like minuscule
like the lupus flare literally lasted
two or three days I'm pretty sure I'm
still in a lupus flare but I feel good
enough to get on camera for you guys in
film if you're curious as to what the
hell is going on behind me all of my
princess canvases and all that stuff
will be coming up part in the next
couple of weeks Tom and I move in like
40 days 40 days literally like oh my god
I am working all the way until June and
then we are moving the second week of
June now we are going to be packing our
stuff up but we did also hire people to
come in and help us they will be coming
in at the end of May so literally like
20 days which is why the beauty room is
starting to come undone I'm not quite
sure if I'm going to be able to do
another Beauty room tour for you guys in
this particular apartment but definitely
when I do move to Arizona
I will go ahead and film one of those
for you guys we are going to have a
two-story apartment so we're going to
have a loft and upstairs is going to be
all of the practice room and also Beauty
room so the upstairs loft area is going
to be designated to that and I'm super
excited so anyway let's go ahead and get
into today's video we are going to be
talking all about big Chalet
highlighters I love a big Chalet
highlighters you guys know I'm obsessive
everything a big Chalet sometimes I
don't love blushes that are big chalet
because I feel like they can be a little
more difficult to work with but I love
big chalet highlighters they should they
bake should I actually okay I just love
them all day long I feel like wet and
wild make some good ones um you know
Dior Bobby Brown there are all sorts of
different price ranges that you can pick
up and I wanted to share with you guys
some of my all-time favorites so let's
go ahead and jump right into it the
first two are from Wet n Wild we're
going to start with the lower price
range items so the first one is the wet
wild mecca glow highlighting powder in
the shade of precious petals and then
this guy right here is the Wet n Wild
mega glow highlighting gold bar now I
believe this was limited edition I'm
still going to go ahead and swatch it
for you guys because I know a lot of
people were curious about this
but the other one the precious petals is
still available on their website so if
you want this for like literally three
dollars and 49 cents you should go ahead
and pick it up now facial light
highlighters are really beautiful
because they really look like a second
skin on your skin they literally just
look like second skin they have this
really nice interesting formula so you
don't pick up a lot of product and once
they go onto the skin and you can either
build them up and make them super
intense or you can leave them just a
little more light and subtle on your
skin now these are obviously very built
up swatches but we have the Goldilocks
shade on top and then precious petals on
the bottom this is a beautiful beautiful
highlighter and I know that they only
release two different shades this is the
only one that I have my friend Brittany
sent this to me thank you so much
Brittany but I think that these are just
absolutely beautiful and impeccable and
honestly like three dollars and 49 cents
if you're looking for a base layer sort
of formulation you want to try them out
but you don't want to spend the big
bucks like on the dior highlights for
fifty dollars go ahead and get yourself
a wet and wild mega glow highlighter
okay they are absolutely wonderful
really really beautiful quality and they
go on to the skin beautifully as you can
see alright next price range up it will
definitely be the laura geller baked
gelato swirl illuminators I know they
just released a new one that's like a
holographic goodness that I'm totally
going to get my hands on but this one
right here is called peach glow and
these ones are definitely very very
smooth to the touch very very firmly
press don't be scared you know when you
get highlights like this what you need
to do is go ahead and get yourself a
really nice densely packed a brush and
you need to buff these into the skin
they are not going to go on with a fan
brush they're not going to go on with
anything that's too flimsy you really
have to pick them up you have to dig in
that product and then you have to buff
them onto the skin but they look so
impeccable when you do so now today I'm
actually wearing a powder highlight if
you're curious it is one from an Etsy
shop that was sent to me on for PR and
it's really interesting it doesn't sit
on the skin the same way a bit like a
baked shell a highlight would but it
still looks very very pretty but I feel
like I can always tell when I'm wearing
a big shell a highlight and when I'm not
like they really just do look like
second skin this particular shade right
here is called gilded honey again from
the laura geller line this one is the
most popular it was the first one that
she ever released and although sometimes
I'm
unlike laura geller like i don't know
what you're doing with your line it
seems really weird I will say these
baked gelato squirrel eliminators are
impeccable this one is my all-time
favorite it is called charming a pink
you can see it is the most used out of
the bunch and that is because it is a
beautiful beautiful cool toned icy pink
shade and there they are one swipe
swatches so on the top we have peach
glow then we have gilded honey and then
charming pink absolutely impeccable
about 21 dollars you can see that these
are you know wet wild ones going a
little chunkier but still like 349 you
know if you want to try something out
I'd go with the wet and wild but if you
want to take it up like a nice step and
you really want a good Big Chill a
highlight go for those Laura Keller's
alright next in the line but we do have
these guys right here from makeup
forever so makeup forever does make some
nice literally bronzer facial a
highlights and I think baekchul a
blushes this little guy right here is a
duo of a bronzer and a blush I'm sorry a
bronzer and a highlight I don't adore
the actual bronzer but I love the
highlight this is called the sculptor
undetectable face contour in the shade
and number two and here is the actual
highlight and you can see it's actually
very similar to the wet and wild one the
gold bar up here but really really nice
kind of antique to gold shade beautiful
on the skin they also do offer a lighter
shade which is a pink one and the
bronzer is quite nice it's a little
orange e on my skin and I do find it
kind of hard to buff the bronzer into my
skin and make it look natural but the
highlight is beautiful and then right
here we have the new undetectable
Luminizer 's and these are gorgeous the
shade right here is called zero one and
they also do have a zero two shades so
this one is the pink and then they do
have a gold shade this one is a little
more textured since it does have that
sort of like texture actual going on
there as you can see it's got like a
little bit of like a wave imprint but
beautiful beautiful cool toned pink
shade again it very similar to the laura
geller big gelato swirl in the shade
charming pink and very similar to the
Dior blend gardens in the shade glowing
pink so really enjoy those next step up
but we do have Bobbie Brown beautiful
beautiful packaging these particular
highlights are called the highlighting
powders this particular shade is called
afternoon glow really really gorgeous
packaging mirrored you have a nice big
mirror there as well which is gorgeous
and this is a really nice rose gold
color kind of
similar again to that Atma what was it
to be wet and wild shade the Wow what is
it called precious paddles sort of that
this one is definitely a little more
rosy and a little more salmon toned very
very beautiful though and these are
ultra ultra creamy and buttery and
beautiful on the skin so really really
liked these as you can see you do get a
little bit of hard pan when you work
with products like this because they are
so firmly pressed but again if you use
the right brush and you really buff it
in it looks amazing my favorite brush to
use with these all of these highlights
are here is definitely my Lexi small
contouring brush and then finally we
have the last step up I would say this
isn't your the dior platform or whatever
you want to call it these are super
ultra expensive they are like $54 a
piece that they are beautiful the first
one that came out last year was called
the nude air Luminizer and it was in the
glowing gardens collection this is zero
zero one glowing pink absolutely
beautiful it was limited edition they
never released it again and then this
year they did come out with a whole
permanent collection they do have a
shade very similar to this and as you
can see the makeup forever is very very
similar to this Dior one but these are
super soft super buttery and the
packaging really does make you feel very
like ooh I'm very fancy so I really
really think these are beautiful and
then here is from the permanence line
this is the zero zero one shimmering
sculpting powder that is what they're
calling them now and they are the exact
same a formula as the glowing gardens if
you were curious and this one is very
similar to the shade 0:02 that they
released last year that was limited
edition and I want to show you guys
really really quickly
side-by-side swatches of the wet and
wild precious petals next to this one
because they are so similar so here is
the Dior nude air and then right below
it is the wet in wild so really really
similar very very beautiful again all
sorts of different price ranges these
are definitely my favorites out of all
the big Chalet highlights that i have in
my collection these are the formulas
that i would recommend to you guys if
you are curious the Laura Geller ones as
well as the wet and wild are cruelty
free Bobby Brown Dior and Make Up For
Ever are unfortunately not fine anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed it this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow for my life
update bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
