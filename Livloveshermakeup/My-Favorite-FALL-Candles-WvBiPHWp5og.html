thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having an awesome fantastic
fantastic day today i am talking about
one of my most favorite things in the
world besides makeup of course is
candles i thought it would be really fun
i've been posting a lot of reviews on my
channel lately and i thought it would be
fun to kind of take a break from that
and talk about some of my favorite fall
candles um I'm a huge candle lover I
love Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candles I love
Chesapeake Bay candles which is a brand
you can find at target I love yankee
candle I like a whole lot of brands and
I have certain favorites um for each
like season basically so if you guys do
enjoy this video let me know so that i
can also film one for you know my
favorite winter candles which i have
tons of my favorite spring candles
summer campbell's things like that I
burn candles all year long so let me
know if you guys enjoyed this video so
anyway let's just get started I have put
them into three different categories so
I have the sweet-smelling category which
is going to be like your baked goods
sort of smelling category it usually has
pumpkin in it and it just smells very
very sweet I have the fresh category
which is kind of like the outdoorsy um
you know like crisp crisp like fresh air
sort of scent and that's kind of a big
popular sort of category in the fall
candle sense i think you know you get a
lot of sweet ones you get a lot of fresh
ones and then you also get like woodsy
or on ones that are kind of like selling
like a bonfire so those are the three
different categories i have fresh sweet
and then would see so let's just get
started i'm going to start with the one
that is the odd one out it is the woodsy
category and i only have one for the
fall this is the tobacco cedar candle
from the collection by chesapeake bay
you can get the Chesapeake Bay brand at
Target and this is good this size those
were about believe seven to nine dollars
i think i got mine for nine dollars and
this is a to wick candle and it smells
amazing the scent is very very like um
fireside like you know what i mean like
burning wood or fireside sort of smell
so if you like those kind of darker
woods your sense
this is absolutely delicious um and
Chesapeake Bay actually makes one of my
all-time favorite candles I got it last
year and I cannot find it this year it
is called apple wood that is the best
candle I have ever smelled ever I burn
it all year long and last year I
remember picking it up and i literally
would burn through it throughout the
whole year i just undid like just burnt
the last little bit of it this past
summer and i cannot find it this year so
I'm absolutely devastated but that is
the candle that turned me on to the
Chesapeake Bay um brand so this is part
of their special like collection I don't
know it's called the collection but um
they also just have like their normal
ones that are just called Chesapeake Bay
candles which I will show you another
one also but if you really like that
kind of woodsy um bonfire sort of smell
this tobacco and cedar one is absolutely
delicious my boyfriend really likes the
smell of this if you have a man in your
life they would probably really like
this smell too and I just I really
really love it I really really love it
oh just not so good so that is my woodsy
favorite for fall I know you guys are
probably thinking oh where's marshmallow
fireside that is actually more of a
winter candle for me that one from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works it smells sort of similar
but a little more sweeter that is more
of a winter favorite but this one is
definitely my favorite for the fall all
right let's move on to the sweet
category because I feel like a lot of
people love sweet smelling candles um I
think that that's like I don't know I
feel like those are the most popular
ones if that makes sense so the first
one I want to talk about is my all-time
favorite candle for fall if I didn't
have to pick like I don't even know how
to describe it if I only had to pick one
it would be this one this is a new one
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and it has become
such a favorite it is the pumpkin pie
scented candle and this is a three wood
candle oh my gosh it smells so darn good
if they describe the scent as an autumn
blend of creamy pumpkin whipped vanilla
and flaky pie crust that's as sweet as
your favorite pumpkin pie and it really
smells like that you don't get any other
like syrupy sort of smell
here you don't get anything that's like
to like buttercream icing or anything
like that it literally is just a scent a
pumpkin mixed with like pie crust and it
is my favorite candle um in the falsies
like if I had to pick one of these I
know that I picked my favorite ones in
general but if I had to pick one this is
it so pumpkin pie from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
to reboot candle amazing the second one
I want to talk about is from Yankee
Candle I was burning this last night and
this one is called pumpkin wreath and
it's so interesting because you would
think that pumpkin wreath would have
liked a little bit of like I don't know
like fur balsam or balsam sent to it but
this one really really smells sweet it
smells like a sweet like creamy pumpkin
it kind of smells like pumpkin pie minus
like the pie press send so you're just
being that creamy pumpkin smell and it
just has something sweet in there I'm
not even quite sure what it is but if
you like I don't know if you like just
like a creamy pumpkin sent with a little
bit of sweetness but not like
buttercream sweetness and not like um
Piper sweetness but like a little bit of
just normal sweetness I don't know how
else to describe it you would probably
really really like this one this is one
of the bigger canvas from Yankee Candle
they do run a little more expensive than
the typical Chesapeake Bay candle or
even the ones from Bath and Body Works
which now are up to i think twelve
dollars a piece when you get them on
sale or like twenty dollars a piece if
you don't get them on sale but this one
probably runs for around thirty or
thirty-five dollars however this is the
biggest one after you use them up you
candy pop them and reuse this little
jars like apakah theory are you say
pakka theory I really really love these
jars but also on these ones burn forever
and they're only one wick and they do
fill up your whole you know living space
so really really love this one if you
like just the scent of pumpkin with a
little bit of sweetness is the one for
you the next one I'm going to talk about
is probably a huge cult favorite at Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works this is pumpkin cupcake so
this literally smells like a pumpkin
cupcake um it is a three what canva
looks like that and they describe the
scent as
satisfy your sweet tooth with this scent
of a freshly baked pumpkin cupcake
covered in loads of rich buttercream
frosting and that's basically what it
smells like to me it just smells like
pumpkin butter cream frosting so if you
are like really big into the buttercream
sort of sent you would really really
like this it just has that tiny little
tinge of pumpkin in it and it is just
absolutely lovely so really love that
one that is sort of similar the next to
you are kind of similar they are the
pumpkin pecan waffle and apple and
pumpkin pancakes both of these are from
bath and body works as well so pumpkin
pecan waffles smells very very sweet
again instead of getting you have
buttercream sort of like send you're
getting more of like a um a little more
kind of like pumpkin pie where you're
getting a little bit of like baked good
sort of sense so something baked in the
oven like pie crust or waffles things
like that yeah I smell a lot of pecan in
here to this one again is a three wit
candle and I smell a lot of cinnamon in
here too so if you are a fan of cinnamon
you would probably like the pumpkin
pecan waffles they described it as a
delight in the scrumptious scent of
pumpkin pecan waffles pure maple syrup
and a touch of brown sugar it's funny
because I don't smell a ton of maple
syrup in this one I do in the pumpkin
pancake one but this one I smell more
cinnamon and more pecan in it than maple
syrup so if you like the scent of
cinnamon and waffles like mixed together
with who doesn't you would probably
really like pumpkin pecan waffles and
then the last one in this category like
I said is Apple pumpkin pancakes this is
a new one to me this year and again
three wood candle I smell a lot of maple
syrup in here so if you are someone who
likes that scent of maple you would
really really like this one they
describe it as start your day with the
satisfying scent of fluffy pumpkin
pancakes topped with warm chapped apples
and crunchy walnuts again I don't know
of a cent I felt like didn't really
describe this one i ordered this one
online with like without smelling it
basically before smelling it and i
honestly smell more maple in here so
this one definitely has more maple
whereas
this one has more cinnamon so you can
kind of choose between those two they're
sort of similar but not really kind of
like the names are you know like you
have apple pumpkin pancakes and pumpkin
pecan waffles you would think you know
pancakes and waffles would smell really
similar but they're different all right
and now we are going to go on to the
third little section and this is the
fresh smelling candles this is like for
the people that don't enjoy the really
super sweet candles um and I feel like
there really is if you go on the bath
and Bodyworks website there really is
like a to like I don't know how it's
like a two way road okay you get your
fresh handles and then you get your
sweet candles so these ones are the
fresh ones they're kind of like walking
outdoors smelling nature you you think
of walking in the woods and you're like
ooh that smells like fall like that
really crisp clean scent that's what
these are so the first one is from
Chesapeake Bay this is not from their
special like collection like the other
one this is just their normal collection
and this runs for I've at least seven or
eight dollars it has one wick it looks
like this oh this just smells so good it
smells very outdoorsy it's got a little
bit of like fur balsam in there I think
and definitely some kind of fruit it
could be like berries or a little bit of
I don't even know I smelled like an
undertone of pineapple I know that
sounds crazy it's very very very like in
there so it's not like Oh pineapple but
I smell a little bit of pineapple and
maybe like furball some if that makes
sense or balsam and um I really really
love this one this is a great great
price on these Chesapeake Bay candles
and really do fill up the room nicely
with tons and tons of sense so if you
enjoy that you would really really like
these if you don't want to splurge on
the bath body works candles or the
Yankee Candles you can definitely pick
up this but this is a really really nice
fresh outdoorsy sort of sent it sort of
reminds me of what is it sweater weather
from Bath and Body Works which actually
did not make it into my favorites I
would say the runner-up for this section
is definitely autumn and that one is
from bath and body works as well um but
those two did not make it into my
absolute favorites but this one smells
kind of like sweater weather so if you
like that scent you'd probably like this
one very very nice
um the next one is leaves I've
completely burnt this one out this is
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it is a 3 wit
candle and I could not decide whether to
put this in the fresh category or the
woodsy category with the tobacco cedar
Campbell because honestly I smell a lot
of woods eNOS in this but I smell more
like fresh crisp berries like a little
more than like a woodsy like bonfire
smell but it says celebrate the
brilliant colors of autumn with this
rich blend of golden nectar red apple
and spiced berries and I think it's that
little bit of spice berries that makes
me think of more of woodsy than
outdoorsy you know it's so weird woodsy
an outdoorsy are basically the same
thing but you guys know what I mean this
smells a little more fresh than like
bonfire II so um this is a cult favorite
everybody loves leaves um if you are
just looking for a fresh candle and you
haven't smelled them or you're ordering
online if you want something that just
smells fresh order this um you really
can't go wrong with leaves it's just
perfect for I don't know like you really
could burn it all year long if you
wanted to it really is just one of those
intoxicating sense that everybody likes
so if you're unsure about what to order
and you're ordering online definitely go
with leaves for the fresh sense all
right the next one is from yankee candle
and this is called autumn in the park
this is new to me this year this is one
of their smaller ones you can see that
they're full sized ones look like this
and then this is like the medium-sized
one this smells really really good this
reminds me of a bath and Bodyworks
candle but not I don't know yankee
candle and bath and body works actually
really are very very different you know
their sense and the way that they
interpret like different sort of baked
good sense and clean sense and fresh
scents is very very different and this
one I smell a little bit of like bonfire
in it I smell a little bit of fresh
berries I smell a little bit of balsam I
mean it's just a wonderful wonderful um
blend like really really nice and this
is new this year and I knew the minute I
smell that I was like oh my gosh that's
going to be a favorite and even these
little ones even though they just have
one week they really do fill up the room
as well so Yankee Candle yes autumn in
the park delicious alright and the last
two are more well they are fresh
but these are ones that you're also
going to get a little hint of fruit in
so the first one is cranberry pumpkin
this is new to me this year new to Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works this year i believe and
this is an amazing amazing blend um i
ordered this online because i like to
shop through ebates so that i get cash
back and I just didn't think I was gonna
like this honestly I thought ooh pumpkin
and cranberry together as I'm gonna
smell good I don't know I really didn't
think it would but it is so so fresh so
good definitely the cranberry is a lot
more overpowering in this then the
pumpkin is so if you do like the sweet
scent of cranberry I tend to think of
cranberry as more of a winter sent like
frosted cranberry from Bath and Body
Works is a great sense that they come
out with during the winter but this one
is a really really nice blend so you do
get the warmer undertone of the pumpkin
but you're getting a lot of that sweet
sweet cranberry smell so I really liked
it very very clean smelling very fresh
very nice it says fresh from the patch
pumpkin blends with tart cranberry in a
fragrance that brings the best of fall
into your home and I agree with that i
feel like the cranberry hair is very
tart but it smells really really nice
definitely go and smell this in store it
could be for you or maybe not and the
last one I want to talk about is a
pumpkin apple this has been one that has
been my oh excuse me I opened it and I
was running this last night so like
smoke came back um this is one that I
have had I think for the past like a
year or two years I mean not the
specific candle but the scent I've been
repurchasing it is very very fresh it
almost could be like a summer candle
honestly again the apple is a little
more overpowering than the pumpkin in
here so it's a little more fresh
smelling not too sweet and they describe
it as experience the blend of your two
favorite fall scents apple and pumpkin
enhanced by notes of cinnamon and clove
I do not smell any cinnamon or club in
here to be completely honest all I smell
is a whole lot of apple and a little bit
of pumpkin so if that sounds good to you
you would probably like pumpkin apple
from bath body works so anyway those are
my favorite fall candles I hope you guys
enjoyed this video please let me know if
you like this I just thought it would be
really fun to throw in here I know a lot
of people love candles I talk
about Campbell's a lot on here i order a
lot of candles I show you guys a lot of
candles from Bath and Body Works and
haul them and do all that kind of stuff

a thumbs up and I will definitely put
one out for winter as well I have a lot
of winter favorites and yeah I hope you
