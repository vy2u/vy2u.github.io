video is going to be all about my
favorite full coverage foundations I
have been promising this video to guys
for a while so let's go ahead and get
right into it I have a few from the
drugstore a few that are high-end and I
will let you know if they will work for
your particular skin type but please
keep in mind that I do have combo to
oily skin so the majority of these are
really really good for combo to oily
skin obviously alright the first one
we're gonna start with is the infallible
Pro matte L'Oreal foundation let me say
that again l'oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation the shape that I wear is
one-zero-one classic ivory eye is loved
and adored this foundation so much it
doesn't give like a completely matte
appearance to the skin but if you are
looking for one that will give you a
demi matte or semi matte appearance to
the skin this is a really really great
foundation I highly recommend for those
of you who do have combo to oily skin
one layer of this gives a really nice
amount of coverage and it really helps
to cover texture fine lines and wrinkles
I know that sounds weird because you
would think a heavy coverage foundation
or a full coverage foundation would
actually emphasize those but I swear
this is a really really seamless
gorgeous formulation and it really kind
of blends over all of your imperfections
so that is definitely my first one one
layer of this you are full coverage the
second foundation I want to talk about
is from Maybelline this is the
maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming foundation you guys know I
also love the powder the shade that I
wear is called porcelain and that this
does have titanium dioxide sunscreen in
it with broad-spectrum SPF 15 so if you
do have sensitive skin if you have combo
too oily sensitive skin this is really
nice because this is a physical sunblock
not a chemical and those are more likely
to help you from not breaking out a lot
of chemical sunscreens personally break
me out but physical ones do not
this also has active C which is some
sort of formulation of vitamin C and is
supposed to actually help your skin to
appear better looking and I think it has
salicylic acid in as well I know the
powder does so anyway this is the
beautiful foundation from the drugstore
if you do want medium to full coverage
one layer of this is definitely a solid
medium coverage however two layers is
completely completely full coverage
again better for those of you who do
have combo to oily skin if you do have
dry skin you may want to go ahead and
put
a drop of oil in here or even you know
going with a very very hydrating primer
but this is an amazing amazing
foundation the next one i want to talk
about is great for you dry skinned gals
or guys this is the josie maran vibrancy
foundation fluid in the shade dynamic I
absolutely adore of this particular
foundation this is my all-time favorite
foundation I do have one pump of it on
my face today if you do have dry skin
the reason why you will love this is
because it is infused with argan oil
just like most of the products from the
josie maran brand it's absolutely
beautiful it does not dry down matte so
it's more of a satiny look on the skin
however it is full full coverage so I
really really adore this this is also an
incredible vitamin the next is also from
the drugstore this is the covergirl
outlast stay fabulous 3 and 1 foundation
the shade that I wear is 8:05 I also
have the luminous version but I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter that I rarely
reach for this the reason why I like
this one so much I'm in the shade ivory
by the way and the reason that I like
this one so much is because I feel like
it's solid medium coverage but then
areas where you want to build it up more
to get even more full coverage you can
so say you want to put it all over your
face and then you have areas like me
where you have like acne scarring along
your jaw line you can go in and kind of
stipple it on it really really works
well and I would say 2 layers of this is
completely full coverage and if you do
have combo to oily skin this also helps
to control any sort of oil like that
might break through throughout the day
so I really really love this foundation
as well again if you do have dry skin
use a hydrating primer another one that
I absolutely adored that it drives down
completely matte is the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage foundation this does
have broad-spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen it
is a 12 hour makeup and it is oil free I
get asked all the time what shade in
this do I wear I wear the shade fair
beige and I really like this a lot it
has a very neutral undertone and very
very full coverage it does dry down very
very matte and it has more of like a
mousse like consistency it actually kind
of reminds me a little bit of that
maybelline superstay I feel like this
one and this one have a little bit more
of a mousse light consistency but it
goes on so nicely and if you do have dry
skin I think I would just altogether
like stay away from this one it's
probably going to emphasize dry patches
on your face but if you have oily or
especially calm
skin no I'm sorry if your collagen or
especially oily skin I think you would
love it because I feel like my oils do
not break through throughout the day
with that and on top of that I feel like
it does keep me very very very matte so
I adore that the next one that is really
really great and it's completely full
coverage is the Revlon Colorstay whipped
creme makeup I do like the original
version but I prefer the whipped version
I just think it's easier to blend I
don't know if you guys have ever noticed
with the Revlon colors see the liquid
version you put that stuff on and it
dries like cement it's very very similar
to the Kat Von D lock-it
what is it the Lockett foundation and
I'm not showing that in this video yes
it is very full coverage but it's not a
favorite of mine because I feel like it
really really dries down and it almost
feels like a mask on my skin I feel like
this one is a really nice version of the
liquid version without being too cakey
and also it doesn't dry that quickly as
you guys can see it's definitely a
mousse like consistency I just took out
a lot oh I hate when I do that I'm like
why am I wasting products but the shade
that I wear is the lightest this is
called ivory and that is what it looks
like it's a really really nice finish I
would say it gives more of like a Demi
matte appearance or semi matte
appearance to the skin but very full
coverage you can definitely build it up
in certain areas that you need to again
if you do have dry skin go ahead and use
a very hydrating primer the next one is
actually from hard candy this you can
get at Walmart I love this foundation if
you have dry skin if you have sensitive
skin if you have oily skin combo skin
this is going to work for everyone the
shade that I wear is 930 porcelain and
this is the glamoflage invisible
foundation this is what it looks like it
comes with just a little pump like this
the only thing that I don't like about
this is the fact that you're really
really smells bad you guys like really
really bad but the shade is great and as
you guys can see it goes on really
really thin but for some reason it gives
a lot a lot a lot of coverage so if you
are someone who does want to be able to
blend your foundation out pretty darn
quickly but you still want full coverage
that is a great option it kind of
reminds me of the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid alright the next one I
want to talk about is from Clinique this
is the beyond perfecting foundation plus
concealer they shape that
where is 0.5 breeze I love love the
coverage level on this I swear to you
one little like swatch of this
applicator on your face and you're good
to go it has amazing coverage my only
complaint is that this does kind of
darken up on the skin quite a bit it
oxidizes so there is 0.5 Breeze there is
a shade called linen that is lighter
this is fine for me while I have a self
tan but during the winter I may have to
pick up linen but this is really
gorgeous you guys it does write down a
little quicker so if you don't like that
and you do want to kind of you know let
it sit on your face for a little bit
before you blend it in or if you just
don't want to blend it in right away I
would not recommend this one but I think
it's beautiful on the skin it gives a
lot a lot of coverage and it claims to
be like a two-in-one so a foundation +
concealer and I really do think it is
alright and the next one I want to talk
about is from Rimmel this is the state
map - liquid mousse foundation in the
shade zero one zero light porcelain this
reminds me a lot of this this is the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage I
feel like this particular shade right
here which is zero one zero light
porcelain is a perfect match for fair
beige I feel like this one keeps me a
lot more matte than this which is crazy
because like I said this is a very matte
foundation if you do have dry skin stay
very very far away from this particular
one this is not going to work for you
unless you want to mix it in with a
different foundation but if you do have
really really oily skin either one of
these is great but honestly this is
$3.99 at the drugstore
it gives incredible incredible coverage
and I like that this shade does not lean
too pink and it does not lean too warm
it's just right in between neutral
really really nice consistency very very
um moosie and again if you do have dry
skin I just would stay very far away
from this because sometimes this can
even emphasize dry patches on my face
and that was even during the summertime
when I'm an oily beast so that's kind of
crazy but I do recommend that one that
is the beautiful foundation and the last
one that I want to recommend for you
guys or the one that is my favorite is
the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in
place makeup the shade that I wear is
one and one this is called ivory nude it
is a little dark on me but it still a
wonderful foundation again if you want a
foundation that's not going to dry down
instantly this is
really nice it does remind me little
bits of the Revlon Colorstay because I
feel like once you start buffing it in
then it kind of sticks to your face like
cement but when you first put it on it's
not gonna be like a moosie consistency
or it's not gonna dry right away so once
you start buffing it in its gonna stay
where it is but when you first apply it
you do have some time to kind of play
around my only complaint is that this
does not have a pump
I really hate dumping this out I feel
like it gets really gross around the rim
here but this is amazing amazing full
coverage I mean a little goes a long way
with this baby so I really enjoyed that
as well alright guys so those are all of
my favorite full coverage foundations
let me know down below which is your
favorite full coverage foundation and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
