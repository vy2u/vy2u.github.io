thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day I am here to talk about my
facial oils today or my favorite facial
oils yes I'm not talking about all of
them because this is all of them I do
have quite a few I really really love
facial oils are just for reference
I've combination skin so I do get oily
in my t-zone and then the outer
perimeters of my face like my cheek area
and like over here or like all that kind
of stuff yeah it's quite dry so just for
reference anyway I am going to talk
about my favorite ones out of this
little bit in here today I have tried a
lot as you guys can probably tell and I
definitely have some favorites so let's
just get right into it but first one I
want to talk about
it's from L'Oreal this is the H perfect
glow renewal facial oil this is my
all-time favorite facial oil I
absolutely love this it has a beautiful
consistency it's kind of like a spicy
scent I know that sounds weird but it's
got a little bit of fragrance to it it's
not overpowering it's nothing that's
going to bother you and I hope that it
wouldn't bother sensitive skin I do have
combination skin that sometimes gets a
little sensitive and this has never ever
bothered me but I just have a little bit
of a scent to see you guys are aware but
I believe you can get this for under $20
at the drugstore I think it's absolutely
fantastic
as you guys can see when I kind of shake
the bottle it's got a very very fluid
like consistency to it it is not super
thick it's not going to be like avocado
oil or markussi oil or anything like
that it is very very thin and liquidy
and I would say 2 to 3 drops of this all
over my face completely moisturizes me
in the right way it does not make my
t-zone too oily and it also is like a
moisturizing enough for my cheek area
and the outer perimeters of my face I
absolutely love this - thumbs up for
this product definitely my all-time
favorite facial oil alright the next one
I want to talk about is the josie maran
argan oil line now you can get the josie
maran one or you can also just go to
your like natural food or health store
or whatever or onto like I was gonna say
nutiva calm no that's an actual coconut
oil brand you can go on to like Vitacost
and find basically a hundred percent
pure argan oil anywhere for even
probably a cheaper price and the Josie
Maran one but this one is very very
popular a lot of people use this in
their hair they use it on their face
it's an absolutely
fantastic oil it's got a beautiful
consistency she has two different kind
of formats on the Sapporo website she
has the hundred percent pure argan oil
which is just a 100% pure organic virgin
argan oil it's really really fantastic I
love the consistency it definitely is
like an in-between consistency I would
say a very very thin oil like jojoba any
very very kind of thicker oil like
coconut if I apply too much of this I am
a little greasy on my face especially in
my t-zone and sometimes I feel like it
doesn't sink in enough so if you do have
oily skin or combination skin I
recommend really only maybe two to three
drops of bits two to three drops of this
this is definitely going to be enough to
cover your whole face you can bring it
around your eye area it is so gentle and
so moisturizing and lovely but it
definitely can be a little oily if you
use too much of it so I just my
recommendation would be that less is
more really with argan oil products
especially in your hair as well I love
putting it on like the ends of my hair
but anytime I put it on my scalp area or
near my booth I get very very oily in
that area so I just think that with
argan oil less is more for sure so she
does um you know sell just the regular
100% pure argan oil and she also has a
light version this is fantastic for
those of you who do have oily skin and
want to use an oil but you don't want
something too thick or something that's
going to sit on top of the skin two to
three drops of this is fantastic it's
the same exact thing it's just not as
concentrated so it's basically a little
watered down it's a watered down version
of the 100% pure argan oil so that is
definitely my favorite our second
favorite oil the third one I want to
talk about is the tarte maracuja oil now
again you don't have to purchase the
maracuja oil from Tarte um I believe
it's called passion flower oil or
passion fruit oil you can basically get
it anywhere however tart is kind of
known for having this adorable little
packaging but also they do have this
wonderful wonderful version of their
maracuja oil which is kind of I would
say like the most popular version and I
think it's really fantastic it is 100%
pure and it
a virgin and organic and I think it's
lovely this is definitely more of a
thick consistency if you are having a
super super dry day or if you just have
dry skin in general I think maracuja is
a great great product for you I have
noticed a lot of brightening properties
with the maracuja oil it says that at
night you should apply 2 to 3 drops on
your hands rub it together and then pat
on to clean face I feel like if you use
more than 2 or 3 drops of this you
really do look oily it sits on top of
the skin and it is thick this is the oil
that you can feel on your skin so I
really only use it when I have like dry
patches may be some eczema or I'm
dealing with some rashes or something
like that from a lupus flare up but for
the most part it is really really nice I
try and not wear it underneath and
makeup all the time just because it is
super super thick and I do find that it
breaks down on my makeups throughout the
day because it is so potent but overall
I think this is a lovely one especially
if you have combination skin that gets a
drier during the winter time which mine
does I think this is a great little one
to reach for again you can get mark Kuja
oil or passion fruit oil anywhere but I
mean Tarte makes some keep acting look
at that packaging it has like the little
push thing here and then you just go
ahead and drop the oil onto your hand
and like it says you should tap this
into the skin a lot of oils are better
absorbed when you push them into the
skin I just want to say that really
quickly I'm one of those people that
have just tried like rubbing and rubbing
and rubbing until they're absorbed and
it takes a really long time that way so
again heat it up between it your fingers
make sure that you're getting some heat
going on there like you're making a
little fire and then tap it into your
skin you're gonna be amazed at how
quickly it actually gets absorbed that
way alright and then the last oil that I
want to talk about is actually one that
you mix into a moisturizer and you guys
have probably heard me talk about this
all the time in my weekly favourites
videos this is the Paula's Choice resist
moisture oil a little bit moisture
renewal oil booster for dry or very dry
skin it has ceramides and argan oil in
it this is basically just an oil booster
that you add into your moisturizer it's
going to step up the game of your actual
moisturizer so if you have very very dry
skin you would love this I
love it I use two to three drops of it
and I mix it into my daytime moisturizer
and I feel like I just get those extra
benefits of like oils and argan oil and
the healing properties and just it makes
the moisturizer a lot more slick also so
it's easier to blend onto your skin so I
absolutely love this I use this every
single morning I think it's absolutely
fantastic you guys have probably heard
me talk about it a lot but this is
definitely my other favorite facial oil
so overall those are my favorites the
l'oreal aged perfect glow renewal is
number one that josie maran
oils coming in and number two tarte
maracuja oil as number three and then
the polished choice resists moisture
renewal oil booster coming in at number
four I have been playing around
obviously I have like a lot more oils
here that I play with I think they're
all really really nice and I have been
playing around with this Korres one
lately and I think this is great for
brightening the skin but I need to play
with it a little more the ones that I
showed you guys are my tried and true
I've been using them for more than you
know a year or two years now but overall
you can find a lot of different oils
that are really nice for your skin just
try and make sure that they are
unrefined they're organic and they are
completely pure because that way you're
gonna get the most like a beneficial
moisturization brightening whatever
healing sort of properties out of the
oils so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this quick little video on my favorite
facial oils and I will see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
