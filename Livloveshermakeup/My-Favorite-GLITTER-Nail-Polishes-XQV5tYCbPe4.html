talk about my favorite glitter nail
polishes and these are the ones that I
think are the best they have the best
formula or the best quality show up even
if you're not wearing a color underneath
it they still show up and I love them so
let me get started the first one is from
Sally Hansen complete salon manicure and
this is in the color golden rust and it
looks like this and this one is like you
know kind of those rounds little
glitters and it is very chunky but if
you wear a top coat over it you don't
feel you know grit to the nails
beautiful color it can be you know if
you can wear it under any nail polish or
I mean over any nail polish or just wear
it on its own and it shows up that
beautiful so love that one the next one
I want to talk about is from wet and
wild it's the wild shine nail color and
this is in four six zero D kaleidoscope
so very very nice it's just a you know
silver glitter it's not too chunky it's
a nice formula it makes any nail polish
that's matte or just you know playing in
color look really you're a doesn't and
it really lights up the nails so I
really like that these are really cheap
by the way very good quality another
silver one that I really like is from
nails ink and this is their galaxy nail
polish and this is in traffic trafalgar
press it i am butchering that name but
anyway it is beautiful it looks like
this it's not as it's a little more
chunky than the wet and wild one but
also if you can see it it's a little
more bright so i really really love that
one and the next one i want to talk
about is from forever 21 this is their
nail color in gold and by the way these
are only two dollars and ninety cents
and really good quality so loved this
one has those really nice chunky
glitters in there that pick up every
color really love that the next one i
want to talk about is from NYC and it is
New York minute sparkle top coat and you
can use this as a top coat
or it does actually show up without any
other nail-polish on so it's pretty that
way too
it's called big-city dazzle and if you
can see these are tiny tiny little
glitters very very shimmery all
different colors but very very tiny so
it goes on nice and smoothly and by the
way I'd like to finish off a topcoat on
top of any kind of chunky glittery nail
polish so that it doesn't feel gritty
you know when you're doing things so
love that one the next one I want to
talk about is also from nails ink it is
the other galaxy one and this is in the
color buckingham court so this is a nice
red color and it's got gold in there and
those are probably two of my favorite
colors so really really love this one
and let me just throw this one in there
because it's also one of my favorites I
think I just love the formula this is
the other galaxy nails inc nail polish
glitter and this is in Knightsbridge
Road
so this is a nice like Goldy kind of
silvery one so these three are really
just good-quality I got these on Sephora
calm the next one I want to talk about
is also from wet and wild it is their
wild shine nail color and this is in
sparkled for 35g
and again these are really really tiny
little shimmers and it's this beautiful
kind of like ethereal pink color really
love it
very very nice again it goes on really
smoothly and the next one I want to talk
about is from again forever 21
there are nail color and it isn't green
multicolored I guess that's it but
really really beautiful actually it
looked great with the outfit I'm wearing
today umm just gorgeous look at all
those colors I mean it's got that dark
Navy in there almost black color silver
green blue everything gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous if you just wear
this alone you can do two coats
beautiful love that and the last one I
want to talk about is from NYC and it is
their expert last nail polish and
in the color Gramercy glitz and it is so
beautiful and when I looked at it I just
thought oh it's so cute
such a pretty color so cute easy to go
over any other color like this pink nail
polish and I just love it I think it's
so sweet looking and it was very very
cheap so those are my favorite or in my
opinion the top litter nail polishes
that I own they have excellent formulas
they can be worn alone they don't leave
your fingers too gritty you know if they
do just apply topcoat and I love them so
I hope that you have tried some of these
and it's not going to fix them up let me
know down below if you have tried them
and if you like them and I'll see you in
the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
