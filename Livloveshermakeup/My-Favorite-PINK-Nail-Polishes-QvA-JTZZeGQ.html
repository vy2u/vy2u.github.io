have another of my favorite nail polish
videos i don't even know why do
quotation mark actually favorites but
i'm going by color so today i have the
Pink's for you guys i know everybody
loves pink and the only reason i put the
Reds in front of the Pink's were because
um the holidays are coming up and people
like to wear you know more holiday-ish
colors like red so anyway i'm taylor the
pinks and let's just get started so the
first thing is the OPI nail lacquer in
pink outside the glossy box I got this
in my November glossybox and you guys
I'm obsessed with this color it is so
beautiful it's this light pink color it
has like eight i would say white
undertone and it is so beautiful on the
nails i absolutely love it i really
should have my nails painted for this
video but i absolutely love it it is
just a gorgeous gorgeous color and i
think you can only get it through
GlossyBox i believe so i'm so happy that
i got that the next one is also a semi
newish product but it has become a
favorite instantly this is from essence
this is the color and glow in nail
polish in it does not even say but it
looks like this and i got this in an
alcohol like probably a month ago and
i've been wearing this on my toes and
probably three and a half weeks now it
has not come off at all I didn't even
use a top coat it is just on there and I
absolutely love the color it's like this
gorgeous um really really bright cool
toned pink with sparkles in it and you
guys this was only a few dollars so
loving essence as a brand and loving
their nail polishes the next one I want
to talk about is from wet and wild this
is their wet and wild wild shine nail
color this is in lavender pearlescent
and it's just beautiful like baby pink
color with like a purple undertone and
it's got kind of like a milky
consistency to it that is how it goes on
the nails it really picks up that
iridescent glow and it's just absolutely
gorgeous and the formula is wonderful so
love that the next one is also from wet
and wild and the wild shine
line not brands but yes the line they
have a lot of different lines like what
wild does and I love their nail polish
lines and this one is really good too so
anyway this is the one in tickled pink
and is just a really bright like really
really whitish creamy pink it's not as
cool toned as this one this one is a
little more warm and I just absolutely
love the way it looks on the nails so
definitely a favorite the next one I
mentioned in my favorite glitter nail
polishes video but it is from NYC it is
the expert last expert lash I was going
to sing lash expert last nail polish and
this is in gramercy glitz I don't know
if you guys can see that but it's like a
light pink with little sparkles in it
and it is so beautiful topped with one
of these it's like oh my god it's like
they are meant to be together you guys
is so beautiful especially this one oh
my gosh those two colors together you
guys so beautiful so absolutely love
this I think it's like um just such a
pretty color and the pink actually does
show up if you want to just apply this
it doesn't just show up as sparkles you
actually get that tint of the light pink
so love that the next one is from
forever 21 this is one of their glow in
the dark nail polishes it looks like
this it is super super hot fluorescent
pink and by that I don't mean like a
dark dark pink like this I mean it's
like a light pink but it is like glowing
it's like glow stick and I absolutely
love the way it looks on the nails I
have a few of these polishes I have the
yellowish green one too and they're just
so fun they're so bright I think this
was probably like a summer collection
but if you guys can still find these on
the forever 21 website pick them up
they're just so fun especially the pink
one so cool I don't have any other color
like that so I really love that the next
one is from wet and wild and this is
from their mega last line which I also
really really adore and this is a
candylicious which is 209 see and it's
just this really neutral um like I would
say in between pink color um like it's
not too bright but it's not too dark
either kind of matches my lips
my lips a little darker but it's really
really gorgeous I feel like when I don't
know what to do with my nails I usually
go to a color like this which is not too
it's not too much of like a statement
color but at the same time it's very
very pretty and girly so love that the
next one is from SC this is the nail
lacquer in madison ave hue and this is
like a pink with a purpley yeah
definitely a purple tinge to it you can
see it's definitely got some purple in
there it has tiny little microflex of
silver shimmer too so that really helps
pick up the purple I think I also got
this in a glossy box which is crazy and
really loving the nail polishes I get in
these little boxes so loving this I
think it's absolutely beautiful and the
last one I want to talk about is also
wet and wild it's gonna be wild shine
line again really love that line I think
it's like literally like 99 cents a nail
polish of course they could have a
better selection I wish hopefully
they'll come up with more but the Pink's
are really really awesome in that line
this is called lavender and this one
also have a bit of a purpley undertone
and I really love that in a nail polish
just because I feel like it can really
be worn any time of the year when you
have like a bright pink something like
this this is more for like you know some
are things like that this really can be
more on any time of year and look
gorgeous so those were my favorite pink
nail polishes of all times i'm talking
about formula color everything those are
my favorites um well favorites yes i
would say favorites of all time as of
now i'm sure i will be updating these
videos in the future once I collect more
nail polishes which I really don't need
to do but I will be um and I hope you
