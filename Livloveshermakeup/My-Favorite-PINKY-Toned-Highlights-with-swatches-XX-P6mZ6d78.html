today's video is going to be one that
has been requested over and over and
over again and I originally was not
going to be filming this video today I
was going to be doing the ride-or-die
palate review and swatches from violet
sauce that video is going to go up
tomorrow instead it because I just don't
have time to film that right now there
are like 42 different shades in that
palette and I have to swatch them out
and I don't want to be hurried so I
thought today I'm go ahead and do this
one I was not planning on filming this
video today but I thought you know what
everybody requests this let's go ahead
and just do it so this is going to be
all about my favorite pinky tone
highlights if you've been watching me
for a while you know that I am
absolutely obsessed with pink tone
highlights which is kind of funny
because today I'm wearing a very warm
toned highlight I have champagne pop and
Prosecco pop layered on my cheeks but we
are going to talk about pinky tone
highlights I am someone who does have a
very fair complexion with a cool
undertone so I love love love pink tone
highlights and I thought I would share
with you guys my favorite creme and also
powder pink toned highlights so let's go
ahead and start with two Kremlin's
because I feel like I don't talk about
liquid or creme highlights all that
often if you have comically skin so
sometimes I feel like these just kind of
go right off my face but in the winter
time I have been liking these a lot so
the first one I want to talk about is
actually from Clinique
this is called the chubby stick in the
shade heavy highlight at first I was
like oh should I be clutter this should
I declutter this and then I started
using it on my face and what I was doing
was I was layering it layering it
underneath a powder highlight and I was
like I cannot declutter this it is a
beautiful beautiful opalescent voice
pinky highlight as you guys can see and
when you actually do layer it with a
powder highlight it looks incredible and
when you really want a highlight that's
going to last absolutely all day I would
really highly highly recommend going
ahead and taking a cream highlight and
then layering on top with a powder
highlight and you are going to get
something that's going to be wham bam in
your face absolutely all day long so
this is what heavy highlight looks like
I feel like it blends out beautifully it
does have it in Mexico base so it's kind
of slippery feeling but really really
nice if you do have a fair complexion it
would look a little more icy on you if
you do have a medium tone complexion or
a very deep complexion but that is
definitely the first one and then the
other cream highlight I want to talk
about I feel like I don't talk about
not but I love to mix this into my
foundations this is the NARS Copacabana
illuminator and this is what it looks
like I have this one announces super
orgasm now super orgasm is a really
really gorgeous kind of peachy color
with gold iridescent but this one is
absolutely amazing you buy a little goes
a very long way as you can probably tell
from this particular swatch but it
really has that nice pinky undertone but
like each silver iridescent to it so
obviously the Clinique one is a little
more muted and laid-back this one is
quite in your face if you want to apply
this with like a PM sponge on top of
your foundation you can just apply it
really really lightly like I said a
little goes a very long way or you can
mix this into your foundation it is
absolutely beautiful if you are getting
into pinky tone highlights and maybe you
just want to kind of lift up the color
of your foundation or even just go with
a really nice silvery kind of iridescent
highlights like this I would highly
recommend going ahead and checking it
out because I've had this for years a
little bit very long way and I am
continually impressed with that
continually continually impressed with
that alright let's go ahead and get into
the powder highlights I feel like a lot
of these I talk about all the time so
some of you may not be surprised that
the first one is definitely ve or skin
nude air glowing gardens highlight any
shade 0:01 glowing pink now they did
release some new permanent shades I
won't be purchasing any of them because
the or does test on animals but this is
my favorite highlight of life so I'm
going to use it up and then I won't
repurchase but this is what the outer
packaging looks like the new shade I
believe that is very similar to this one
or a spot on dupe
it's called zero zero two I believe so
it is just a really nice gorgeous
gorgeous pink highlight but again it has
that really nice kind of white undertone
I find this very very flattering on the
skin and who was it it was Tara Bates
who did a side-by-side swatch of this
one next to the new one but they just
released it is permanent and they are
the exact same color so if you do want
this I will go ahead and leave a link to
Sephora down below where you can pick it
up it is not an affiliate link it will
just take you directly to the website
but this is what it looks like it is at
base gel a formulation and I know I get
asked all the time what the hell is a
big deal a formulation it basically is
just one of those formulations where
you're touching it and it is like
buttery buttery soft and it doesn't feel
quite like a baked product or like a gel
it just is right in between it's very
very hard
describe but if you were to put your
finger in here you would know what I
mean you don't get it kind of tip up it
goes on really good me nice almost like
a foil to finish and these look really
really beautiful on the skin so anyway
that is the shade
0:01 glowing pink like I said it if you
have a new highlight that is pretty much
the exact same thing is that that is
permanent the next one I want to talk
about is from the ambient strobe
lighting powder collection from
hourglass hourglass is a cruelty-free
brand so I probably will be reversing
this I love the shade brilliance light
and also this one so this one is called
incandescent light beautiful silver
packaging you do have a little mirror
and then this is what it looks like so
this is one that I would categorize more
in like the neutral tone family so it's
not too cool tone but it's also not too
warm tone it I feel like it will be very
flattering on everyone and if you are
new to the ambient lighting powder
formula it's beautiful it's very very
light and airy on the skin and exactly
doesn't have the sort of pigment that
the Dior one has or a typical powder
highlight would have but it gives a
really nice list from within kind of
glow so if you are someone who is
looking for a very natural highlights
that you can build up on your skin and
you want it to be kind of pinky toned I
would highly recommend checking that out
alright the next one I want to talk
about is of course if that does Rose
Corsa Becca is a cruelty free brands
they are owned by a parent company that
does tests on animals but they
themselves do not test any of their
products on animals so this is bestest
rose quartz
look at the packaging absolutely
stunning I did a whole review on this I
just think it's really beautiful this is
the epitome of a neutral toned pink
highlight it will work for those of you
with a cool undertone and also a warm
undertone and I feel like on most
complexions this is going to look
absolutely stunning if you do have a
deeper complexion this is going to look
maybe a little bit more ashy on your
skin at my friend Senora who has a very
very deep beautiful chocolatey
complexion put this on her skin and it
definitely looked a little more silvery
but if you do have a very very fair
complexion this is probably going to be
a step or two darker than your skin so
it will give you a beautiful beautiful
glow so there is a Becca's rose quartz
as you can see definitely not leaning
more white tones and definitely not I
don't know it's just a little darker
than the hourglass as you can see these
two ones right here are definitely a
true highlight on me we need to say are
lighter than my skin tone but the
someone is not but that doesn't mean
that just because a highlight is darker
than your skin it doesn't mean that I
can't still give you a beautiful glow so
there is Becca's rose quartz love that I
did they make it permanent I feel like
they might have if you didn't think so
it they really should this is absolutely
stunning all right the next one is from
Laura Geller and this is it be based in
Louisville swirl illuminator indie shade
charming pink now I do not think that
Laura Geller is a cruelty-free brand so
I would not be purchasing but if you
have builded honey I do have what is a
peach glaze I think and then this one
and this one is beautiful as well so
another really nice cool toned pinky
kind of highlight this again has that
big shell a sort of formulation so
you're not going to get a bunch of kick
up or anything when you put your actual
brush in there or your finger so this is
how if swatches there is is and it is
very very similar as you can see to D D
or so if you are looking for something
similar to be fewer it's not spot-on and
like a dupe but similar I would highly
recommend looking into the laura geller
it is a whole lot cheaper so there it is
it's beautiful I love the way it goes on
it definitely has more of a pink tone
and then the actual do did yours if you
are definitely has that white undertone
this is more of a true pink but really
really gorgeous on the complexion and
finally the last one I want to talk
about is the urban CK afterglow eight
hour power exists eight hour powder
highlighter in the shade aura now this
is stunning and I will be talking about
this in my pale girl must-haves video
that will be coming up in a week or two
it is just beautiful it definitely have
more of that white iridescent underneath
it and this is a true powder highlight
so you can get it can get a little
powdery and a little chunky on the skin
you want to make sure you really do buff
it out but it is beautiful I feel like
it's right in between the laura geller
and outs of the dior this is just
something that i feel like it's going to
look beautiful on pretty much every
single complexion so there it is there
is the beach a lot of swirl illuminator
and charming pink and then there is the
Dior and I just really really love the
another glass I'm sorry I just really
really love the Urban Decay one I think
it goes on beautifully like I said
because it is that true powder really
kind of highlight you do need to buff it
in a little bit into the skin but for
the most part I feel like that is going
to show up beautifully if you do have a
fair complexion so anyway guys those are
my favorite pink tone highlights so if
you are wondering
again here we have it the you're glowing
gardens and glowing pink here is
incandescent lights from our glass right
here we have Becca's rose quartz and
then here we have a big baked gelato
swirl illuminator and charming pink and
then finally aura from urban decay and
then like I said also Narses Copacabana
and after the pony chubby stick and
happy highlight those are my favorite
pink tone highways I would love to know
down below what are your favorite pink
tone highlights and yeah that is pretty
much it thanks so much for joining me
guys and I promise to have that review
and swatches of the Holy Grail palette I
mean Delf a ride-or-die palette up
