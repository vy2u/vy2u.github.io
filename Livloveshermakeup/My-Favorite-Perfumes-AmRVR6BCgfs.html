about my favorite body pneus I wanted to
kind of do a body miss like my favorites
of that and then a perfume favorites
before I show you guys my whole
collection of the two combined and so
today I'm showing you my favorite
perfumes and I narrowed it down to the
ones that I really think I could not
live without like I definitely use these
like every day all of them no I would I
I mean I know that these are like the
month used ones in my collection and
they're my favorite scents so let's just
get started the first one is this DKNY
this is the golden apple one this smells
so good you guys I like the green apple
one but the golden apple oh oh it's so
good so so good i have this sitting next
to the little blossom one which is also
are like a favorite of mine but this one
is better this one is from coach and it
smells it very similar to that but this
one just smells a little better um I
don't know which one this is I have like
a few of those you know little coach
ones with the little ribbons and whatnot
they're just like color-coded but this
is i believe is he doesn't even happy
flower poppy flower whatever it smells
good it smells like fresh flowers I
really like fruity scents things like
that so I like to pair this with you
know um a body mist you know if it
smells similar and I love the packaging
so cute that little ribbon the next one
is like my classic I've gone through
three of these I think in the past two
years which is like a lot seriously um
this is the burberry this is just the
women is like this is just the standard
women's perfume i believe ya burberry
for women and this smells so classic and
so mature I feel like a big girl when I
wear this and my boyfriend loves the
scent it's almost like on the border of
being like unisex um but it just smells
like a powerful one I don't know but I
love it i'm almost done with this i get
them on hautelook for like twenty five
dollars which is ridiculous I think I
have another one
actually the next one is actually a
vintage bloom from Jessica Simpson for
spa love the packaging I have another
perfume on her and I hate it and I
bought it in full size and its most
hideous but this one smells very good
it's like a light bouquet of flowers and
it's just it's very light very floral
very feminine and i love the bottle the
next one is also very floral e this is
from steel oh this is creme bouquet and
you have to kind of like the scent of
flowers and baby powder to like this
perfume because those are the two things
that it smells like and I like those two
things so I really really love this
perfume and the last one yes that's
right I only picked you know like what
like six it's comparison you guys have
you smelled this one from parasocial I'm
so good you know what smells like it
smells like um what's that be sexy or
whatever from victoria's secret I've
used that body mess with this it's like
the same thing except this is way
cheaper this is just her standard Paris
Hilton uh it doesn't even say it just
has parasites interview get the one with
a stripey bottle it smells so good it's
so girly and fresh and it's wonderful so
those are my top perfumes that I could
not live without I wish I could have
picked more but I really wanted to
narrow it down to the ones that I use
like on a weekly basis and those are the
ones so as you can see I'm really uh I
like floral scents but then when it
comes to body muscle it fruity scents
for some reason so you know how it is i
just like to pair them together so
anyway what's coming next not in the
next video but after this kind of little
serious thing is i'm going to show you
guys the combination of my body mist and
my turkey collection i have to get it
organized for us look freddie anyway
thanks for watching guys see you next
