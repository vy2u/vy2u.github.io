my channel today's video is going to be
all about my favorite yourself sort of
products these are items that are very
much up there in price range but I
continue to purchase because they are
such good quality so let's go ahead and
start with a Charlotte Tilbury perfume I
believe this retails for around a
hundred and thirty-eight dollars I
actually first tried this out when it
was sent to me for PR and now this is
the third one that I have purchased
myself so I've gone through four of
these in the past nine to 12 months
which is absolutely insane I am NOT
somebody who has like only two or three
perfumes I actually have a pretty large
perfume collection and the fact that I
have gone through so many of these in
the past year is really really
astonishing to me now you do get the
normal sized amount of product in here
that you would with any other perfume
but I just feel like for 130 dollars
it's absolutely crazy but I adore at
this scent it is very very complex
definitely has a little bit of a sweet
undertone a little bit of a powdery
undertone as well as a spicy undertone
and for whatever reason I just can't get
enough of it so that is definitely one
of the most expensive perfumes in my
collection as well as one of my treat
yourself product let's move on to some
of the market Jacobs glosses I don't
even have any of these in full-size but
for a full-size this is gonna cost you a
little bit of money now I am one of
those people that really really doesn't
love lip gloss I prefer some sort of a
lip butter or even just like a tinted
lipstick something that's really
moisturizing something that I can
practice my flute with and that isn't
going to rub off on my head joy I like
these more than the buxom lip polishes
as well as the lip plumpers just because
those tend to be a little more sticky
when you think of a lip gloss you
usually do you think they're gonna have
a little bit of stick and tack to them
but these are so creamy they're so
beautiful on the lips and I actually
find them quite moisturizing so I have a
couple of different shades here this
little set I got during the holiday
season this first shade right here is
called boys don't cry which is a deep
purple and then we have a lighter kind
of lavender purple this is called
enamored I'm sorry raspberry beret this
is the enamored formula and then here we
have skin-deep which is one of my
all-time favorites it is like that
classic nude a lot of people seem to
like this guy right here which is called
sugar sugar
I prefer skin deep just because when I'm
not self tanned I feel like it is like a
your lips look better but has that cool
undertone running through it like
this is sugar sugar which is definitely
a favorite for a lot of people a very
very new kind of milkshake color with a
little bit of gold shimmer running
through it and then just changes which
is beautiful it's basically like a
bright chrome you have a deep kind of a
rich copper color with blue reflex as
well as green reflection it's like a
polychrome you have a lot of different
colors going on here so although these
are very very expensive when I run
through them I definitely will be
repurchasing a full size of skin deep as
well as raspberry beret as well as chips
it changes
alright recently I have told you guys
that I have been finding a lot of dupes
for Sunday Riley skincare products I
need to start finding dupes as well for
like drunk elephant products just
products that are super super expensive
and pricy as far as skincare is
concerned but it can be difficult
because a lot of these brands use really
really high quality ingredients but if
this is a product from Sunday privately
I just won't stop purchasing because it
works so well for me it is the UFO ultra
clarifying face oil personally can't use
the Martian mattifying melting gel toner
anymore because it is just way too
drying on me but this is actually
one-point-five salicylic acid treatment
that is bound into an oil it is grated
this is the second one that I have gone
through in 12 months which is crazy
after I skin you can still get breakouts
you can still get blackheads as well as
a lot of congestion in the skin and this
is just beautiful to go onto the face
and not dry out your skin even though it
has salicylic acid in it so this is
definitely a very pricy product that I
will continue to purchase it is one of
the only overnight sort of treatments I
can put on my face as far as benzoyl
peroxide or salicylic acid is concerned
and it doesn't dry me out to hell 100%
pure is actually a brand that I found
first because they did send me some PR
but I have recently purchased four or
five of their fruit pigmented blushes so
this one right here is called moppet and
this is a very very green clean kind of
vegan cruelty-free brand if you are
looking for really really clean products
they do have some good ones my issue is
that I don't love their skin care
products and they are incredibly pricey
but I do like a lot of their makeup
products there is something about this
color right here like I said it's called
Moffet as well as the texture that it
just blows me away I feel like a lot of
the time with green beauty products some
of them are really good and some of them
are just not you do get a little bit of
powder kick up when you put your brush
in here but so creamy so smooth so
pigmented and I feel like when I put
this on my skin it looks like a
and skin so you're never going to get
that really overdone blush look you know
when you dip into a product and you put
it directly onto your cheeks and you're
like oh my god I got to blend that out I
feel like you don't even have to do that
with these blushes they are incredibly
pricey for a blush but definitely
something that I am okay with purchasing
because I enjoy them so much and like I
said if you are looking into green
beauty kind of stuff would highly
recommend checking out their fruit
pigmented blushes just recently spoke
about these in a favorites video but
these are the dry bar a sake bomb
nourishing conditioner as well as
shampoo it definitely up there in price
and you get 8.5 fluid ounces in here I
feel like I'm starting to run out of
conditioner quicker than shampoo which
is sort of normal but you know what
these have been great for my hair I've
had so many scalp issues due to my lupus
the past year and a half it's just been
really hard for me to want to wear my
hair up in like a ponytail or wear my
hair down or do half-up half-down and I
feel so confident and comfortable when
I'm using these hair products because I
feel like it makes my hair look very
smooth it definitely helps my scalp
doesn't irritate it in any way shape or
form even with that really really strong
kind of cardamom fragrant a lot of you
in my favorites video we're mentioning
that the volume line is also really good
so I might look into that too but very
very impressed and happy with the
shampoo and conditioner and finally
let's just go ahead and talk about
hourglass as a whole but particularly
their holiday palettes which retail for
$80 apiece
I will continually purchase these
probably every single year I am really
really hoping that this year they come
out with multiple different shade ranges
for their palettes so say they come out
with three and they have one for lighter
skin tones one for medium skin tones as
well as one for deeper skin tones
because these are such special pallets
and I really do get so much use out of
them so this was the I believe at 2015
or 2016 palette definitely better for
those of you with a fear to light
complexion if this is the palette from
this year you can see that they went a
little deeper with the tones I really
really do enjoy that and then I even
have I think this is the 2014 or 2015
yeah you know what this is the 2015 this
is the 2016 and then this was the 2017
but you guys I get so much use out of
these and I know that I'm not the kind
of person that will tell you to go buy
you know an $80 $120 palette but
I mean I'm trying to show you guys the
products that I will splurge on and
normally I would not go buy $130 perfume
normally I would not go and buy an $80
face palette but these are products I
reach for so often when it comes to
their powder products they really are
fabulous I love their ambient lighting
powder routers I love their ambient
lighting blushes I love their ambient
lighting bronzer is just a beautiful
beautiful formula that is worth the
price in my opinion so anyway guys those
are products that are worth to splurt
definitely treat yourselves sort of
products let me know what yours are down
below and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
