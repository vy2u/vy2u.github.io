this video I am sharing with you guys my
favorite vegan items from Walmart I
think a lot of people think that you
cannot pick up a lot of vegan items at
Walmart for whatever reason that is
totally not the case I am going to show
you guys some snack items that I pick up
on a daily well not like a weekly basis
I should say not a daily basis a weekly
basis at Walmart every single week and
yeah I love Walmart they have amazing
amazing prices I really think that you
can't beat them and before you go off on
me and you're like where are all the
fruits and vegetables let me tell you
guys how I personally like to do my
shopping so weekly shopping I like to
get my fresh produce and vegetables at
Whole Foods I think they have the best
selection I like to get a lot of like
frozen items and things like that at
Trader Joe's because they have good
prices and they do have some good vegan
options and then I like to get pretty
much everything else at Walmart I like
to get juices here I like to get like as
you can see bread bowls just like drinks
I like to get almond milk I like to get
salsas and almond butter and things like
that I like to get it warmer because
it's much cheaper so I'm gonna walk you
guys through some of these items and
yeah we'll just get started so the first
item I have here is the great value 100%
juice this is apple juice and this is
like a 64-ounce container 96 fluid ounce
not even 64 my goodness way more than
that 96 fluid ounce container I believe
this was 349 which is amazing I am huge
on juice and I don't recommend getting
really into juice because it's not that
healthy for you there's a lot of added
sugar and things like that you can get
juices that don't have added sugar and
all that kind of stuff this is a hundred
percent juice but I just personally
really really love juice I will drink
that like literally as my dessert it's
like my favorite thing so anyway I think
that up and then I picked up some more
teas I think that you can get teas for
so cheap at Walmart I kind of Emmett
east snob I really love Teavana teas
which are like loose leaf teas however I
really like these Lipton green teas the
ones that have like the flavoring a
friend of mine got me into the Jasmine
citrus passionfruit ones and I really
liked those ice so I thought that I
would pick this one up this is green tea
super fruit cranberry pomegranate I also
picked up a little box of the celestial
fruit tea sampler again I like to have
fruit teas iced so good so this one has
raspberry zinger a georgia peach passion
wild
singer true blueberry and black cherry
berry and then I also got another one of
the Lipton's and this is acai dragon
fruit melon and I think those are gonna
be amazing ice so anyway I picked some
of those up these were like 149 a box
which is very very cheap and I feel like
Walmart has the best prices Walmart also
has the cheapest price on the Vita Coco
pure coconut water this is one liter and
I think this was around three or four
dollars the next item I like to get at
Walmart is the Justin's almond butter
and also peanut butter this is the
cheapest you can find it honestly the
Whole Foods this is almost like triple
the price not triple the price but
almost double the price I swear to you
so anyway this is just classic almond
butter all that is in here is dry
roasted almonds and palm oil it's super
super good I love almond butter with
apples and then I did pick up some red
bowls you guys I don't know what's wrong
with me I've become obsessed with Red
Bull and I know it's not healthy for you
okay I'm well-aware but I don't like
regular Red Bull
I like the flavored one so this one
right here is the blue edition this is
blueberry and for as little for four
cans of this I think it was like maybe
five or six dollars which is the
cheapest I can find it anywhere there is
a hundred and ten calories in here it is
vegan and there's only 80 milligrams of
caffeine which is not that bad now it
does have other but kind of not so good
ingredients but I think I'm obsessed you
guys I just like drinking cold drinks in
the morning and if I have a Red Bull I
will not have a coffee because I could
literally probably die from all the
medication I've take I'm not supposed to
mix that much caffeine but this only has
about 80 milligrams of caffeine per
bottles there's the tiny little bottles
and that's actually not too bad the
normal cup of coffee has anywhere
between 80 and 120 milligrams of
caffeine so anyway yeah that's not too
bad so these are the blueberry ones
these ones are the tropical ones and
this is my favorite it's like I'm
stuttering on my words this is my
favorite these are the cranberry ones
they're so good cold in the morning love
them alright so let's talk about some
cereals you might not have known are
vegan Raisin Bran vegan so good love to
drink it with almond milk so yeah I like
getting a big box of this this is only
like 349 it's family size at Walmart and
then another favorite thing of mine at
Walmart are definitely their salsa so I
love salsa
and salsa isn't super expensive anyway
but you can get these big ones here
these are let's see here 24 ounces yeah
which is 1 pound of salsa for I believe
2 or 3 dollars this one is peach
pineapple chipotle salsa and I wish that
the great value by the way I always like
to get the great value brand I like
compared to brands they're the same
exact thing they have the same exact
ingredients and they're vegan so yes of
course I'm gonna buy the compareto which
by the way that also the apple juice is
the compare to brand because it's the
same exact thing guys anyway this is
peach pineapple Chipotle I wish they
just had like peach pineapple mango from
the great value brand but they don't
they have the Chipotle one I really
really like this one it tastes really
good and then I also picked up a new one
this is a line in garlic and I thought
that sounded really really good as well
I love anything sweet or savory when it
comes to Saul says here are the chips
that I eat and they are the cheapest at
Walmart these are the Benito's of black
bean chips they are vegan high in fiber
and I don't know what it is but ever
since I kind of switched to a vegan diet
five to six days a week I can't really
process like corn as well if that makes
sense like you just doesn't go through
my body as well now babies do anyway I
really do like these they taste
extremely extremely good and they are
the cheapest so I got back to the two
bags of that hello ooh Special K red
berries vegan yes nobody knows that I
swear not a lot of people know that but
yes this one is 15% more cereal family
size it was like 349 or $4 this one is
vegan the obviously the fruit and yogurt
one is not and a few of them aren't but
this one is and it's really really good
now what I drink that with our of these
Blue Diamond almond breeze almond milks
it's 30 calories for a cup and this is
the vanilla flavoring this is the family
size and this is like two or three
dollars so I got two of those and we
always get a few of those and then the
next item I got were these little
Justin's classic peanut butter these are
these squeezable packs I like to take
these when I go to work and they're
basically just little tiny peanut butter
you know packs like snack packs and I
like to bring them with like a cut-up
apple and I will eat that throughout the
day and then the final item that
is the great value white cranberry peach
again this one it doesn't have like
high-fructose corn you know syrup or
anything like that in it however there
is added sugar in this one I just can't
help myself I loved you so so so much
and I go through it so quickly so I
always get the great value brands
because this looked like two or three
dollars for this 64 ounce this is 64
right yeah 64 ounce food on skinned foot
64 ounce container I cannot speak so
anyway I did pick this up um I wouldn't
really recommend like you know buying
tons and tons of sweetened juices like
this but this one tastes exactly like
the what's it called Ocean Spray white
cranberry peach which is really really
good and I'm just obsessed with juice
this helps me stay on my vegan diet so
anyway those are some items that you can
pick up at Walmart that are completely
vegan I hope that maybe I inspire some
of you and again don't worry I get all
of my fruits and vegetables at Whole
Foods that's why I'm not showing any in
this video but yeah I think all of us
together was around maybe $60 which is
not that bad considering all those Red
Bulls are normally like $10 a thing so I
hope you guys enjoyed this little video
I will pop up some more you know vegan
grocery hauls and things like that once
in a while and yeah I'll see you guys in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
