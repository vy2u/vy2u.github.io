this video I am finally sharing with you
guys my top favorite water and serum
foundations now I love wearing water and
serum foundations during the summertime
I feel like it's the best time to wear
them just because they're super super
lightweight on the skin they actually
have a beautiful consistency to them I
feel like they really look like skin and
also they can be quite beneficial for
your skin because they either have a
high property of water in them or serum
so anyway today I thought I would share
with you guys of my favorite ones I have
tried a lot of them out you probably
seen me I don't know review seven or
eight serum foundations within the last
six months on my channel but today I am
sharing four with you guys these are my
ride-or-die absolute favorite a water
foundation so let's go ahead and get
started
alright the first one I want to talk
about is from Laura Mercier and this is
not really categorized as a serum or
water foundation but the consistency is
definitely like a water foundation and
it's very hydrating on the skin and this
is the Laura Mercier candle glow soft
luminous foundation the shade that I
wear is shell you do get one fluid ounce
of product in here and it's a beautiful
frosted glass bottle with like a
gunmetal little lid you do have a pump
here and this is absolutely beautiful
and gorgeous on the skin out of all of
the four that I'm going to share with
you guys I would say this one doesn't
have a very very strong wear time you do
need to wear a nice kind of tacky primer
when you're wearing this one but I do
think it's absolutely beautiful on the
skin you can tell right away by how it
just kind of goes down and kind of melt
all over my skin that it definitely has
like a water consistency to it I really
like this particular shade I feel like
shell matches me really really nicely
even when I do have a self-tan and I
just love the way that this fits on the
skin it has a very very mild fragrance
to it and I think that if you are
someone who does have a little bit more
like dry skin and you are looking for a
nice water or serum foundation you would
really really enjoy this I prefer to
apply this with a brush actually which
is interesting because you guys know I
normally like to apply any start a
foundation with like a damp a Real
Techniques sponge and I feel like that
works a little better if you're wearing
more of like a medium to full coverage
foundation you guys know on a day-to-day
basis I prefer full coverage foundations
but during the summer time sorry that
was loud
summertime the last thing I want to do
is put on like the Kat Von D lock and
tattoo foundation or like the Tarte
Amazonian clay just because it's so
heavy and I just feel like you know it's
not as light weight and skin like
looking at a water or serum foundation
this one does not have any SPF in it but
most serum or water foundations do but
this one's a really nice option if you
have a more a dry or I would say like
combo dry even like more mature skin I
think you would absolutely love this it
is a little more pricey but it's really
really good all right so the next one
I'm gonna share with you guys is the
Sephora ethereal natural finish
foundation this was probably one of the
first serum foundations to kind of hit
the market this is supposed to be a dupe
for the Perricone MD serum foundation
it's really beautiful it comes it looks
basically just like the fair go and MD
one it comes in dropper form and it just
has a beautiful silicone ease sort of
serum consistency too it's now the shade
that I picked up is about I would say a
shade two shades darker than my skin
tone it is number 10 which is ivory I do
believe they have a 0-5 shade which is
lighter but this is what it looks like
on my skin even with my self-tanner on
right now it is a little darker but you
guys can see it blends so beautifully
it's got light to medium coverage I
would say that all of these serum
foundations or water foundations have
light to medium coverage however I will
share with you guys want at the end set
it's my all-time favorite and I feel
like that one really really can actually
build up nicely on the skin but I would
say one layer this is about as much
coverage as you can get out of it
there's really no point in layering this
particular one because it just doesn't
layer very well if you want more
coverage I would just recommend going in
with a foundation on top you could use
this kind of as a base or you could go
in with a concealer but this one is
absolutely beautiful it is so silicone
II like really really like filled with
dimecaco to the top but it really feels
good you can blend it in with your
fingers really quickly and I also do
like to apply it with a brush the reason
I don't like to apply these serum
foundations with a damp Real Techniques
sponge is because I feel like it does
kind of take a little bit of the
coverage away and these particular
foundations don't have that much
coverage to begin with by the way this
is only 0.67 fluid ounces so you're not
getting a full ounce of product in here
but this is significant bit
significantly cheaper and then the other
foundations that I am showing you guys
it's about half the price I believe
comes in around 19 or 20 dollars so this
one is a really really good option as
well I think all sorts of different skin
types would really really enjoy this I
would just stay away if you have very
very oily skin all right so the next one
I'm gonna share with you guys is the
Smashbox camera ready BB water drops
this has broad-spectrum SPF 30 in it I
love this one it does come in dropper
form as well and this is I believe 70%
water so you're getting a really really
nice hydrating foundation here you guys
can see it literally is like water on
the skin it blends beautifully it
doesn't feel as like dimecaco mic or
silicone like as the Sephora one since
this one is more of a water foundation
but this is beautiful it's very
hydrating I don't feel like it's greasy
at all on my skin even though I do get
quite oily during the summer time I feel
like this just really hydrates it leaves
a beautiful finish on the skin and this
one can build up a little bit not too
much and I do want to say really quickly
I don't think the Laura Mercier builds
up that well either you might as well
just go ahead and do one layer of the
Laura Mercier one layer of the Tonks
infusion or the ethereal natural finish
foundation but this one I would say it
can build up a little bit the most
coverage that you're going to get out of
this is definitely like a very light
natural coverage you definitely can
still see like your acne scarring or if
you have like marks on your face
hyperpigmentation acne you definitely
can still see it through this particular
one but it just makes your skin look
beautiful and luminous and glowy and I
feel like all of these foundations
definitely don't have super super full
coverage but it's still beautiful
because they really look like skin and
they kind of like turn into one with
your skin so anyway that is my third
favorite in the shade that I wear is
Farah by the way really enjoyed that and
they final serum foundation that I want
to talk about that is my all-time like a
ride-or-die favorites this is the Stila
serum foundation this is the aqua glow I
absolutely won't do you guys hear that
someone's honking down there I
absolutely adore this foundation I did a
review on it it's beautiful it was
probably I don't know maybe like the
first serum foundation of like the New
Year like this released I think in
February maybe and it was the first one
that I tried of the new year and I just
absolutely adore it this one is really
nice you do want to shake it up really
well all of these actually but this
one's really nice because you can
actually build the coverage on this so
this is what the actual packaging looks
like you do get one fluid ounce of
product in here
leave its around 32 or 35 dollars and
the shade that I wear is fair and now
this has a really nice kind of cooler
undertone to it so if you are someone
who has a quill undertone in your skin I
just squared it out way too much anyway
this is a really beautiful foundation
here it is like completely blended into
my skin as you guys can see you can't
even tell like it definitely covers
things nicely but it's not like heavy or
anything like that it doesn't really
feel DeMatha comb like sort of like the
ethereal natural finished foundation it
definitely feels more water like like
the smashbox one but it gives like way
more coverage and like I said this fair
shade does lean a little more on the
cool side so if you don't have a pink
undertone or like a lot of red in your
skin this may not be a super super good
color match for you but I believe they
do have six to eight different shades
that you can check out and I really
really do adore at this one you really
do want to make sure that you shake this
one really well because I notice if I
don't
every time I actually like pump the
product out sometimes it comes out in
like different kind of consistencies
like sometimes gonna be a little more
chunky sometimes it will be a little
more liquid like so you really do want
to kind of shake it well but it's
beautiful definitely has the most
coverage out of all four of them and
that is my all-time favorite so those
are my favorite water and serum
foundations I think these are perfect to
wear during the summer time because
they're so lightweight on the skin they
look like skin most of them have SPF in
them and I just think they're really
really beautiful I am one of those
people like I said I just love like full
coverage foundations so the fact that I
really enjoy these water and serum
foundations it's kind of a big thing for
me because I've always been very very
self-conscious of how my skin looked
when I was wearing tinted moisturizers
or CC creams or BB creams and I feel
like these have that sort of coverage
level they're not like full coverage you
know so I really feel like this has
helped me to kind of like get used to my
skin a little more and I don't know I
just really enjoyed it and the greatest
part is that when you go back to wearing
a full coverage foundation you're like
oh my god that's so full coverage so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow for my
Ulta follow-up haul bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
