thank you so much for joining me i have
my hair pulled back because i am filming
a little tutorial for you guys this is
going to be my i'm in a hurry makeup
tutorial and i wasn't planning on
filming this this week i was gonna film
it like next week or the week after or
something you know it's been on my list
for a while but i have actually been
reaching for this look every other day
this week I've been in a hurry I just
have been laying myself kind of sleep in
a little longer and keeping myself
basically like 10 minutes to get ready
in the morning and I have tying myself
with this particular look and I can
actually do a full face of makeup in six
minutes with these products i will be
talking my way through this tutorial so
obviously it's not going to be as short
but let's just get right into it shall
we so any time I'm gonna free in the
morning if I wake up late if I give
myself just like 20 minutes to get ready
in the morning I always always reach for
micellar water to cleanse my face or a
facial wipe just because it's like I
don't know if I'm in a hurry I don't
want to go through my whole skin care
routine I just don't want to so I did
already cleanse my face with these
simple of micellar cleansing water this
is my favorite cleansing water I still
have not found that Garnier one I know
I'm like the only person I really want
to try the Garnier one but the most
simple one is definitely my favorite it
just leaves my skin feeling really
really nice and soft and takes off any
sort of residue that may have been there
from the night before so the next thing
I'm going to do is go right into
foundation if I am in a hurry I do not
bother with primer like eyelid primer
face primer or anything like that I just
absolutely don't I also don't bother
with using a foundation or a concealer I
try and reach for something that's
really really easy to blend because I
want to use my fingers because that is
the quickest way so I love this cover
girl posole CC cream it has the coverage
of a foundation but they blend ability
of a CC cream so what I do is apply two
pumps of this onto my fingers by the way
my shade is 105 ivory and I just apply
this all over my face and I love the
coverage it gives I will take it right
underneath my eyes on my eyelids
everywhere i'm talking everywhere and i
love the coverage that this particular
CC cream gives it's actually my favorite
one i know a lot of people love the one
from it cosmetics however my favorite
one is this one i just love the way it
smells i love the coverage gives i love
how blendable it is the only thing i
will say that i do
love is the fact that it is a little
dark and this is the lightest shade it
doesn't look dark when you first put it
on but after a while it will start to
oxidize especially on the outer
perimeters of your face so I don't love
that but basically what I'm doing is
just blending the sand all over my face
it really has a nice smell to it and i
also have SPF so i love this and like I
said like when you're in a hurry in the
morning you don't need like primer you
don't need foundation you need something
that's easy to blend and I feel like CC
creams are great for that so the it
cosmetics CC cream would also be really
really nice for this particular look
just making sure it is everywhere all
right white my hands and then I'm just
going to go right in and set this
because this is going to be our primer
is going to be our concealer and our
foundation so what I like to set mine
with is the essence all about Matt this
is the fixing compact powder this is
just a translucent powder and because
this CC cream does pull a little bit of
like pink and orange undertones on me I
like this particular powder because even
though it is translucent it sometimes
does leave a little bit of a white cast
which I feel like evens out any sort of
color that starts to get a little pink
or orange e on my face with this
particular product so just make sure
everything is all blended I'm going to
go in with my it cosmetics this is my
bookie buffing brush I got this in the
holiday sex that came out from last year
I'm just going to go right into this
powder and start putting that on my face
I'm setting everything in around my eyes
around my nose everywhere I do have
combination skin but especially when I
have not used like a primer or something
like that I like to make sure that I
really lock this in so that it lasts a
good chunk of the day and I really love
this powder if you guys are looking for
a really nice matte powder this one is
really really good I just recommend not
using too much because it does leave a
little bit of a white cast but again if
your foundation or CC cream is a little
dark for you you know that may actually
work in your favor so anyway after I
have done that and completely set my
entire
face in I'm going to go ahead and reach
for this palette right here this is my
hourglass ambient lighting edit palette
I reach for this every single time all
the products that you guys are seen this
is what I reached for every single time
I'm in a hurry and I think it's nice
because when you're in a hurry you want
to reach for products that you know are
going to get you out the door quickly
and the reason i love this hourglass
ambient lighting edit palette is the
fact that it has three highlights in it
a bronzer and two blushes so i actually
have certain ones that i pair with each
other so any time I use the bronzer on
my cheeks I will go in with dim light
and highlight with that any time I use
this pinky color in the middle right
here which is called luminous flush
blush I will go in and i will use
diffused light as my highlight at any
time i use mood exposure blush i will go
in with the what is it ambient lighting
powder in your doesn't light which is
one of their strobing powders and i
absolutely just love this palette
because i feel like our glass products
you can't really overdo them on the face
in my opinion I just feel like it's very
very easy and if you are in a hurry in
the morning the last thing you want is
to go and grab like your most pigmented
blush and highlight and put that all
over your face because it's just going
to you know it you have to spend more
time blending it out it's just not a
good solution as far as time is
concerned so what I'm going to do is
take this little morphy fluffy brush
right here it's a blush brush and I
highlight brush and i use it for both
and it's very very fluffy and i like
that because it doesn't pick up too much
products at once at once so i'm going to
go into the shade right here this blush
shade the one in the middle i'm chatting
off the excess and i'm just going to put
that onto the apples of my cheeks and
like i said i just love that it doesn't
deposit too much color down quickly and
also the ambient lighting powders have
like the kind of like soft focused
effect to the skin so you're really
making your skin look nice as well and
when you're not wearing a concealer or
correct or anything like that you just
have a CC cream on you know you can use
all the help you can get in the coverage
department so i'm just putting that all
over my cheeks I don't bother with going
in even when I use the bronzer shade I
just use that on my cheeks to kind of
give some light I don't bother
contouring your bronzing or doing any of
that because
of the girl when you're in a hurry ain't
nobody got time for that alright so once
I've done that like I said I like to go
into diffuse light and I'm going to use
the same brush I go right into that I
tap off the excess I hit my chin area
just to give a little bit of light I go
down my nose a little bit above my
eyebrows and then right on my cheekbones
above the area where I put the blush on
and I feel like it's just nice it gives
a little bit of light and I also kind of
evens out the skin if you have any
discoloration or I mean I feel like
these ambient lighting powder is like I
said they have that soft focused in fact
almost like a little bit of coverage so
it's really really nice in that area
alright so that is my blush of my
bronzer everything I have put my face
products on basically so the next thing
that I like to do is go in with a single
shadow and I like to just use my finger
I tap this from my lid all the way up to
my brow bone it's a nice pinky shade
this is the knicks prismatic I shadow in
PS 0 for a girl talk and it's just a
pinky peachy neutral shade and I go
ahead and I put this on my little finger
and I tack this all over my I all the
way up to my brow bone it just gives a
little bit of light and I'm really messy
with it because again I'm going to hurry
I'll take it on the inner corner of the
eye as well but what I like is it just
gives a little bit of brightening on the
eye without being um super super
overdone so I just put that all over do
the same on the other side really really
messily I just don't even care and I
won't straighten out my eyebrows with
this time if I feel like I need to
because when you're in a hurry you don't
do your brows alright and then the last
step that I do or I mean the second to
last step I should save I'm gonna put
eyeliner on first and what I like to do
when I'm in a hurry is girl just go
ahead and grab yourself like a banana
colored or white colored eyeliner it's
going to make your eyes look awake and
its really really nice so the one I use
is the Laura Geller icare waterproof
eyeliner the reason I like this one it's
more of a banana shade so it's not a
stark white to right on the water line
and I just think it looks a little more
natural if that makes sense so I'm going
to put that right onto my waterline
literally almost just poked my eye out
it's hard to do this on camera
so I just put that right onto the water
line like that and then the last step is
to go in with mascara and when you're in
a hurry you don't have time to curl your
lashes or at least I don't so I like to
grab a mascara that really really um
holds a curl so the one that I always
grab for is one of my favorites it's the
Sephora outrageous curl dramatic volume
and curved mascara in the shade black I
like it cuz it's got this tiny tiny
little wand so it's like amazing and
pulling the lashes up giving you a nice
coating and like making it look like you
have lashes but also holding a curl so
that is what the wand that looks like
and I'm just going to apply one layer of
this on my upper and lower lashes and I
just really love the way that this holds
a curl like I said I mean it's one of
those products I actually feel like does
hold a curl a lot of mascaras I have
longer eyelashes on top and i will be
doing a video on the eyelash products
that i use because a lot of people are
curious i just got some on the side of
my face that's okay you guys can see
immediately um the difference like it
just opens your I cub but i will be
doing a video on what eyelash like
stimulating products i use i'm going to
recommend 33 buys that are all in a two
of them are in a nice price range of one
of them is quite pricey but i thought
it'd be interesting to do a video on
that because these are not um I mean
they are my natural lashes but they
didn't always look like this basically
so then as you guys can see I islands I
love always mess up a little bit and I
get mascara either up here like I don't
want to blink too much because it will
go up here or down here so what I do
after is just go in with a q-tip and I
will wipe that after it's dry but ain't
nobody got time for that right now I'm
not gonna sit here and wait for that to
dry to do that so I will do that off
camera but this is the look it is a very
very quick simple I'm gonna hurry makeup
look but I feel like it still looks put
together I'm not saying that this is
like oh yeah you should go to work
looking like this like if you're in a
very professional environment I am a
teacher a music teacher so it's okay for
me to show up to work with like very
minimal makeup but I don't know if
you're in a more professional
environment maybe this is not enough for
you but it is for me so I do enjoy it i
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you for watching and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
