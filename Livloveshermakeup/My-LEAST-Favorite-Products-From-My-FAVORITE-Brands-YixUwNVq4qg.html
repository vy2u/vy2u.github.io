channel today's video is going to be
part to you in the little mini series
that I started last week I talked all
about my favorite products from my least
favorite brands I'll go ahead and throw
that video up in the cards if you are
interested in checking it out and so
today I thought we would flip that
around and I would talk about my least
favorite products from my favorite
brands so let's go ahead and start with
Becca I have a product here from Becca
that I really don't like now Becca has
been a very consistent brand in my
opinion I have been loving all of their
new releases lately they have definitely
been a favorite brands but I have never
liked the Becca backlight priming filter
now I find this kind of funny because
I'm actually a big fan of the first
light priming filter I adored this when
I was living in Milwaukee I liked it
while I'm here in Arizona I'm not quite
sure if I would repurchase I feel like I
need just a little more moisture in my
primers nowadays but still I really do
prefer this over the back light now I'm
thinking of just going ahead and
decluttering this there really isn't too
much left in here but as you guys can
see I've tried to use this in multiple
project pans which I do have a project
and coming up soon for you guys talking
all about cruelty-free or non
cruelty-free products that I want to use
that before wintertime but anyway this
is definitely one of those products that
I tried and tried and tried to get
through if you want a good bang for your
buck when it comes to primers and these
primers from Becca outlast freaking
forever anyway I really don't like the
artificial look and plaster that this
gives to my face it looks really really
unnatural and shiny and a lot of people
say oh it just gives me a glow I don't
feel like it gives me a glove it really
just looks artificial and I don't feel
like it actually prolongs the wear of my
foundation so I'm not a fan of this I do
love Becca but this is not something
that I have been enjoying all right up
next we have the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills brow is in the shade blonde I also
do have the shade taupe and I hate this
brow pencil you guys everybody talks
about how good the brow products are
from Anasazi of Beverly Hills but in my
opinion I don't think they're that good
I've tried dip brow I hated it I tried
the brow powder I hated that I've
decluttered it and this guy right here
is no exception I really don't think
it's good I have also tried the Anasazi
of Everly Ho's perfect brow pencil I
just don't like Anasazi of Beverly Hills
brow products now you have this tiny
tiny little retractable pencil right
here as you guys can see it's and I feel
like to even get any color payoff
because this is such a dried formula I
have to go back and forth in my brows
now when you're doing that
disrupting the hairs and I'm actually
losing eyebrow hair from using this so I
do have it in my brows today today I
just filled in the front part I didn't
even do the arch or the tail because I
really just don't want to have to go
back and forth in my brows but this is
definitely something I'm thinking of
decluttering because honestly it's
nothing special and I definitely don't
think it's worth the 19 or 22 dollar
mark all right up next guys we do have a
little trio here from wet and wild this
is called the color icon three four
eight eight eight part and heavy little
eyeshadow trio so this is what it looks
like and I thought this was beautiful it
was a limited edition collection maybe
that's why it's X so much because this
is just not the same sort of formula as
their other trios and their other eight
p.m. palettes here is the wet and wild
comfort zone palette I love this palette
two pieces let me open it up here and
that is what it looks like I love this
palette two pieces and I love the
pigmentation I love how smooth and
blendable they are unfortunately these
are just not the same let me go ahead
and do some swatches for you guys in
this top shade right here which may look
semi pigmented when you actually swatch
it out and get it onto your eyes it
looks patchy it has a little bit of
glitter in it it's really not that nice
this purple goes on extremely patchy now
I know that Purple's are very difficult
to formulate but that is just not good
and then the pink is nothing special so
this is just not be normal kind of
formula that you would expect from wet n
wild let me show you guys some swatches
of comfort zones just so you can get a
little bit of a comparison here here's
like comfort zone you guys can see the
full-on pigment going on there there are
one swipe swatches compared to these
it's just not the same formula I don't
like that they do that I don't like that
they do these limited-edition
collections so that is not something
that I am a fan of sorry I have snot
coming out of my nose still Oh sick all
right moving on guys we have a product
from ELF now you guys know that Elfie is
one of those brands that has one of my
all-time favorite powders of life it is
the alto correcting powder in cool and
this is what it looks like it has little
quadrants and you can see there's
different colors here so you have a
yellow you have a blue you have a pink
and then you have a green I love this
for setting in my foundation it is
literally my all-time favorite powder as
far as setting powder is concerned so
when I saw that they had these little
skin balancing cool toned beads I
thought oh my god this is great I should
try this out no these are messy they
flopped on the floor you end up having
to pick a little balls off the floor
they break when you start putting them
on your face they leave a very
artificial looking sheen on the skin
they're just not good I know
we're trying to do like the Guerlain
meteorite sort of thing with these but
honestly these are just not good quality
they also look very ashy on the skin and
I do find that sometimes if I do have a
little more like self-tanner on it the L
tone correcting powder in coal can look
slightly actually on my skin because it
does polls such a cool undertone but
these just make me look like a ghost
they're really really not nice and I did
not like them alright guys and finally
we have a product here that is a very
very high expensive primer from our
glass now you guys know our glass is
definitely a favorite brand of mine I
love their ambient lighting powders I
really love it they are strobing powders
I really love their holiday kids that
they come out with every single year and
lately I have been absolutely obsessed
with the illusion hyaluronic skin tint
there's literally nothing in my
collection as far as foundation is
concerned that I like more than this
right now I wear the shade vanilla I
used to not be the biggest fan of this
but it's working amazingly for me down
here in Arizona it's what I have on my
skin today but anyway I really don't
like this primer right here what's funny
is I used to like it so it's like I've
done a little switcheroo with these two
products right here but this is the
ambient light correcting primer in a
luminous light this was one of those
products where when I was in Milwaukee I
really liked it at first and then I
would notice that it really helped to
control oil in my t-zone so I would take
a little bit of it and I would like to
tap it into my t-zone and after a while
I would notice that it started to peel
up a little bit it pills like crazy now
for me down here
I just can't mix it with any foundation
any sort of skin care products oil with
anything like that it does not work for
me it doesn't leave a little bit of like
a blurring look on the skin but unless
you are very very oily I don't think
this will work for you because now I
have more normal to dry skin and this
looks like on my skin so although
it's beautiful and I love the ambient
lighting formula as you guys can see
this is just not something that works
for me anymore I don't feel like it
really prolongs the wear of my
foundation all that much and I really
hate that it pills on my skin so anyway
guys those are my least favorite
products from my favorite brands I want
to know what your products are down
below thank you for joining me and I'll
see you guys tomorrow
