welcome back to my channel today I'm
sharing with you guys my least favorite
shades from some of my current favorite
palettes now there are also a couple of
palettes in here where I kind of switch
around the finishes so this is sort of
like a rearranging palettes video but
it's not super super in-depth or a
serious because these are still
favorites of mine and I like a lot of
things about them but there are
definitely times where I'm doing my
eyeshadow or I'm putting on blush or eye
light or whatever and I think I really
wish this was a different color or I
wish this was a different finish so
let's go ahead and jump right into the
video by the way I do want to say really
quickly I don't know who started this
whole rearranging palettes thing here on
YouTube but I do know that my friend
makeup struggles as well as Georgia
Harris have done videos like this so I'm
gonna go ahead and throw them up into
the cards because I think I can
throw other people's videos up in my
goddamn card so we're gonna go ahead and
do that if they are not up in the cards
then I will link them down below please
go check them out send them some love
but yeah let's go ahead and jump right
into it so when it comes to the Too
Faced chocolate gold palette this is
like a four star rated palette this
 is good okay I really like
a lot of things about this palette
however I have to say the two green
shades over here money bags and challah
for a dolla look very very similar once
I get them onto you at my lower lash
line or even onto my lid now you may be
thinking they look completely different
this is obviously like a deep army green
and then this one over here live is
obviously like a dig you know a true
green well for whatever reason it
probably because I'm not that great with
my makeup they both start to look at the
same on me I feel like the one thing
that is missing in this particular
palette is a steal a blue color now I
mean there's so many different colors in
here you have been nice kind of neutral
lid toppers you have the true gold you
have the silvers which are
gorgeous you have the beautiful
beautiful kind of like I said greenish
shapes but they look so similar so I
would have loved to see a steel blue
shade in here with that beautiful foil
finish that would have been great so
that is the first palette up next guys
we have they Becca a play skee glow face
palette when it comes to this palette I
enjoy it a lot I reach for it a lot I
had reached for my Becca palettes a lot
in general but there are definitely two
different colors as well as two
different finishes I would switch up in
here and they are these guys right here
I feel like these are incredibly
recycled shades from Becca
we have is one of their barometers now
this is in the shade of bronze Bondi and
it really is pretty but I don't feel
like it's universally flattering for a
ton of different skin tones I would love
to see this a tad deeper and a little
more cool tone and also I would have
loved to see a little bit of shimmer in
here now sometimes when I look at it in
direct sunlight
I see shimmer but then I can't remember
if it's just coming over from some of
those shimmering skin perfecter press or
if that shimmer is coming over from some
of the luminous flush of blushes but I
would have loved to see this a tad more
cool tone so that a lot of different
skin tones can use it and also a little
bit of shimmer and then this guy right
here winterberry obviously you've seen
this blush a million times this is
basically just Papua mousse and every
other blush that they use every single
time in their palettes a Becca comes out
with some gorgeous gorgeous a luminous
flush of blushes and lots of colorful
you know shades like Snapdragon and I
can't remember the another one but
beautiful beautiful colors so I'm always
wondering how come they always do this
very very kind of like reddish a
grapefruit color
pomplamoose but I think it would have
been nice if they did like a true red
like a true wind winterberry kind of
color like a true red or a deep a purple
matte that would have been really nice
that could have worked for a lot of
different skin tones or something that
was really really nice and shimmery and
then maybe they changed out blush copper
for a little more of like a peachy shade
so that's just kind of how I would
rearrange at this little guy right here
but overall still a really good palette
moving on we have the lorac unzipped
palette I've been reaching for this a
lot at recently and I love the overall
color tone layout in here however some
of these really really start to muddy
together and I don't think it's just my
skill level which really doesn't high at
all I think it's just the colors in
general now the two shades right here
which you would use as a transition as
well as a crease color which are called
let's see here unconditional and
unspoken they look identical
when you get them on to the eyes and
then these two darker shades right here
also look kind of similar when you get
them onto the eyes now you may be
thinking come on Liv you could do
something a little more unique or
different with that palette but every
single eye look that I come out with
with this palette looks very very
similar one thing that is definitely
missing in here is a true transition so
my least favorite shades are definitely
unconditional and unspoken because I
feel like uncondition
if it was a hair lighter and maybe a
little more topi it would be a perfect
perfect transition and then when it
comes to this guy down here the one
thing that's kind of missing in this
pallet although it is a very very
neutral and a little more cool tone it
is kind of a warmer tone to brown now
you may be thinking unspoken looks a
little more warm tone but I'm talking
like has a little bit of an orange
e-base I feel like it would really give
a beautiful striking appearance to the
rest of the shadows here
I love the majority of the finishes in
here but like I said I just I feel like
I need a transition and I feel like I
need something a little more warm tone
to pop into my crease so those are the
two shades I would change in one of my
favorite palettes and then finally guys
we have the Kat Von D Saint and sinner
palette now when it comes to this
there's really only finishes that I
would change the color selection in here
is really extravagant and really really
cool if you kind of play with it
now when I first got this palette I
personally thought that this color
layout was scary I just feel like the
way that they put the palette together
didn't really make sense but you have
the same side you have the center side
and now that I look at it more I really
do enjoy it however absolution and
rapture and pretty much anything in here
that's glitter infused why hey you know
I do that I just don't understand when
brands do that huge glitter infused
thing revelation and ashes are actually
beautiful they're like that true matte
finish so you have like that actually
color and then the chocolate brown but
then they have these micro glitters in
there and you get this fall out on your
face and you're just kind of wondering
why it's there they blend beautifully so
what I would have loved to see is ashes
completely matte no glitter in it as
well as Revelation revelation would be
perfect to work into the crew say if it
didn't have those glitter pieces and
then ashes because there really isn't a
transition color in here again would
have been a great transition now when it
comes to some of these maps here like
exodus as well as exorcism I really like
Exodus but I would have preferred if
that was a little more of a shimmery I'm
sort of finished this guy does have
little tiny glitter particles in it as
well and again I find that they travel
on my face throughout the day and then
exorcism purples are so hard to do and I
can never work with matte
purples and it's probably just my skill
level but some of the more foil shades
in here are absolutely beautiful the
foil finishes in here are really really
nice that
would have made at that shadow right
there even more excellent in my opinion
but the rest of the palette is gorgeous
some of my favorite shades are Cathedral
and heaven but like I said you know it's
not so much the color selection in this
palette it's more so the finishes that I
would rearrange and funny enough I think
it was Georgia Harris who actually
rearranged this palette so that you
could see it in a more cohesive way but
now when I look at my same consider
palette I'm definitely not as
overwhelmed as I was when I first got it
I actually really do enjoy it and I love
the color selection so anyway guys those
are some of my least favorite shades and
finishes from some of my current
favorite palettes let me know if you
want me to do a whole rehaul on a
certain palette or if you want me to
discuss like a new release coming up and
I rearrange the colors and that I think
these videos are so so so fun so
definitely check out George's as well as
a makeup struggles a video but yeah
that's pretty much it thank you so much
for joining you guys and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
