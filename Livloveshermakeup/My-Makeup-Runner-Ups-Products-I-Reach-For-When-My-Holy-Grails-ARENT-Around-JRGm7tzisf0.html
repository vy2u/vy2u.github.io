thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be about my runner-up
products these are kind of like my
second best and there's still really
really good products that I do have
something that stands above them if that
makes sense so I want to go ahead and
start with the Anastasio Beverly Hills
moon child glow kit you guys know this
is one of my all-time favorite glow kits
it's beautiful but very very pastel II
now I recently was sent to the flower
beauty Galactic glow face palette it
looks a little something like this
again sort of like a dual chromatic
holographic palette but this one has a
lot more depth to it because of this
golden shade down here now I do have the
golden shade on my cheeks today and this
one and the bigger one right here are so
beautiful mixed together so I will
always have a soft spot for the honest
hacia Beverly Hills a moon child if this
is the palette I reach for when this guy
is not in the picture alright guys up
next we have the Oprah makeup fixer mist
now the Smashbox photo finish primer
water is my all-time favorite setting
spray I love that it's alcohol free
fragrance free a very very light on the
skin and I do feel it actually prolongs
the wear of my makeup well so does this
guy right here and honestly this is like
a fraction of the price you could 8
ounces of product in here with the Ofra
and it's only like 14 dollars on the
Ulta calm website I feel like people
often pass this up just because it's not
talked about very often but if I have to
go ahead and replace my Smashbox with
something else it would be the Ofra now
as far as eye primers are concerned I
have always loved the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion so one of the
reasons why I love the anti-aging is
because it has this really really smooth
yet tacky base to it so it's not overly
sticky and tacky like say the shadow
insurance glitter glue or something from
Too Faced and obviously it's not too
slippery so this is a really really good
product however I have found recently
that I love this little elf primer right
here it comes out in a very very full
kind of silicone like texture and at
first I thought I was not going to like
that because it was a little too
slippery but if you set it down with
powder it really looks good throughout
the day it helps to make sure that my
eyeshadows don't crease and also the
color and saturation when I wear this
eye primer is amazing I love
my modern renaissance palette this is
one of my top five palettes for sure in
my collection and that is coming from
someone who last year had over a hundred
palettes in her collection so and that
is saying a lot it is beautiful I love
the formula of this I love the color
selection but I have to say I have been
very very impressed with these Solstice
palette from bad habit this is actually
what I have on my eyes today and what I
had on my eyes two days ago and probably
like five days ago I've been wearing
this out of this palette now my
only complaint with this is that I feel
like you get through these way too
quickly
my friend Lucci I got the same sort of
PR package as I did and I saw that on
her like Aphrodite as well as her
Solstice palette she literally had hit
pan on so many different shades and I
was like what the but now I can see
where she's coming from you have to be
so careful especially with the mattes in
here because you start to get dips in
them very very quickly so what I
recommend this one over say the color
pop yes please I'm not quite sure
because honestly the color pop yes
please I use the out of that one
and I have not hit pan but this has been
my favorite recently it has been my
go-to or second best product I want
something a little more orange E and
warmth out I'll go for this if I want
something really really berry toned but
also something that gives a little bit
of depth I will go for this my all-time
favorite face palette is the Becca
Jaclyn hill champagne collection face
palette it includes two luminous flush
blushes I'm sorry note to matte blushes
you have amaretto as well as Pomplamoose
and then you also have a rose a spritz
which is a luminous flush blush then you
have a champagne pop and Prosecco pop in
here I use the out of this I am
very very surprised that I am NOT
panning this palette because I love it I
adore it I love the packaging love the
mirror love it for travel it is also eye
safe a few of the blushes are so I like
to use it on my eyes as well it is just
an all-over really good palette
unfortunately it is discontinued so
whenever I'm not really reaching for
that I have been going for the anasazi
of Beverly Hills blush trio now I know
this technically isn't like a face
palette but it gives me the same sort of
vibe to as the Becca really like a mix
and matching a lot of the shades in here
and you do need a smaller brush but this
is very very easy to go ahead and pack
into it your purse or into your suitcase
it is travel friendly and you also do
have a mirror so I would say the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills blush trio is second
best right now these were on sale a few
days ago at Sephora
so I don't know if they still are
definitely check it out we have a lot of
different shades to choose from and it's
a beautiful beautiful formula if you've
been watching my channel for a while I'm
sure you know how much I talk about the
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder as well as the elf tone
correcting powder in cool I'm currently
out of both of those and I've been
reaching a lot for the luxe cashmere HD
setting powder and coconut cream from a
graftobian professional makeup which is
a product that I didn't love at first
but I really do enjoy now and I also
reach a lot for my Too Faced Born This
Way natural ethereal setting powder
both of these are loose powders however
I think they look great if you apply
them with a damp sponge if you don't
want to bake your face but you still
want to get that flawless look and you
do have dry skin or mature skin I highly
recommend checking one of these out go
in with your Beauty Blender after you
apply your foundation make sure it's
still a little damp and then push it
into your skin and I think you're gonna
be really really surprised by how nice a
loose powders look that way so really
love the graftobian as well as the Born
This Way I also have been obsessed with
your lips but better and kind of like
nudie lip shades so my all-time favorite
right now is the NYX butter lipstick in
the shade a root beer float and this is
just the epitome of a your lip a better
sort of color it's got a berry a Mafi
tone to it but it still looks natural
has a little bit of a nude kind of
running through it the only thing that I
will say about this is like do you feel
like it starts to kind of move around on
my lips throughout the day my second
best next to the root beer float is
definitely this of Burt's Bees lipstick
right here I have been loving this it is
in the shade 5:02 suede splash and it is
beautiful it goes onto the lips really
nicely and it definitely has a little
bit of a longer wear time than the root
beer float I still prefer this shade
just a little more which is why I'm
putting this in the number one spot and
this in number two but it really is a
good formula and I'm actually interested
in trying some more of the shades out my
current favorite foundation without a
doubt is the studio Skin Foundation from
Smashbox and you shade a 1-point one
however when I am NOT reaching for that
I am always reaching for my urban decay
at Naked Skin Foundation I feel like I
was a little late on like the bandwagon
it comes to this foundation I did not
actually pick it up until last year I
did a first impressions on it I think
this is great if you have normal or dry
skin even if you do have Humber or oily
this will also work for you you're
looking for something that's not going
to give a really really dewy vibe or a
really really matte v it's just going to
look like your skin like make your skin
look like your skin I would highly
recommend checking out this foundation I
do wear the shade is 0.5 don't know if I
said that yet it blends in beautifully I
can use it with a brush or I can use it
with a damp sponge and I absolutely
adore it and now we should talk about
bronzer I am obsessed with the horrible
butter bronzers from Physicians Formula
and Physicians Formula have kind of been
on my list recently you guys will
see a video coming up on that very soon
I just don't feel like they are
all-inclusive and I feel like right now
or 2018 should be the year of obviously
being inclusive so I'm not quite sure if
I would repurchase these but I'm gonna
have a damn hard time finding a good
Duke because this guy right here in the
shade bronzer as well as light bronzer
are beautiful they smell really good
they go onto the skin in such a natural
way and I mean this is a great great
bronzer right here now I really do like
my two face of sweet tea bronzer as well
I remember when this released with some
other products I wasn't a huge fan of
the other products but this is gorgeous
if you want that really really luminous
bronzer and it's gonna look like you're
wearing bronzer this is the bronzer for
you now I know some people don't want to
look like they're wearing bronzer but if
you just hit the high points of your
face this is just absolutely stunning it
really does look like you've spent the
day at the beach it has a little bit of
like a yellowy undertone and it actually
looks surprisingly and natural even on
my fair complexion so I'm a huge fan of
this bronzer and I'm gonna have to say
you know what and that is second best in
my collection as far as color correcting
is concerned I still absolutely love my
Urban Decay Naked skin color correcting
fluids but the Becca under eye corrector
has really grown on me they now have two
different shades of this the one that I
have is the lightest one and I didn't
love this when I had more combo oily
skin and for good reason it is very
sticky it is very very tacky and very
humectant so if you do have dry or
mature
skin.this is definitely something to
look into you can also gonna double it
sa concealer honestly it's not too pink
on the skin so I'm a huge huge fan of
that little guy right there and then
when it comes to primer all-time
favorite at the moment is the it
cosmetics field the moment primer this
has been my favorite for years now
unfortunately kind of like Physicians
Formula it cosmetics in South so
currently on my list so I'm gonna
need to find a dupe for this very very
soon but this is the anti-aging ultra
hydrating sensory awakening primer serum
now if I had to pick another primer in
my collection that could compete with
this one it would definitely be the NYX
born to glow illuminating primer in e
shade btg p01 white now they're not
similar in any way this is literally
like a face serum and it's just so
incredibly thick and luxurious and
hydrating on the skin but this is the
best illuminating primer that I have in
my collection hands down I'm not a huge
fan of primers that have a really really
artificial glow if they're going to be
illuminating this one is the perfect
amount and also has a nice scent to it
as well as a nice amount of hydration
not as much as this guy right here
very very very decent amount this looks
particularly good when I wear something
like the Smashbox Studios skin
foundation something that's a little
more hydrating or a little more skin
like but it also really does look great
with a full coverage matte foundation so
I love the mixed burnt to glow
illuminating primer finally I guess I
should tell you guys what is my all-time
favorite blush at the moment it is the
Too Faced a love flush Baby Love a long
lasting a 16 hour blush I've always been
a huge fan of these blushes as you guys
know on my channel I do own all six of
them in a full-size this was a great
great reformulation that they did this
is a really really neutral pretty color
I would say it's kind of similar to
tarts exposed obviously I'm trying to
pan all my Tarte stuff right now and I
think I did go ahead and declutter that
exposed single so this has a little more
of a golden sheen at running through it
a lot more blendable and easier to pick
up on a brush then the Tarte however you
know what my Milani Luminoso blush yeah
this is definitely any second place you
guys can see I have made a huge dent in
this guy right here this will give you a
lot more glow on the cheeks but it is so
flattering on so many different skin
tones which I find very very cool so I'm
a huge fan of that eye
say that the Milani is definitely
second-best and yeah I think that's
about it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know down below what are
your top 5 runner ups in your collection
thanks again for joining me guys and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
