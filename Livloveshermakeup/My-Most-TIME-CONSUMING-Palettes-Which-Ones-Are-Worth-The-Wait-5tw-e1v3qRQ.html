today I am sharing with you guys some of
my most time-consuming I and space
pilots but the thing is is that these
are actually really worth the wait now
I'm usually someone who does not like to
spend a lot of time blending my
eyeshadow blending based products I like
things that can just be like a
one-and-done kind of thing I wanted done
kind of situation but I will say these
palettes are definitely worth the extra
time even if I have to blend my
eyeshadow for 20 minutes I will do it
for these palettes because they are that
good so let's go ahead and start would
be pretty vulgar cosmetics nightengale
eyeshadow palette I did do a review of a
bunch of different pretty vulgar
cosmetics products so I'll go ahead and
throw that up in the cards if you are
interested I did not like everything
that I got from the brand but this
palette right here is gorgeous so inside
of here you get a bunch of gorgeous
grungy smoky tone colors and I have to
say although all the finishes and all of
the shadows in here are not created
equally
this is gorgeous when you actually spend
the time and put in the extra efforts
again I love I give so many compliments
every single time I am wearing this and
I just think it's absolutely stunning so
this is definitely the first palette
that is very time consuming as far as
blending is concerned as far as building
up color is concerned but you know what
at the end of the day it is worth it
because it is gorgeous on the eyes
alright the next palette I want to talk
about is a limited edition my last
product so this is the Kat Von D element
holographic palette so and this is what
it looks like it does not look like much
in the pan at all
these are holographic gorgeous like dual
chromatic shades and basically you can
use this all over your face so the
difference between this and the anasazi
of Beverly Hills like moo-cows below kit
it just can also be used on the eyes it
can also be used on the lips as well as
the cheeks blush chopper highlight
whatever you want
now these definitely take a little more
effort if you want to put them on the
idea have to foil your brush you really
have to kind of build up the shades but
it's so worth it
these on the inner corner of the eyes
paired together with light at the
nightingale palette or any sort of how
it looks absolutely stunning and when
you really go in with like a sigma
tapered highlighter f-35 highlighting
brush and really kind of pack it on and
then go in with a buffing brush you can
get these to mold in with your skin and
you get such a natural beautiful
holographic goodness sort of thing going
on with your face I do sometimes feel
like the moon child Lok it can be very
like okay it's obvious that you have
purple I later on it these are
we can move in with the skin if you want
them to so although it is a little
harder to work with I would recommend
this I think this is great quality
alright next we have two different blush
palettes from elf cosmetics these are
just the elf cosmetics blush palette now
I have a lot of people tell me all the
time
I love your recommendations but
unfortunately I cannot get over those
out blush palette now the thing about
these is that you really have to be
careful I think they are overly
pigmented in my opinion and I don't say
that very often but I think that
definitely was based products sometimes
when they are overly pigmented it can be
a little more difficult to work with so
one of my favorite things about these
blush palette this one is the dark
version by the way is the fact that they
really do kind of stain the cheeks and
they stay on all day long but you do
have to work with them so if you are
fair complected here's the light one by
the way if you are fair complected what
i would recommend doing is going in with
a fluffy brush picking up the product
and then just kind of like stippling it
onto your cheeks and then if you feel
like you do have some harsh edges or it
looks a little streaky because they are
so pigmented go in with a fluffy brush
and just kind of blend in circular
motions and I can promise you you are
going to love these blushes they last
all day they look incredible on the skin
and I really think those are worth the
wave all right next we have the Bible
sauce Pro eyeshadow palette in the
dredgen metal version now the reason why
I feel like this is so time-consuming is
because it's just filled with foiled
shades so if you are new to the viola
bas formulation make you a lot of
glitter pact or glitter infuser
eyeshadows as well as foil chase and
usually a few maps unfortunately in this
palette there are only two matte shades
you have a transition and then you have
a liner shade and this liner shade down
here is absolute so you basically
just have a transition shade
let's see here poppin and kisses are
both foiled as well you really need
something that you can put all over your
lid it just kind of as a base and this
palette does not have that so when you
try to work with it on its own
unfortunately these are really hard to
work into the crease to work into the
outer V to blend because you don't have
anything underneath it so it's
definitely a little more time consuming
I call this a supplementary palette like
I have to pull something else in like my
Urban Decay Naked basics palette or even
my Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral palette
to make this work but it definitely is
worth the wait is a beautiful palette
and I love what it does for the eye
alright next we do have these Fela
perfect me a perfect cube palette so I
do have all four of these but I will say
I feel like the majority of them are a
little difficult to work with actually
pretty much all of them are a little
difficult to work with not all of the
shades in here are created equal
I guess not all of these finishes in
here are created equal it's funny
because all the palettes seem to have
one liner shape it's super super crispy
and hard to blend and then they also
have one really really densely pressed
like a blush in here so one of the bus
is a super gravy and then the other one
is super hard to work with so the first
one I have here is the light flash and
medium a version I'm probably going to
declutter this one just because I feel
like I have shaped like this in my
collection but this is what it looks
like to get five different eyeshadows
and two blushes one of my all-time
savers is this one right here which is
the fair / light version this is
gorgeous for when you just want to put a
shadow on really quickly you want your
very one and done sort of a look and
then finally one of my all-time
favorites as well is this guy right here
which is can flash deep the rose gold
one which is called medium flash tan is
also really gorgeous I have that as well
but this one right here could be a
little problematic again especially if
you are fair complected so I love with
feel again I love this you can get a
palette that will work for all sorts of
different complexions but like I said
there is always one a blush in here that
are super firmly pressed and for this
palette is this one right here now
obviously this is a little too dark for
me to use as a blush so I use it as an
eyeshadow it's super hard to
blend and then the two liner shades in
every single palette towards the right
hand side are very hard to blend but you
get such a gorgeous I look and face book
when you use these are great for travel
and I really feel like the outcome is
worth it so if you have your eye on one
of those palettes I would highly
recommend picking them up because
although they are a little time
consuming they definitely are worth the
wait alright and finally we have some
short cosmetics products on the first
one is the charge of contouring a
palette this is the beautiful contouring
palette but again I feel like it's
almost a little too pigmented one of the
reasons why I love my it cosmetics
contouring palette is because I feel
like I can build it up on the skin when
you are a little more fair complected it
can be difficult to go in and contour
without looking muddy and these two
contouring shades on the side here
really really quickly could make you
look like you kind of got like hit in
the face or something so
me I'm just not crazy about those two
contouring shapes but everything else in
here is so incredibly beautiful I don't
like this little strip of weird random
highlight in here but I feel like if you
can use these the right way it actually
will give you a really nice chiseled
look and I feel like it's worth the wait
I don't see that very often about
contouring palette because like I said a
lot of the time I feel like they get
muddy on my skin it real quick but if
you use this the right way if you go
with a densely packed brush and kind of
work it into the hollows of your cheeks
and then take again a buffing brush is
really really buff it out or even go in
with this and then take like a silica
powder and assess your whole face on top
and do like the buffing techniques this
looks amazing so although it is a little
more time-consuming because it is so
pigmented it's definitely worth the wait
and finally I have the charge of
rainforest as I see eyeshadow palette of
volume 1 and volume 2 I'm not in love
with volume 3 I feel like that's just a
little too chunky at the very heart to
work onto the eyes very time consuming
and definitely not worth the weight that
these 2 palettes right here are
beautiful so they all are like a soils
consistency and if you are not used to
that they definitely take a little more
time to work with my all-time favorite
is the volume 2 which a lot of people
were saying you get in this month of
boxycharm if you do get it seriously
work with this a little bit with like
densely packed brushes you are going to
love it it's absolutely beautiful and
then volume 1 is definitely a little
more on the flaky side as well it's not
as firmly pressed as volume 2 however
it definitely is a little more firmly
pressed in volume 3 like I said volume 3
really only works for me as a
highlighting palette but this one right
here is really really beautiful as an
eyeshadow palette if you use the right
brushes so it's definitely a little more
time consuming but you can get gorgeous
gorgeous eye looks the last all day and
do not crease whatsoever so those are
definitely worth it as well so anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed this video as
always thank you so much for joining me
and I guess I will see you guys tomorrow
