this video I'm going to be sharing with
you guys my must have beauty tools if
you hear the wind it is really loud here
right now and I live in a really big
building and everything starts making
noise in the wind against like the
windows so I did open the door a little
bit 85 degrees here in Manhattan really
hot so if you hear like gusts of wind
blowing through that's why I live in a
high-rise and it happens it starts like
really shrill horrible sound it's
actually kind of scary I don't like it
anyway but like i said this video is
going to be a must have beauty tools so
um or my must have beauty tools i have a
lot of beauty tools and i think that a
lot of them are not necessary but a lot
of them i just like to have so i have
like a foot bath i have like warming
mitts for my hands that vibrate and like
heat them up I have you know tweezers
all that kind of stuff basic stuff and
then I have you know face brushes
certain things I've tried a lot of stuff
and I threw everything on my bed last
night and it total out to be 18
different kind of beauty products and I
think some of them are definitely worth
the hype and I just wanted to pick out
the ones that I really don't feel like I
could live without if that makes sense
like the ones I've use on a daily or
weekly basis and that told out to be
five products so i'm going to show you
guys in this video those five products
i'm going to talk about them explain
what they are and explain why you guys
should probably look into that if you
want it anyway so let's get started the
first thing i want to talk about is the
clarisonic this one happens to be the
clarisonic mia is bright pink i love it
it's adorable and basically the
clarisonic is from the makers of the
sonicare toothbrush which i also have
they came out with this many many years
ago and basically they have tons of
different varieties that you can choose
from different sizes different settings
stuff like that and it's basically just
a face brush to use when you're
cleansing your face you can use it in
the morning and at night or you can use
it only in the morning or only at night
or maybe even just a couple times a week
it really really exfoliates really well
and it basically makes the cleanser that
you're using penetrate into your skin I
think like eight times more
that it normally would with just your
fingers so um on the website on the
first kind of website they have all
these like studies that they did about
why this is so much better than
cleansing with your hands um I will say
right away i got this when it came out
many many years ago I think I was like
14 I asked her for Christmas my mom got
me and her her and I both the clarisonic
pro and that was like the big chunky one
they had like four or five different
settings and that lasted me until last
year it actually broke last year and i
went into sephora and I knew exactly
what I wanted to get I wanted to get the
Mia this is the one that only has one
setting however I specifically chose it
for a reason because I found that when I
had like my clarisonic pro the settings
did not matter what really matters about
like the cleansing is the brush so I've
tried a lot of different brushes from
the clarisonic line I started with a
sensitive skin one i also have tried the
normal skin one both of those were just
okay I have tried the delicate one that
one was really nice and then I recently
or a guest less in the past couple of
years I fell in love with the deep pore
cleansing one which was like really nice
long bristles most of them are really
short bristles but this one was really
nice and long and it really got like
into my pores and I just noticed my skin
cleared up so much and um I kind of
started getting away from my clarisonic
maybe in the past couple of months i was
thinking like I don't know it just kind
of felt like it was that extra step at
nighttime that just like I don't know I
was getting to bed late I was tired and
I just didn't want to do the one staff
which was kind of stupid I ended up
kicking up another beauty tool that i'm
going to show you guys next it's one of
these sponges from OSHA that's going to
be another one of my must-haves but um I
picked that up because I thought well
I'll just do like a change of pace and
I'll do every other nights well do the
bowl just fine Jan the clarisonic and
let me tell you my skin started breaking
out like crazy and I realized that my
skin is very used to the clarisonic and
very used to the amount of exfoliation
that I get every single night when using
this and so I went back to using this
every single night
and I use the bosha sponge in the
morning so anyway long story short i
love this i would say it's very very
important that you don't need to pick
just so you guys know you don't need to
pick up like the higher quality or like
the bigger ones first of all their heart
to store these are awesome to pack the
mia and the minute you are great you can
get them from ninety nine dollars at
sephora and you can even get like
cleansers and stuff that comes with it
it's a great deal and i just want to say
if you're going to splurge which i think
you should you should try the different
brush heads I really don't think the
actual model of the clarisonic makes a
difference I think it's just it feels
like it's vibrating more in your hand
but i don't think the actual level they
go back and forth the sonicare system
goes like this their toothbrushes and
their cleansing facial whatever this is
what are you say shal brush um they go
back and forth and so just like up and
down so it really gets into the pores
but I actually think that it's just like
it feels like it's doing more in your
hand but that's because I got the
battery and everything in here so in my
personal opinion you only need the one
with the one setting however i'm going
to say that this brush head that i
recently got this i have had this
probably since january it came out in
january this is their new luxe line the
l ux e and let me tell you oh my god
this feels like buttery silk I got one
for me and one for my boyfriend one for
my mom my mom did not like it she felt
that it did not exfoliate her skin
enough um however my boyfriend might
love this um this is amazing at
nighttime I use acne cleansers so I knew
something either with salicylic acid
benzoyl peroxide or tea tree in it and
that can be very drying to the skin and
I was noticing kind of when I was
getting away from my clarisonic for that
you know time I was noticing i was
getting very very red and raw after i
had used the clarisonic and like ten
percent benzoyl peroxide which is
totally normal but it was just too much
it was over exfoliating my face and I
blame it on the brush so the minute I
got this one everything changed and it's
just so silky and smooth and it really
moves the product around nicely you just
want to really hit your skin delicately
don't
push in like this that's not going to do
anything you really want to just hit the
top of the bristles so just really
lightly all over your face and it'll
beep and let you know when it's over you
just felt all over your whole face you
can either put the cleanser on top or
put your cleanse around first and then
go over I recommend putting the cleanser
on because it will save you so much
product because this really will make it
lather up but anyway so um love the
clarisonic this has been a huge part of
my skincare regimen for years and years
and years now but I realized that you
don't need to get the expensive one to
get the quality that you know it's all
about they're all waterproof you can
keep them in the shower but let me tell
you that clarisonic pro cockyboys hear
that wind that clarisonic pro in the
shower that thing is huge you don't want
to travel with that I dare definitely
recommend getting the mia or the me of
two and bullying and splurging on one of
the deluxe brush heads which are about
forty dollars maybe even 60 however um
if you clean them off after you like
after you are doing your face in the
shower I always feel like this and I let
it run the water run and I make sure
that the brush is really really really
clean and then I make sure that I stored
in the shower rack so that it drives
really well so I don't actually change
my head every single or every three
months I do it like every six months and
that's worked for me but anyway so I
love the clarisonic highly recommend if
you guys have it's really perfect for
everybody i'm not going to hit the point
it's great for anti-aging it's great for
just deep cleansing depending on what
kind of skin you have you can find a
brush head that matches but i really
recommend the luxe brush heads like I
said they are around forty to sixty
dollars and the other ones you can get
like two for 40 or maybe they're like
twenty-five dollars a piece I think
however I have just found I had the most
benefit from this particular brush head
and it has something to do with the
model of the actual thur sonic so don't
splurge on the actual model just pick up
the you know the little cheap one it's
cute it's tiny it's compact it's great
for travel and it doesn't take up a lot
of space in the shower alright moving on
second product this little sponge so I
hauled this
maybe about three weeks ago and like I
said you know when I was just talking
about the clarisonic I was just not
getting a lot out of my flowers not I
mean it wasn't that it wasn't getting a
lot of it I was just getting tired and I
just felt like I was getting weird skin
issues if I'd use it one day and not the
next and that's when I realized I have
to use it every single day because I'm
used to mechanical exfoliation but I
thought I'd trade it off with this fudge
so i used this and it was fine but then
i realized that you know I need my
clarisonic every day so I started using
this in the morning and i love it so
this is the bosha um where's it calls
home g a cork on sham KO njaa see i
don't know how to say that home jack
pong jack probably not something like
that it is basically just like this
spongy material it comes in this little
case and it's like hard to the touch it
feels like a little rock but the minute
you put it under warm water it just like
cushions up and it's so soft it's very
very porous as you guys can see and I
love using this with my scrubs in the
morning I these scrubs on my face in the
morning so I will take my scrub just a
little bit on here and this lathers up
so beautifully and now they do have
three different types they have this one
which is the I believe red clay which is
actually hydrating and I have
combination skin but like i said i tend
to use scrubs that has salicylic acid in
them and cleansers that have you know
acne ingredients in them so it does
really dry out and irritate your skin so
i thought uh whatever i'll pick up the
hydrating one i love it it absolutely
every time I use um i'm using a saint
I've scrub right now when i use it with
my hands and I get all the shower it
feels dry like my skin feels a little
like oh it took too much oil out of my
face you know however when I've use it
with this it feels soft and it feels
like oh my god it's so we're doing look
at my building is tipping over anyway it
feels so good when I use this it doesn't
feel tight it feels just great so I love
the hydrating one they do have a green
tea one which is for oily skin and then
they have a normal skin one but i
recommend checking out the hydration
but like I said it's just super porous
it just is great because you don't have
to use nearly as much product it saves
you money because you only have to use a
tiny little bit and basically you just
rub it all over and then you go in with
the water and you keep kind of lathering
and it still works with scrubs which the
st. i scrub i'm using right now the
green tea one is very very filled with
granny particles of exfoliator so I'm
amazed that it really lathers up nicely
with this so absolutely love this sponge
I highly recommend and I would say if
you cannot afford the clarisonic or if
you don't even want to try and you just
start like it's too expensive it's not
my thing definitely go and check out
these punji Africa coming Ned comnet KO
njaa see comcheck sponges from bozhe you
can find those on the website and I also
can store I believe that was like
fourteen dollars so really good deal
alright moving on my third favorite or
yes favorite must have beauty tool is
this Revlon petty egg same so there's
this one that sells everywhere that's
like petty egg that's been on like
infomercials and stuff I tried that I
did not like it this is better this is
the Revlon one it's called you know I
think it's Revlon petty egg or something
like that and basically it opens up and
you get this little part here and then
you get this part and this for your feet
um I have a thing about like getting
calluses off my feet my feet tend to get
like rough and I don't like that so
every other night I use this and what I
do is I scrub scrub scrub on my heels on
my toes everywhere on my feet I step for
the really soft parts because this is a
little rough it's kind of like a cheese
grater and it just it's like a cheese
grater it just grapes off the dead skin
cells and it actually has this little
lid so when you're scraping you don't
have to do it over the trash can or
toilet or something it actually fills up
inside here and then you can just dump
it out later so I love that I think it's
really quick and easy and nice and it
keeps my feet really really nice and
soft I always thought that it was my
foot creams that we're keeping my feet
really soft but I definitely think it's
this so what I do is I use that like I
said every other night they also
this like thing right here where you
think kind of like polish your heels if
you want I don't use it but I just love
this part but um I've had this for years
and years and years i'll be like five
years and i absolutely love it like i
said i've used it every other night and
then I put on a foot lotion or a foot
cream and then I cover my feet and socks
and in the morning my feet are so soft
and they just look nice they look pretty
they don't look rough and yucky for the
summertime because all our feet will be
out during the summer they just look
really great and I'm very very happy
with this product so love that all right
number for right-handed before I'm ready
what's happening okay number four is the
derma roller this is a micro needling
system for your skin so it can be used
anywhere on your body that has skin
uh-huh don't use it like on your
eyeballs or anything basically it is a
set of tiny tiny little micro needles
you can see there and I realize oh my
god the wind I'm so sorry you guys hold
on one second okay I closed that door it
was so loud I'm really sorry um anyway
so yes I realize this is not everybody's
cup of tea these are little needles that
you are rubbing on your face I realized
that a lot of people are like I'm not
doing that however if you have acne
scars or stretch marks or cellulite this
is supposed to be really really good and
I say supposed to be because I have not
tried it on cellulite and stretch marks
it which I do have and I probably will
try however I've been using this
religiously once a week for my acne
scars I had a bad cystic acne breakout
in high school all around my jaw it was
hormonal related and I ended up going on
birth control and it completely cleared
everything up that I was left with acne
scars really really dark red marks that
are now still purple on my skin however
I was left with a few kidded acne scars
which is where it actually has like an
indent in the skin and it is not pretty
um it looks bad you know it's textured
you can tell and let me tell you guys
since I've been using this this has
dramatically cleared up the pitted acne
scars that's crazy you
you have to get like plastic surgery for
that kind of thing literally it's like
indents in your skin and it's just
amazing to me that this has helped so
much so basically the concept of this so
windy so the kind sorry so the concept
of this is that you are damaging your
skin and your skin needs to rush the
surface and push out you know like red
blood cells and collagen and just push
forward good ingredients so that it can
prepare itself so you are rubbing these
micro needles all over your face and you
do this once a week only because
anything that you put on your skin after
using this for a week is going to deeply
penetrate the skin because you are
making small little tiny holes in your
face okay it's kind of yucky um you look
really red and beaten up after but it
really really works you want to follow
up with a really nice moisturizer after
nothing else no harsh ingredients try
and not wear make up the next day just
be really really careful um so basically
like I said you really have to kind of
roll it on your skin and it does feel
uncomfortable I believe there are
numbing creams you can get I'm a pretty
high pain tolerance so I don't mind it
but a lot of people do say like oh my
god it really really hurts so that's
something to think about they had
different sizes that you can get they
recommend you start out with the 1.0 mm
millimeter yeah and they also go up to i
believe like three point 0 which are
like longer needles and that's for
really really deep like going way down
into the bottom layers of your skin and
you need to work your way up so i'm on
the one point oh I you can even get the
I think point 5 start with that I
started with the one point oh I did have
some issues at the beginning my skin was
just looking even more blotchy however
like a week later it's just like some of
these pitted acne scars started going
away and I noticed because the problem
with like makeup kind of stuff is you
can cover color like I still have the
little purple marks from the acne scars
however you cannot cover texture and
when you have little indents in the skin
that's very noticeable so I'm so happy
to say that this has really actually
helped that I really did not know there
was even a way to clear that up
unless you wanted to get plastic surgery
because when you have an indent in the
face you have an indent in the face like
that's how it is however this is really
really helped and I'm absolutely amazed
you need to be really careful with this
you need to absolutely clean it and stay
on top of it these are needles they are
going into your skin they are pulling
out crap as they go okay so you don't
know what's all all up in the deep
layers of your skin so you need to soak
this in our rubbing alcohol or what
about you so powerful it's the proper
all that alcohol 15 minutes before you
use it and then after you use it for 45
minutes and then you want to let it air
dry I got mine on amazon for I believe
like fourteen dollars would be really
good deal it was really good big deal I
was happy um and like I said start out
with the smaller size needles and just
work your way up I don't notice any
anti-aging benefits from this I think my
clarisonic helps keep away fine lines
better than this does but people do say
it helps with that I don't see that
however if you have acne scars
absolutely try it out again I'll just
tell you guys so basically you are
rubbing the needles on your face you're
injuring yourself so that your body says
oh my god no no no no and rushes you
know red blood cells and collagen to the
surface to try and repair it so that's
the point is that you want the body to
come back and try and repair some of the
stuff that it left because if you have
scars chances are is that the body
didn't send everything that it could up
there to heal itself so it's just
something to think about it kind of
makes sense if you think about it
injuring yourself to get better results
like those pitted acne scars it's kind
of like your body forgot to go and
repair them so it's kind of awesome that
you can kind of re-enter yourself and
then it comes back and it will help even
more hopefully so um you can use this
once a week do not use it more than once
a week on when you start out I believe
you can use it a couple of times a week
but I don't recommend that for people
with sensitive skin it was just what my
dermatologist told me I could do and
yeah so anyway highly recommend the
derma roller and the last and fifth
product on my must have beauty tools is
where is it
it's a razor and I'm sorry I'm actually
out of the cartridge that's like the
main part of this that's the only reason
I like this thing beside the size so
this is the razor this is the
intuition razor I saw this about four
months ago at target with my boyfriend
and I said look at the size of that
razor that thing is huge and I just
thought wow that must really take a lot
of hairs at once you know what I mean
and what I thought was really cool was
that it had these two like bubbles on
the side of the blades so I think it has
three or four blades maybe five just a
standard razor but on the sides it has
this like creamy formula that's supposed
to help moisturize and also be a
two-in-one built-in shaving cream I am
somebody personally who shaves my whole
entire body every other day yes I shaved
my arms I take everything i just don't
like hair on my body I don't know what
it is but some people are like that some
people are not even in the winter time I
can't let like my leg hair grow out
everything has to every other night OCD
but anyway so um I was getting really
sick of having to go and lather shaving
cream on the particular shaving cream i
was using was one that i had to squeeze
out because i just i don't know i really
liked it but it just took so much time
and I was like so when I saw this at
Target and picked it up and I used to
that night oh my god I shaved my whole
body from head to toe in probably three
or four minutes which is awesome it
never takes that's like short amount of
time okay it takes forever so I was
really really happy that this works so
well it doesn't irritate like my
underarms or anything it doesn't
irritate anywhere on my skin it really
is moisturizing the built-in cartridges
are really nice they come a different
sense the only thing I will say is that
it doesn't foam up so you can't see
where it is like on your body however
because it takes up so much space like
if people like this you know like that's
taking up a lot of the arms so you don't
really have to worry about like spots
that you might have missed this is not
going to miss anything so anyway I'm
sorry I don't have the cartridges I have
to actually go out and get those which
I'm bummed about because this is that is
the most expensive part of this tool the
cartridges
get like six of them for like fifteen
dollars I know it sounds horrible and
yes shaving cream is much cheaper or
conditioner you know whatever you want
to use but for me personally I don't
like spending tons and tons of time in
the shower in the bathtub yes but in the
shower no so it's worth it for me I'm
just one of those people and like I said
if you shades every other day or even
every day you're gonna you're going to
thank me for picking one of these that
because shaving cream my god it takes a
lot of time you never notice until you
get something that's better so
absolutely love this I never get any
irritation no red marks no nothing and
it's been great the blade is really nice
and sharp and I just love it so anyway
those were my must have beauty tools
that total not to be five I didn't know
it was going to be five I was just going
to pick my top picks I cannot live
without those these have made my life
easier they have made just things go
quicker like that razor and then the
clarisonic has just helped my skin so
much the derma roller and that little
cuttie I thing forget about it I would
not show my feet in public if I couldn't
use that so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did please
give this a thumbs up and I'll see you
my next one fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
