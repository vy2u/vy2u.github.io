this video I'm gonna be sharing with you
guys my must-have beauty tools if you
hear the wind it is really loud here
right now and I live in a really big
building and everything starts making
noise in the wind against like the
windows so I did open the door a little
bit 85 degrees here in Manhattan really
hot so if you hear like gusts of wind
blowing through that's why I live in a
high-rise and it happens it starts like
a really shrill horrible sound it's
actually scary I don't like it anyway
but like I said this video is going to
be a must-have beauty tools so um or my
must-have beauty tools I have a lot of
beauty tools and I think that a lot of
them are not necessary but a lot of them
I just like to have so I have like a
foot bath I have like warming mitts for
my hands that vibrate and like heat them
up I have you know tweezers all that
kind of stuff basic stuff and then I
have you know face brushes certain
things I've tried a lot of stuff and I
threw everything on my bed last night
and it total out to be 18 different kind
of beauty products and I think some of
them are definitely worth the hype and I
just wanted to pick out the ones that I
really don't feel like I could live
without if that makes sense like the
ones I've use on a daily or weekly basis
and that totaled out to be 5 products so
I'm gonna show you guys in this video
those five products I'm gonna talk about
them explain what they are and explain
why you guys should probably look into
that if you want it anyway so let's get
started the first thing I want to talk
about is the Clarisonic this one happens
to be the clarisonic mia it's bright
pink I love it it's adorable
and basically the Clarisonic is from the
makers of the Sonicare toothbrush which
I also have they came out with this many
many years ago and basically they have
tons of different varieties that you can
choose from different sizes different
settings stuff like that and it's
basically just a face brush to use when
you're cleansing your face you can use
it in the morning and at night or you
can use it only in the morning or only
at night or maybe even just a couple
times a week it really really exfoliates
really well and it basically makes the
cleanser that you're using penetrate
into your skin I think like eight times
more
that normally would with just your
fingers so um on the website on the
Clarisonic website they have all these
like studies that they did about why
this is so much better than cleansing
with your hands um I will say right away
I got this when it came out many many
years ago I think I was like 14 I asked
her for Christmas my mom got me and her
her and I both the Clarisonic Pro and
that was like the big chunky one that
had like four or five different settings
and that lasted me until last year it
actually broke last year and I went into
Sephora and I knew exactly what I wanted
to get I wanted to get the Mia this is
the one that only has one setting
however I specifically chose it for a
reason because I found that when I had
like my Clarisonic Pro the settings did
not matter what really matters about
like the cleansing is the brush so I
have tried a lot of different brushes
from the Clarisonic line I started with
a sensitive skin one I also have tried
the normal skin line both of those were
just okay I have tried the delicate one
that one was really nice and then I
recently or I guess less in the past
couple of years I fell in love with the
deep pore cleansing one which was like
really nice long bristles most of them
are really short bristles but this one
was really nice and long and it really
got like into my pores and I just
noticed my skin cleared up so much and
um
I kind of started getting away from my
Clarisonic maybe in the past couple of
months I was thinking like I don't know
it just felt like it was that extra step
at nighttime that just like I don't know
I was getting to bed late I was tired
and I just didn't want to do the one
step which was kind of stupid I ended up
picking up another beauty tool that I'm
gonna show you guys next it's one of
these sponges from bozhe that's gonna be
another one of my must-haves but um I
picked that up because I thought well
I'll just do like a change of pace and
I'll do every other night so I'll do the
Bulge of sponge and the Clarisonic and
let me tell you my skin started breaking
out like crazy and I realized that my
skin is very used to the Clarisonic and
very used to the amount of exfoliation
that I get every single night when using
this and so I went back to using this
every city
all night and I use the bosha sponge in
the morning so anyway long story short I
love this I would say it's very very
important that you don't need to pick
just so you guys know you don't need to
pick up like the higher quality or like
the bigger one is first of all their
heart to store these are awesome 2-pack
the Mia and the Mia two are great you
can get them for 99 dollars at Sephora
and you can even get like cleansers and
the stuff that comes with it it's a
great deal and I just want to say if
you're going to splurge which I think
you should you should try the different
brush heads I really don't think the
actual model of the Clarisonic makes a
difference I think it's just it feels
like it's vibrating more in your hand
but I don't think the actual level they
go back and forth the Sonicare system
goes like this their toothbrushes and
their cleansing facial whatever this is
what are you a social brush um they go
back and forth and so just like up and
down so it really gets into the pores
but I actually think that it's just like
it feels like it's doing more in your
hand but that's because I got the
battery and everything in here so in my
personal opinion you only need the one
with the one setting however I'm going
to say that this brush head that I
recently got this I have had this
probably since January it came out in
January this is their new luxe line the
lu x ii and let me tell you oh my god
this feels like buttery silk i got one
for me and one for my boyfriend one for
my mom my mom did not like it she felt
that it did not exfoliate her skin
enough um however my boyfriend might
love this this is amazing at nighttime I
use acne cleansers so I knew something
either with salicylic acid benzoyl
peroxide or tea tree in it and that can
be very drying to the skin and I was
noticing kind of when I was getting away
from my Clarisonic for that you know
time I was noticing I was getting very
very red and raw after I had used the
Clarisonic and like ten percent benzoyl
peroxide which is totally normal but it
was just too much it was over
exfoliating my face and I blame it on
the brush so the minute I got this one
everything changed and it's just so
silky and smooth and it really moves the
product around nicely you just want to
really hit your skin delicately don't
push in like this that's not going to do
anything you really want it just hit the
top of the bristles so just really
lightly all over your face and it'll
beep and let you know when it's over you
just go all over your whole face you can
either put the cleanser on top or put
your cleanse around first and then go
over I recommend putting the cleanser on
because it will save you so much product
because this really will make it lather
up but anyway so I love the Clarisonic
this has been a huge part of my skincare
regimen for years and years and years
now but I realized that you don't need
to get the expensive one to get the
quality that you know it's all about
they're all waterproof you can keep them
in the shower but let me tell you that
Clarisonic Pro keep is here that wind
that Clarisonic Pro in the shower that
thing is huge you don't want to travel
with that I dare definitely recommend
getting the Mia or the me of two and
going and splurging on one of these luxe
brush heads which are about $40 maybe
even 60 however um
if you clean them off after you like
after you are doing your face in the
shower I always feel like this and I let
it run the water run and I make sure
that the brush is really really really
clean and then I make sure that I store
it in the shower rack so that it drives
really well so I don't actually change
my head every single or every three
months I do it like every six months and
that's work for me
but anyway so I love the Clarisonic
highly recommend if you guys have it's
really perfect for everybody I'm not
even gonna hit the point it's great for
anti-aging it's great for just a deep
cleansing depending on what kind of skin
you have you can find a brush head that
matches but I really recommend the lux
brush heads like I said they are around
forty to sixty dollars and the other
ones you can get like two for forty or
maybe they're like twenty-five dollars a
piece I think however I have just found
I have the most benefit from this
particular brush head and it has
something to do with the model of the
actual Clarisonic so don't splurge on
the actual model just pick up the you
know it's a little cheap one it's cute
it's tiny its compact it's great for
travel and it doesn't take up a lot of
space in the shower all right moving on
second product this little sponge so I
hauled this
maybe about three weeks ago and like I
said you know what I was just talking
about the Clarisonic I was just not
getting a lot out of my flowers nah I
mean it wasn't that I wasn't getting a
lot of it I was just getting tired and I
just felt like I was getting weird skin
issues if I use it one day and not not
the next and that's when I realized I
have to use it every single day because
I'm used to that
mechanical exfoliation but I thought I'd
trade it off with this fudge so I used
this and it was fine but then I realized
that you know I need my Clarisonic every
day so I started using this in the
morning and I loved it so this is the
bullsháá what is it called cognac or
Concha KO njaa see I don't know how to
say that home jack long jack probably
not something like that it is basically
just like this spongy material it comes
in this little case and it's like hard
to the touch it feels like a little rock
but the minute you put it under warm
water it just like cushions up and it's
so soft it's very very porous as you
guys can see and I love using this with
my scrubs in the morning I knew scrubs
on my face in the morning so I will take
my scrub just put a little bit on here
and this lathers up so beautifully and
now they do have three different types
they have this one which is the I
believe red clay which is actually
hydrating and I have combination skin
but like I said I tend to use scrubs
that has salicylic acid in them and
cleansers that have you know acne
ingredients in them so it doesn't really
dry out and irritate your skin so I
thought uh whatever I'll pick up the
hydrating one I love it
it absolutely every time I use I'm using
a st. I scrub right now when I use it
with my hands and I get all the shower
it feels dry like my skin feels a little
like oh it took too much oil out of my
face you know however when I use it with
this it feels soft and it feels like oh
my god it's so windy look at my building
is tipping over anyway it feels so good
when I use this it doesn't feel tight it
feels just great so I love the hydrating
one they do have a green tea one which
is for oily skin and then they have a
normal skin one but I recommend checking
out the hydrate
but like I said it's just super porous
it just is great because you don't have
to use nearly as much product it saves
you money because you only have to use a
tiny little bit and basically you just
rub it all over and then you go in with
the water and you keep kind of lathering
and it still works with scrubs which the
st. Ives scrub I'm using right now the
green tea one is very very filled with
grainy particles of exfoliator
so I'm amazed that it really lathers up
nicely with this so absolutely love this
sponge I highly recommend and I would
say if you cannot afford the Clarisonic
or if you don't even want to try and you
just start like it's too expensive it's
not my thing definitely go and check out
these Fuji Agricole KO njaa see konjac
sponges from bozhe you can find those on
the website and also can store I believe
that was like 14 dollars so really good
deal all right moving on my third
favorite or yes favorite must-have
beauty tool is this Revlon pedi egg same
so there's this one that sells
everywhere that's like petty egg that's
been on like infomercials and stuff I
tried that I did not like it
this is better this is the Revlon one
it's called you know I think it's Revlon
pedi egg or something like that and
basically it opens up and you get this
little part here and then you get this
part and this for your feet I have a
thing about like getting calluses off my
feet my feet tend to get like rough and
I don't like that so every other night I
use this and what I do is I scrub scrub
scrub on my heels on my toes everywhere
on my feet I step for the really soft
parts because this is a little rough
it's kind of like a cheese grater and it
just it's like a cheese grater
it just grapes off the dead skin cells
and it actually has this little lid so
when you're scraping you don't have to
do it over the trashcan or toilet or
something it actually fills up inside
here and then you can just dump it out
later
so I love that I think it's really quick
and easy and nice and it keeps my feet
really really nice and soft I always
thought that it was my foot creams that
we're keeping my feet really soft but I
definitely think it's this so what I do
is I use that like I said every other
night they also
this like thing right here where you
think kind of like polish your heels if
you want I don't use it but I just love
this part but um I've had this for years
and years and years I'll be like five
years and I absolutely love it like I
said I've used it every other night and
then I put on a foot lotion or a foot
cream and then I cover my feet and socks
and in the morning my feet are so soft
and they just look nice they look pretty
they don't look rough and yucky in the
summer time because all our feet will be
out during the summer they just look
really great and I'm very very happy
with this product so love that all right
number four right what's happening okay
number four is the derma roller this is
a micro needling system for your skin so
it can be used anywhere on your body
that has skin uh-huh
don't use it like on your eyeballs or
anything basically it is a set of tiny
tiny little micro needles you can see
there and I realize oh my god the wind
I'm so sorry you guys hold on one second
okay I closed that door it was so loud
I'm really sorry
anyway so yes I realize this is not
everybody's cup of tea these are little
needles that you are rubbing on your
face I realized that a lot of people are
like I'm not doing that however if you
have acne scars or stretch marks or
cellulite this is supposed to be really
really good and I say supposed to be
because I have not tried it on cellulite
and stretch marks yet which I do have
and I probably will try however I've
been using this religiously once a week
for my acne scars I had a bad cystic
acne breakout in high school all around
my jaw it was hormonal related and I
ended up going on birth control and it
completely cleared everything up that I
was left with acne scars really really
dark red marks that are now still purple
on my skin however I was left with a few
pitted acne scars which is where it
actually has like an indent in the skin
and it is not pretty it looks bad you
know it's textured you can tell and let
me tell you guys since I've been using
this
this has dramatically cleared up the
pitted acne scars that's crazy
usually you have to get like plastic
surgery for that kind of thing literally
it's like indents in your skin and it's
just amazing to me that this has helped
so much so basically the concept of this
so windy so the kind sorry so the
concept of this is that you are damaging
your skin and your skin needs to rush
the surface and push out you know like
red blood cells and collagen and just
push forward good ingredients so that it
can prepare itself so you are rubbing
these micro needles all over your face
and you do this once a week only because
anything that you put on your skin after
using this for a week it's going to
deeply penetrate the skin because you
are making small little tiny holes in
your face okay it's kind of yucky um you
look really red and beaten up after but
it really really works you want to
follow up with a really nice moisturizer
after nothing else no harsh ingredients
try and not wear makeup the next day
just be really really careful um so
basically like I said you really have to
kind of roll it on your skin and it does
feel uncomfortable I believe there are
numbing creams you can get I'm a pretty
high pain tolerance so I don't mind it
but a lot of people do say like oh my
god it really really hurts so that's
something to think about they have
different sizes that you can get they
recommend you start out with the 1.0 mm
yeah and they also go up to I believe
like 3.0 which are like longer needles
and that's for really really deep like
going way down into the bottom layers of
your skin and you need to work your way
up so I'm on the 1.0 I you can even get
the I think point 5 start with that I
started with the 1.0 I did have some
issues at the beginning my skin was just
looking even more blotchy however like a
week later it's just like some of these
pitted acne scars started going away and
I noticed because the problem with like
makeup kind of stuff is you can cover
color like I still have the little
purple marks from the acne scars however
you cannot cover texture and when you
have little indents in the skin that's a
very noticeable so I'm so happy to say
that this has really actually
helped that I really did not know there
was even a way to clear that up unless
you wanted to get plastic surgery
because when you have an indent in the
face you have an indent in the face like
that's how it is however this has really
really helped and I'm absolutely amazed
you need to be really careful with this
you need to absolutely clean it and stay
on top of it these are needles they are
going into your skin they are pulling
out crap as they go okay so you don't
know what's all all up in the deep
layers of your skin so you need to soak
this in rubbing alcohol or what's called
a super powerful it's a problem that
alcohol 15 minutes before you use it and
then after you use it for 45 minutes and
then you want to let it air dry I got
mine on Amazon for I believe like
fourteen dollars really really good deal
it was a really good big deal I was
happy um and like I said start out with
the smaller sized needles and just work
your way up I don't notice any
anti-aging benefits from this I think my
Clarisonic helps keep away fine lines
better than this does but people do say
it helps with that I don't see that
however if you have acne scars
absolutely try it out again I'll just
tell you guys so basically you are
rubbing the needles on your face you're
injuring yourself so that your body says
oh my god no no no no no and rushes you
know red blood cells and collagen to the
surface to try and repair it so that's
the point is that you want the body to
come back and try and repair some of the
stuff that it left because if you have
scars chances are is that the body
didn't send everything that it could up
there to heal itself so it's just
something to think about it kind of
makes sense if you think about it
injuring yourself to get better results
like those pitted acne scars it's kind
of like your body forgot to go and
repair them so it's kind of awesome that
you can kind of re injure yourself and
then it comes back and it will help even
more hopefully so you can use this once
a week do not use them more than once a
week when you start out I believe you
can use it a couple of times a week but
I don't recommend that for people with
sensitive skin it was just what my
dermatologist told me I could do yeah
yeah so anyway highly recommend the
derma roller and the last and fifth
product on
my must-have beauty tools is where is it
it's a razor and I'm sorry I'm actually
out of the cartridge that's like the
main part of this that's the only reason
I like this thing
besides the size so this is a razor this
is the Schick intuition razor I saw this
about four months ago at Target with my
boyfriend and I said look at the size of
that razor that thing is huge
and I just thought wow that must really
take a lot of hairs at once you know
what I mean
and what I thought was really cool was
that it had these two like bubbles on
the side of the blades so I think it has
three or four blades maybe five just a
standard racer but on the sides it has
this like creamy formula that's supposed
to help moisturize and also be a
two-in-one built-in shaving cream I am
somebody personally who shaves my whole
entire body every other day yes I shaved
my arms I shave everything I just don't
like hair on my back I don't know what
it is but some people are like that some
people are not even in the wintertime
I can't let like my leg hair grow out
everything has to every other night OCD
but anyway so um I was getting really
sick of having to go and lather shaving
cream on the particular shaving cream I
was using was one that I had to squeeze
out because I just I don't know I really
liked it but it just took so much time
and I was like so when I saw this at
Target and picked it up and I used it
that night oh my god I shaved my whole
body from head to toe in probably three
or four minutes which is awesome it
never takes that's like short amount of
time okay it takes forever so I was
really really happy that this works so
well it doesn't irritate like my
underarms or anything it doesn't
irritate anywhere on my skin it really
is moisturizing the built-in cartridges
are really nice they come in different
scents the only thing I will say is that
it doesn't foam up so you can't see
where it is like on your body however
because it takes up so much space like
if people like this you know like that's
taking up a lot of the arms so you don't
really have to worry about like spots
that you might have missed this is not
gonna miss anything
so anyway I'm sorry I don't have the
cartridges I have to actually go out and
get those which I'm bummed about because
this is that is the most
expensive part of this tool the
cartridges you get like six of them for
like $15 I know it sounds horrible and
yes shaving cream is much cheaper or
conditioner you know whatever you want
to use but for me personally I don't
like spending tons and tons of time in
the shower in the bathtub
yes but in the shower No so it's worth
it for me I'm just one of those people
and like I said if you shades every
other day or even every day you're gonna
you're gonna thank me for picking one of
these that because shaving cream my god
it takes a lot of time you never notice
until you get something that's better so
absolutely love this I never get any
irritation no red marks no nothing and
it's been great the blade is really nice
and sharp and I just love it
so anyway those were my must-have beauty
tools that totaled out to be 5 I didn't
know it was gonna be 5 I was just gonna
pick my topics I cannot live without
those these have made my life easier
they have made just things go quicker
like that razor and then the Clarisonic
has just helped my skin so much the
derma roller and that little cutty egg
thing forget about it I would not show
my feet in public if I couldn't use that
so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did please give this a
thumbs up and I'll see you my next one
fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
