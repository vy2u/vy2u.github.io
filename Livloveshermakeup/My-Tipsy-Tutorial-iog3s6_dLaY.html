routine drunk but is some drunk shopping
like when I got a Sephora when I was
drunk but you guys were like no we want
you to be actual a drunk because y'all

petty bitches okay so I'm just wait
being makeup all over my face I'm gonna
start it with Izzie dr. Brandt pores no
more illuminizer primer so I think I got
this in a boxy charm that box each I'm
supposed to be cruelty free I don't
think that dr. Brandt is cruelty free
boxycharm okay I'm I set up my little
mirror here okay you know I'll just go
like this is fine I'm just gonna kind of
put that blended that primer really
really good I'm actually kind of proud
of myself because that was like a lot so
I'm gonna go ahead and foundation I'm
going to use this bitch Brown right here

outside boy I'm trying to use them up
he's the 50 shades of white with
a peach undertone Amazonian clay full
coverage airbrush foundation so I'm
gonna go again with the this guy nope

this tart brush I'm just endorsing the
 out of you right now tart oh my god
I just love you so much I just love you
so if you guys didn't know I am
boycotting
it's actually like a weird thing
actually looks like a like a lump or
something why am i I thought she's all
stuck together so I I would say that
that primer is like a 2 out of 5 you
know it left me shiny but I did use a
lot and yeah so I'm going ahead and I'm
gonna play this in circular motions I
can do it it's okay I got work a really
good day like all the teachers so we're
all like you know crying a bathroom how
kids are cooking their lunch you know
that kids are like drooling on you and I
can have germs everywhere in it there's
here isn't like your dearest life that's
what it's like being a teacher some days
some days it's amazing and it's just
it's so rewarding and other days it's
like yeah I'm gonna go cry so I think we
all kind of had that day today so that
is why we all went out to drink so if
the Dean of my school sees this just
know the whole department was with me
that's right now I'm taking it bitches
down with me alright so I'm just
blending this and it looks I mean it
looks
Oh patchy you know well patchy honey um

much I should probably do my eyes so I
have this mmm eat a makeup corrector I'm
just gonna put this on my eyeballs or
not like on miles but under you know Oh

he can just blend this all out in one
fell swoop

at me yell at you live you know did I

powder and then went in with cream and
now that I'm all blended I'm gonna go in
with the NYC bronzing blush and I'm
gonna use the wet and wild brush

herself and yoga gear and she got a nice
tight ass and like you got from my
