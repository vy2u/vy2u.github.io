thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day i'm
here to share well i'm going to give you
guys my top four favorite winter candles
i am an avid campbell collector you guys
know that i love Yankee Candle Bath and
Body Works candles I love Chesapeake Bay
candles I just love candles I'm big on
sense and if you guys watch my empties
videos you probably have seen me go
through like a bajillion three wick
hands the list her bath and body works
so i really really love candles i did a
video like this it was my favorite fall
candles and I went through and I chose
out my favorite winter candles and there
were 16 candles and I said no Olivia no
nobody wants to sit through a video of
you talking about 16 different candles
so I narrowed it down to the fore fore
fore fore favorite candles I could just
not live without during the wintertime
um they are let's see here to our new
and two are like old like cult favorites
of mine so let's just get right into it
the first one I want to talk about is
the one that I would pick over all of
them if there was only one candle I
could have during the wintertime it
would be this one this is the back and
Body Works holiday traditions tis the
season 3 wick candle I love this candle
it literally smells like Christmas in a
candle my friend haley said that in one
of her videos and I was like that that
is the exact description of what this
cable is kind of smells like red
licorice it is a mix of let's see here
bright red apples freshly ground
cinnamon and deep green pine and it's
just so good it has such a nice throw
like the set throw will just fill up
your entire home it's amazing it's
wonderful and I love the color it really
reminds me of Christmas and it just
smells so unique and delicious so that
is my first favorite and it is the one
that I would purchase over and over and
over again and literally if I couldn't
have any of these candles that is the
one I would choose alright my second
favorite is a new one to me this year
and actually never would have picked up
this scent I actually
this during black friday Bath and Body
Works was having this thing where if you
typed in a code you could get a big bag
that was filled with all these goodies
for twenty dollars and this candle was
in there and this is the spiced apple
toddy three wood candle and it says it
is a sweet mixture of winter fruits
apple brandy and spiced plum that will
warm up your winter celebrations and it
smells so darn good it just kind of
smells like cider it's a very very warm
scent and it reminds me a little bit of
tis the season but it just has a lovely
lovely warm scent it's definitely a
little more of a mild candle so if you
don't like a huge sent throw this one is
a little more mild I like to burn this
in my guest bathroom it's just a lovely
lovely scent and it definitely has been
a favorite um this season alright moving
on the third one I want to talk about is
also from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works another
through with candle this is for the
people that love like a how do I
describe it a more masculine sort of
sense we have this burning in our
bedroom right now and my boyfriend
really likes it a lot this smells like a
sexy man it's very similar to mahogany
teak wood and also what's that other one
that they come out with this time of
year sparkling icicles which is a really
really fantastic sent I almost picked
that one but this one I like more this
is New York black tie and it says the
perfect date for any night in the big
city it's green sage sandalwood and
tonka bean and this is new to me this
year i think this is actually new this
year in general they've never released
this one before but it smells amazing it
literally is like mahogany teak wood and
sparkling icicles combined together into
a candle it just smells like a sexy man
and it kind of has like a sexy man color
to it it's grey so if you want to put it
in your boyfriend's like office or
something he probably wouldn't mind
because it really really does smell good
and the centro is ridiculous like if you
put this in little literally your
kitchen you will smell it all around the
entire like apartment or your entire
home it's really really crazy so I
absolutely love that one and then the
last one that I want to talk about is
from yankee candle and this is a
favorite and i believe it called
favorite from yankee candle this is the
vanilla icing candle this is probably
one of the sweeter sense that i love
during this time of year i usually get
like tons
tons of sweet scents during fall like I
love like you know pumpkin everything
and icing and all that kind of stuff so
by the time winter rolls around i'm kind
of like I'm over it but I cannot go
without this candle during the
wintertime it is so nice it smells just
like buttercream frosting and even
though it just has one wick it really
have a nice throw and i have to say
these yankee candles are pretty pricey i
only buys the bath and body works three
with candles when they are on sale for
half the price because i don't think
they're worth it for twenty dollars but
this I believe is twenty-nine
ninety-nine for this size but i have to
tell you Yankee Candles go and burn
forever and they have a very strong
throat even if they just have one wick
so I really really love this scent it's
amazing if you love buttercream like
vanilla scents you will absolutely love
this one so that is my last favorite I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I will
be putting up a review on it the new oh
my gosh i'll skip this right now i will
be putting up a review on the new
hourglass ambient strobe lighting
powders that what it's called strobing
powder that will be coming up next so if
you guys want to watch that then just
stay tuned on my channel and I will see
you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
