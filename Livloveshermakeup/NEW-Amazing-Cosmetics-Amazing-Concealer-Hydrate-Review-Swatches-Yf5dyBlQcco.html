review is going to be a really really
quick one on a new concealer that I
recently found on the alta comm website
that I am in love with it is from
amazing cosmetics and it is their new
amazing cosmetics hydrate concealer
first of all look at this packaging do
you see this look at this it's like a
beautiful beautiful weighted pink color
like mirrored hot pink I love that I am
all about this if I were a concealer I
would be this one
anyway I absolutely love this I
purchased this for $32 on the Ulta calm
website it would link below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
it up if you were interested I didn't
know if you guys would be interested in
me doing a review on this product but I
did post a picture on Instagram and a
lot of you asked if I would so that is
why I'm here
so this is supposed to be a full
coverage longer and concealer that blurs
the imperfections on your face with a
vitamin rich formula that nourishes the
skin creating a natural skin like finish
they do you have let's see here one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
different shades and I love the shade
range from amazing cosmetics their shade
in ivory whether it be in their full
coverage concealer or what's the other
one that I tried there I think it was
called their perfecting stick which I
didn't really like but they're like
shade range is amazing the ivory shade
is actually I think two or three shades
lighter than my actual skin tone so I
can use it to highlight underneath my
eyes I love it it's amazing so this is
what the actual packaging looks like
like I said really really beautiful you
open it up and you get I believe 0.08
ounces a product in here which is not a
lot especially when you have a container
like this instead of a squeezy tube this
is more like a little lipstick thing but
this is amazing I mean the coverage is
beautiful it creates this really
luminous glow to your skin but it still
maintains like a full coverage effect it
covers everything and it is so blendable
and creamy here is the shade like I said
I do wear the shade ivory and it just
blends in like a dream I like to blend
this in with my Real Techniques sponge
and it just covers everything but
creates a luminous finish on the skin I
did see that they also relieve released
a illuminating concealer so I'm kind of
interested in that one as well but you
guys can see when I kind of turn it it's
got this luminous quality to it that
just maintains a ton of moist
are underneath your eyes it's really
nice for a pop spot couldn't see like
that conceal anything for a spot
concealing on any little areas where you
have blemishes as well I just think the
formula is absolutely absolutely
fantastic and I love the shade range so
this wears a really really long time
I was surprised I personally because
they do have combination skin I do need
to set it in with a powder and I highly
recommend for everybody unless you have
dry skin to really set it in with a
powder it does kind of change the finish
when you do go in with like a matte
powder but it really just maintains a
beautiful lustrous creamy moisturizing
consistency underneath your eyes or
anywhere that you apply it so it has a
very very long wear time as long as you
do a powder and I would say it lasts
anywhere from 8 to 12 hours which is
really good for a concealer I do not
have any creasing with this concealer
that is amazing because when I go
underneath my eyes with a really heavy
duty concealer creasing all over like
fine lines that I didn't know existed
are suddenly there and I'm like great
kidding me but at that so I love this
concealer I think it's beautiful
underneath the eyes I highly recommend
checking it out again you don't get tons
of products in here but I just think the
formulation is like an amazing amazing
I am a big like I'm very picky when it
comes to under eye concealers and
brighteners I really like my maybelline
instant age rewind and then I like a few
others but for the most part I've used
concealers for spot concealing this I
will put underneath my eyes it is
absolutely amazing
so anyway like I said I will leave a
link below where you guys can pick up
this product if you would like to you
really Rizzy and join this a lot and
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
