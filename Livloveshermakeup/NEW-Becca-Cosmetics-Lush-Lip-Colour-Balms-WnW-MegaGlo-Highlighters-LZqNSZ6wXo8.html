channel today I do have a review and
swatches for you guys on some new
products that recently released at Ulta
the first are the new a Becca lush lip
color balls I did purchase three of
these and then I did purchase at the
arrests of the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting a powder collection so I
have all six here just watch out for you
guys and give myself nine now I will say
I'm doing something tomorrow called
agloe down showdown which will be a
comparison of these next two high end
highlighters which I'm super excited
about as well as side by side swatches
of these against their limited edition
highlighters so if you want a comparison
video that will happen tomorrow but
today I wanted to give you guys my
thoughts really quickly on these I think
everybody should have one of these in
their collection they are
fantastic but anyway let's go ahead and
start with the DEF at left lip color
balls please do retail for $22 apiece
and you do get let's see here three
grams of product in here I believe yeah
three grams of product the outer
packaging looks a little something like
this kind of similar like hourglass
packaging I hate this color it's like a
poofy brown color I don't like it but
anyway that is what the label looks like
and it shows you the corresponding shade
the actual packaging is super keep super
super super cheap alert you guys see
this it is like acrylic packaging
reminds me of those like one dollar
lipsticks from ELF which honestly the
one dollar lipsticks from ELF are pretty
good but the packaging I just can't
now the first read I picked up is called
black violet this is what it looks like
unfortunately I will be returning this
one it is just extremely extremely
patchy on at my lips personally it means
I can see that I did pick up is called
almond spice and this one is really
beautiful I will be keeping this one and
you enjoy quite a bit it's sort of like
an in-between and muted pink of my lips
but better sort of shade and then the
last one I picked up is the one I
currently have on it's called a chai
creme and this is my favorite one I'm
usually not a nude kind of girl but this
is like the perfect nude I feel like
it's very neutral it looks a little more
cool to me in the packaging a little
more warm tone on the lips but still
have like a nice neutral thing going on
it's hard to explain but anyway let me
tell you guys kind of what I think about
these so I think that if you are going
to pick any of these up I would
definitely go with the lighter shades or
the more in between shades now when I
first saw that they released uh swatches
of the colors I would like all of them
look the same so of course I wanted to
go ahead and pick up a darker shade but
honestly I really regret picking up the
darker shade I just feel like because
these are so humectant and because they
are so
these actually have the pigmentation of
a lipstick but in balm form
unfortunately they just don't go on to
the lips gracefully they do move around
throughout the day you probably need a
lip liner if you do want to rock out the
darker shade so I am going to be going
ahead ever turning that black violet
shade but overall I would say they're
pretty good if you're very very picky
with your lip products like I am you
might want to scoop one or two of these
up I don't think the shades look exactly
different on as a list like the more in
between a lighter shade so I don't think
you need to pick up more than one or two
but I am happy with the almond quest
shade as well as the open faced shade as
well as the chai Khurana shade so like I
said super super cheap packaging
longevity is not that great on these
either but because they are more of a
balm I sort of expected that now they're
not horrible to the point where like you
apply it a forty-five minutes later
they're gone but I would say within an
hour they are gone off your lips and you
do have to reapply these really do with
fate very gracefully though which I
appreciate I do not like when I have a
darker color on my lips and it starts to
get all crazy all over the place and
doesn't fade evenly that is what happens
with the darker shades Olympics that if
you are going to pick one of them up I
would definitely go with a lighter shade
but overall they're pretty good you guys
very moisturizing very you message I
believe the first ingredient in here of
castor oil so they go on really nicely
and they are crazy pigmented so let me
go ahead and show you guys some swatches
here is the first shade like I said this
one is called a chai creme so that is
what the chai creme looks like really
really nice kind of in-between a nude
color and the next one that we do have
here is called a black of violet so this
is the one that I don't like like I said
it's super beautiful when you swatch it
and you would think like oh my gosh the
pigmentation of the shiny you know
beautiful finish on that I really really
want that but honestly these just do not
wear very well the darker shades look so
bad you do not get it and then finally
we do have the almond Kleist shade which
is just that beautiful midtone pink
color and I really like that as well
normally I'm not like a super super into
the kind of pinky pinky colors but I
really do like the two of these so yeah
overall I would just say that these are
quite nice if you don't want to spend
$22 I don't think you have to but I am
definitely a snob when it comes to lip
product so I am going to go ahead and
keep the two of those now as far as
being you and Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powders are concerned
honestly you need one of these in your
life you hear me these are cruelty free
they are beautiful and they retail for
$4.99 apiece $4.99 apiece they are that
gorgeous baked chalet formula and I have
to say you guys know I talk about
precious pedals a lot which is the one
that they first released along with this
guy which is called crown of my canopy
the four new sheets are identical in
formulation so if you are wondering if
they are the same they are pretty much
the same and now I will say there is one
in here that I feel like is a little
more on the chunky glittery side and
tomorrow when we do the glow down
showdown you guys will see it's pretty
much identical just repackaged from
their little hearts collection that they
did where they did the micro glow
highlighting powders and it was like a
little hard thing it's the same exact
thing just repackaged but yeah these are
really beautiful so the first one that
we have here like I said is precious
petals this is a gorgeous gorgeous rose
gold color would highly recommend it to
those to you who do you have more of
like a medium complexion these are
beautiful I really really enjoy going in
with my wet'n wild unicorn blush brush
Brad blush my brush and picking them up
I kind of swirl in there and tap off the
excess and then I just kind of go right
on cue of the cheekbones I really like
this brush because it is a little
slanted and I feel like you can apply it
almost like a fan brush normally I do
like something a little more densely
packed when it comes to a basin a
highlight cuz I really like to kind of
buff it into the skin but this has been
doing wonders with the highlighter so I
really would highly recommend picking
that up as well which is only about 3 99
or $4.99 on the ulta.com website so like
I said that is the first shade let me go
ahead and swatch it for you guys so here
it is this you've called precious petals
super super beautiful just has that
really really nice kind of rose gold
color to it the next one that we do have
here is crown of my canopy this was
another one that released the first time
so this is great for those of you with a
deeper complexion really really
beautiful kind of copper shade I like to
use this as a blush topper you guys know
blush toppers are a real thing if you do
have pale skin so I really do like this
I think it's absolutely stunning so
there it is swatched I feel like if you
do have a deeper complexion this would
look absolutely incredible on you now as
far as the newer shades are concerned
the first one we have here is called
blossom glow which is going to be
amazing for those of you who do have a
fair complexion this is an identical
dupe to the G or glowing gardens and
glowing pink which I will swatch out
tomorrow for you guys but
this is what it looks like it is so
gorgeous it is not like the
limited-edition one that has a little
heart in it too this one is a true
really really light pastel kind of pink
color with a white undertone it is
absolutely beautiful you guys I mean I
just love this formula I love how it
goes on and I love the pigmentation so
again more medium complexions would love
this one it deeper complexions of fair
complexions you're going to love that it
definitely has that coolish undertone so
if you're not eating to the cool tone
pink if that is okay because they're
going to hook you up with this pink
right here this one right here is called
botanic a dream and again very very
gorgeous so and this is what it looks
like now this one in my opinion is very
similar to the limited edition hearts
highlight that they had it got a little
bit of more of like a neutral pink color
not so much like a Becca's what is it
that goes rose quartz this one
definitely is a little more cool toned
but I have like this deepest sort of hue
to it so there is botanic dream and then
there is ah what is it cold
blossom glow so there is blossom glow
there is botanic dream if you were
wondering what the two of those look
like swatch together but like I said all
of these have the same formula you guys
are super creamy super pigmented super
beautiful on the skin and then we have
the one that I have on today which I'm
actually wearing a gold highlight today
this one is called golden flower crown
golden flower crown it is beautiful you
guys and I have it on I upside it with
me when I wear a brush like I said I
don't want to say go wash a brush and I
just kind of put it right onto the
cheeks I brought it down a little bit
onto the apples of my cheeks just
because I like to do that it is so
gorgeous so pigmented and I absolutely
love this color this is a true gold okay
a little bit of like a yellow undertone
going on in here but I think it is
absolutely stunning so let me go ahead
and swatch that on my other hand cuz I'm
running out of room so here is what
golden flower crown looks like
absolutely stunning so there it is there
are all of them so you guys can see and
then finally we have this purpley shade
now this is the one that I do find a
little chunky I feel like this is just
repackaged from the little heart ones
that they had it that were limited
edition I know a lot of people can still
find those in their Walgreens but this
one definitely has a little more grit to
it and I seem to notice that when it
does come to purpley and kind of like
blue tone to highlight
so I don't know if it's with a
formulation thing but this one
definitely does have a little kind of
like micro glitter in it it's still
beautiful and it's still wearable I
would recommend taking a little more of
a densely packed a brush when it comes
to this one but here it is switched so
yeah anyway guys those are all of them
swatch honestly go ahead and just take
your pick whatever you think will work
on your skin tone even if you want to
take this one and if you have like a
super deep complexion it would still
work even if you want to take this one
and you're super fair complected it
would still work as a blush topper I
think they are incredible very long
wearing dirt ignant adapt it and like I
said tomorrow we will be doing a
side-by-side swatch Beth again some
really high-end highlighters you guys
are going to be amazed at how well these
compared to some really luxurious
highlighter so anyway those are my
review and swatches on it those products
like I said I don't feel like the Becca
edge lip color balms are a necessity if
you're super picky about lip products
like I am maybe you want to pick one or
two up you do not need the whole
collection you do not need three or four
of them but as far as these highlighters
are concerned you could get all six of
them for like thirty dollars would
highly recommend you do so or you can go
ahead and just pick up whichever one you
think would be best for your skin tone
so I hope you enjoyed this video mister
members out in front of me so I'm going
to go play with them and yeah that's
pretty much it I will see you guys
tomorrow right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
