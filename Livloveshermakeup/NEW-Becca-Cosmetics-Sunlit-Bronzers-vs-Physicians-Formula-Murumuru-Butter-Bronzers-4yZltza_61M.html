my channel happy Tuesday today's video
is going to be a quick comparison on the
new Becca sunlit bronzers versus the
Physicians Formula
Muro Muro butter bronzers I can never
say that fast Muro Muro let's go ahead
and get some background information we
will start with the Physicians Formula
butter bronzers these do retail for
$14.99 apiece on the ultra calm website
you do get 11 grams of product in here
which is quite a lot they do have pretty
cute packaging they are quite heavily
fragrance so if you are not someone who
likes the sense of like suntan lotion
and mai tais and pina coladas and like
all that really really beachy kind of
thing you're not going to like this it
is definitely one of those bronzers
where I can smell it as I'm applying it
to my face so if you are sensitive to
fragrance you would probably not like it
now they only have two different shade
selections which really is a bummer but
they do have a little mirror at the
bottom as well as the sponge tip
applicator I have never tried this bunch
of applicator because I'm worried it's
gonna wipe my foundation off but
definitely let me know I just dropped it
definitely let me know down below if you
haven't tried it out so the first shade
that they do offer in the line is called
light bronzer this is what light bronzer
looks like and then they also do have
this shade right here which is called
bronzer this one right here is my
all-time favorite bronzer and I still
stand by that I love that the shade is
called bronzer and it is a bronzer this
one's a little more cool tone and a
little deeper in color all right as far
as the becca sunlit bronzers are
concerned this is what the outer
packaging looks like absolutely
beautiful I feel like there is no
comparison between the Physicians
Formula One's and these but there is
quite a difference as far as price is
concerned these only have 7.1 grams of
product in it and they are $38 apiece
which is very very pricy now they are
very beautiful if you guys can see they
do not have any fragrance to them so if
you are sensitive these would be a good
option for you they have a nice sized
mirror here and then they do have the
same sort of imprint on them as the
Physicians Formula One's do and this
particular shade right here which is
called Capri coast is the second to
lighter shade out of five different ones
that you can choose from and then I also
did get the lightest shade which I think
is beautiful this one is called Bali
Sands this is the one that I currently
have on my face and I feel like it's
very very similar to the light bronzer
shade from Physicians Formula
so overall which ones do I prefer I love
my Physicians Formula muru but
browsers there's just nothing that could
really compare to them even these Becca
ones I feel like they have a lot more
kick up they're a lot more powdery I
don't feel like they go onto the skin
nearly as nicely as my Physicians
Formula ones do but there's still like
second best I still think this Bali sand
shade is absolutely beautiful and I
think it's pretty similar to the new
hula light
I haven't actually gone and looked at
hula light but I did see a few photos of
this one and also the light bronzer
shade from Physicians Formula and hula
light next to each other so if you're
looking for a cruelty-free option for
hula light this one seems like it's very
very similar as well as the light
bronzer now my concern is the fact that
um you know these do have an overspray I
think nobody actually knows that because
when you are looking at the photos
online they seem like they have this
beautiful like it's kind of night at
your dustin's they just have this
beautiful sparkly thing going on and you
would think because it is Beca and
they're known for their shimmering skin
perfectors you would think that that
would be built through the whole entire
product now an overspray is one of those
things where you take your brush and you
kind of wipe off the top layer and you
are left with something completely
different all the way down to the deep
deep dark bottom of the pan you are left
with something completely different than
what you see on the top so after I went
in with my powder brush from Real
Techniques I noticed that you know what
there aren't little sparkles or shimmer
in here anymore what is going on so I
noticed that there wasn't overspray and
I usually associate an overspray with
being like a really really cheap product
I feel like cheap products are just ones
that have overspray I don't know why
that's always what I have thought in my
head it's not too bothers I'm probably
just gotten that product on my face it's
not too bothersome because you
definitely can just like wipe it off but
it's just one of those things where I do
feel like it's kind of false advertising
especially when you're spending $38 so
if you were hoping that these were going
to have shimmer in them they don't my
friend Sonora did get the deepest like
reddish shade which I can't remember
what it's called a link it down below
but she also said that one had overspray
so these actually have a more satin or
Demi matte appearance on the skin which
is pretty much identical to the
Physicians Formula but in my opinion you
guys I just think the Physicians Formula
ones are better now obviously this has
more shade selection so if you do have a
medium or deep complexion these are
going to be better for you because the
Physicians Formula might not show up on
you but overall I think if you already
have these ones you definitely don't
need the other so let's go ahead and
swatch them out the first day that I am
going
Squatch is the light bronzer shade from
the physician's formula and this is
really beautiful like I said I feel like
these are so much softer and creamier
than the becca ones I don't know if I
said that yet but they really feel
smooth they're buildable on the skin and
to the touch they just feel so silky so
there is the shade light bronzer and I
will go ahead and swatch right
underneath that the shade Bali sands and
I just love this one as well they're
very very similar they may not look
identical when you hold them next to
each other but they're very similar on
this Gannet
now this kind of Sheen that they do have
going on in here it's not anything that
is going to be noticeable that
noticeable on the skin now you can see
the Becca one definitely has just a
little more pigment than the Physicians
Formula but still very similar and they
both do have that nice glossy effect to
them alright let's go ahead and swatch
Capri Sam's now so here is a Becca's
Capri Sands this one's beautiful and it
is a little different than the bronzer
shade from Physicians Formula this one's
a little deeper it's got a really nice
level of pigmentation and I think if you
want to step it up a notch and you
really want to get a nice contour going
on or a nice bronzer that's a very very
kind of like out there and in your face
this would be great if you do have a
fair complexion and then we're going to
go ahead and swatch it the bronzer shade
which still remains like I said my
favorite bronzer of life I prefer this
out of every single bronzer I'm talking
about in this video it's just absolutely
gorgeous so there are all of them swatch
here we have physician's formula here is
Becca Capri coast here is Physicians
Formula wait did I say that right I
think without one I don't remember what
order I wanted you guys because they
honestly look so similar to each other
but this is what they look like I know
this one is Physicians Formula so here
we have light bronzer there is Bali sand
there's Capri coats and then there's the
bronzer shade it's really hard to tell
when you actually look at them because
they are so similar but I would say
overall I prefer the formula on the
Physicians Formula I think that if you
have a light enough complexion that you
can pull those colors off I think I
would absolutely go with those if you
already have them in your collection and
they work on your skin tone do not pick
any of the Beco ones up unless you're
just like a huge collector of bronzers
like I said I'm going to keep all of
them because I really do enjoy them but
for the most part I'm Way more drawn to
my Physicians Formula One's I just wish
they would open up a larger shade
selection so
hope you guys enjoyed this quick little
comparison thank you so much for joining
me definitely let me know down below
which ones you prefer and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
