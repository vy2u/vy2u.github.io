sorry camera went shaky but welcome back
to my channel thank you so much for
joining me as always I hope you guys are
having a fantastic day
in today's video we are reviewing and
swatching a new product to me a new
formula to me these are the new Bobbi
Brown highlighting powders and I picked
up one of them out of three of the new
ones that they have these do retail for
46 dollars apiece on these sephora.com
website which is quite pricey if I was
going to go ahead and purchase all three
I would be spending probably about $150
so because I'm not familiar with this
particular formulation I only picked up
one and if you guys are curious the
shade that I picked up is called
afternoon glow which is a beautiful rose
gold so anyway these are 46 dollars
apiece no where on the website on the
support website at least does it say
that these arcs like an exclusive
Sephora offer or that they are limited
edition so it doesn't look like they are
permanent and the three shades that you
can pick from our absolutely stunning I
did pick the lightest one which is
afternoon glow they also have sunset
glow which is like a deep grapefruit
color almost like I don't know how to
explain it it's like a pinky grapefruit
color and then they also have the shade
teller ID and teller ID is a beautiful
kind of moppy plummy highlighter it's
really really pretty
you do get 0.28 ounces of product in
here or eight grams is that equivalent
to eight grams I believe so yes eight
grams and you know these are supposed to
be a light reflecting powder that gives
a high impact light reflective glow
these are a baked Jala formulation if
you guys have been watching me for about
the past six months you know I've been
going crazy over Beit Jala highlighters
I love my laura geller baked gelato
swirl illuminators I love the Dior
glowing gardens highlight I think bake
Chalet formulations are absolutely
beautiful as long as you apply them the
right way so anyway and this is what the
outer packaging looks like just typical
Bobbi Brown nice sleek black packaging I
am not too familiar with Bobbi Brown
makeup items I love her skincare items I
love her extra pair I cream her night
cream I like her extra enriched face
face a lot of her items that I have are
actually skincare related like her
clarifying oil and things like that but
I'm super excited to try out some of her
makeup items and I am
liking this product so far so anyway
just a beautiful sleek little box like
that it does say afternoon glow at the
top and then the actual packaging looks
like this so this is actually special
from what I was looking at on the
website the original highlighting
powders the outer packaging just looks
like this but this one says a Bobbi
Brown in rose gold and I think it's
really beautiful so this is acrylic or
plastic you do have a little push button
here and when you open it you get a
huge-ass mirror and I love having
mirrors for highlighter I love having
mirrors for blushes like everything I
think a mirror should come with
everything honestly as long as it
doesn't disrupt the packaging and make
it too bulky I think having a mirror is
absolutely fantastic so when you open it
up this is what it looks like you have
this nice mirrored rose gold plating all
around the actual product and then there
is the actual highlighter so like I said
this particular shade afternoon glow on
the website when I was looking at it on
the desktop it looked a very golden and
I was like okay it's gonna be like a
golden champagne highlight and then when
I look at it on my phone it looks a
little more rose gold and in person I
really do feel like this is a rose gold
product I do have it on my cheekbones
today down the bridge of my nose and
also on my chin and my what's this
called
yes Cupid's bow and I do think this is a
beautiful beautiful color it is darker
than my skin tone but I still think it
gives a really gorgeous reflective kind
of high shine high-impact foil to look
to the cheeks it's absolutely stunning
and I really really like this color I
think it's beautiful now because it is a
baked jewel a formulation I should have
been a little smarter and known not to
go in with a first of all dirty finger
or an oily finger or a wet brush or
anything like that because the minute
you do that with a product that is a
baked still a formulation or anything
that is firmly pressed you're going to
get a little bit of hard pan and I
immediately got some hard pan when I dip
my brush in here I was way too eager I
went in with my luck see 522 tapered
highlighter brush it was still damp and
you guys can see probably that there is
a little bit of hard pan there already
now hard pan is easy to remove with duct
tape I will be doing a review a review
on Hardman know I hate
am i will be doing a tutorial or a demo
on how to get rid of hard pan that is on
my list don't worry it's coming soon but
yes I did get a little bit of hard pan
and like instantly basically and I'm a
little disappointed that that happened
because I know better especially with
like a big delay formulation anytime you
have a powder that is firmly pressed
together or firmly packed you're going
to get that so anyway that's the really
my only complaint with this you guys I
think the formulation is absolutely
beautiful it does remind me a lot of the
glowing gardens from Dior that beautiful
beautiful baked chalet highlighter
that's no longer available so I didn't
want to show it but it also reminds me a
lot of the laura geller
baked gelato swirl illuminators you get
the same sort of high shine impact
you're getting the same sort of
pigmentation these highlighters are
beautiful or at least this one is
beautiful because it really does give a
gorgeous like foiled appearance to the
skin and I love that I like for my face
to look like I'm wet like sweaty and
dripping dripping in sweat I don't like
when highlighters are too powdery or too
glittery and they start to emphasize my
fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes
or my pores I don't feel like big delay
formulations really do that which is why
I'm so obsessed with them so overall I
think the packaging is beautiful I think
the price is quite high for this so if
you are looking for a baked chalet sort
of highlight and you really want to
experience that beautiful foiled nasaan
your cheekbones I would recommend
checking out the baked gelato swirl
illuminators from laura geller first
just because those are I think twenty
six dollars apiece you do not get as
much product in them however I think
they're a nice way to kind of try out
the formula and see if you like that
kind of formula but overall these are
very buttery very very smooth my
favorite way to apply them is definitely
with some sort of a buffing brush so
this one right here is the lux II 512
small contouring brush again it's not a
highlighting brush but what I like about
this is it is quite dense and it is
completely even at the top any time I'm
working with some sort of baked chalet
formulation I like to buff it into my
skin because if you're not buffing it in
I swear to you it will just sit on top
of your cheekbones and nobody wants a
highlight that just sits on the skin you
really want it to look like you're
glowing from within or at least I
personally do so I really like to use a
brush that is completely even and I can
like buff in circular motions but you
definitely could use
some sort of a tapered highlighter brush
again I did go in the first time with
the Alexi 5:22 tapered highlighter I
didn't like the way it looked I didn't
feel like it picked up the product very
nicely and even if I was really kind of
buffing it in circular motions because
these brushes are tapered towards the
top I feel like it's just not
distributing it just Trevor tuning
distributing the product evenly onto my
cheeks so the same thing goes for the
Sigma tapered brush just because it is
tapered at the top I don't feel like it
really really can get to the product in
there another good option is the elf
flawless concealer brush if you want a
little more precision and you really
want to just get it on a certain area
like right on your cheekbone instead of
bringing it down to the apple of your
cheek like I did today this is nice and
you definitely can buff it in circular
motions but overall I would say the Luxy
512 small contouring is the winner for
me any time I am using some sort of a
baked gelee of formulation so we're time
on this is extremely extremely strong I
feel like because they really have that
foiled look they really kind of adhere
to the skin nicely any sort of facial a
formulation which by the way I'm not
familiar with the Mac extra dimension
formulation but I did have someone tell
me that that's basically what they would
compare this product to the Mac extra
dimension formulation I don't know but
I'm guessing that is sort of like a big
shell a formulation as well I think
they're just incredibly pigmented very
buildable on the skin they never look
like they're emphasizing pores or
texture I think the only thing you have
to check out is to see if you have the
right sort of brushes to apply this and
also definitely check out the actual
colors to make sure that it's something
you're interested in like I said this
particular color which is called
afternoon glow is darker than my skin
and when I turned my head a certain way
in certain lights you can see that it is
darker so sometimes that looks a little
strange if it's on your cheekbone but
overall I'm just think it's beautiful
for the glow I think it's gorgeous and
the other two shades I definitely would
I definitely personally think I can't
speak I definitely personally think
would be way too dark for me I would
have to use them as like a blush topper
but I think that this is a pretty good I
don't know I feel like this is nice if
you do have fair to light skin tones but
for the most part
a little more selfed and right now I
feel like if you're super super fair
like if I wasn't self-tanning I'm not
quite sure this would look as natural on
me but anyway I think the formulation is
really beautiful very buttery and very
long wearing and let's go ahead and do
some swatches shall we so I am going to
go ahead and put my finger in there as
you guys can see it's just that
beautiful beautiful foiled look there's
no skipping there's no chunks of product
and the second you put it onto your hand
it just glides on like frickin butter so
there it is on the back of my hand
absolutely beautiful as you can see when
I turn it into like a certain light you
can see that it is darker but then when
I turn it the other way it's like boom
just glow so that's something to be
aware of I don't think that this
particularly like the three new shades I
don't think they're particularly
friendly for super super light skin
tones if you do have a deeper complexion
I think you're gonna love all three
shades but overall I do think that this
is a nice product for glowy skin I'm
going to go ahead and blend it out
really quickly on my hands you guys can
see and look how beautifully that blends
I mean it's just absolutely stunning so
yeah overall I think this is beautiful
very similar to other big Chalet
formulations that are on the market like
I said if you are unfamiliar with that
sort of formulation I would definitely
check out the laura geller ones first
those are absolutely beautiful I love
all of them I have all three of them
they're beautiful I would highly
recommend checking those out to see if
you like this sort of formulation but I
feel like anybody could really use these
whether you have oily skin dry skin
aging skin these really don't settle
into fine lines and wrinkles this
particular formulation and I think it's
just stunning on the skin if you do want
that really wet appearance so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys tomorrow at 6
p.m. for my review and swatches on the
new Kat Von D serpentina eyeshadow
palette bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
