this video I have a quick little review
and swatches for you guys on the new
Clinique uplighting illuminating powder
the shade that I picked up is called
zero one nude glow this is the outer
packaging this is a product that is
exclusively sold at Sephora it is new
and there are three different shades
that you can pick from
they are $27 a piece which is really
really good considering you are getting
nine point six grams of product in here
so there are three different shades the
first one is nude glow or on the website
they call it soft glow the second one is
called bronze glow and then the third is
called Amber glow and these are all
quite dark which is why I went with the
lightest shade and technically these are
supposed to be either setting powders or
illuminators on your skin however for me
personally this has turned into more of
a plush topper or a blush so if this is
a sheer multitasking powder that gives
it the skin a candlelit glow it says it
has soft focus pigments to flatter on
all skin types with a candlelight to
radiant glow you can wear it alone as a
finishing powder after your foundation
or as a highlighter only where you want
it it is free of parabens sulfates and
fatal AIDS and this project this product
project so this product is allergy
tested it is a hundred percent fragrance
free and it is ophthalmologist tested as
well so here is the outer packaging as
you guys can see like I said you're
getting a huge amount of product in here
0.33 ounces or 9.6 grams I would say
this standard highlighter or blush are
what around four to six grams you're
getting almost like ten grams of product
here which is crazy and the actual
packaging looks like this it's beautiful
just a mirrored effect of course you're
gonna get fingerprints on here but
really really pretty you have a little
push button here that opens it up if you
have a gorgeous big sized mirror and
then here is the actual color here is
nude glow so I was thinking that this
was going to be very similar to kind of
like the hourglass products like a
mixture of the hourglass ambient
lighting powders with these strobing
powders and I feel like that's exactly
what it is if you want a hybrid of the
ambient lighting powders and these
strobing powders this is probably the
product that you should pick up it's
really really beautiful as you guys can
see this nude glow shade or soft glow
which is the lightest shade out of all
three is definitely darker than my skin
I can't really highlight with this
it definitely just darkens up on my skin
however today I am wearing it underneath
the chart to Amazonian clay 16 hour
blush I'm sorry on top of the charts
Amazonian clay 16 hour blush in these
shades seduce and I just love the glow
I'm getting I did go in with my Tarte
exposed highlight right here but a lot
of this glow that you're seeing is a
mixture of this with the Tarte exposed
highlight I think it's just absolutely
beautiful I will say the actual texture
of it is very very soft but it's pressed
a little firmly so I do find that when
I'm putting it on my face and when I
pick it up on my finger I don't get any
sort of chunkiness or anything like that
but when I dip my brush in there I do
get a little bit of kick up which is
kind of strange because normally when
you do have a product that is a little
more firmly pressed you don't get kicked
up however I do notice a little bit of
kick up with this product so like it
says on the website this is basically
like a sheer beautiful sort of buildable
highlight powder whatever you want it to
be like I said this particular shade
which is the lightest out of all three
is definitely too dark for me to go
ahead and set my foundation with it's
just too peachy it's too nude and it's
too sparkly I definitely feel like this
has a lot more sparkle to it and Sheen
to it I shouldn't say Sparkle because
there's no glitter or anything it's a
very finely milled but it definitely has
more of a sheen to it than just the
regular hourglass ambient lighting
powders however I feel like it doesn't
go as high lady as the strobing powders
I'm a huge fan of the strobing powders
because I feel like they're a step up
from the regular ambient lighting
powders and they really give you like
highlight on sleek this particular
product doesn't really do that it's
right in between the two of those so if
you really like those hourglass ambient
lighting powders and maybe you have like
medium to deep skin tones I think you
definitely could highlight with the
three shades that we have here so this
one which is soft low is definitely more
like new T and then the shade in the
middle which is called bronze glow
definitely has more of a deeper
undertone and then the shade amber glow
is like straight up dark let me show you
guys what it looks like it's got kind of
like a pinky reddish tone so I think
this would be a great highlighting
option for those who do have darker skin
like medium to deep skin tones but if
you do have fair skin and you want to
try this out as a blush topper or a
blush I think it's actually really
beautiful like I said today
I have it on as a blush topper I think
it's stunning I have worn this alone as
a blush it's beautiful as well the
actual formulation is very finely milled
and I do like the wear time on it and
things like that so as far as where time
is concerned as long as you're wearing
like a good I want to say like tacky
base like a good primer doesn't have to
be tacky but a good primer whether it be
silicone or something a little more
tacky and you're wearing like a
foundation this really isn't going to go
anywhere I really like the fact that
it's not chunks of glitter or sparkle
it's not super super obvious like they
said on the website it's supposed to be
sheer but of what I really like about it
is that it's very very buildable without
looking unnatural and I think that's
super super gorgeous especially during
the summer time the last thing you want
is to have like a really really chunky
highlighter on that really kind of
emphasizes your pores and things like
that I think if you have like tan to
medium like deep skin tones you could
easily run this over your face as you're
setting powder and just have this
gorgeous luminescent quality to your
skin that would look absolutely
beautiful but for me personally like I
said it's just a little too dark but I
still think it's absolutely beautiful
like swept onto the cheeks very very
natural very very buildable I'm really
really enjoying this product so yeah
we're time on it is pretty darn strong
as long as you are wearing kind of like
a tackier foundation or just like a
foundation underneath it in general if
you just want to go and just put this on
I would highly recommend setting it in
with a setting spray just because it is
although it is pressed a little firmly
it is quite soft and powdery it's got
like a little bit of almost like a
domotic own feel in there sore it's a
method con feel in there so I do feel
like it could slip and slide all over
your face if you don't at least set it
in with a setting spray but for the most
part I'm really really impressed I think
this is a beautiful product again it's
multitasking if you do have deeper skin
tones I think this could be your
highlight you could use it to set in
your foundation you could use it to just
do like soft glow you know whatever on
your face I think it's absolutely
stunning so I'm really liking it as a
blush topper let me go ahead and swatch
it for you guys I'm going to show you
what it looks like when it's just
applied sheer so you guys can see and I
will kind of blend it out a little bit
and then I will build it up so here is a
swatch of it just sheared out and if I
took a really really light fluffy almost
fan brush I could really really dust
lightly on my cheekbones down the bridge
of my
nose and on my chin and I could probably
almost get this to look like a highlight
but for the most part you can see when I
do turn my hand it is deeper than my
particular skin tone so let me go ahead
and build it off just a little more so
you guys can see and then you'll start
to see those more like nude qualities in
there and I just think it's a beautiful
formulation I'm really really impressed
and I think if you want sort of like a
cheaper alternative to the hourglass
ambient lighting powders like a mix of
the ambient lighting powders with the
strobing powders I think you would
really really like this the texture is
very smooth and silky very very
blendable and very very buildable so
overall I think this is a beautiful
product it just depends on what your
skin tone is if you want to use it as a
highlighting powder if you want to use
it to setting your foundation if you
have really fair skin tone like I do you
can use it as a blush topper or a blush
but yeah this is awesome really really
like the quality of this and yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this quick little
review thank you for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
