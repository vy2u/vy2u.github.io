channel today I am completely makeup
free because I am reviewing a skincare
product for you guys this is the new
drunk elephant vestige le cantaloupe
cleanser it does retail for $34 on the
Sephora calm website it is a Sephora
exclusive and you do get five fluid
ounces a product in here this is
supposed to be good for normal oily
combination and sensitive skin it says
it is an innovative jelly that creates a
luxurious and milky lather to gently and
effectively melt away all traces of
makeup debris and impurities from the
day loaded with skin friendly
ingredients like cantaloupe extract and
marilla oil bestie will not dry or strip
the skin but it will leave it feeling
clean soft and supple without an ounce
of residue left over suggested use is
just to apply a small amount into the
palm of hand gently massage over dam
face and neck and eyes yes you can use
it around your eye area you want to work
it into a milky lather rinse well and
then pat your face dry with a warm towel
it says a warm towel or no just this pat
dry so anyway I was super excited to get
this you guys because of this right here
okay cantaloupe anytime I see something
like watermelon or cantaloupe or any
sort of fruit extract in some sort of
cleanser I get very excited especially
when it says jelly this just sounds like
something I want to eat like I literally
want to open it and just go and eat it
so yeah I'm actually really enjoying
this product you guys I will say I am
the kind of person because of my
combination skin I am somebody who
reaches for a lot of clarifying sort of
cleansers like right here I had these
Sunday Riley Ceramics lip clay cleanser
this is for normal to oily skin I think
this retails for around $45 recently
I've tried out this new nerd skincare
clarifying cleanser again I think it has
salicylic acid in it I'm just somebody
when I do have very very oily skin are
not really oily but I get oily in my
t-zone I do feel like I need something
that is going to kind of remove that oil
remove that buildup and I just usually
reach for a clarifying cleanser so I was
actually really surprised that I love
this so much this is definitely
something I'm going to repurchase which
is crazy five food ants for $34 that
seems a little cheap when you think
about it for drunk elephant because
they're so pricey but when you look at
it in the grand scheme of things like
these cleansers right here are hella
hella pricey
this one right here Sunday Riley
ceramics lip would not repurchase this
guy right here
I would actually repurchase so I feel
like that says a lot because $34 is a
lot
of money for a cleanser but I'm really
really enjoyed this the first thing I
want to talk about is the actual scent
because so many people have been asking
does it actually smell like cantaloupe
so drunk elephant is really known for
not using a lot of artificial fragrances
or just a lot of artificial ingredients
in general so no it doesn't technically
smell like cantaloupe it has a little
bit of a sweet scent to it but you
really don't feel like you're putting
actual cantaloupe on your face it does
have a little bit of a chemical odor to
it as well but as you guys can see the
actual consistency is truly like a jelly
and it really really is cooling when you
first apply it I would say the feeling
of it or the actual like consistency
reminds me a lot of say like any of the
gel mass from Peter Thomas Roth if you
like that when you start to rub it on
your face so this particular cleanser
claims to be something that you can use
for makeup removal I will tell you guys
right now I really don't feel like it
does that great of a job at makeup
removal
I have tried at dampening up my face and
then going in with this and removing
makeup I've also tried this on dry skin
and I just feel like I'm using way too
much jelly you know what I mean I feel
like when you want to use something to
remove your makeup you go through it
pretty darn quickly especially if you do
wear a full face of makeup like I do
every single day so for me it's not
worth it to purchase just to remove a
makeup but it is good at second
cleansing so if you just have a little
bit of product left on your face after
you've removed your makeup with a wipe
or with an oil then you can go in with
this and it will remove the rest of the
impurities the debris any sort of
residual makeup but also what I like to
do is I have really been enjoying using
this in the morning
now I love pairing it together with my
Clarisonic or my luna i feel like it
does a really really nice job of just
getting the gunk off of my skin and i
know a lot of people who do have dry
skin have been telling me that this is
not working for them like it states on
at the actual sephora.com website this
is for normal oily combination and
sensitive skin although this is a jelly
cleanser and it does give a little bit
of a milky or foamy sort of lather I do
think that this will strip your skin if
you do have dry skin so I would be very
very careful if you do have dry skin but
I think it will work if you're sensitive
I can use this all around my eye area
without any sort of irritation which is
a really really big thing for me and I
really enjoy that and one thing I want
to show you guys really quickly is this
actual packaging so as you can see it's
kind of like a squeezy tube now usually
when you're working with the jelly
cleanser one of the most annoying things
as you squeeze
and so much product comes out at once so
what they did here is they have this cap
that comes open like this and then you
have a little spout so you can actually
kind of control the amount that comes
out making horrible sounds but you can
actually kind of control the amount of
product that comes out which i think is
awesome because normally like I said
when you do have a cleanser like that
you really have to kind of like shake it
and be so careful because it just like
explodes all over your hand so I really
do enjoy the actual packaging I think
it's a very very smart and innovative
and like I said I really am just
enjoying this for cleansing so I noticed
that I really like to use it in the
morning so if I have any residual
skincare I need to rinse off in the
morning it is just so so so nice to pair
together with my actual and Clarisonic
or my Luna I have been noticing that my
skin it feels soft and supple and I know
it's because it has that marula oil
built in there I don't notice a huge
difference from the cantaloupe extract
apparently cantaloupe is supposed to be
good with brightening and things like
that I have not been using this products
long enough to notice the difference
with that I'm a big believer that you
know cleansers aren't going to do that
much for you as far as that is concerned
because the cleanser is what on your
face for maybe a minute tops so I don't
believe that it can do that much as far
as treatment is concerned but what I
look for in a cleanser is either
something that's going to help but a
little bit with breakouts or sucking up
oil kind of like the ceramic slip or I
look for something that is going to just
remove the residual product that I have
on my face whether it be makeup or
whether it be skin care so I think this
does a beautiful beautiful job it is
very very effective I love that I can
use it around my eye area I love how it
makes my skin feel you know I go in with
my toner and I don't feel like I'm
stripping my skin I just feel like it
feels really beautiful you know after I
finished my skincare in the morning I'm
just amazed at how soft and supple my
skin is looking so I do not have any
makeup on currently I hope you guys can
kind of see what my skin is looking like
currently I have been using the ordinary
skin care quite a few products from them
I'm going to be going ahead and
reviewing the ones that I do have next
Wednesday for you guys but I noticed
that I was getting a little bit of
chemical burns from some of the products
specifically the buffet serum which a
lot of people are not sensitive to I'm
not sensitive to the retinol I'm not
sensitive to the lactic acid but for
some reason I got very very sensitive to
the buffet serum so what I was doing was
using this as my cleanser in the morning
and at night
forget it I can't go in with something
like this or something like this when I
feel like I literally have chemical
burns on my skin it's just too much it's
going to strip the skin it is going to
make you feel very dry this was the
perfect combination it did not sting my
skin even though it was like you know
this raw skin you know bright red and
pink it did not hurt it it's not
stinging in any way shape or form and I
just think it's a really nice product so
yeah I definitely would highly recommend
like I said if you do have dry skin I
feel like this might be just a little
too drying for you maybe you want to
look for something that is more of a
foaming or milk cream cleanser because
this is a true jelly and anytime I use a
gel cleanser or jelly cleanser I always
think of that bean just a little more I
don't know it kind of removes impurities
out of your skin so when you do have dry
skin that's not what you're looking for
you're looking to put nutrients back
into your skin so anyway guys a very
very impressed with this definitely let
me know if you have picked this up and
what kind of skin type you have I want
to know if you like it and yeah that's
pretty much it I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
