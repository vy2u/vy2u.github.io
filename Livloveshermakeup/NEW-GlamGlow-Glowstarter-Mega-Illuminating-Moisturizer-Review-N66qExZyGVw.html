this video I'm giving you guys a really
quick little review on a new product
that recently released wrote recently
released on the glam glow comp website I
was so excited to get my hands on this
this is the new glam glow glow starter
mega illuminating moisturizer and this
is the shade nude glow it is supposed to
be a universally flattering shade for
all skin tones and all skin types and it
comes in a beautiful little pink box
like this as of right now this product
is only available on the glam glow comp
website adds up April 25th 2016 when I
am filming this video I will of course
link below in the description bar where
you guys can pick this product up if you
want it is not an affiliate link in any
way shape or form but hopefully in the
future they will release this on the
Sephora calm website because I don't
know I personally like to buy my stuff
from Sephora so that I can go ahead and
get points and all that kind of stuff
but they do have a code right now I
believe on the glam glow website if you
sign up for their newsletter you can get
15% off of your order so you know you
wouldn't be paying $49 shipping was free
and I feel like this is relatively well
priced I'm leaving it 1.7 ounces of
product in here yep 1.7 ounces of
product or 50ml in here and this is what
the actual packaging looks like it's
gorgeous it's a big kind of chunky
silver acrylic packaging with like a
metal lid I actually really like it I
think it's beautiful
and you open it up and this is what the
product looks like so this is new to
glow and as you can see there is a
little bit of like a peachy or nude tone
to it and I was really worried that this
was just not going to match my very very
fair skin for reference I am usually the
lightest shade of foundation pretty much
every single line drugstore and high-end
so I do have quite fair skin I'm not the
fairest of them all but I do have quite
fair skin so I was a little worried that
this was not going to work for me but
I'm happy to report that this actually
is beautiful on the skin so there it is
kind of applied heavily to the back of
my hand and then when you rub it in it
just starts to like really really
dispense and immerse itself into your
skin so it looks better and better the
more that you blend it in this is an
absolutely gorgeous moisturizer I'm very
very happy that I picked this up I'm a
huge fan of Lam blow in general I have
pretty much all of their masks in full
size or at some point I've had all of
their masks in full size I really like
their pout mud which is like their lip
exfoliator and the lip treatment I'm a
big fan of the brand I think that their
products really do work nicely and you
see the gleam on my hand right now that
that tinted moisturizer is giving it's
just absolutely stunning so let's go
ahead and talk about the scent quickly
the scent is beautiful I never worried
with glam glow products about scent
because normally they smell really darn
good this smells kind of citrusy like a
little bit like lemon um and just kind
of like lemon and orange I would say
it's nothing super super intense or
crazy it actually smells a lot less a
lot less strong than like their original
treatment mass so if you don't like the
scent on the treatment mass and I think
you would be okay with this it's a very
very subtle scent so anyway let me read
a little bit about what this product is
supposed to do for your skin it says
give your skin a perfect hydrated glow
with glam glow glow starter mega
illuminating moisturizer it is created
to boost the look of dull fatigue skin
it features vitamins botanicals
hyaluronic acid and tea oxide which is a
golden root blend to brighten clarify
and provide instant hydration immediate
iridescent illuminating pearls that blur
the skin and reflect to enhance your
complexion creating flawlessly smooth
hydrated skin for an instant sexy
Halloween Hollywood glow Hollywood
Hollywood glow so basically it's just a
tinted kind of moisturizer I mean it
almost gives a little bit of coverage I
hate to say I don't want to like market
it as a tinted moisturizer because it's
not supposed to be but it really is just
a beautiful illuminating moisturizer it
really blurs the look of fine lines and
pores and just like redness and
discoloration discoloration
discoloration on your skin I'm so
surprised by how well this actually
works obviously this is one of those
products that's supposed to be used like
during the day because it's not like you
would put this on at nighttime maybe you
would if you were going out or something
like that but at bedtime you don't
really need to put like an illuminating
product on your skin so I think the
thought of this is to wear it underneath
your makeup wear it underneath your BB
cream or your tinted moisturizer or your
CC cream just to give a really gorgeous
glow to your skin you can even take it
down like your neck and your décolleté
if
are wearing like a sexy dress and you
want like certain areas of your body to
be really highlighted it really is just
a gorgeous product and I kind of hope
that they come out with like a body
moisturizer or something along this the
lines of this because I really love the
iridescent that this gives to your skin
cannot speak I really love the
iridescent that this gives to the skin
it's just that beautiful kind of nude
color and it has a little bit of pink in
it and then like this gorgeous like gold
reflective like properties it's
absolutely stunning and I feel like it
really does moisturize my skin quite
well I'm not going to say it's like as
moisturizing as say like the origins
Knight immense or like Cetaphil or sera
babe moisturizing creams it's not like
that it's a very very thin consistency
and it really sinks in immediately and
of course is going to give you a
beautiful glow to your skin but for the
most part it's just a very very
lightweight sort of moisturizer I think
if you a combo skin or oily skin you
would love this I feel like it sinks in
really really quickly and I don't feel
like the reflective particles in there
make me look super oily they just make
me look glowy and I love it so I think
this is a really really nice product if
you do have dry skin or like aging skin
and you need a little more moisture then
this can actually give you I would
recommend going in with like an oil and
then or going in with this and then
going in with like an oil on top or
using your regular moisturizer and then
going in with this you could use this
more as kind of like a treatment primer
but yeah it's just a beautiful beautiful
beautiful beautiful tinted moisturizer
sort of thing and I really really like
it I was not expecting for it to blend
this seamlessly like into my skin and
give me such a beautiful glow but it
just has this gorgeous like nude color
and pink color and gold color and it
smells amazing it's really nice on my
combo skin I'm just overall really
really happy with it
I tend to have really good luck with
glam glow products in general I haven't
had any sort of skin irritation or
breakouts from this product so so far so
good I will of course update you guys
like you know if you guys are curious
about it I'm sure you'll see it in my
failed and holy grails hopefully a big
Holy Grail
in the next couple of weeks but yeah so
far I'm really really happy with it I
think it's beautiful really really
wonderful moisturizer and I hope that
they come out with the body products
like this because I think that would be
awesome so anyway that those are kind of
my thoughts so far on the new glam glow
glow starter mega illuminating
moisturizer I really really love it I
think it's wonderful and I've been using
it for about four to five days so of
course I need to use it a little more
and I'll update you guys then but so far
so good thank you so much for watching
this video and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
