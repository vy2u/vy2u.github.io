today's video is going to be on the new
it Cosmetics Buki brush box this is part
of their apology collection and I
purchased this for $39 and 68 cents on
QVC com what you get inside
well first you get this really cute
little box but what you get inside are
four of these little Buki brushes and
let me just talk about them one by one
I'll start with this one over here so
this is a really nice densely packed
flat top brushed really really soft all
of these brushes are very very soft but
this one is nice and dense and this one
is called the buffing Buki brush and it
says buff your favorite powder
foundations onto skin with small
circular motions for even coverage I
also think you could definitely use this
for liquid foundation I think it would
really blend well and help any streaking
and make sure there are no lines on your
skin a few you apply your foundation I
can't stop touching me they just feel so
soft I'd love that so anyway that's the
first one the second one it looks like a
little like Peter Cottontail like a
little bunny tail or something it's so
soft and this one is called the powder
ball Buki and it says use like sweeping
motions to apply your favorite loose and
pressed powders all over your face and
decollete so really excited to use that
it's not too as densely packed but you
can definitely just put you know a sweep
of bronzer on or even just you know your
pressed powder or a finishing powder so
excited about that the next one looks
like this and it's more of an angled
Buki and this one says it is the radium
spooky apply your favorite cream and
powder bronzers and Luminizer is using
gentle sweeping motions to blend into
skin for contour and definition turn on
an ankle and blend so this will be
really nice for contouring anywhere that
you want some more definition and it's
also very very soft of course so excited
about that and the last one you get in
this little kid is like an ankle dome
kind of brush and what I like to use
this for is to blend in my foundation or
CC cream into my hairline so that you'd
have just a really really even you know
you don't have a line where you know it
goes into like your hairline are things
like that so I really like doing that
these kind of brushes
anyway this one is called the complexion
perfection Buki and it says apply your
favorite cream and liquid foundations
concealers and highlighters using
patting motions then blend and smooth so
I'm sure you could also apply under-eye
cream with this and I'm really excited
for that one too so that's what that
little one looks like and let me show
you all for one more time so you can see
and like I said this was there our
today's special value it was only thirty
nine dollars and sixty eight cents so
you technically are paying $10 a brush
which is a great deal when it comes to a
cosmetic brushes because they tend to be
a little more on the expensive side but
they are really high-quality and I'm
very excited to use these so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and let me know
if you pick this little set up from QVC
and I'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
