thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having a fantastic day
please excuse these like baggy sleeves I
love this little turtleneck that I'm
wearing today however it's very like it
doesn't fit me anywhere it like really
except for the this area like it just
doesn't fit on the arms if it's on the
stomach area and like this area but here
it's just look so frumpy so I apologize
I'm not feeling very good today I woke
up with a sore throat so I wanted to
cover my throat and protect it because
that's really gonna do a lot anyways
today's video is going to be a review
and swashes on the new laura geller
they gelato swirl illuminators in
charming pink and peach glow these were
released on the ulta.com websites like i
would say what is it like two weeks
three weeks earlier for platinum members
so i did order them I wasn't actually
interested in getting them at first but
then my friend Amy from makeup buy a new
Michelle kind of talked me into it
because she was like oh he looks so
pretty and you know look at the swatches
that were likes watched on trend mood
the reason I didn't want to get them was
because the two new shades just looked
at very very standard and I thought well
I can definitely do those out in my
collections but she was like well if you
don't like them you can just return them
they're only 26 dollars apiece and I was
like okay okay I'll do it so this is
what they look like this one right here
is peach glow and this is charming pink
I do have experience with this
formulation because I am a huge fan of
the laura geller baked gelato swirl in
gilded honey this is what it looks like
when I first reviewed this last year I
actually wasn't a huge fan um if you
guys watch that video if you've been
with me for that long I thought that the
formulation was a little crispy it
didn't really blend into the skin very
beautifully and it was because they just
wasn't working with the formulation
correctly if that makes sense so with
this particular formulation you need a
nice dense brush and you really need to
buff it into your skin this is a hybrid
gel sort of formulation like a baked
Jala sort of formulation which is really
big right now like all of the new Dior
highlights the Burberry highlights it's
a really big thing right now to do a
cream to powder sort of highlight and
that's what these are so you need a nice
dense brush the way that I like to apply
them is with my Sigma tapered
highlighter
later at 35 brush which looks like this
and I will literally tap into the
product and then really really like buff
it in there like get it in there I'm not
just going like oh okay
oh no I'm really kind of moving it in
there because honestly I feel like when
you have this cream to powder sort of
formulation it just doesn't sit on the
skin nicely if you're just going to dust
it on it will look like it's on your
skin and you don't want that it will
emphasize texture on your skin so you
really want to buff it into your skin so
anyway I was using it correctly when I
first got the Gildan honey one and I
kind of gave it a bad review but since
then it has become one of my favorite
highlights it's a gorgeous gorgeous gold
shade and I love the way this looks on
my fair skin even though I do have your
skin I feel like this still looks really
really beautiful on my skin so I don't
really love those and I also do have
experience with the laura geller what
are these baked gelato swirl these are
actually waiting this occult baked
gelato yeah based Amato vivid swirl
blushes so this is the shade plumberry
these are beautiful they have like a
semi matte Demming that sort of finished
they look gorgeous with all of the
highlights and they're just really
really beautiful too so I recommend
those the blushes and the illuminators
are the same size you get 4.5 grams or
0.16 ounces so this is what the two
little boxes look like for the new
highlighters and like I said I think
they are going to be available for
everybody starting like April 10th or
something like that let me double check
on the website I mean I might as well
right I'm pretty sure these are going to
be available for everybody on April 10th
they did have like a you know platinum
sale thing going on before for you know
platinum members to get their hands on
them but for the most part I believe you
can get these in store and online
starting in April so anyway let's talk a
little bit about the actual colors and
what I like to use them for so today I
am wearing charming pink which is that
light pink shade that has kind of like
an opalescent white undertone to it so
it looks like that I have that on today
I think it's beautiful I love it on my
cheeks these we're a very very long time
I just got home from work and I
my day at 7 a.m. and it is now 5 o'clock
at night and I feel like my makeup still
looks nice I feel like the highlight is
still there very very beautiful on the
skin and I just like the way it looks
when I really buff it in so the charming
pink shade is my favorite out of the two
of these however if I were to pick a
favorite out of all three that I own I
would still go with my gilded honey it's
just my favorite I feel like it's a
universal shade for every single skin
tone
now the peach glow one I do like as well
this is a little dark on my skin when I
swatch it you guys will be able to see
what I'm talking about with like fair
skin you want something that's not going
to change when you turn your head or
your hand you want something that's not
going to look darker in certain lighting
in certain lighting because you're
trying to highlight your face so you
want something that's going to appear
lighter so the charming pink one does
that for me and also the gilt of gold or
gilded honey guilty gold gilded honey
one does that for me as well the peach
glow is a little darker so it is very
very beautiful when the light is right
on it but when I turn my head it gets
darker and then it just doesn't really
look like a highlight to me so I like to
use this as a blush topper I think it's
really really beautiful that way so on
the Alta kaam website and on the back of
the boxes it actually says that you can
like literally put this it says it's a
prince Lucent wash of luminous color
that you can put all over your face I
really don't agree with that even when
you use a light hand and you use a super
super fluffy brush instead of something
really dense like this one from Sigma
you literally are still going to get a
lot of color payoff I would not
recommend getting these these are not
like the ambient lighting powders from
hourglass or anything like that I would
recommend going ahead and using them as
a highlighter not using them all over
the face because they are very very
saturated like in color and I just don't
think they give a very like luminous
soft focused effect they're literally
like BAM highlighter right there so I
just wanted to point that out because I
felt like on the Ulta home website and
on the back of the box they were kind of
like marketing it as sort of like a soft
focus powder and I'm like no these are
definitely highlighters
anyway I just wanted to throw that out
there but overall I think these are
really nice I don't have too much to say
because they already have worked with
this formulation before um I guess my
only recommendations would be to use a
dense brush make sure you really get
into the product when you first swatch
it they don't feel super buttery they're
not gonna feel like a makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow or legs I don't know they're
not going to feel like the sort of
texture that you think they're gonna
feel like let me just say that because I
feel like right now on the market
they've been coming out with so many
like they chill a formulations a lot of
the ones that I own are way smoother and
softer than these and it could be
because they have that gelato swirl
texture in them but I don't think it's
that I think the formulation is just a
little rougher it's a little more baked
so if you just need to get into it I
would recommend when you first get your
product kind of run your finger in there
it's not like there's an overspray it
just feels a little crispy feel a little
crispy to the texture so get your finger
in there as you guys can see their ultra
pigmented they're great and I feel like
sometimes we need to remember even if a
product doesn't feel great when we're
watching it we're not always going to be
swatching it we're wearing this product
on our face so as long as it goes on
really nicely and pigmented and
beautifully that's all that really
matters so in the long run the
formulation is great just really get in
there and once you get into the product
more you're going to love it more and
more trust me so um like I said my
little comparison for the three of them
is that I would still pick my gilded
honey I feel like this is gorgeous on my
skin tone gorgeous on so many different
skin tones and if I had to pick a second
one I would do the charming pink because
I feel like this is a true highlight on
my skin tone the peach glow is beautiful
I am going to keep it however I'm going
to be using it as a blush topper so yeah
anyway that was my little quick review
and let me go ahead and do swatches for
you guys on these I almost forgot to
swatch them
that's so funny I'm sitting there like
all laughing I'm not okay bye guys it's
like we're the swatches alright so this
is the charming pink shade as you guys
can see it's the beautiful kind of like
pink opalescent white undertone sort of
shade and I'm going to show you guys so
you can see it goes on very pigmented
and when I turn my hand you can see that
it's not getting darker it's getting
almost lighter you can see that
opalescent undertone like that white
color in there that is what makes it a
highlight from my particular skin tone
let me go ahead and swatch the peach
glow so you guys can see what I mean
when I
say that this one when I turn my head if
I'm wearing it on my face or even if I
turn my hand when I have its watch it
gets darker and that's what makes it not
so much a highlight for me but a blush
topper so there it is peach glow and
then you turn it and you can see it's
getting darker so that is what makes it
a blush topper for me instead of a
highlight but overall I think they're
all fantastic I love them let me go
ahead and swatch the gilded honey one
for you guys one more time because I
think this one is amazing
and every single skin tone could use
this one and it still is just the it's I
don't know it's just the prettiest one
to me out of the whole bunch like if
you're thinking of getting one I would
recommend getting the gilded honey it's
just absolutely stunning so anyway I am
happy with the new ones I think they are
really really nice and I do like that
charming thing shaded but yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches and I will see you in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
