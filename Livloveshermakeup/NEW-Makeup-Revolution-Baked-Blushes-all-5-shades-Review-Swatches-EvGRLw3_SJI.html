in this video I'm giving you guys my
thoughts and my opinion swatches and
also a review on the new makeup
revolution vivid baked blushes I
purchased these for 5 dollars a piece on
the ulta.com website I will link below
in the description bar where you guys
can pick them up if you are interested
but I was so flippin excited when I saw
that these released because you guys
first of all they are five dollars a
piece you literally can get all five
shades for $25 I mean fun like that's
amazing and then second of all I'm a
huge fan of the makeup revolution line I
think they have really really awesome
eyes shadow palettes I love their baked
highlighters especially in golden lights
like that is one of my go-to
highlighters it's amazing so I was
really excited when I saw that they
released these blushes um I just think
they're are really really good quality
and honestly they're supposed to be a
two and one sort of product so they're
supposed to give you luminous quality to
the cheeks and also be a blush built
into one so anyway let me show you guys
what the colors are because I think
that's where this particular product
falls short is the color selection they
are just too similar in color in my
opinion they're just too similar in
color and I will say one of them came
kind of completely crushed and I'm a
little disappointed but anyway this is
what the actual packaging looks like
here's the one that came a little crush
they're basically pretty darn small
they're about half the size of the vivid
based highlighters if you are curious
this first shade is called uh loved me
the best and you do get hold on a minute
let me try and see here you get it's a
0.2 1 ounce is such a small little
packaging but 0.2 1 ounces of product in
here so not tons a product or for 5
dollars I think it's a good deal so this
is the one that kind of came a little
smashed and I will be returning this one
not because it came smashed but because
I'm going to be returning I believe two
of these just because they're so similar
in color but this is the first one and I
think it's beautiful you just get this
kind of mosaic sort of color with tons
and tons of sheen and shine and then you
get the actual blush color now these can
be used two ways you can actually use
them dry like this or you can actually
use them damp so you can spray your
brush with like mac fix+ or any sort of
setting spray will work and they go on
kind of foiled so really really
beautiful today i am wearing
shade one for playing games and I have
that on the apples of my cheeks and any
sort of glow that you see for my skin is
from this product so this is the other
one like I said this is the one I'm
wearing today one for playing games I'm
definitely keeping this one this one is
my favorite color it's a beautiful kind
of lavender lilac color I mean it's just
absolutely gorgeous sort of magenta
there it is and I'll swatch that one
next to the other one and they just go
on so smooth and creamy they have a
beautiful beautiful appearance on the
cheeks I think they really make them
look lifted and nice if you have aging
skin I actually think it would really
like these because they really kind of
lifts the apples of your cheeks they
have a lifting quality to them so there
is the second one as you guys can see
they kind of go on foiled even when
they're still like completely dry and
you can imagine what they look like when
they go on kind of wet I just kind of
wet my hand a little bit I want to show
you guys just so you can see the base
formulation because they are absolutely
amazing they really have like a foiled
quality to them do you see that when you
put it on wet so absolutely you can
spray your brush with any sort of
setting spray and it will just look
amazing anyway those are the first two
shades so the second one nice swatch
like I said was one for playing games
which is my favorite and then the first
one which is crushed is love me the best
I will be returning that one because
it's very similar to the next one I want
to show you guys which is called all I
think about is you so I would say my
biggest complaint with this line is just
the fact that a lot of these look very
very similar so this one is kind of like
a Mavi purpley color really beautiful
very similar to the first one there it
is yeah swatch it for you guys oh my god
the pigmentation and the wearability on
these two you guys these last all day
long on the cheeks I just can't talk
about makeup revolution enough I think
they have fantastic fantastic products
so those are those three and then we
have another sheet here called bang bang
you're dead and this one is very very
similar to which one is this one if
we're playing games which is my favorite
so here is bang bang you're dead and
here's one for playing games so I will
be returning bang bang you're dead
because it's just so similar and I'm so
mad because they felt like they could
have done some great like orange e
apricot e shades or something like that
and it's just kind of disappoint
that they just didn't you know they
didn't they didn't go for it they just
kind of need all of the shades very
similar so I don't know that kind of
disappointed me because I was like wow
these could have been outstanding
absolutely outstanding I will be doing a
comparison video of these against the
Milani baked blush is if you guys are
curious because I think they have a lot
of similarities these ones are
absolutely a lot cheaper there it is by
the way swatch do you see that it's like
oh my god the glow in these products
that is bang bang you're dead and then
we have the last one which is called oh
if I can open it this one is called make
love instead and I will be keeping this
one it's beautiful it's kind of like a
more neutrally peachy shade this is
about as peachy as the colors got but
yeah it is one of my favorites so there
is make love instead so you can see a
lot of these look similar
again the shade range just kind of
bummed me out but I think they're
beautiful they wear an incredibly long
time on the cheeks they're easy to blend
they go on so beautifully I today used
an angled blush brush to apply this and
I just love the way that it puts color
down but also lifts your cheek with that
gorgeous gorgeous highlight like I said
I don't have any other highlighter on on
top of this it's just the blushes and I
just think it's beautiful so the shades
that I will be keeping our make love
instead I also will be keeping one for
playing games because these two are
probably my favorite so you get that
kind of magenta one and then the peachy
or nudie color and then the last one I
want to keep and looking at them they're
so darn similar I'm like really do you
have to do that um what is the last one
that I want to keep I'm pretty sure I
want to keep this one as well this is
all I think about is you so we have kind
of like the purpley one at the nudie one
and then the light pink ones these are
the three that I will be keeping I think
they're absolutely beautiful the two
that I will be Beyla I cannot speak the
two that I will be returning are bang
bang you're dead and then the one that
got crushed which is love to me the best
so you guys will see these when I do my
products I'm returning a video and again
it's not because they're not good
quality is just they're so similar to
each other so I highly recommend picking
these up going in store taking a look at
them and kind of figuring out they're
all in the same sort of shade category
like ma vie sort of color so definitely
pick out maybe like a pinky blonde kind
of a nudie one and then like
the one I think you're going to love
them they're absolutely phenomenal so I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick little
review and swatches on the new makeup
revolution vivid base two blushes I
think they definitely are worth it and
yeah I hope you enjoyed this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
