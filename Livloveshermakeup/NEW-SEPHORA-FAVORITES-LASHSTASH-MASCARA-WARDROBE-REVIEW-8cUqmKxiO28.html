video is going to be a review on the new
Sephora favorites lash stash mascara
wardrobe if you like I can never say
that this is $45 on these sephora.com
website if you are in the US and I
believe $54 in Canada yes yes $54 in
Canada it is a 139 dollar value you do
get two full-size mascaras in here and
eight deluxe sized minis this wardrobe
of 10 mascaras features formulas that
stretch of volumize enhanced and ones
that curl lift and define it also
includes a lash primer and like you said
two full-size mascaras you do have the
ingredients for every single product and
the sizing on the back of the box it is
a light pink color with a kaleidoscope
effect really really pretty and then I
have half of them already pulled out of
here but on the inside as you guys could
see it is this really really obnoxious
plastic sheet so I tried to take most of
them out but on the outside we had our
two full-size mascaras and then we have
the H little deluxe sizes in the middle
so I'm just going to go through them one
by one and tell you guys what I think of
them a lot of them I had already tried
but I think this is a great way to try
out some mascaras especially some
high-end mascara so one of these full
sizes that you get in here is the YSL
babydoll mascara this was new to me it
is one of three mascaras that I'm
wearing on my lashes right now yes three
mascaras I wanted to layer them today so
that you guys could see how they look
layered together but yeah this is the
third mascara that I have put on today
and I think it's absolutely beautiful I
love the way that it kind of like D
clumps a really clumpy mascara so if you
go in with a really really gunky mascara
kind of like the Urban Decay perversion
mascara you can go in with this and it
will just separate the lashes
beautifully it does have a natural or
not a natural I have a rubber bristle
wand as you guys can see it it is just
right up my alley it even smells good
which is amazing like I don't know I
don't think I've ever had a mascara
smell good maybe like the Lancome
Hypnose drama but I don't know why I
sell always blows it out of the park for
me I never wanted to purchase this
because it is quite pricey but now I
will go ahead and do so so yeah that is
the first mascara definitely recommend
checking that out the second one in this
kit is the church purchase lash paint I
do not recommend this I feel like it's
like a waterproof mascara but it's not
first of all it has an extremely gunky
formulation can you guys see that so
much comes out at once I feel like the
bristles are just really everything
together it gets very very like wet and
just all over your eyes all over the
place underneath all over and then at
the end of the day it like dries down
like an actual paint and then you can't
get it off so at first it's too wet and
then you can't get it off at the end of
the day the reason why I don't like
waterproof mascaras even though this
isn't waterproof but the reason why I
don't like waterproof mascaras is
because I feel like when I take my
makeup off at the end of the day it
takes the lashes off as well like able
to take my lashes with them and I'm like
please don't do that
I need those so anyway um that is why I
would not like purchase a full size of
this I'm not even gonna finish this I
really don't like it alright the next
one in here was the Too Faced better
than sex mascara this is one of my
all-time favorite mascaras it's
beautiful it has a natural bristle wand
it is an hourglass shape as you guys can
see and if you want really natural
volume and length I highly recommend
checking out this particular mascara
however it is a notorious for flaking
throughout the day and also smudging so
if you have really really oily eyelids I
would stay away the next one in the
kitchen with the benefits they are real
mascara this is another favorite of mine
it's got a really nice like medieval
torture tool sort of wand going on here
so this is what the wand looks like it's
very very spiky it is a rubber bristle
wand and you have these little PO keys
at the top so then you can get into the
inner corner of your lashes and also the
outer part so I love the formulation on
this it really defines and lengthens not
so much like gives you volume but it's a
beautiful one and I highly recommend
checking that out the next one in the
kitchen put the Urban Decay perversion
mascara this is the bigger blacker
batter I do have a full-size of this I
think it's a great mascara it's a really
good building mascara so if you want to
wear this on the bottom and then layer a
few on top I think it looks good
but if you just want to wear this alone
like beware this is a very very wet
formulation and it is a natural bristle
wand and I do feel like it starts to
transfer throughout the days yeah
throughout the day so that's definitely
something to think about but I do think
it's beautiful and I feel like like I
said it's very good at building so if
you want to put it on first and then put
on maybe like the benefit they're real
or the Too Faced better than sex I think
it would look great alright the next one
we have in here it was new to me this is
the NARS audacious mascara so here is
what the packaging looks like it is
matte like
all NARS packaging I love this it is the
second mascara that I put on today it's
absolutely beautiful it's got like this
360 wand as you guys can see and this
thing is so flimsy but flimsy and a good
way it's super soft it doesn't ever feel
like it's gonna poke you in the eye I
really feel like it gives you like the
trifecta so it gives you volume length
and also definition absolutely perfect
love the formulation I don't feel like
it goes anywhere on my eyes they really
stays on my eyelashes all day this is a
good one
the next thing that was in here was the
Smashbox lash primer now this I was not
very impressed with I have one lash
primer that I'm absolutely obsessed with
it's the urban decay subversion I've
never found a lash primer quite as good
as that one I yeah you know I've tried
quite a lot so this is what it looks
like I really thought it would work for
me since it is a really fluffy almost
like a caterpillar sort of wand thing
going on here it's got longer bristles
than shorter than longer than shorter
and I really liked the way it looked but
honestly I felt like it was poking me in
the eye the wand was just a little too
big and I don't feel like it was gloopy
enough sometimes they feel like a base
like this like a mascara base has to
have a little bit of chunks in it too
kind of like hold the mascara that you
put on top or else it just doesn't do
anything and for whatever reason this
just kind of like disintegrated on my
lashes it did nothing I did not notice
the difference when I wore this and then
put something on top of it so I did not
like that obviously would not purchase a
full side for that right here we have
the Bobbi Brown this is the smoky eye
mascara this is the first master I put
on today so I put on that one then the
NARS and then the YSL babydoll if you're
wondering what's on my lashes this is a
beautiful mascara it's got one of those
really densely packed natural-bristle
wands and I love ones like this so I
don't always love natural bristle wands
but when they're densely packed like
this I feel like they give the perfect
amount of natural looking lashes this is
gorgeous I love the formulation it
reminds me kind of of the Smashbox not
the full exposure is that the full
exposure I can't remember but the
Smashbox has a mascara that's kind of
similar to this particular wand this is
a really inky dark formulation I think
it's beautiful if you are someone who
likes really natural lashes I would
highly recommend checking out this
particular one from Bobbi Brown the next
one we have here is from buxom and I
thought this one was just
hey I got really excited when I saw the
actual wand and this is the buxom lash
mascara is that what it's called
literally yeah lash mascara in blackest
black so
packaging is super super cute as you
guys can see and I really thought I was
gonna love this but honestly this thing
is just too big do you see that like it
takes up literally like half an inch
more and then my eye is huge I felt like
it was getting into my eyeball
especially on the lower lashes forget
about it could not do it so it's got a
really cool wand it does do that kind of
like 360 thing here and a little bit of
an hourglass shape but overall I would
say it's just too long it's not that
it's too wide it's just too long it
really really hurts when you get in your
eye too so I yeah I didn't really like
this and I was actually surprised at how
natural this made up my lashes flew up
and normally when you have a rubber
bristles like this you seem to get a lot
of volume or at least a lot of
definition and length and I don't feel
like this did any of that so I would not
purchase a full side with that alright
and then the last item that we have in
here is the other full-size and this was
very disappointing to me this is the
este edits by Estee Lauder this is the
edges edgiest or edges to whatever aha
up and out double mascara so this side
is volumizing hate the side and then
this side is the lifting this one's okay
so the first thing that you do is go in
with the volumizing side it's just a
typical standard like stupid wand I'm
sorry but like I feel like there have
been so many cool ones that have hit the
market like you could have done
something else with this it's just so
pathetic so that is what it looks like
it's a little gloopy and clumpy I'm just
not into it I feel like it did nothing
for my lashes like absolutely nothing it
didn't look like anything when I put
this on so then I went in with the other
side and the other side reminded me of
one of my all-time favorite mascaras
which is the outrageous curl from the
Sephora brand or the house brand at
Sephora
and this is what it looks like really
really tiny little um I was gonna say
natural bristle brush no a rubber a
bristle wand as you guys can see and I
just love the way that this goes in
because it's so tiny it really really
curls her lashes so if you are someone
who first of all you don't want to curl
your lashes or if you just can't get a
curl with your lashes and this would be
great but the other side is just a total
fail so I don't know I feel like this
one was okay and this side was like
complete so I would personally not
purchase a full-size of this
and yeah so anyway I have not heard very
good things about the este edit line
that's like their new line from estÃ©e
lauder so anyway just wanted to put that
out there so now that is that the little
Sephora favorites last stash asset I do
really think that it was fun to try out
all of these different mascaras like I
said most of them I have already tried
out but I found like a new Holy Grail
which is that YSL baby doll I do think
it's worth it because you are getting 2
full sizes in here and it seems like
it's pretty good like value wise now I
will say a lot of these little little
tiny guys that you're seeing you can
probably get these as 100-point perks at
Sephora anyway but I still think it was
a good value and it was a nice way to
try out some new ones so I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
