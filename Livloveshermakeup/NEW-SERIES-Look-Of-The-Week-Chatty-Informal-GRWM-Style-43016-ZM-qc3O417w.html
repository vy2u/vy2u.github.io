morning in today's video we are starting
a new series on my channel I'm very
excited for this I will be making a post
on Instagram actually you guys have
probably already seen the pose before
you see this video because I am out of
town right now but I am Pre filming some
videos for you guys but anyway I'm
saturdays from now on I am going to be
doing a new series on my channel called
the look of the week and it will be
where I share with you guys the look
that i created this week that i really
enjoyed or the look that i created with
the products that I shot my stash with
so this is going to go hand in hand with
my shop and swatch my stash series and
also my fails and holy grail so on
Mondays you guys will see and you know
swatch with me the makeup products that
i will be using for the week on Saturday
you will see the actual products applied
to my face and then on Sundays you guys
will know if they wear I'll or a Holy
Grail so I thought this was a good idea
because a few of you guys know I'm not a
makeup artist or anything like that but
a few of you asked me for tutorials once
in a while and I figure I'm kind of like
a beauty or lifestyle channel so it
would be a nice way to kind of include
some sort of a well I'm not gonna call
this a tutorial but like I get ready
with me every single week and then also
if you have been curious about like the
makeup I have been wearing that week I
can share with you guys how it actually
goes onto my face and yeah I just
thought that this would be fun to do
that way you guys get to see the actual
products not only swatched and we
talking about them I also applied to my
face every week so I hope you guys enjoy
this and let's go ahead and get started
I have some mean little spots hold on
let me set up my mirror I have some mean
little spots right here today like tons
of little I think it might be related to
my lupus they look like they're pimples
but they're actually like little nodules
under the skin except for this one this
one is a white head but anyway I hope
I'm not going into a lupus flare-up but
anyway if you see a few like kind of red
marks like in my hairline and also
around the outer perimeters of my face I
think these are loops related normally
when i get little marks like that and it
goes into my scalp area I usually know
that it's some sort of irritation
related to lupus so anyway I want to
cover those up today but if you guys
watched my shop and swatch my stash
monday you know the products that I
picked out for the week and we're going
to put some of those on my face so let's
go ahead and get started I'm going to
pull my hair back my lips are so dry it
today I really should boys dries them
let me grab a little quickly all right
I'm going to put on this pur Lisse daily
lip nourisher with mango and shea butter
I don't like this product but it does
sink in quickly so let's see if it can
do anything for my super severely dry
lips again I don't know if I'm going
into a lupus flare-up hopefully not but
anytime I get super super dry skin or
like a weird little like nodules on my
face usually related to that alright so
the first thing we are going to do is go
in with my primer i will be using the
ambient light correcting primer from our
glass in the shade luminous light and i
won't be like I mean these are obviously
going to be kind of Chatty videos more
like get ready with me style videos but
I'm not going to be chatting about the
product too much because I will talk
about the product probably tomorrow in
my fails and holy grails so anyway I'm
just taking a little bit of this and
applying it all over my face and I have
already done my skincare this morning
and I let that completely sink in for
like an hour so everything is completely
absorbed and I'm just tapping that in
making sure i buy it all over my face
and now i'm going to go ahead and grab
the eye primer that i will be using and
this is the NYC City proved 24-hour base
I primer and I'm not quite sure if you
guys have seen the video yet i don't
know if i'm posting it this week or next
week but i will be doing a video on my
favorite drugstore I primers and this is
one of them it's so easy and quick to
use so I'm just kind of penciling that
onto my I really really messily and then
I'm just going to tap it in with my
finger and kind of blend it in just like
throwing me off it keeps thinking of the
pencil and I want to go like but it
actually feels like a little module
under the skin so weird a few of you
were asking if I'm going to do a video
on lupus it's kind of a sensitive
subject for me since I was sort of
recently diagnosed but i do plan on
doing a video dedicated to the topic
when it's lupus awareness month which I
don't know when it's lupus awareness
month actually is i probably should but
i definitely plan on doing a video about
it all right and the next thing i'm
going to do is go in with this little
dr. jart BB mate contouring 123 kit and
in here we get a like highlighting cream
products right here we have a corrector
which is kind of yellow toned and then a
contour so I'm going to start with the
kind of yellow one and i'm going to
correct underneath my eyes so we're just
going to take that where i have some
blue tones right underneath my eyes and
then i'm going to blend that in quickly
with my Real Techniques damp sponge and
then we're going to go in with the
highlighter shade or the pink one and
you guys these have like SPF 30 each one
of them does and that crazy dr. jart is
awesome I think it's a Korean skincare
brand and they're really good with
didn't care of it anyway I'm going to
take the highlighting shade now where I
almost just got that on my dress I'm
going to take this all the way under my
eyes down to my nose and kind of do the
little triangle and then on my eyelid as
well because this does make quite a nice
base and again I will talk a little more
about the product tomorrow um who that
was that was sloppy should I bet she
loved me I love when people can do like
a perfect triangle I'm always very
impressed like Bill girl all right now
put some on my chin oh yes down the
bridge of my nose
oh so cute you guys I feel like I'm
painting my face all right and then I'm
going to go back in with my sponge and
just blend that in to my skin how was
your weekend you guys I hope you are
having a good weekend so far actually
when you see this it will be Saturday
normally I'll be filming this on
Saturday with you guys but I am off
doing a big gig this weekend I've been
gone for probably three days now when
you guys are seeing this and yeah it's
hopefully been a lot of fun I am sure
the show's hopefully went well I'll let
you guys know I guess next week but for
the most part I will be filming this
like on the day with you guys you guys
know I don't really do tons of pre
filming I prefer to just film on the day
with you guys but whatever alright and
I'm gonna go in with the bronzing or the
contouring one and I'm just gonna hit
right on the size of my face here I'm
not gonna go crazy this is a little dark
and I find if I put it on my forehead
area i mean i'll talk about the product
a little more tomorrow and my fails and
holy grails but I find if I put it too
much like near my forehead I think it's
just my makeup skills or lack thereof
like I just can't it just gets really
buddy looking and I'm not a huge fan of
like cream contouring products I will
stay out of all three of the products in
this little kids this is probably my
least favorite but I'm trying to make it
work because this is an item that I'm
trying to use up in 2016 alright next
we're gonna go in with our base and i
have been using a tinted moisturizer all
week and I kind of regret it now because
of course I'm dealing with some stuff on
my face but I have been enjoying really
really lightweight sort of product so
I'm going to give this a good shake this
is the neutrogena healthy skin glow
shares eliminating tinted moisturizer
and ivory to fair and i'm going to take
a nice little bowl off of this on the
back of my hand about that much actually
let's take a little more I got some
stuff to cover so I'm going to take that
and then go in with the flat side of my
Real Techniques sponge look at this it's
so abused I need a new one I love these
sponges and i'm just going to stipple
this on to my face and I'm going to go
all the way or like around my eyes
everything like that
because we won't be doing really any
concealing even though we did do some
color correcting and highlighting it
kind of concealed um but those i love
how I'm talking about like oh yeah I
won't be talking about the products I
know Here I am but the dr jart products
are little more of like a corrector than
like a concealer all right I need a
little more I'm looking at my forehead
and I'm like des not gonna I can't hang
with that so I'm gonna put a little more
I'm just gonna put it right on to the
sponge this is a really thick formula so
I don't feel like it gets super absorbed
so I'm just gonna put that on and again
I'll talk about the product a little
more in depth tomorrow let you know if
it was a funny little hard granula but
so this is what it looks like on the
skin you can see it is quite
illuminating and it doesn't have too
much coverage to it but that's what I've
been enjoying and normally i'm like a
full coverage kind of girl all day every
day but i don't know lately i've been
all about that like light face makeup
life alright so as you guys can see
everything is still kind of showing and
this doesn't really build super super
well so i'm just gonna leave it and
we're going to go ahead and set
everything in with my putter so i'm
going to be taking my heart airbrush
buffer foundation brush and my ELF tone
correcting powder and cool I'm going to
swirl this in there and then we are
going to stipple this on to the face
starting with the eye area and the
t-zone and then going into the outer
perimeters of the face just making sure
everything is locked into place so that
it doesn't go slippin and slidin all day
long and you guys probably know that
this product is a holy grail of mine I
won't even talk about it tomorrow
because I've talked about it so many
times in you know like my favorite
products ever sort of videos like my
fellow moly grows um this is like my
ride-or-die powder so yes this is a Holy
Grail I feel like it makes every single
foundation or base look like that much
more beautiful it's beautiful really
sets things in and if products are a
little darker on your skin which that
tinted moisturizer is a tad darker I did
get a little Sun yesterday um but it's
probably why I have all this stuff going
on and basically allergic to the Sun
having
become a widow your way did get a little
bit of Sun i sat out on the balcony for
a little bit and I feel like I darkened
up a little bit you may disagree but I
feel like I say I really see the tan I'm
gonna wait my hands off and my lips
quickly because you guys know I always
coat my lips I'm just one of those
people um I always just go over my lip
area and that's probably why they're so
like dried out anyway after we have set
that in I'm going to go ahead and take
my little stila perfect me perfect you
affair light palette so in here we have
five I shadows into boo lashes and I'm
going to take the light pink blush right
here which is called a romantic and I'm
going to be taking my lexy angled 50 for
a large angled brush I'm going to tap
into that product it is a little on the
pottery side and I'm just going to apply
this to the apples of my cheeks I like
these new little steal a palace this
will be a holy grail for tomorrow if I'm
like I'm giving everything away but it
will be a Holy Grail I do like these
quite a bit I think they're really nice
and they can be a little powdery but i
love the way sometimes when they're
super super powdery it's because they're
super super soft and they're actually
very easy to blend on the skin so for me
I go pretty heavy-handed with blush so
sometimes it's nice if it doesn't go on
like you know like wham-bam in your face
you kind of build it and you can kind of
blend it off if you do put too much on
but that's hard with this particular
color and then you do have like that
peachy color in there as well but my
go-to has been this sort of pinky the
light the light color and here are the
kind of flushed baby pink color and I
was thinking in these like look of the
week of videos i would share kind of the
look i mean i'm gonna try and use as
many products that i shot my stash with
but also kind of share with you guys you
know the look that you were enjoying the
most for the week or two look that i was
enjoying the most for the week i was
doing really natural makeup this week
and this was like the go-to like these
particular shades i really really like
that blush and everything so this is the
one
showing you guys all right next we are
going to go ahead and take the wet and
wild mega glow illuminating palette in
320 catwalk pink it looks like this is
so big and I'm going to go back in with
my lexy blush brush I'm going to swirl
this in the product cut off the excess
and put that on top of the app the blush
and talk with the apples of the cheeks
on top of the other blush I'll talk
about this product a little more
tomorrow but I like how it highlights
but it doesn't overly highlight which is
why I'm basically using it as a blush
topper and it does have a little bit of
color going on there hmm just built it
up too much there so after i'm going to
go back in with my tart air buffer brush
and I like to just kind of tap over the
blush areas like I said I'm a little
heavy-handed when it comes to wash so
just making sure there's no harsh edges
or lies sorry if I'm looking in the
viewfinder to making sure that my face
is in the camera alright moving on the
next thing you're going to do is kind of
comb out the brows and I'm just taking
this little spooley from elf and I'm
just kind of pushing them upwards and
then I'll be going in with my models co
more browse in the shade light to medium
and I'm just going to put this on to my
brows and I'm going to wipe off the
excess of the brush with a tissue
because i'll talk about it a little more
in my video tomorrow but I feel like a
lot of the products you get stuck wow I
just wiped it off on a wet tissue that
was not smart a lot of the product gets
like stuck in one area on your brows so
I'm just taking this and combing through
really really quickly doing it kind of
mess Lee just kind of putting a little
extra thickness there not concentrating
so much on the front of my brows because
the color will build up there quite
quickly just kind of going through the
outer part of my brows I would say the
outer perimeters of my brows and then
I'm going back in with the elf's bully
again and i'm just going to comb them up
and I've kind of been enjoying the
rugged brow looks like just kind of like
untamed like kind of pushed up sort of
crazy browse I don't
yeah alright the next thing I'm going to
do is line my waterline with the Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil in the
shade mugshot and I'm going to put this
on my waterline it looks like I'm poking
my eye out everybody says when I do this
on camera they're like oh my god please
don't kill yourself and I'm like um if I
think about that while I'm doing this I
probably welcome myself by accident so I
just kind of close my eyes and do you
know my tight line and my waterline at
the same time oh my god did you see that
that was that was not cute um but I just
I can't do the tight line thing where
you go like this and then you put it on
like my eye starts like flickering and
twitching so I just like to do it like
that all right next I'm going to go
ahead and put on this sephora rouge bomb
and this is in 60 15 a and I've been
wearing all of these bombs this week I
have three different ones but this has
been my favorite shade and I'm just
putting it kind of on the middle part of
my lips and then rubbing my lips
together and that was it what the heck
is on there is a piece of buzz why you
under alright so that is what it's on my
lips and then we're gonna go ahead and
curl dose a girl liskeard eyelashes
so I'm going to be taking up my Revlon
lash curler and I'm just going to curl
my lashes on each side for 10 seconds 1
2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 and I like to pump the
wand so that I have like a little
countdown going and also because I feel
like it really makes it so that you
don't get like an indent you know like
so it doesn't look like it's like
crimped like I don't want crimp lashes I
want them curled all right next we are
going to go in with where is that flesh
where are you there is my BH Cosmetics
fluffy crease brush and we're going to
go into the Stila pallets so I'm going
to be taking this color right here this
pinky matte color which is called
alluring and I'm going to put this all
over my lid and a little
bit underneath my eye as well which I
like to do just to make sure that we can
blend our eye shadows out really really
nicely and seamlessly because I am one
of those people I don't like to spend
tons of time blending my eyeshadow I'm
just not about that life alright and
then I'm going to go back in with it
really really kind of focus it on the
brush not tap off the excess and I'm
going to work that into my crease and
you may be thinking but you just put
this all over your lid like how does
that work um well I don't really know
but it gives a little bit of dimension
and I just want it to look like we have
a little bit of something going on in
the crease and I'm just kind of going
mess lay back and forth circular motions
and then we're going to go in with the
morphe and five thirteen brush and I'm
going to go into the shade right here
this kind of like purpley topi color and
the shade is called dynamic we're just
going to put this into the crease with
back and forth motions not building it
up too much because I've been liking
kind of natural eye makeup this week for
sure just natural makeup in general i
guess you could say i have weeks like
that where I'm like oh lateral and then
other days are I'm like mmm I'll take
like 10 layers of the kat von d
foundation of my face please alright
going back and forth in the crease back
and forth alright and then next I am
going to go ahead and go back to that
morphe brush again and i'm just going to
blend that back and forth quickly make
sure there's no harsh lines and then we
are going to go in with we are you thick
toothbrush a sigma e35 brush and I'm
going to take the kind of crease color
or the liner color which is probably my
least favorite out of the whole palette
I felt like all of the liners in these
pallets were kind of a mess and I'm just
going to focus this on the outer part of
my eye and do a little bit of a V here
it's hard because the consistency on
these all the liner shades in these
pallets are really really like rough and
they're hard to blend so I'm not going
to crazy by the way that dark color is
auld glamorous and it is not a glamorous
eyeshadow let me tell you I don't like
shadows like this where I really have to
blend all right so after I've done that
I'm going to go back in with a course on
my page cosmetics fluffy crease and I'm
going to go in circular motions to blend
this outer beat part out and I'm really
kind of digging in there because again
this one can be difficult to blend this
particular shade I hate when like you
have like a perfect palette and then
like one eyeshadow is a total mess and
it's like why of course it's like an
eyeshadow that you need like I really
like to define that area of my eyes so
it's like yeah I need that one and I
don't like working with it all right
next I'm going to go in to this color
right here I'm going to take it on my
finger and it's a beautiful kind of
metallic gold color the shade is called
passionate and I am just going to tap
this right onto my lid and on the inner
corner of my eye and do it on the other
eye sorry if you guys see me looking
down and looking into this mirror I
still need to figure out my mirror
situation especially if i'm going to be
doing a look of the week every single
week i need a mirror right there in
front of me i actually have one I just
need to hang it you guys it's yes
alright and then I'm going to go back in
and blend one more time kind of blend
everything together so that it looks
nice and molded and then we're going to
take that cream color with the same
brush and the cream color is called
dynamic wait did I say that already yes
I don't know if I used that already and
put it right underneath my brow on the
inner corner of my eye and then take the
excess right underneath my eye as well
and then I'm going to go in with my
little it cosmetics buki radiance
brushes angled I'm going to pick up any
sort of fall out um a lot of the powders
in here are quite you know they're quite
pottery so you do get a little bit of
Fallout and then we're going to go ahead
and put our eyelashes on
not our eyelashes we're just going to
put the mascara on I'm going to be using
the Dior iconic over crawl at mascara as
my first layer and then I will be going
in yeah with my tarts Oh hairball I'll
be going in with my tarts lights camera
lashes mascara and normally I like to
pair my i should actually use this
mirror so i don't look like you guys can
see up my nose but normally I like to
use my Urban Decay subversion lash
primer this week I've just been liking
natural lashes too so I haven't been
doing that and I'm just putting one even
layer of this on and then before it
dries I will go in with the tart lights
camera lashes and again I'll talk about
these more in tomorrow's video you will
see if they were thing a little holiday
oh so here is the tarts lights camera
lashes I'm going to apply it one layer
of this what walking out there alright
one layer this a LAN I think we are good
to go I believe that will be to look for
the day and I used most of the products
that I shot my stash with and I wonder
if you guys can tell which ones I like
and which ones I don't like by seeing it
on my face we're seeing me apply the
product I'll be interesting to see
alright and then I'm going to let that
kind of dry for a second and I like to
go back in with my steward steal a brush
with my BH Cosmetics brush and just kind
of run over the area again like my whole
I area underneath and everything just to
kind of make sure it there's no little
crumbs or anything I don't that's just
something that I do alright and that is
it actually the last thing we're going
to do is set in everything with the elf
illuminating diskin set so let me do
that first then we'll let that dry and
then I will run out of the brush
underneath my eyes and over my eyes and
I do like this illuminating my set it is
nice I talked about this before I will
be talking about it again tomorrow so
we're just going to let that kind of set
and then I have to figure out what I
should do with my hair today and they
get a messy bun it is maybe I should put
a bun maker in I don't really know I
just put like heaps of dry shampoo
in and while this video's super long I
hope you guys don't mind um I swear did
I have like a hairball on my throat um
and let me know down below if you guys
want me like for the look of the week I
mean I like to just sit here and do like
the whole face so that you guys can see
all the products in action but maybe you
only want to see the I log or you know
whatever because guys know I don't edit
my videos so they do tend to be a little
longer but I thought it made more sense
to do like the whole face look alright
so let's go back in with that steal a
brush again I'm gonna go back in with my
ELF tone correcting powder swirl in
there tap off the excess take that
underneath the eye the lid I'm making
sure there's no little mascara crumbs or
harsh lines and that is the look of the
week guys I've really been enjoying this
sort of look it's very like basic and of
course if I wasn't talking normally this
takes me BB 10 minutes to do so yeah
this is what it looks like obviously not
a lot of coverage on the facial area
really really natural kind of lip this
one has been my favorite out of all
three is it I shopped and squashed us
for that shut and swatched at my stash
with and then yeah the I look is really
um natural very very natural so anyway
this is the look of the week I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know what
you think of this series I just thought
it kind of made sense to see the
products in action because I do get
asked a lot like in my fails and holy
girls people still asking you know in
the comments section okay you said that
products you know a Holy Grail but how
does it apply to the skin so you guys
can see all of the products applying it
to my skin hmm oh my god Carol alright
guys so that is it um I don't know what
else to say that is my look of the week
and I hope you know i'm joking when i
say here ball i say that because i love
cats and i like to pretend I'm a cat so
today I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys next week let me know
if you like this concept where I
literally sit here for 24 minutes which
is kind of long or if you just want to
see like the I look or just the face
look or whatever or like the base of you
know let me know in the comments section
and I thought these would tie together
well so like Monday
Saturday Sunday but of course let me
know down below if you like this idea if
you don't like this idea again I just
want to say I'm obviously not a makeup
artist though I'm not calling this a
