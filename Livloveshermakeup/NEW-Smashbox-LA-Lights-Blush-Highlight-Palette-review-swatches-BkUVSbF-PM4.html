please excuse my nose I know it's all
red I've been blowing my nose all day
and I was telling myself don't blow your
nose because then it's gonna look all
red and ugly in video but yes I'm
blowing it now and now it looks likely
my makeup came off please excuse that I
wore our head cold but anyway in this
video I am here to give you guys a
review and also swatches on the news
Smashbox LA lights blush and highlight
palette in the shade Pacific Coast pink
I purchased this on the hsn.com a
website for $35 and says I purchased it
it is now available on these smashbox
website and also I believe the
sephora.com website I'm going to leave
all the links down below so you guys can
go and check it out if you are
interested they do have three different
shades I got the one called Pacific
Coast pink which gives you a dark pink a
medium pink and then a pink highlight
they also have a coral one and then they
have like a berry bun and I was really
attracted to the coral and very fun but
I told myself I said no if you're gonna
get a little blush palette you might
look at pink ones because honestly I've
so many very toned blushes and so many
coral and peach tone blushes so actually
these kind of colors even though they
look very standard and don't have a lot
of these in my collection which is why I
got this one so anyway like I said this
is $35 and I was a little surprised when
I opened it I saw the packaging you know
with like $35 like how much product is
here so basically the two blushes that
you get in here are points two with the
zero ounces or five point eight grams
and then the highlighter is point 10
ounces or two point nine grams and I
just feel like I was not expecting the
palette to be this small and at first I
didn't like that but now I like it
because this is so compact and easy to
travel with I'm actually going to be
having this in my purse at all times I
think it's so compact and sleek and you
open it up it's just you know plastic
packaging you open it up you have a nice
sized mirror and then here are the three
shades that you get so the deep pink
color over here is called rich pink you
have true pink in the middle and then
highlight pink so you get kind of like a
deep-toned pink you get a medium tone
pink and then eight
highlighter so overall I'm really really
liking this palette so far like I said I
think it's super travel friendly and
compact and easy to carry in your purse
the formulation is beautiful very
blendable very very creamy very
pigmented the only thing I don't like
about it is the fact that the highlight
is just dark
it's just straight-up dark and I feel
like for my fair skin I want a highlight
that's actually going to highlight my
face not look so dark on my skin that
when I turn my head or when I turn it
like my hands if I have a swatch I don't
want it to look you know really really
dark it really truly is like a pink
color that have a little bit of shine to
it but it's not super high lady if that
makes sense now
they kind of don't claim that this is
supposed to be a true highlighter the
point of like this whole little palette
is supposed to be to sculpt out your
cheeks so they think to use the darker
shade kind of like to chisel out your
cheekbones and then you use the medium
shade on the actual apples of your
cheeks and then you go in with a
highlight on your actual like cheekbone
area and that's how they describe it in
their little pamphlet here it does come
with a wonderful pamphlet that actually
describes how you should use that this
palette depending on what kind of say
shape you have so you have her shape
which is I have heart shaped face you
have oval you have rectangle you have
Browns and you have square and it
basically tells you exactly where to put
the blush and highlight depending on
your face shape which I think it's
really really cool
I love when um you know beauty products
actually have these little pamphlets I
personally keep these because I find
them very helpful and I think this one
is especially helpful kiss is actually
showing you like it's not like one of
one size fits all is showing you
depending on what kind of face shape you
actually have where you want to put the
product so I feel like this is kind of
like a sculpting palette it's not
necessarily like this is gonna be a
super super like in-your-face sort of
highlight it's really kind of sculpting
like this is for your cheek bone apple
of the cheek and then right on your did
I call it a brow bone earlier no right
on your cheek bone a constant brow bone
no
so anyway I am wearing them today and I
have been wearing them for about 13
hours now and I feel like they have worn
quite well I like to apply these with a
little more of like a dense brush kind
of like aid I'll show you guys it's like
this Tarte stipple brush it's really
really nice I applied at my bronzer with
this today but I like it because it's
quite dense however it still have a
little bit of give to it I like to swirl
the product tap off the excess and then
stipple it on the area where I want to
put the color normally I don't like to
pair all three colors together I just
did for the sake of this video to show
you guys kind of what they're talking
about but I would say my favourite color
in here is the medium tone pink which is
called true pink which is a beautiful
warm almost coral II sort of shade that
is what it looks like
it's just absolutely stunning I love it
all over the apples of my cheeks and
just beautiful so the formulation is
really nice on these they do wear all
day especially if you have worn a primer
or you have a setting spray on I think
they're really beautiful this is the
true pink shade a beautiful kind of warm
tones lovely pink shade I don't know how
to describe it and I would say the two
blushes in here are kind of like a
satiny texture or a satiny finish this
is the dark pink shade and I really like
it because they're not completely flat
and matched they have like a little bit
of Sheen to them but nothing that's -
nothing that you could really pick up on
if that makes sense but they just glide
on beautifully on the cheeks
there's the darker pink shade right
there they are kind of similar when you
swatch them out which was another thing
I was like oh they look so similar the
packaging is so small I don't really
like the highlight at first I thought
maybe I want to return this palette but
I actually really really like it and
then we have the highlight here and the
highlight I like to personally use as a
blush topper not gonna lie this is not
like the greatest highlight for me
because it is quite dark and it's just
not really a highlight on my skin tone
so there is the highlight so we have the
middle shade we have the darkest pink
and then the highlight so all of them
paired together are really beautiful I
really like to take that highlight and
just use it as a blush topper on you
know the two of these but overall I am
gonna go ahead and keep this palette
even though it was $35 and you don't get
tons of product in here it is super
sleek and compact
easy to travel with and I'm going to
carry it in
purse so I think this is nice if you are
looking to have a little bit of color
that you can carry around in your purse
I don't think it's the most amazing
blush palette that has ever been you
know released or anything like that and
I don't really like that they call it a
highlighting and blush palette because I
feel like that's not really what it is
it's more like a sculpting palette for
the cheeks because that highlight is
definitely not universal for every
single skin tone but for the most part I
think it is pretty darn good I am happy
with the purchase and I am going to keep
it what I purchased the other two no I
wouldn't I don't think I need them but
yeah so those are my thoughts on this
new little Smashbox la lights of blush
and highlight palette I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me I'm sorry about my bunny nose
and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
