my channel today I do have my review for
you guys on the new Too Faced chocolate
gold eyeshadow palette I did purchase
mine for $49 only to face calm website
it is also available on the Sephora calm
website as well as the Ulta calm website
if this is a cruelty-free palette and it
is a permanent alongside the rest of the
chocolate Gold Collection if you guys
are curious and this is they do a
chromatic mattes and metallic eyeshadow
palette that is infused with real gold
and cocoa powder you are getting 14
smaller eyeshadow pans to have 0.85
grams of products in them as well as to
larger pans that you have two grams of
products per pan so the two that you are
getting that have two grams of product
per pan are obviously a rollin in the
dough as well as chocolate gold and then
the rest of them you are getting point
eight five grams of product which is
really really nice so anyway here's
what's in the outer packaging that looks
like it basically is just a little hard
a box like this you have the ingredients
listed on the back as well as a little
color matching a chart and then the
actual palette looks a little something
like this now this is different than the
other chocolate bar palette if you guys
are familiar with my channel you
probably know that I had decluttered at
my regular chocolate bar palette I
wasn't reaching for it so often but I do
love and the bon bons palette and I
absolutely love the semi-sweet palette
that is my all-time favorite you're
getting the same sort of packaging here
except this is actually plastic this is
a really really durable plastic though
and I do like that have a snap closure I
don't feel like this is gonna open up
although I really do like the feel of
the metal tin when it comes to the Too
Faced chocolate bar palettes I do notice
that if I drop mine or it slides across
the floor they do start to bend out of
shape so I actually really do like this
packaging at first when I saw it I was
like I'm not a huge fan of that
packaging but I actually really do enjoy
it as you guys can see it is a chocolate
bar with the gold kind of melting over
it and I just really like it I like the
whole concept I like the packaging I
like the way it feels to my hands and I
feel like this is very durable and very
very safe when we do pop the palette
open we actually have a huge and mirror
going on here which I always appreciate
when they put a nice big mirror in
palettes like this whether it be a
fucking like blush trio or a
highlighting color and I
jano palin i like to have a large mirror
so i do enjoy that it takes up the whole
surface area and then inside as you guys
can see this is what the color selection
looks like this reminds me a lot of
their old-school palette that was called
the pretty rebel palette now about two
years ago I actually decluttered that
out of my collection but the more I play
with this the more I have liked it
reminds me of that palette and the tones
in here and the colors in here are just
very very festive and they're very fun
they're bright pops of color and then
they do have a few shades here now
obviously you can work together any
sorta I love because you have a
transition you have a brow bone color
you have a liner shade and then you have
a crease color so if you guys are
curious about what shades I have on my
eyes today I took rolling in the dough
and I did place that all over my lid as
my blending shade and then I did go in
with the shade so bougie which is the
transition it's a really nice kind of
camel mid-tone color and I worked that
into my crease as my transition and this
shade right here does darken up a little
bit on the eyes so if you are fair
complected just be aware of that you
definitely want to tap off your brush
the Matteson here are incredibly
pigmented although they don't blend as
beautifully as the matsing the other
chocolate bar palette sleeve really are
incredibly pigmented I then went in with
cocoa truffle and I took cocoa truffle
and I just worked that right into my
outer via and then I took a little bit
of decadence on my lower lashline and
then I did take this guy right here
which is called love and cocoa this is
one of the beautiful foil sheets in the
palette this foil shades and the
glitters in here are really the
standouts which I know probably sounds
kind of funny coming from me because I
usually am on Too Faced about their
glitter shades but this is a really well
put together palette and these are
pressed very very nicely and then I did
take classy and sassy and I put that all
over my lid this is a fucking great
palette you guys I am so excited for Too
Faced because lately let's be honest
there have been a lot of duds from Too
Faced but knowing that this is a good
palette and I would give this a solid 4
out of 5 stars for the holiday season I
feel like I can definitely go ahead and
purchase other products from the
chocolate gold collection without having
to worry so I really do enjoy the color
selection in here I like what they did
with the shades it's very popular right
now for palettes to be coming out with
only shimmer it finishes so if you're
not into shimmer finishes if you're not
into those more a glitter kind of infuse
shades of stuff that you would pop onto
your lid or that you would smoke on on
your lower lash line got
the Urban Decay heavy metals palette
this is not going to be the one for you
but the thing that this has over the
Urban Decay heavy metals palette is
first of all the packaging on the heavy
metals palette is really not user
friendly I also find some of the shades
just difficult to work with in general
but I understand what they're for I
would never pick up a palette that has
all shimmer finishes in it thinking okay
I'm gonna go ahead and work those into
my outer-v in my crease unless you're
incredibly talented and you're able to
do that go ahead and do that but for me
when I see a palette like this with you
know a finish across the board that's
very very prominent I automatically know
hello this is gonna be for my lid and my
lower lash line now compared to the
Urban Decay heavy metals palette which I
give a solid 4 out of 5 stars to which
one would I recommend out of the two
honestly this one is easier to work with
I'm loving the formula whatever they did
here and they need to do more of like I
said the mattes in here you guys really
aren't as stock and creamy as some of
the other masks that you do get in the
other chocolate bar palette that was
something I was noticing across the
board but they are incredibly pigmented
when I do my live swatches which I will
have a time stamp down below for you
guys to fast forward to if you're
interested you will be able to see just
one swipe how pigmented the black shade
is how pigmented that transition is and
that says a lot
I enjoyed that they are kind of amping
up and you know redoing their
pigmentation level because for a while
there I did feel like two-faced shadows
we're getting a little less pigmented
over time you know get a little more
scratchy getting a little less pigmented
but I have to say I really think they
stepped up their game with this palette
now these are not this same sort of
consistency as say the Urban Decay
having the most palette the thing about
those shadows is you touch them and you
feel like it's moist almost like it
could almost be a cream a product they
are so incredibly soft these definitely
have a little bit of a harder layer that
you have to build into and you kind of
have to dig into but once you get into
there they're great because these really
don't have a lot of fallout
one of the things about the Urban Decay
have you metals palette that drove me
nuts was the fallout I feel like I have
to use the glitter glue I feel like I
have to foil them there are a few shades
in here when I do the live swatches I'll
let you guys know which ones there are a
few shades in here like I you know new
money and just a few of them but
definitely feel a little more gritty and
I will notice a little bit of sparkle
throughout the day but none of these
happens
scene amounts of chunks of glitter in
them and that is so different for
two-face it's like they have these
finely milled little glitters in there
but they're barely noticeable because
you have this nice kind of Sheen foil
thing going on so I'm incredibly
impressed with this formula I don't
think I've ever really seen a formula
like this from two-face to be completely
honest I love that they're very bound
together in a nice way they're pressed
nicely but not too firmly but not too
loosely and they're just very very easy
to work with you guys so I feel like I
can tap these on with my finger onto my
lid and also I can put them on a pencil
brush and smoke them out on my lower
lash line and that is what I would
ultimately recommend you guys use this
palette for and obviously when you look
at it as you guys can see this is going
to need supplementary palettes so unless
you want to use these three shades over
here are these four shades over here
every single day as your transition as
your crease color as your liner shade
this obviously is going to be a palette
that you want to pull in with another
palette so say you have the Sonia Kashuk
eye on neutral palette or maybe you have
the Urban Decay Naked basics 1/2 fucking
the big Urban Decay Naked basics palette
whatever it is that you want you might
want to go in and play with different
tones so that you can play with a
different lid colors and different
aligner colors but overall you guys this
is a really nice palette and I'm really
fuckin excited I'm really really excited
so pigmentation is definitely there as
far as longevity is concerned these are
really really nice I do you notice a
little bit of creasing on my eyelids
throughout the day but I just have those
kind of eyelids that don't ever hold up
all day long you know what I'm saying
and it's mostly if I'm gonna put like a
foiled sheet on there I do feel like I
get a little bit of creasing but overall
I mean this is this is a really solid
palette so that's all I really have to
say let's go ahead and jump right into
the live swatches and go ahead and start
with money bags a love Coco and Halle
for a dolla those are those three shades
right there so we're gonna start with
money bags which is that beautiful kind
of forest green shade it really does
remind me of Christmastime but I have a
little bit of like a gold Sheen running
through it so maybe that's why it
reminds me of Christmas but it is a
beautiful beautiful color as you guys
can see up next we have love and cocoa
this is like a true kind of deep rose
gold color it does remind me a little
bit of classy and sassy but this one is
just a shade deeper in my opinion and
they go on beautifully as you guys can
see this one definitely doesn't have any
glitter infused into it it's just a
really really true kind of deeper rose
gold shade
and then finally we have hollow fatahna
and this one is a beautiful a dirty
green color a little more on the chunky
side a little more grit going on there
and definitely a little bit of I don't
know how to explain it it's not really
like a true fucking glitter in there
like it fused in there but it definitely
has a little bit of grit to it it feels
slightly crispy to the touch you do get
the tiniest amount of fallout when you
use this so I would recommend going
ahead and foiling it but at the top we
have money bags that we have love and
cocoa then we have hollow for a dollar
next we're gonna go ahead and swatch out
chocolate gold old money and gold digger
gold dipped for those three right there
so chocolate gold is that beautiful
stunning like 14 karat gold kind of
color I mean this looks so filed on the
skin it is absolutely amazing and as you
guys can probably see right here it's a
very very high shine impact all the
money definitely have a little more uh
orangie kind of shades going on here or
orangie tones going on here it still
goes on really beautifully very very
foiled but maybe not as high-impact as
chocolate gold so at the top we have
chocolate gold that we have old money
and then gold dipped you would think
that this would have a little more gold
and it actually is kind of like a true
silvery color with a little bit of
yellow undertones that's how I would
personally describe it definitely a
little more chunky but not glittery so
those three shades right there are
beautiful very foiled looking like I
said the last one is a little chunkier
not so much like glitter infused it's
hard to describe with this palette it
just feels a little rougher and it is a
little rougher to apply to the eyes I
mean it needs maybe a little more
building up on the eye
that's how I'll go ahead and fucking
describe it so at the top we have
chocolate gold then we have old money
and then we do have a gold dipped
alright let's move on into new money as
well as the shade live in lavish so new
money is that beautiful kind of color
that's very similar to totally fetch
from their other palettes now this one
like I said is a little bit of a
disappointment I just feel like it's
really hard to pack onto the lid or the
lower lash line it definitely requires a
glitter glue for it to last all day or
even to get on there full pigment and
you do have to foil it but this guy
right here which is called living lavish
which is a beautiful kind of purpley
shade I really like this purple I think
the purple czar hard to do or at least
that's what I've heard and although it
is a little bit chunky
I do still think that you get that high
impact to look when you get it on to the
eyes so obviously you guys can see
they're really foil shades over here
versus the ones that are maybe not as
pigmented and have a little more grit to
them but still really beautiful so over
here we have new money and live in
lavish it's time to move on to a little
more of a cool-toned row over here at
the top we have a rich girl and then we
have famous and drippin diamond so rich
girl is kind of like a silver shade with
a little bit of a pink undertone it's
not something that you would notice
unless you swatch it right next to drip
in diamonds but drip in Diamonds has
that true silvery blueish undertone and
this has just the tiniest amount of a
pinky undertone and it really is
absolutely gorgeous you guys so here is
the first shade this one is called rich
girl and then we have famous and famous
is kind of like a step lower and then
old money but it's a little more on the
bronze tone side I feel like when you
swatch this next to chocolate gold old
money and gold dip which is that really
really foiled row you're gonna get a
great eye look I mean if you just want
to layer those together do something on
the lid if you have the skills to work
that into your crease or put it on your
lower lash line it's absolutely stunning
so I really do like that shade right
there very foiled very smooth on the
eyes and then we do have drippin
diamonds which is a little rough to the
touch but it's gorgeous and as you guys
can see it is that steel blue kind of
silvery color and when i swatched it
next to the other one hopefully you guys
can see a little bit of that topi pinky
shift at the top which is rich girl
famous obviously is the bronze and then
we have a drippin diamonds which is the
true silver blue up next we have two
mats we have cocoa truffle which is that
matte burnt brown kind of color and this
is basically like a warm chocolatey a
brown color and I don't feel like these
swatch amazingly and they do take a
little bit of building on the eyes but
not like too much building it's hard to
describe these aren't the best Maps the
two faces ever come out with that's what
I'm trying to say and then here is
decadent and decadent is just a true of
black and this is a good black as far as
pigmentation is concerned but it is very
very hard to blend so I definitely
prefer the shimmers and the glitters in
this palette over and the mattes
alright and then here we have classy and
sassy classy and sassy is what I have on
my lid today this is the beautiful true
kind of rose gold color I love this all
over the lid I also like it on the inner
corner of the
as well as on the lower lashline just a
really a beautiful color so those are
the next let's see here one two three
four five shades five j7 5 shades
apparently I do not know how to count
because that was six shades and now we
finally have the last two which are so
abou G as well as rollin in the dough so
let's go ahead and swatch those out so
boo she is definitely in that beautiful
kind of transition shade it's kind of
like a camel color with a little bit of
like a it's a neutral tone okay it's a
very neutral tone going on here I
actually love this as the transition and
this mat is really really nice and then
as far as rollin in the dough is
concerned I prefer the other kind of
bigger bars in the chocolate bar pallets
I just feel like the all-over brow
colors in there are very very soft and
creamy this one's definitely soft and
creamy but it's a little more chalky and
the pigmentation although it is very
high-impact as you guys can see the
pigmentation is great with the mattes in
here they're just a little harder to
blend that's all but I don't really care
because there's not too many mattes in
here and I feel like the masks they did
put in here we're very very nice as far
as like corresponding when it comes to
the other shades in the palette so
anyway just wanted to let you guys know
so we have a so bougie
right yeah and then rolling in the dough
so anyway guys those are my review and
swatches on at this particular palette I
would give this a solid 4 out of 5 stars
I think Too Faced did a great job I know
that I'm one of those people that often
is quite hard on to face but that's only
when they don't release good products
they used to be my favorite brand I have
a lot of respect for Too Faced Orly like
you do it there are certain things that
have happened with the brand that I
don't so much agree with but I will say
I think this is a good palette and if
you're looking for something festive and
fun for the holiday season that has a
lot of shimmers in it that you can use
as a supplementary palette I would 100%
recommend this so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me guys and I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
