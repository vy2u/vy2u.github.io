I wanted to do a review on the new Too
Faced ice queen mascara it looks like
this and I actually really did not like
this mascara I used it today and I've
been wearing my makeup for about six
hours but already it has started to
flake like crazy and I just found it to
be really really difficult to apply I've
used it a few times
um this week and each time I've used it
I have absolutely not liked it I think
because the brush is so ginormous this
is the part that kind of throws
everything off it pokes you in the eye
it doesn't coat every single lash
because the bristles are so uneven and I
just really didn't like that I think if
you are gonna use this for something
when it comes to mascara it is best to
just use it like this and pick up the
areas that you really want to make
longer like on your bottom lashes um I
think that would work because it's got
those different size of bristles but
other than that um I will not be using
this really I'm just not super happy
with it I have had much better mascaras
much better luck with the Too Faced
brand in general I love the toothpaste
brands so I was really disappointed that
this didn't work out for me
I definitely recommend the better than
sex mascara from Too Faced and also in
the same price range is the they're real
from benefit I would say get these over
this one so that is my review I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
