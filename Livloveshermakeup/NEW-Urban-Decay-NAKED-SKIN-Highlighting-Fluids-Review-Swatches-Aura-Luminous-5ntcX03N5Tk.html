my channel today's video is going to be
a review on two out of the five new
Urban Decay Naked skin a highlighting of
fluids I did pick up the shade luminous
which is a cool toned white shade with
gold iridescent running through it as
well as the shade Ora which is a
beautiful cool toned pink color with
silvery iridescence running through it
this is what the outer packaging looks
like really nice kind of almost
holographic pinky box which i think is
adorable and the packaging and the size
is exactly the same as their color
correcting fluids and I believe their
original concealer so I was very excited
to get these and as you guys can
probably tell from the thumbnail they
are not working out for me whatsoever I
would really advise against purchasing
these but if you think you really really
do want them I'll go ahead and leave a
link down below in the description bar
where you can go ahead and purchase them
from the sephora.com website it's not an
affiliate link it will just take you
directly there so I have a huge fan of
the Urban Decay Naked skin line I've
recently really really fallen in love
with their products try it out to the
foundation which i think is beautiful on
the skin one of the most gorgeous
foundations on the actual face in my
opinion I also have their hybrid
complexion Perfector which I use all the
time when I'm sick I love it I really do
enjoy their color correcting fluencies
are the best color correctors on the
market in my opinion I own all five
shades and I just think overall you know
what I'm into it I really like their
naked skin line I was a little confused
when they released these because I was
thinking okay naked skin the point of
the naked skin line is that you are
going to be wearing something that's
very very beautiful and lightweight and
looks very skin-like but I was thinking
why are they releasing highlighting
fluids and the fact that they call them
highlighting fluids makes me think that
it is going to be a highlighting product
but if you read on the actual Sephora
website they describe these as strobing
powders or I'm sorry strobing liquid
illuminators so the thing about strobing
powders are strobing the liquid
illuminators is the fact that those are
definitely a little more subtle which i
understand a really great example of
that is the hourglass ambient strobe
lighting powder I love these these are
one of my favorite formulas as far as
highlighter is concerned this particular
shade right here is called incandescent
light and this gives the most beautiful
natural gorgeous gorgeous glow from
within kinda highlights there is a huge
difference between this and these new
highlighting fluids I find that no
matter how much I layer these I just
cannot get them to actually show up on
my skin so today let me just kind of
come in a little closer I'm
we wearing these I have it on my
cheekbones down the bridge of my nose
and on my chin I have both of these
layered I put a lot on I don't think you
guys can even see anything I purposely
wore very very light makeup today so
that you guys could hopefully see even
just a little bit of highlighting going
on if you see something around my cheek
area here that is actually from the Too
Faced Papa don't peach blush so that's
not even coming from these so I find
that overall and they just really don't
strobe my face they don't highlight my
face they really don't give me anything
I just feel like I'm just putting extra
layers of products on so one thing I
really want to say quickly is the fact
that I don't like that these liquid is
strobing illuminators can't go on top of
an hour to powder to face already powder
to face I am someone who does have combo
skin so I like to make sure that I can
actually layer liquid illuminators on
top of my powder I have a few great
examples here that I can do that with
I'm the NARS Copacabana illuminator any
of the NARS illuminators I'm able to do
that with the Becca shimmering skin
perfectors in the liquid version I'm
able to do that and then something from
the drugstore the card can be glow all
the way liquid illuminators and also
able to do that and they don't disturb
or move around my foundation these new
highlight includes from Urban Decay
unfortunately do move my foundation and
one of them even has glitter particles
in it
they shade luminous does and I was
wearing this on Monday and shot my stash
and a few of you were like oh my god you
know your pores look so emphasized
texture all over the place I layered
this together with the anasazi of
Beverly Hills Nicole Guerrero glow kit
and I was just thinking because these
weren't giving me a lot of pigment I
could go ahead and layer them with a
powder product and unfortunately they
look absolutely horrible layered and you
need the powder product if you are
someone who does have combo skin these
are gonna slip and slide all over your
face even if I wear a tacky foundation
and a setting spray they do not last if
you have really aging or dry skin I find
that this particular shade like I said
really leaves a lot of like glitter
particles on my face the aura she
doesn't but it's not nearly as pigmented
and like I said this already doesn't
even have good pigment to it so I find
these really really useless to be
completely honest I think Urban Decay
just thought you know what our naked
skin line does so well let's go ahead
and throw in some highlighting fluids
people will love them no people are not
loving them they are getting horrible
ratings on the sephora.com website and I
agree with absolutely everything that
everyone is saying about these so in the
color selection I do have to say good a
few good things the color selection is
good I like
color selection I like that they have
their really nice like soft opalescent
white shade they have the pink they have
some deeper shades they have a skywalk
shade which is like a beautiful
holographic kind of like bluish greenish
color I do think the color selection is
good it's fun it's nice it's a
difference but I don't think that these
are going to work for a lot of people
unless you have absolutely perfect skin
it that doesn't have any texture you're
not super oily you're not super dry that
is like the only way that I think these
would really work because the
pigmentation is just so poor the wear
time is so poor they move around the
foundation you literally have to go in
with these right after you apply your
foundation and then powder on top and
then even then it takes away from the
actual color so yeah really really
disappointed with these you guys I
really can't say enough horrible things
about them the only good things that I
really think are okay with them are the
fact that they have a good color
selection and also the fact that you
know what that's it that's it's just the
color selection there is nothing else
that's really good about these in my
opinion so let me go ahead and show you
guys some swatches quickly I'm gonna try
and build these up so you really can
tell here is the shade aura and I'm
really really kind of swiping this on
here so here is the shade aura as you
guys can see looks really pretty when I
really build up the swatch there and
then let me blend it into the skin
to show you guys what it looks like
blended ends so there is the shade aura
blended in you can see it a tiny bit of
a shift which is nice but you have to
imagine putting this on over a
foundation and then going in with a
powder so that it doesn't slip and slide
around and then you're left with way
less coverage or way less glow in color
and then here is the shade luminous so
this one I would say is definitely a
little more pigmented but it has glitter
particles in it so here is the shade
Luminess which again it looks really
pretty and then you put it in or you
massage it into the skin and then it's
kind of just like a barely there kind of
color I mean it may look nice on camera
but for me personally I find the C's are
just they disappear into my skin they
literally my face just eats these up and
I just I really I really don't like
these so I would advise against
purchasing these again if you have
really really good skin I'm sure that
maybe they would work for you and if you
love a very very subtle highlight okay
extremely subtle they would work for you
but for me they're just a no-no so thank
you so much for joining me for this
quick little ranty review I guess I will
see you guys tomorrow for a Sephora haul
