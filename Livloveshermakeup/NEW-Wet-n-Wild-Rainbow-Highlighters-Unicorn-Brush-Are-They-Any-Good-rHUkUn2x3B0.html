my channel today's video is going to be
a review and swatches on some new
products from wet-and-wild so about a
month ago a when while did release this
unicorn collection they had some I
figment some lip products they had some
highlighters and of course a unicorn
horn brush and I was like I have to jump
on that so I did not pick up the big
kids that came with like the little
silver unicorn on the front where you
got all of the products from the
collection instead I did pick them up
one by one from Ulta now one of them was
sent to me by a my friend Trina it is
the rainbow highlighter in unicorn glow
this was actually sent to me back in
January when this highlighter first
released so thank you so much to Trina
she was able to pick this up in her
Walgreens I could not find this anywhere
so she did pick that one up for me but I
purchased the rest on the ultra comp
website this little guy right here is
the limited edition bronze over the
rainbow highlight and this one is what I
have on my eyes today this does retail
for $5.99 on the all TOCOM website and
then here we have everlasting glow this
one is more pinky toned great for those
of you with a fair complexion it's what
I have on as my actual highlight today
and this one is also $5.99 on the Alta
kama website and then of course we have
the unicorn horn brush which is adorable
I do have my shades up today so
hopefully you guys can see the really
really pretty colors that are going on
here but we have like a gunmetal effect
right here on the actual handle the
ferrule is like a gunmetal shade and
then you have the actual green and
purple going through it so it literally
looks like a unicorn horn it is super
super cute and I believe this does
retail for 3 dollars and 99 cents or
$4.99 depending on where you pick it up
so anyway let's go ahead and start the
review with this little guy beautiful
beautiful little brush I will go ahead
and pick up some more of them I wouldn't
say it's the best highlighting brush
ever but for you know under $5 or under
$6 you really can't beat it so again
this is what it looks like up close you
do get some nice synthetic soft bristles
all of this is cruelty free and I
believe this brush is vegan very very
nice and soft I do notice that when I
wash wet and wild brushes whether it be
their eye brushes or their face brushes
after a while the bristles do start to
kind of puff out a little more and you
get a little more of a densely packed
brush when you first get them because
they are kind of slid into that little
plastic slip it kind of makes them so
that they're more like
and they're a little thinned out but
once you do wash them you should be able
to get a little more of a fluffier brush
but this is beautiful for picking up
these particular highlighters now these
particular highlighters are not a big
Chalet formula they are not the same as
say like their mega Glo formula here is
their limited-edition let's see cure the
sweetest bling mega Glo highlighter this
is a true kind of baked chalet kind of
highlight as you guys can see that is a
beautiful beautiful formula but these
ones right here the color icon
definitely have a little more grit to
them and they definitely feel a look
crispy or to the touch maybe have a
little more glitter in them but they
still go onto the skin really
beautifully so like I said today I'm
wearing this one right here which is
called everlasting glow I just took this
brush I really really kind of swirled it
in there to pick up all of the shades I
cap off the excess a little bit and then
I just go back and forth on my cheeks
sometimes I do with a little bit of
circular motions but for the most part I
just kind of do like tapping motions and
I really do feel like this brush picks
up these particular highlighters really
really nicely I do not like the way it
picks up my other mega glow highlighters
again these are more of a baked chalet
formula so you need something that's a
little more densely packed but for any
sort of powder highlight I'm really
really enjoying this brush if there is
one thing I would recommend from this
collection go ahead and get this brush
for yourself it's absolutely adorable
and really really nice quality so again
that is the little unicorn horn a brush
absolutely loving it I hope they come
out with some more face brushes and eye
brushes like this now as far as the
actual highlights are concerned I would
say the one that is not the most
wearable is probably unicorn glow this
is definitely more of a collector's item
obviously it is like the colors of the
rainbow as you guys can see and when you
do swirl them all together you get sort
of the same sort of color as say the
Helia shade from the aurora glow kit
from Anastacio beverly hills as you can
see it's kind of like this greenish and
goldish shade I'll go ahead and swatch
it for you guys so you can see I would
say that the pigmentation level on this
particular one compared to the other two
is definitely on the lighter side so it
can be wearable but it's not the most
wearable highlight now if you want to go
individually into every single one and
wear them as eyeshadows these
highlighters really really do they're
together nicely as eyeshadow as well as
cheek product but this is probably the
one that isn't the most wearable but
probably people would want to pick it up
just to have it but it really is quite
pretty and if you want to apply it in
kind of like a stripy
motion and just take your brush and just
go like this so that you can get all
four or all five of the colors on your
actual cheek it actually does look quite
pretty so it definitely is a little more
outside of my comfort zone I don't think
I would wear a green highlighter on a
daily basis but I don't really have an
issue with trying that out once in a
while so very very cute very very pretty
definitely a little more of a
collector's item there and then we do
have the bronze over the rainbow so
bronze over the rainbow is really a
really gorgeous of bronzy tones as you
can see so today what I did is I went in
with Maya's japonesque 140 brush I
actually swirled all of the products
together tapped off the excess putting
into a my crease area and then I took
this shade right here which is like the
lightest shade that little strip pack
that onto my eyelid and then I took a
little flat shader brush and took this
deep shade right here smoked that out on
the lower lash line I love that these
kind of double as eyeshadows so if you
do want to do that again you can go
ahead and do that if you want to count
it all together I mean obviously you
would have like five or six different
shades right here but you can mix them
all together I like that it gives sort
of a look of like hey I put a lot of
effort into my eye look even though I
didn't because you're getting so many
different colors at once if you do want
to swirl your brush together and it just
gives a very very interesting sort of
look to the eye so it looks like you put
more work into it it looks like you put
more shades on even though you just kind
of swirled your brush in there and
applied it all over but I really really
like this one it is a little too deep
for me as a true highlight it definitely
is a little too shimmery and glittery to
be a bronzer on my skin but it is a very
very pretty blush topper now a lot of
people say blush toppers are not a real
thing Lib but you know what for me when
you are very fair complected they are
real things so again I will use a brush
like this or even something fluffier
I'll go and I'll pick up the product and
then I just tap it over my blush
especially if I'm wearing a more bronze
II tone blush it's super super gorgeous
and I really do like this one as well so
let me go ahead and swatch it this baby
for you guys and you know I have to say
it like the more you dig into these the
softer they do get when you first get
them they do feel a little crispy to the
touch I would say this one right here
definitely has the most pigmentation out
of all of them but that is what the
highlight looks like when you do it mix
all of these shades together really
really beautiful and then the last one
we have is my all-time favorite this is
everlasting glow beautiful beautiful
silvery pinky and white shades all mixed
together you do have a little strip
yellow right there which gives it a
little more warmth but I said what I
have on today is the highlights again
just kind of went in there put my brush
in and then just kind of tapped it on
and then did a little tiny amounts of
buffing motions now because this brush
is not too densely packed it can't
really buff it completely into the skin
but it does a good job of applying this
particular highlight gorgeous gorgeous
shade if you do have a fair complexion
especially if you pull a cool undertone
this is definitely the one that I would
pick up as you guys can hear you know
they definitely do have a little bit of
like a sandpaper II feel to them a
sandpaper a sound to them but they are
beautiful on the skin and just for a
little bit of side-by-side comparison
I'm going to go ahead and swatch the
sweetest bling which is from the mega
Glo collection just right below that one
so you can see what the two Pink's look
like I do prefer the formula on this
mega Glo one but both of them are very
very pretty and they are very similar in
color as you can see so if you weren't
able to get this one you could probably
still get this one and yeah those are
all three of the new a mega Glo
highlighter so overall guys I'm really
impressed I feel like for $5.99 $4.99
you really can't beat it I'm not gonna
sit here and it pick a product that's
literally under ten dollars I think
these are great you get a huge amount of
product in here well over five ounces I
would say you get seven point five grams
of product in here literally for under
ten dollars so I would say go ahead and
pick them all up pick up one of them if
there is one item out of the collection
I would highly recommend it is the
unicorn brush I just feel like this is
such a cute little collector's item like
I said I really hope that they do come
out with more brushes like this but yeah
very very impressed you guys for the
money you really can't beat it what I
purchased these items were $25 a piece
probably not but they're cheap they're
great they're good at the drugstore and
I really do like quality of them so I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
