have another video for you guys today at
this time we are going through my
November 2016 empties so if you would
like to see what Tom and I used up this
month then please keep on watching
alright so we're gonna start with some
makeup removing wipes as the first pack
I used up was from Olay these are the
fresh effects wiped out refreshing
makeup removal cloth I did not like
these they really really burnt my face
I'm on top of that they left a very oily
resume by the way I'm sorry if the
lighting is super super dark it's very
very overcast and rainy here today but
yeah and these just left a very oily
residue on my face and they burnt so I
would not repurchase those I would
however be purchased these so if these
are these sephora yuzu and also rose
cleansing wipes I feel like I've been
talking about these all the time lately
but I absolutely adore them so yes I
would repurchase the rose I just dropped
them but those are amazing my all-time
favorites and then the easy ones are
revitalizing and toning and I also would
repurchase these alright we of course
have some pretty but candles from Bath
and Body Works that we burnt through and
the first one is called heirloom Apple
and this is what the packaging looks
like it's so pretty I'm going to decant
it or dupatta it so I can reuse it the
fragrance notes are red Cortland apple
creamy sandalwood and marshmallow and
this really really yeah I feel like this
really reminds me of what is it
marshmallow fireside with a little bit
of added sweetness so we would
definitely repurchase that next time
next year during the fall and then also
Chestnut in clove this is a blend of
roasted chestnut clove buds pine cedar
wood and velvety moths the smell amazing
as well oh yeah it's just all so good
like a bonfire so we would repurchase
this one at two alright and then we did
burn through two of these cinnamon sugar
donut three whit candles which we adore
I love those rose gold lids but yeah
this is what cinnamon sugar doughnut
looks like and they smell amazing too
and the fragrance notes are crushed
cinnamon sugar crystals and homemade
donuts little sorry if I'm a little
itchy oh is just holding mr. badger
alright moving on I used up a pack of
these Shiseido facial cotton I love
these for putting on toner removing eye
makeup things like that they are
extremely extremely soft so I would
repurchase those we did use up at the
beach house um what is this deep
cleansing hand soap from Bath and Body
Works it is a blend of fresh Island palm
pink jasmine and Beachwood it smelled
really really good we would definitely
repurchase this next year I
if you live in like Florida or something
this would be a really nice set it just
kind of smells like the beach it's a
really really good sense oh yeah we
would repurchase that I did use up the
ultime cup removing facial towelettes as
well this is what did they look like
they were very very good very comparable
to the what are they the Neutrogena ones
in the blue pack
they smell like that one they really go
like take off your makeup nicely and
they go on to the skin very nicely
they're very soft and pillowy so I would
repurchase those I've used up in this
little snail gold a facial mask so this
was sent to me by the black abbe de
Blanton by the brand of blue scandal and
this is actually like the thing with the
snail goop in it so I don't know if it's
you know and snails like move they have
like that gooey stuff behind them I
don't know exactly what it is but that
is what you put on your face with this
mask so I did not like the smell of this
it smelled very very strange to me but
this is the Dabo eco life first solution
mask pack in snail gold and I felt like
it actually made my skin look very very
hydrated and glowy I tried it on on
snapchat and a lot of you after were
like oh my god your skin looks beautiful
but I just did not like the smell I
could not get over it so I personally
would not purchase that with my own
money nor would I recommend it to you
guys and then we did use up these
TheraBreath plus maximum strength fresh
breath toothpaste so Tom and I love this
toothpaste it's one that you have to
order online from Amazon and he likes it
cuz this doctor recommended I like it
because I get dry mouth
I take ADHD medications and also I take
lupus medications and they all give me
dry mouth so we really really like that
I am tossing in this little body lotion
here this is from the brand hemp's I
love this they used to sell this at the
hair salon that I worked at if you guys
didn't know when I was in high school I
worked at a hair salon I was a
receptionist and every time I smell this
it reminds me of bad so I really like
this scent it's a very like sentimental
but at the same time I can definitely
tell that it has gone bad so I'm gonna
pass that along I did use up a lip
smacker this is in these strawberries
and cream version I love lip balms I go
through them very quickly so that was
not in any troubles to get through we
did use up the pumpkin pecan waffle or
the wallflower duo from a bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks so this is what it looks like
I'm so tongue-tied today you guys I
don't know what it is anyway this is the
duo from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it smells
amazing
like that we would repurchase that next
fall we also did burn through another
leaves candle we burn through these like
all the way through winter almost so
this is a blend of crisp red apple
golden nectar and warm clothes spice it
smells amazing if you have never had the
opportunity to smell a leaf candle you
really should because they smell
incredible we did also use up a little
to do a pack of the marshmallow fireside
wall flowers they look like that
I do like marshmallow fireside I like
the candle too but sometimes I feel like
the candle doesn't have a very strong
scent throat I still ordered it during
the Black Friday sale which I will share
with you guys soon but yeah I just feel
like sometimes the scent is really
really good with some stuff and then
other times it's very very week so I
don't know what that's all about
I used up the garden-gate whole blends
nourishing mask this is the avocado and
shea butter one I love the Garnier whole
blends line so I would definitely
repurchase this it smells heavenly and
really really helps to condition your
hair I also used up a little mini glam
glow super mud clearing treatment I love
glam glow and I love the clearing
treatment so I would repurchase that I
used up another pack of the Shiseido
facial cuts in like I said they are my
favorite facial cotton I am dropping
 all over I'm sorry we used up the
fall lakeside breeze what is this deep
cleansing hand soap this is a blend of
blue sage sweet basil and sample wood
this smells really really good and very
very strongly a basil so if you like
that you would like this one I did use
up the covergirl plus a late CC cream in
the trone at own rehab foundation
version and 105 ivory this was in my
current project pan so I used that up
and very happy I also used up at the elf
eyelid primer this is in the vert the
sheer version I believe it's called just
the one-dollar version this little guy
right here from Lime Crime went bad this
is one of it their lip fell the teens in
the shade riot to the chain the scent
just changed like so much so I knew that
that went bad I used up this sis derma C
vitamin lip so dermal serum this was not
good at all was very very sticky and
tacky I would not recommend another
product I would not recommend are the
Shea Moisture super fruit multivitamin
renewal facial wipes with grapes
grapefruit seed oil and lotus seed
extract cannot talk guys and this is
what they look like these were not good
at all they were very very dry on the
skin and they did not remove my makeup
something I would repurchase any folks
eyes or something I would get in a full
size is the almond shower oil from
lassie town this is beautiful
it smells incredible and it really
really does moisturize the skin it's
kind of similar to like the Nivea
in-shower body lotion except I feel like
I prefer this more so I will definitely
begin a full-size of that this little
guy here the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous concealer did go bad it reeks
like really really reeks it's a good
concealer but it's not something I would
repurchase I used up the amore Pacific
moisture bond rejuvenating eye treatment
gel this was beautiful would highly
recommend I would consider purchasing a
full size of this but like I said I'm
not a huge fan of amore Pacific
fragrance I feel like they put a lot of
fragrance into their skin care products
so not a huge fan of that but that eye
gel is beautiful here is the autumn 3
wick candle this is bright red gala
apple juicy figure eucalyptus and
eucalyptus leaf and fir balsam yep we
burned through that it was beautiful
would repurchase love that scent a lot I
also used up this little belief the true
cream moisturizing balm so moisturizing
balm is a little more different and then
the aqua balm aqua balm is more of like
a gel cream and this one is more no
sorry I'm a balm is more of like a gel
this one's more of a gel cream I think
both of them are good but I do prefer
the other version so I would not
purchase a full-size of that I used up
an elf a golden bronzer was very happy
to use that up I also used up the Too
Faced what is this better than sex
mascara this took quite a while to get
through as well but I did use that up I
used up the piece Sephora mini citrus
brush cleaner and this is what it looks
like really really nice for spot
cleaning your brushes would highly
recommend I'll see you stop the
potpourri what is this vanilla mint so
this is the spray before you go and
nobody else will ever know kind of spray
I did find one called like unicorn gold
or something like that from Target that
I do actually prefer I like to spray
bottle better so I'll be purchasing that
but poo pourri is quite good I did use
up this little tart h2o drink of
hydration boost or whatever it's called
it's a really nice kind of moisturizing
primer it's technically a moisturizer
but I use it more as a moisturizing
primer because it really does have a lot
of silicone in it so it makes your
makeup go on really nicely so I do like
that I'm going ahead and just let
go of the Josie Maran Nirvana hydrating
treatment mess I love this bottle is so
beautiful I might keep it but I just
can't make it through this it really
leaves my skin itchy and just feeling
irritated and dry and gross oh I do not
like this would not repurchase I did use
up the Shea Moisture african black soap
problem skin facial wash it with
tamarind extract and tea tree oil this
is a beautiful beautiful facial scrub
would highly recommend my only issue is
that these are not the beads that
actually dissolve which is really crazy
because these are technically um this is
like a very natural brand I don't know
if you guys can see the little beads up
there this is like a natural brand which
is weird I thought they would have the
jojoba beads but these are the ones that
do not dissolve on the skin so I didn't
like that because they got into my hair
and things like that so I would not
repurchase it but I do like the african
black soap line from the what is it
called Shea Moisture line let's see here
the pink with a splash of fresh and
clean all over body mists from
Victoria's Secret this went bad you used
to smell amazing I love the scent the
other one just has turned it smells like
sour now so this is a really nice
fragrance but not when it turns and then
I also did it used up the amazing
cosmetics hydrate concealer this was a
really really awesome thing to use that
busy guys can see there is literally
nothing left in there so I scooped that
out with a chopstick but yeah this was a
pretty good concealer and then the final
item that I used up with a thousand
wishes Wallflower and this smelled
pretty darn good from Bath and Body
Works so anyway and those are all of my
empties for the month I hope you guys
enjoyed this video sorry I'm a little
tongue-tied today it has been a long day
at work but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this thank you so much for joining me
