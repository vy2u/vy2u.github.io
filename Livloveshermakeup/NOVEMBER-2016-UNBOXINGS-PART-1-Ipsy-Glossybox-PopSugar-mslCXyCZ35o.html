thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be part one of my
November 2016 subscription unboxings I'm
going to be unboxing a my November 2016
FC bag also my November 2016 velocity
box and also my November 2016 PopSugar
must-have box so let's go ahead and jump
right into it we are going to start with
it see I have not peaked yet but I did
take everything out of its outer
packaging this is what my little pouch
looks like for the month super super
cute and it does have a little star that
says it's the on it so the first item
that I got in here is from benefits this
is the Porefessional this is a pore
filling a primer I already do have this
in a full-size and quite a few of the
little sample sizes
I actually prefer one that I have from
the drugstore over this one it is the
L'Oreal magic beast I'd prefer that as
my pore filling primer so I will go
ahead and pass it along to a friend I
also have let's see here in matte
lipstick which again probably will pass
onto a friend I like a really really
comfortable lip product so this is the
absolute two New York New York lipstick
in the shade dominatrix well Melissa
here I have the matte lash black mascara
or mascara from the balm cosmetics I'm
excited to try this out let's take a
look at the wand here alright so here is
the wand oh my god is like right up my
alley it is super spiky and it is a
rubber bristle one which I absolutely
love it has a little bit of a curved
kind of like the benefit I'm roller lash
so that's kind of cool we will
definitely have to try that out I also
got let's see here the hey honey good
morning honey silk facial serum this is
all-day nourishing for all skin types it
says apply daily by itself or under your
date or night cream excellent when used
under makeup for providing a smooth and
glossy appearance to your skin very cool
I'm super excited to try that I love
when Ipsy gives me little skincare
samples because I love skincare and the
final item that I got in this month's
box or this month's bag is the Lacroix
and Co be lighter peaches daughter
what is this blush is this the blush I'm
guessing that this is either a cream
blush or it is like a lip balm so let me
put my finger in there Oh feels super
soft and silky
yeah yeah I think this is probably a
cream blush so there it is watched on
the back of my hand very cool all right
so I would say probably 3 out of 5 stars
for Ipsy this month just because there's
a few items in there that I probably
won't reach for very often or that I
will declutter but I'm super excited to
try out that mascara and also be facial
serum alright let's go ahead and get
into this month golasa box so I have not
peaked in here either so this is what it
looks like on the inside we have the
little card and the little bow and all
that kind of stuff so the first item
that I see in this month's box is the
crushed by Rihanna this is the ODF u
rollerball so super super cute packaging
here oh I love that box so this is the
RiRi by Rihanna let's see here I have
never smelled this rollerball before but
I'm obsessed with this packaging do you
guys see that let's go ahead and try
this out let's see here
oh it smells pretty good it smells
pretty good with a little more of like a
subdued kind of warmer fragrance kind of
reminds me of the forever red from
where is it oh Bath and Body Works most
pretty good actually I'm excited for
that we also have the deep blue yay this
is from heavy and this is called the
Quran that pearly eyeshadow pencil this
isn't a very topi kind of color
I usually don't reach for things like
this I will so watch it but I will
probably declutter this but it is a
beautiful kind of satiny taupe color do
you guys see that they give a lot of
like eye cran pencils that can either be
used for eyeliner or eyeshadow but I
don't really use eyeshadow cream sticks
all that often we have a little bit of
beeps dry shampoo here this is the
instant dry shampoo in the original
formulation this is a nice deluxe sized
container
I adore evisceration it was so very
excited to have that we also have the
Palmetto rejuvenate or their
rejuvenating antioxidant mask this is
let's see here supposed to be brighten
and soften at the skin so I have
actually gotten this in at my Ipsy bag
before and I really liked it so I'm
super excited to try that again and then
I also got the lycopene skin care calm
this is nurture protect read read read
rehabilitate and renew your skin so this
is looks like a cream like a cream to go
see that packaging is super cute woo
that smells good this is basically
like a facial moisturizer or facial
cream so super excited to try that out
all right so I would think GlossyBox
probably got about 4 out of 5 stars I
always like glossy box because they feel
like they give you a nice amount of
different products so you get some that
are really nice for skincare you get
some hair care you get a little bit of
makeup you get a little bit of
everything with glossy so super excited
to try that out and now let's go ahead
and dig into the PopSugar must-have box
this is my little whimsical box I always
call it my whimsical box because that is
what I think of it Lavigne hilts this a
little bit umm so yeah let's go ahead
and take in here here is the November
card the first item that I see you it
looks like a little scarf you guys this
is a runner the table runner oh my god
that is adorable I love that so this
looks like a table runner I thought that
this was a scarf but no it's a table
runner it's actually adorable we do not
have a table runner right now on our
dining room table but like I said I love
that PopSugar must-have box descends
like Ruby random things so this is a
super cute little table runner you hope
you guys can see that it has little
frills on the end which i think is
adorable so very excited to try that out
we also got some toffee butter popcorn
this is all natural and it is gluten
free I will be munching on this all
right after I close this video off this
is a rich and creamy decadence it says
you cheese gourmet popcorn was started
in colorado by a group of college
friends who love popcorn well I also
love popcorn so that is great we have
let's see here 24 party pics oh these
are so cute so you can make a little
like odorous or something during this
time of year for holiday parties and
then you can use these as the little
pics so if you want to do little
sandwiches or little like finger food
these are adorable oh my god I love
those silver and gold stars and the next
play do we have here is bubble wrap so
let's take a look let's take a little
piece shall we
this is the stowaway we've gotten this
before this is so way the dawn-to-dusk
palette so we got a little miniature
lipstick scent from them one time and
they were actually really nice little
lipstick so I'm excited to take a peek
in here let's see what this little
palette looks like it's so tiny and
travel friendly alright it's got that
really interesting kind of like NARS
packaging to it kind of rubbery but it
just show you one two three four five
different six different shades I'm sorry
not five six different shades on the
back here
interesting all right it has a little
brush here probably will never use that
but this is what it looks like
look at those shades they are beautiful
do you want to dip my finger in here to
kind of feel them ooh they feel kind of
good but a little rough maybe slightly
rough but we shall see there a few
swatches for you guys let's go ahead and
swatch that Navy shade as well that one
actually feels kind of nice oh it did
not come out very pigmented at all I
don't know I don't know about this
little palette but I will try it out I
have to you know go ahead and try it out
on my eyes before I give final thoughts
but super super travel friendly and very
compact but we also have the Kendra what
is this let's open it up this is a
little Kendra did you do Kendra Scott
guessing that there's a little piece of
jewelry in here or something in here yes
here's a little piece of jewelry oh this
is so beautiful oh it's a beautiful
little um what is this because I think
you might be a bracelet or something
like that
Oh what is I don't know exactly what
this is you guys I actually have no idea
I will write down below what it is
exactly but this is what it looks like
cuz it could be whatever you want it to
be could probably put this on your wine
glass if you want to as well but that is
so pretty do you guys see that ah it
would be it's a little piece okay and
that is very very pretty and then the
last item that we have here is actually
some sort of little Bowl which is so
cute again this is my love pop sugar
must have because I think if you kind of
random things but like few things so
it's kind of like a little rueful I
guess you could use this rainy holiday
season as well here is that what it
looks like so yeah super cute it just
says good AG goods on it and this is a
wire bowl handmade direct how to make
decorative art bowls or handcrafted
individually as a result of their many
of capable wah variations should not be
considered flaws okay so that is what it
looks like
very very cute alright guys so that is
everything that I got in my pop sugar
must-have box for the month so overall I
would say probably 5 out of 5 for this
this box that I actually do you think
this is huge not quite sure about that I
shadow palette but everything else is
adorable and very festive and holiday
season like but yeah not super super
impressed it with Ipsy this month I
think glossy box did pretty well let me
know down below if you guys got a
different box or bag than I did
and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
