C bag also my November 2016 a velocity
box and also my November 2016 popsugar
must have box so let's go ahead and jump
right into it we are going to start with
it see I have not peaked yet but I did
take everything out of its outer
packaging this is what my little pouch
looks like for the month super super
cute and it does have a little star that
says it's the on it so the first item
that I got in here is from benefits this
is the Porefessional this is a pore
filling a primer I already do have this
in a full size and quite a few of the
little sample sizes i actually prefer
one that I have from the drugstore over
this one it is the l'oreal magic base I
prefer that as my poor filling primer so
I will go ahead and pass that along to a
friend i also have let's see here in
that lipstick which again probably will
pass on to a friend i like really really
comfortable lip products this is the
absolute new your new york lipstick in
the shade let's take your dark red so i
have a lot of colors like this i'm not
going to open it and it also has a matte
finish so probably not going to be
something i'm super interested in but i
will pass that along to a friend as well
melissa here i have the mad lash black
mascara or mascara from the balm
cosmetics ooh I'm excited to try this
out let's take a look at the wand here
alright so here is the wand oh my god is
like right up my alley it is super spiky
and it is a rubber bristle wand which I
absolutely love it has a little bit of a
curb kind of like the benefit on roller
lash so that's kind of cool we will
definitely have to try that out i also
got let's see here the hey honey good
morning honey silk facial serum this is
all day nourishing for all skin types it
says applied daily by itself or under
your date or night cream excellent when
used under makeup for providing a smooth
and glossy appearance to your skin very
cool i'm super excited to try that i
love when ypsi gives me little skincare
samples because i love skincare and the
final item that i got in this month's
box or this month's bag is the Lacroix &amp;amp;
Co be lighter peaches daughter what is
this blush is this a blush I'm guessing
that this is either a cream blush or it
is like a lip balm so let me put my
finger in there Oh feels super soft and
silky
yeah I think this is probably a cream
blush so there is watched on the back of
my hand very cool alright so i would say
probably 3 out of 5 stars4 if see this
month just because there's a few items
in there that i probably won't reach for
very often or that i will declutter but
I super excited to try out that mascara
and also be facial serum alright let's
go ahead and get into this month
glossybox so I have not peaked in here
either so this is what it looks like on
the inside we have the little card and
the little bow and all that kind of
stuff so the first item that I see in
this month's box is the crushed by
Rihanna this is the eau de parfum
rollerball so super super cute packaging
hero i love that box so this is the RiRi
by Rihanna let's see here I have never
smelled this roller ball before but I'm
obsessed with this packaging do you guys
see that let's go ahead and try this out
let's see here oh it smells pretty good
smells pretty good it's a little more of
like a subdued kind of warmer fragrance
kind of reminds me of the forever red
from where is it Oh Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
smells pretty good actually I'm excited
for that we also have the day blue yay
this is from Pelle and this is called
the Quran pearly eyeshadow pencil this
isn't a very topi kind of color I
usually don't reach for things like this
i will so watch it by will probably
declutter this but it is a beautiful
kind of satiny taupe color do you guys
see that they get a lot of like I cran
pencils that can either be used for
eyeliner or eyeshadow but I don't really
use eyeshadow cream sticks all that
often we have a little bit of the dry
shampoo here this is the instant dry
shampoo in the original formulation this
is a nice deluxe sized container I adore
evisceration it was so very excited to
have that we also have the Palmetto

be brighton and soften the skin so i
have actually gotten this in at my Ipsy
bag before and i really liked it so i'm
super excited to try that again and then
i also got the lycopene skincare calm
this is nurture protect read Brett
rehabilitate and renew your skin so this
is looks like a cream like a cream to go
see that
packaging is super cute ooh that smells
good this is basically like a facial
moisturizer or facial cream so super
excited to try that out alright so i
would say classy box probably got about
4 out of 5 stars I always liked
GlossyBox because I feel like they give
you a nice amount of different product
so you get some that are a really nice
for skincare you get some hair care you
get a little bit of makeup you get a
little bit of everything with glossy so
super excited to try that out and now
let's go ahead and take into the
popsugar must have box this is my little
whimsical box i always call it my
whimsical box because that is what i
think of it let me tilt this a little
bit um so yeah let's go ahead and take
in here here is the November card the
first item that I see you looks like a
little scarf you guys this is a runner
table runner oh my god that is adorable
I love that so this looks like a table
runner I thought that this was a scarf
but no it's a table runner it's actually
adorable we do not have a table runner
right now on our dining room table but
like i said i love that popsugar must
have box descends like really random
things so this is a super cute little
table runner i hope you guys can see
that it has little frills on the end
which i think is adorable so very
excited to try that out we also got some
toffee butter popcorn this is all
natural and it is gluten-free I will be
much in on this or right after I close

decadence it says youjizz gourmet

group of college friends who love
popcorn well I also love popcorn so that
is great we have let's see here 24 party
pics oh these are so cute so you can
make a little like Oh d'oeuvres or
something during this time of year for

actually really nice little lipstick so
I'm excited to take a peek in here let's
see what this little palette looks like
it's so tiny and travel friendly alright
it's got that really interesting kind of
like on ours packaging to it kind of
rubbery but it does show you one two
three four five different
six different shades I'm sorry not five
six different shades on the back here so
interesting all right it has a little
brush hair probably will never use that
but this is what it looks like look at
those shades they are beautiful do you
want to dip my finger in here to kind of
feel them who they feel kind of good but
a little rough maybe slightly rough but
we shall see there a few swatches for
you guys let's go ahead and swatch that
Navy shade as well that one actually
feels kind of nice oh it did not come
out very pigmented at all I don't know I
don't know about this little palette but

ahead and try it out on my eyes before I
give final thoughts but super super
travel friendly and very compact but we
also have the Kendra what is this let's
open it up this is a little Kendra did
you do Kendra Scott guessing that
there's a little piece of jewelry in
here or something in here yes here's a
little piece of jewelry oh this is so
beautiful oh it's a beautiful little um
what is this didn't think it might be a
bracelet or something like that Oh what
is I don't know exactly what this is you
guy they actually have no idea i will
write down below what it is exactly but
this is what it looks like because it
could be whatever you want it to be
could probably put this on your wine
glass if you want to as well but that is
so pretty do you guys see that ah would
be if a little piece okay and that is
very very pretty and then the last item
that we have here is actually some sort
of little bowl which is so cute again
this is why i love popsugar must have
because they give you kind of random
things but like cute things so this is
kind of like a little rueful i guess you
could use the story holiday season as
well here is that what it looks like so
yeah super cute it just says good AJ
goods on it and this is a wire bull
handmade direct Adam a decorative art
Bulls are handcrafted individually as a
result of their mini okay buh buh buh
wha variation should not be considered
flaws okay so that is what it looks like
very very cute alright guys so that is
everything that I got in my popsugar
must have box for the month so overall I
would say probably five out of five for
this this box that i actually do you
think this is cute not quite sure about
that eyeshadow palette but everything
else is adorable and very festive and
holiday season like but yeah not super
