today I did want to go ahead and walk
you guys through my November 2017 and
beauty product empties I do I also have
a few little home empties thrown in here
as far as like handles and like wax
melts are concerned but mostly it is me
the empties
we work on for half the month so I don't
have too much to share with you guys but
I guess we'll just go ahead and jump
right into it I want to start with two
different setting sprays this one is
from Scandinavia it's the post and make
up recovery spray and this one is from
Pixie it's called the make up fixing mix
with Rosa water and green tea I did
enjoy both of these this one was sent
for PR this one I purchased with my own
money and I actually would repurchase
both I do prefer the pixie just a little
more over the skin to Naevia but I do
enjoy both this is supposed to be a post
make up recovery spray kind of like a
toner with a little bit of like a witch
hazel and I believe some tea tree oil in
here to kind of calm down inflammation
after you take your makeup off but I
really just like it for going ahead and
a setting my whole entire face in
alright moving on I do have a mascara
here that's not necessarily empty but
I'm going to go ahead and toss it it is
from eight cosmetics it is the superhero
mascara I have a love-hate relationship
with this at first I thought it was just
a little too dry so then I went ahead
and put in some eye drops in here and it
got way too gloopy I let it sit out for
a few days because I was hoping that
maybe you would dry back out but it
happened so I'm just gonna go ahead and
toss this it's just way too clumpy on my
lashes and I feel like that says a lot
because I personally love clumpy lashes
are you guys moving on I have a candle
here from so much brighter this is my
new favorite vegan cruelty free cancel
company this particular candle is called
past the cider it's apple cinnamon
nutmeg and clove oh my god you guys I
cannot even tell you how good it smells
that they are as you guys can see wood
wicks and I personally really really do
prefer these over the witch City wicks
candles which I used to purchase a lot
these also are pretty good this one
right here is called lemon verbena but I
have to say I'm really really partial to
so much a brighter she has an Etsy shop
where she sells things absolutely love
them so would for sure be purchase I
probably would not repurchase lemon
verbena however I do enjoy the wax melts
from which city wick so I have lime
patchouli the scent wasn't amazing so
probably wouldn't purchase that one but
I do love rose wood at musk so would
repurchase that big tree I also didn't
like the scent of this would not
repurchase that but I would repurchase
lemon verbena
alright guys moving on I did use up the
Habs white peach of rosy and peony
herbal shave gel this is limited edition
it's been a limited edition for like
five months now but this is probably my
all-time favorite shave gel if you want
to really close shell shades but you
also want something that smells
incredible would highly recommend this
it is vegan and it is cruelty free all
right speaking of vegan and cruelty free
here's the turts clean queen that vegan
deodorants my all-time favorite
deodorant when highly recommend you guys
check this out
if you are new to natural deodorants it
does take a little bit of time to get
used to this but I really love it and
I'm going to repurchase alright here we
have the glossy a what is this called
priming moisturizer in the rich version
and this is the luxurious face cream and
I actually highly C please just ran in
here anyway I did go ahead and get this
scent for PR this was sent to me from
glossier I really do enjoy this but I
only enjoy it as like a priming facial
moisturizer which technically it is what
it's supposed to be it says to put it on
in the morning as well as nighttime but
I only like it before my makeup so I
would actually go ahead and purchase
that with my own money
you're a used-up the Revlon Eterna 27
moisture cream with pro Jenna - I just
have to toss this you guys I didn't use
up the whole entire thing there's a
little bit left but the ingredients in
here are really not good rogem eaten is
known to be a very bad ingredient for
the skin
I've had this around for years of my
collection so I'm just gonna go ahead
and toss that next up I have the Korres
a wild rose instant brightening and
illuminating mask this was also sent for
PR probably about eight months ago I
finished it up I loved it for my dry
skin but back when I had more
combination oily skin I didn't really
like it because it was too moisturizing
but I would go ahead and purchase that
again with my own money - and then here
we have a little face cream this is from
infinite aloe skin care my friend
actually sent this to me my friend
Rochelle she loves this aloe cream for
her dry sensitive skin I tried it out
and I was actually pretty surprised I
mean this is one of those like 1-800
kind of companies it is cruelty free and
I believe the majority of their products
are vegan but it works really well it
calmed down inflammation in my skin and
it just makes my skin look very very
nice and it does hydrate nicely so I
wouldn't consider purchasing a full-size
of that alright I did also use up a
blending sponge right here this is
something that I use for my body when I
am self-tanning and this is the miracle
complexion of body sponge so I go ahead
and toss these when they start to fall
apart like this but
love it and I would repurchase all right
here we have the uLTA Beauty
moisturizing seaweed body scrub made
with sea salt and jojoba oil I did enjoy
this but I felt like The Container was
super super small so I probably wouldn't
repurchase unless it was on sale again
you can eight ounces of product but it
was moisture izing I didn't feel like it
left a greasy residue on my body though
which was really really nice and it did
smell quite good so that is the ultimate
moisturizing seaweed a body scrub up
next I have a few little samples here
the first one is from addict lay on this
is the hydrating oil serum was essential
oils it smells amazing
very very moisturizing on the skin if
they are cruelty free I will purchase a
full-size that Ola Henderson truth serum
would definitely purchase a full-size of
this I've gone through I think 7 full
sizes I absolutely love this serum it's
beautiful next up I do have a hair
product here that I used up I have not
really been showing any hair products
because I can't use a lot of hair
products currently if you guys didn't
know I have SLE lupus which is an
autoimmune disease that does attack the
hair skin nails and internal organs now
I unfortunately was in a well I was in a
trial last year I want to say it's
unfortunate I have been at six months
clear of a lupus flare because of the
trial but there were some bad side
effects that I got to like really really
thick dark scarring on at the back of my
scalp so I have been using a
prescription shampoo and conditioner
which is why I haven't really been
showing any of my shampoos and
conditioners that I have in my stash but
I did actually finish this guy off I've
been mixing it together but with this
shampoo that I have which is a
prescribed shampoo and this is called
the red kin frizz dismiss sulfate free
shampoo Redken is not cruelty free so I
would not repurchase I really don't see
a huge difference when I use this anyway
so yeah would never purchase that up
next we do have these shade Terra
organics rose hips black soap this is a
facial wash for all skin types it's anti
acne and anti aging wonder soap if
you're looking for a very and natural a
vegan cruelty free face wash you don't
want to use salicylic acid or benzoyl
peroxide this is a really nice pick if
you want a really good like a microderm
sort of feel you take a little bit of
this rub it all over a damp face and
leave it on for five minutes people
start to feel the tingling sensation it
really takes care of black blackheads
breakouts as well as anti aging and just
kind of smoothing out the skin so I do
enjoy this and I probably would
repurchase up next we have the
Pharmacy honey potion this is a renewing
antioxidant hydration math oh my
goodness
I love this it comes in like a gel
consistency you put it onto your face
and it foams up and warms up if you're
super super sensitive this might be a
little too much for you but I loved it
for my dry skin so I'm definitely gonna
purchase a full-size of that and then
here we have the fresh two vitamin
nectar vitamin C boosting at face mask
I've had this little 250 point perk for
quite a few months now this was such a
good at math I really enjoyed it but
unfortunately fresh does test on animals
so I would not repurchase and then
finally I have the cargo left activator
gel this is something that I use to make
my lashes nice and long and thick a lot
of people seem to think I mean a lot of
people think to think of that my lashes
are just naturally thick and long and
things like that but no I actually do
use special products on them apparently
I am using jojoba oil and coconut oil on
them and it's keeping them nice and
healthy and long and beautiful but this
was really nice when it lasted
unfortunately they don't sell this
anymore so I would not repurchase but
anyway guys that's it those are all my
empties for the month I hope you enjoyed
this video let me know down below of
five different products that use you
used up this month I would love to hear
and I guess I will see you guys tomorrow
