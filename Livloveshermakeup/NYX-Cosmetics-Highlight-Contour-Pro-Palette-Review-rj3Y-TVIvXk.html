I'm doing a review on the new Knicks
highlight and contour Pro palette I
ordered mine for 2499 on the alte
website and inside you get eight
refillable pants so basically you get
like a shimmery highlight here a matte
highlight here you get a neutralizer
color right here and then you get a
darker highlight right here then you get
a deep matte bronzer one with a little
bit of shimmer kind of a cooler more
topi kind of bronzer and it really
really dark deep chocolaty bronzer so
base it or not brought so I guess you
could say contour it's so basically I
like this palette because it gives you
such an array of colors because
everybody obviously has different skin
tones I am wearing it today I am wearing
this um really light shimmery white
color on the inner corner of my eyes and
underneath my brow bone I am wearing the
mat highlight on my chin my nose and um
my cheekbones I am wearing the
neutralizer the yellow neutralizer
underneath my eyes and I am wearing this
color right here this kind of topi
contour on my cheekbones and also on my
forehead so I actually love this I love
it a lot this is actually one of my
favorite I've been digging up a lot of
contour products lately and actually
this is my favorite one that I've tried
so far I like it more than the cocoa
contour from to face I like it more than
the product i'm going to review next and
i also like it more than the clinic
chubby sticks so i'm really really happy
with this a lot of people have not liked
this i've seen a lot of stuff on my
makeup social um youtube just people
saying it's really really flaky they
don't like it i will tell you guys right
now that it can be a little powdery but
i don't find it to be chalky because
it's powdery that also means that it's
going to be super super pigmented and it
is a little goes a long way that's all i
can say you don't want to be ramming
your brush in there and swirling around
you literally just need to tap it in and
use it on your face so basically these
are refillable so they have these little
like in dense or grooves right here
where you can actually just see if i can
do this pop out
color that you want so if you use up one
of them you can just get a refillable a
refillable pan so I do like that and i
think they are easy to pop out you know
obviously when you do stuff like that
you know just make sure your nails
aren't too long because they can get
indented and pull out a little bit of
the products but I do like that they are
refillable and I just I'm yet so
basically like I said I ordered this for
2499 on the alte website this is the
little box it comes in and on the back
and has a little picture so you can kind
of see how to use the product it says
right here define your features like a
pro with our eighth color refillable
highlight and contour palette seamlessly
blend these soft and pigmented powders
to emphasize your best features and then
it says you know it shows you areas of
how to highlight contour and blood so
right here it shows you highlight
sections contouring things like that so
kind of nice to have that as the
reference if you are new to contouring
which I am I would say the packaging is
pretty nice it's very very sleek and
thin so this is like a nice little on
contour palette to travel with which I
may be picking this one to travel with
when I travel later in the month um let
me read for you guys a few things that I
said on the Alta website um it says
define your features like a pro with
this NYX Cosmetics refillable highlight
and contour Pro palette each set
includes for customizable highlighting
and contouring shades for emphasizing
your favorite features it says how to
use use a fan brush for a soft highlight
and a small stippling brush for an
effortless contour and then it just
shows some of the ingredients um and
like I said I um think like they said
like using you know a fan brush for the
highlight and things like that because
these are so pigmented like can you see
that these are really really pigmented
like you know you really don't need to
be um taking a brush and like digging
into the product it's just really not
necessary and that's where I think
people are saying like oh I'm getting so
much fallout and like you know my brush
is just really in there it's big high
you're applying it with two dents of a
brush probably and same goes with the
bronzers super super pigmented and you
really only need to use a light hand so
um like I said I really really am liking
this I think it's super easy to blend um
I find that when I apply it if I apply
it with like a denser brush and I need
to blend it out i just use something
that's really really area light to kind
of blend it out especially on my
cheekbones but it blends beautifully
into the forehead with just like a fan
brush for bronzer I mean for contouring
um I really like that they have all
these different varieties of highlight
shades and also a neutralizer that's
kind of interesting people are really
into like what is that the bed my banana
powder and things like that I never
thought I could use a product like that
because i am so fair i thought oh my god
that yellow is really going to show up
but this one is really nice and did
cover up my dark circles today really
really effortlessly so I do like that I
like that they have different kind of
highlight shades on with shimmer one
here one here so if you are a little
darker you can use that one and if you
were a little paler you can use that one
you really can use either and I like
that they do give you an option down
here of a contour with a little bit of
shimmer in it because maybe that's like
a color that could actually be a bronzer
for some people on their skin so they
may use this really really deep
chocolate brown color right there as a
contour and then that one to kind of
warm up the face but overall I'm really
really impressed with this palette I
love it I think it's totally worth it
for 2499 I mean like I said I've been
reviewing quite a few of these
contouring products lately and I have
another one coming up right after this
video and I would say this one is by far
my favorite so far so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review I will see you in my
next video have a good day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
