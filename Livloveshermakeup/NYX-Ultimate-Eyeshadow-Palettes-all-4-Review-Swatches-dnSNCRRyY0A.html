video is going to be a quick little
review and swatches on the new NYX
ultimate eyeshadow palettes I purchased
these buy one get one 50% off on the
Alta com website I will go ahead and
link those down below in the description
bar we guy can get them if you are
curious or interested and there are four
different palettes that they have we
have smoky and highlights the brights
cool neutrals and warm neutrals and I
personally really really enjoyed these
like I said they are buy one get one 50%
off so normally they are priced at $18 a
piece which i think is a little pricey
for what they are
you do get a lefty here one two three
four twenty nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
different shades in each one but I think
the packaging is just a little flimsy I
do like the quality of them but again
NYX is kind of a hit and miss when it
comes to their eyeshadow palettes at
least for me personally but anyway like
I said I think that for buy one get one
50% off it definitely is worth it so if
you want to pick up maybe two of them
you can get one of them for $9 so anyway
this is what the outer packaging looks
like I think it's just a little cheap
honestly it does have a snap closure
which I enjoy but for the most part I
feel like this could definitely just
like break in my suitcase or just like
crack open so I personally wouldn't
travel with these you open it up there
is no mirror but this is what we show
you guys this is smokey highlight this
is the smokey highlight palette you are
getting a nice arrangement of kind of
cool tone shades in here it's very very
similar to the actual cool neutrals
palette but this has some nice shimmery
shades you're not really getting any
glittery shades but you're getting a
nice amount of satiny shades and also
matte shades and then here is the cool
palette and I want to show these really
quickly to show you guys kind of a
comparison this is the cool one I really
enjoyed this one a lot again you are
getting want to make sure there's no
glare you're getting some nice satiny
shades and some matte shades let me hold
the two of those up together as you guys
can see because I don't think it's
necessary that you get both of these
because they are quite similar so here
we have the smokey and highlight and
here is the cool neutrals let me see if
I can there maybe this will be easier
try to see how I can hold these up so
there we go
alright can you guys see that I
so so here we have the cool one no this
is the smoky and highlight and then this
one is the cool one and you guys can see
there are just some tones in here that
are very very similar I feel like if you
really want a cool toned eyeshadow
palette I would go ahead and grab the
cool neutrals one I just personally like
the shades in here a little better the
smokey and highlight is nice it has a
lot of kind of like suede looking colors
but for the most part I feel like these
are very very similar so I'm going to be
returning these smokey and highlight and
then the next one we have is the brights
and I love this one this may be my
favorite I personally never got the
Urban Decay electric palette so this is
basically like my electric palette you
are getting a nice mixture of satiny
shades in here a little bit of glitter
shades and also match they are extremely
pigmented I will definitely be keeping
this one and then the last one we have
I'm definitely keeping as well this is
warm neutrals and warm neutrals is
really really beautiful you're getting
some gorgeous gorgeous kind of red tones
in here orange tones really really
perfect for fall so I will be keeping
this one as well the only one that I'm
going to return it is the smoky and
highlight and it's just because it's so
similar to the cool toned one but I
prefer the colors a little more and also
I prefer that there are more mats in the
cold tone one so anyway like I said
packaging isn't all that great but if
you are going to get them like BOGO you
know buy one get one 50% off I think
they are worth it so pigmentation is
really really strong on these I'm going
to swatch six shades out of all of them
at the end rebuy so you can see but for
the most part I think these are very
very nice they wear an incredibly long
time on the lids especially if you're
wearing a primer I've been pairing these
a lot with my Too Faced shadow insurance
the litter glue primer and they really
stick to that very very nicely it can be
a little difficult to blend them out
with a glitter glue primer but I would
recommend just any sort of primer in
general you can use the elf one you can
use you know Urban Decay one whatever
you want to use I think these really
like are at their best yet they're at
their best when they are paired with a
primer I did try using them without a
primer and I just felt like they like
disintegrated on my eyes honestly now
the actual formula of these like when
you touch them is not super super
buttery I'm not going to say these are
like the NYX prismatic eyeshadows those
are almost like a foiled eyeshadow
really really metallic super super soft
and buttery these are not super soft and
buttery however they translate onto the
eyes beautifully they are highly highly
pigmented and I think that's what comes
at the end of the day is how it looks on
your eyes so I really do like that they
kind of paired together some nice satiny
shades some matte shades and then also
maybe like a glitter shade here and
there in a certain palette and I just I
don't know I really really like the way
that these translate onto the eyes like
I said for me personally NYX is always a
hit and a Miss or a high-pitch Animus a
hit or a miss when it comes to their
eyeshadow palettes I either love them or
I hate them I'm a huge fan of The Next
button naked palettes they really love
the eyeshadows in there I love
everything in there and I'm a big fan of
the prismatic eyeshadows but do you have
a few pallets from NYX that I'm just
kind of like in it's okay with but these
are very very good quality I think that
if you are looking to have a nice pallet
and you do you want to get one you know
bow go for you know buy one get one 50%
off I think that this is a pretty darn
good deal I would go ahead and get
something quite contrasting like maybe
the cool one with the brights or the
born one and the warm one and the
brights or even you could just do the
cool tone and the warm tone I feel like
if you were to get the two of these you
would have just like everyday looks
completely just like a tip of your
fingers if that makes sense like you
literally could just put together any
sort of look with the two of these right
here so I think they are overall really
really good quality are they why we need
to the point where I'm like oh my god
I'd have to use these not really but I
will say the brights one is why me to
that point it's amazing very very
pigmented and if you already have a lot
of like neutral eyeshadow palettes in
your collection like I do I don't think
that these are going to be the best
thing you've ever tried in your life
however if you did not get like the
Urban Decay electric palette and you
were looking for a good bright palette I
would highly recommend the brights
so let's go ahead and start watching
these like I said I'm going to do about
6 swatches of each one and then if you
guys would like let me know down below
and I can post swatches of all of them
on my Instagram alright so here is the
brights let's go ahead and swatch this
one there's a blue color we've got a
green a yellow let's do the purple
alright so there we go let's starts
watching these I just think this one is
so good there is a little bit of fallout
with this particular one the other ones
I
no fallout with whatsoever I do not
experience fallout but there's a little
bit with these ones they're slightly
powdery but nothing that I can't manage
so there is a few of the bright shades I
feel like they are very okay you have
mostly mattes in here which is good
because I think colorful eyes really
look the best when they are masked just
because I don't know they look kind of
out there if they have tons of glitter
or shimmer in them let's go ahead and do
one of the red shades in here as well
just really beautiful and pigmented I
honestly think if you never got the
electric palette but you want a little
color in your life I think this would be
a really really fantastic palette to get
this is definitely my favorite out of
the bunch
let's do the purple as well alright so
there are a few of the shades from the
brights
palette which is definitely my favorite
my second favorite is definitely the
cool palette so here we have this one
and it has a nice arrangements of
glitter shades tiny bit of shimmer and
then also some matte so let's do that
kind of purply color this one right here
is actually a jeep for Mac's um blue
brown pigment as you guys can probably
see and also that single eyeshadow from
Urban Decay I don't remember the name of
it if you know let me know down below
and I feel like this particular palette
also has some really nice transition
colors which I really really enjoy I
love a matte cool tone transition color
so there are a few of them so watch let
me do a few more some of the lighter
shades so you guys can see this
particular one is really really in your
face and very very buttery and creamy
pavement ed so here are some of the
lighter shades so really really nice I
think with this particular one the mats
are a little weaker but for the most
part the shimmer shades and the glitter
shades are really strong and I feel like
the shimmery ones definitely have the
finest milled like texture to them
they're definitely the most buttery but
I still feel like all of them go on and
very nicely onto the eyes alright now
let's go ahead and swatch a few of the
warm one so we have this gorgeous kind
of like kind of beautiful copper shade I
would
say let's do a gold there's a few of
them this is a beautiful one as well the
reason this one is not my favorite is
just because I feel like I have so many
like neutral warm toned eyeshadow
palettes but this is beautiful yeah
please excuse you guys know I'm bad it's
watching but really really gorgeous
gorgeous colors in this one I enjoyed
that a lot let's do a few of the lighter
shades as well so there's a matte and
there's a shimmer so again the mats are
a little weaker but the shimmers go on
very very nicely and you can of course
foil these with any sort of setting
spray as well and then the last one I
want to swap to ease the smokey and
highlight which is the one I'm returning
you guys will see it's just very very
similar to the UM is beautiful but it's
very very similar to the cool ones so I
just don't feel the need for it in my
collection and also I find that a few of
the shades in here get really muddled
together because they are so dark and
smoky they just start to look kind of
similar to each other all right let's do
a few more I'll do some of the lighter
shades so you guys can see as well you
guys are probably seeing a trend here
they have kind of like metallic key or
shimmery like later colors and then the
darker colors are kind of matte or
glittery and there's just a lot of
repetition in a few of these palettes so
I just don't think you eat all of them
but anyway those were some of the
swatches on these new little NYX
ultimate eyeshadow palettes let me give
you guys a close up one more time of
everything so here is the smokey and
highlight palette and then we have the
warm neutrals palette and then we have
the cool neutrals palettes and then the
last one we have is double writes which
is my favorite I just am happy when I
look at this like a look at it it's so
beautiful just makes me happy anyway I
think these are pretty darn good for
what they are however I will say
they're not the best I shadow palette
I've ever used if there's one I'm super
super excited about it is the brights
and that is because I don't own anything
else like this in my collection so I
hope you guys enjoyed this little review
and swatches on the new nyx ultimate
eyeshadow palettes thank you for joining
me and i will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
