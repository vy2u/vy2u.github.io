thank you so much for joining it i hope
you guys are all having a fantastic day
yes i do not have perfect lady obviously
look at that little Sun lamp with cookie
d if you like I'm in the basement of my
parents home filming for you guys and I
just wanted to say I know it's not
perfect lady it's not perfect like
camera auto focus or anything like that
I actually brought my camera with me
however I just can't find a good place
to film the lighting is just not coming
in correctly I did fly here instead of
drive here at this time so I wasn't able
to pack my ring light or any day and I
didn't know there were there would be
like a few videos while I was here that
I had to film and I was gonna film I
feel a little Holy Grail yesterday and
then it just like the time just went
away from me so please let me know he'd
still like me to fill my pills in holy
grounds on my laptop I know the quality
is not nearly as good I will be home on
from my trip tomorrow night so
technically I'm only filming this nail
polish haul and then a Sephora haul
tomorrow on this particular at camera
which is on my laptop um but if you guys
would like to still see it my fields and
holy grails I can do that when I get
back and I can film that on Thursday for
you guys or I could do it like tomorrow
if you guys don't mind I know the
quality is not that great so I do
apologize but I recently went to hmm
while I was here on a little vacation
with my family and I picked up 10 of
their and nail polishes and guys oh my
god these nail polishes are so good so I
wanted to go ahead and show you guys
which once I picked up and I'm loving
the formulation on these I have tried a
few of them out there also o cake like
literally opaque in one coat and they
just have gorgeous gorgeous colors so
I'm super super excited to share with
you guys which ones I got so let's just
get right into it the first one that I
picked up from H&amp;amp;M is called all about a
low and it is a beautiful kind of light
green color it's kind of like a mossy
green color with a little bit of like an
opalescent blue shade in there again
opaque in one coat absolutely gorgeous
get me absolutely gorgeous on the nails
I'm actually reading this on my toes
right now I think it's so pretty it's
just a gorgeous gorgeous formulation and
I think this color is beautiful alright
this anyone I picked up is a glitter
polish and this is called raspberry
cascade and I actually have
this on my toenails over the all about a
low right now and this is a gorgeous
kind of glitter shade as you guys can
see it's a dark pink shade but it has
tons and tons of chunky glitter in it
and it's just absolutely beautiful on
the nails this is a little tougher to
get off obviously because like you need
like 100 percent pure acetone you really
have to rub however I just love it I
love the way it looks on the nails it
gives like a really like beautiful sort
of glow from every single angle like if
you have it on your nails and you're
kind of like removing your hands you can
see like little areas where the light
picks up on the glitter flex and it's
just a gorgeous gorgeous color so that
gives the second nail polish I picked up
and that one again is called raspberry
cascade and then the next one I picked
up I have on my nails right now again
opaque in one coat even though this is
technically a like topper this is a
beautiful iridescent sort of um what
would I call it like peachy pinky color
it really changes everywhere like when
you move your fingers as you can
probably see it's changing from pink to
green to blue to all the colors of the
rainbow it's gorgeous this is called the
candy floss and this is beautiful like I
said it's just an opalescent gorgeous
pink color it really changes when you
move the actual polish or when you move
your fingers that light hits it a
different way and it's gorgeous on top
of any of the especially this like a low
pillar it's gorgeous on top of any of
these or you can just wear it alone like
I did today and I just love it and again
even though it is technically a topper I
still feel like this is a very very
opaque color for you know a nail polish
so amazing love that the next one I got
was this one right here which is a
beautiful kind of ruby color it's like a
i would say orange and red iridescent
sort of shade and the actual shape name
is russet pearl and normally I wouldn't
go for a bread like this because I've
always found I don't know why I have
always found that like shiny red
anything I always thought just look kind
of cheap and I don't know it was never
really like my color even though I love
the color red that is my favorite color
just like anything that's like shiny red
I always thought was kind of weird like
no I don't like that um but this color
is absolutely gorgeous again opaque in
one coat on the nails
and it is called a russet pearl so your
gain a little bit of orange in there a
little bit of red absolutely beautiful
alright the next one I picked up is kind
of like a rusted pearl accepted is the
blue shade absolutely gorgeous this is
called a blue bottle and look at that
it's like this deep navy color with
iridescent like I don't even know it's
got like a silvery light blue iridescent
to it it's absolutely gorgeous opaque in
one coat love that one and then I picked
up another kind of glitter topper or
glitter polish this one is called very
cold and it's so pretty it's like a
green I don't know it's kind of got like
a green yellow base with tons and tons
of little flecks of yellow gold and blue
shimmers in it so really really pretty
and it's just absolutely gorgeous
alright then the next one I got is
called utopia like you tou PE I get it
cuz it's a taupe shade so it's called
utopia it's absolutely beautiful this
one is so opaque like literally so
opaque I mean opaque in one coat like
all of them but even more so like this
just goes on so gorgeously has a
wonderful formulation I think it's
perfect for any time of year I
personally love taupe nails any time of
year i will rock them during the summer
the winter the spring whatever i think
it's a beautiful beautiful color that
you can wear and it's very very like
work appropriate like i love the shade
gray obviously hence the outfit anyway i
think this is absolutely gorgeous and
yeah beautiful beautiful formulation on
that one alright and then I picked up
the shade right here which is called a
beat it like a beat like a beat you know
like the red beet like the one you eat
just arrived like literally Det beat it
and it's gorgeous kind of like a bright
kind of don't even know this kind of
reminds me of like an azalea sort of
shade you know like the flower azalea's
I feel like it kind of looks like that
but a little more on the red red side
which is definitely where they get the
beat it add name but beautiful opaque
super amazing formulation and it looks
amazing with this next polish I'm going
to talk about this is another glitter
polish and this is called copper cascade
these
amazing together you wouldn't really
think that copper and like a bright pink
would look gorgeous together but this
one does this is copper cascade really
really nice glitter topper just
beautiful beautiful copper base and then
it's got tons and tons of copper orange
and gold flecks of glitter and its
really really gorgeous polish and then
the last one I got is my all-time
favorite this is amazing this color is
stunning this is called cinnamon spark
okay you guys do you see this look at
that color like the iridescent sand
there is this beautiful kind of base it
which is kind of like a bluish coppery
color but you turn it and you literally
get every single color like of the
rainbow like it's amazing again you
would think that a formulation on
something like this which has a little
more iridescent in it you would think
that it would have um I don't know like
a little it would be a little sheer like
it wouldn't have as much like opaqueness
to it but this is absolutely stunning
and I love it and please excuse all the
creepy little animal mastering I know
people are gonna be like oh that's weird
and creepy but my family we love animals
and our basement is super super bright
and like red and blue and yellow it's so
unlike anything else in our house huh oh
but anyway yeah so those are the ten
polishes that I picked up from hmm they
are amazing they have a great
formulation that glitter polishes the
ones that have kind of like an
opalescent sheer quality or not I don't
want to see sheer quality to them the
ones that have kind of like an
opalescent look to them I still go on so
opaque and nicely on the nails like I'm
wearing that one today which is the
shade candy floss and this is just one
coat and I still feel like it looks like
there's like polish on my nails you know
and that's supposed to be like a topper
and I just think they're amazing so if
you can get your hands on some of these
hmm nail polishes I highly highly highly
recommend it so like I said let me know
if you guys are interested in seeing my
fields and holy grails I can definitely
film that tomorrow I know it's a little
later in the week now but I mean I would
still be happy to film it I just know
that the quality on this too little
camera if not as good as obviously the
quality of my actual camera
so let me know what you guys think and I
will see you tomorrow for my Sephora
haul</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
