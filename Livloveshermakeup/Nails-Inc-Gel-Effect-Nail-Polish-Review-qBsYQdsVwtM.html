hope you guys are having a really really
good day um today I wanted to review for
you guys the new nails ink gel effect
nail polishes I picked up two shades I
picked up Chiltern Street which is this
nice like baby pink color and I also
picked up the one I'm wearing today
which is Baker Street which is this a
beautiful beautiful blue color it's a
very very true - um you know what it
looks like and it's very true on the
website also I picked these up for $15 a
piece on the Sephora website I will of
course link below where you guys can get
it but basically these are gel nail
polishes so if you've ever gotten your
nails done at a salon and you've gotten
like a gel finish or if you've done it
your at home you know they have like
systems you can use to do gel um these
lasts forever like weeks and weeks and
weeks and weeks and one of the things I
love about gel nail polish is that kind
of like Sheen it gives it looks like
jelly basically on the fingers it gives
a really nice Sheen and I've been really
into that lately with my nail polishes
I've just wanted something that's kind
of like you know gives a nice believe I
guess I think of wearing like matte
colors more I guess in the fall I don't
know I think a beautiful matte red is
nice on you know the nails are like a
maroon or something like that but other
than that I really think that a nice
sheen is really really great during the
summer so basically on the Support
website they have ten different shades
and a lot of them kind of remind me of
spring summer shades you get like a nice
yellow you get some pinks of blues
turquoise and then out of the ten I
would say number seven eight nine ten or
seven eight yeah seven eight nine ten
those ones are more red or maroon II so
those are more what I would think of as
fall kind of shades so the first couple
ones that you see are not the first
couple but the first like seven that you
see on the website are very much like
spring and summer oriented and I just
love that nail saying I think is a
really really great brand they have
awesome nail polishes of course for $15
you're like oh is it really worth it but
you are getting a good amount of product
in here you're getting point 247 fluid
ounces and they come in these nice like
thick little packaging so when you take
you think it's gonna like twist like
this and the
comes out you actually pull this and you
have the wand so when you take the wand
out the one is really nice and it's not
one of those like tapered ones that gets
kind of small towards the top it's one
of those that is like flat if you guys
can see and I personally as someone who
is not great with applying nail polish I
prefer blondes like these that are kind
of flat because they're easier to apply
it's just like the amount of product
that gets on the brush is not too much
if that makes sense um so for someone
who is not great with applying nail
polish I really really appreciate that I
think that's great it's the same one
with the pink one of course um I did do
a little swatch of the pink one on my
nails it looks beautiful
I have to tell you guys the pigmentation
is amazing this is one coat that I'm
wearing on my nails right now that is
why it's 15 dollars because this is like
that formula that you can take and you
can go and immediately you know you're
gonna be done in five minutes and it
will have dried and you will have full
color all you need is one coat you don't
need a top coat you don't need you know
a base coat all that other stuff that's
why these are $15 because they're kind
of like a all-in-one sort of products so
I'm going to read for you guys a little
bit about what it says on the Sephora
website it says nails link gel effect
$15 10 different shakes it is a high
gloss nail polish that mimics the effect
of a gel manicure and it says the gel
effect polish creates a glossy plumping
effect and flawless finished without a
trip to the salon in flues infused with
a nourishing flower extract formula that
conditions and strengthens and nails it
also features nails inks innovative
plasticizer technology allowing color to
glide on evenly while the extra wide
brush ensures easy application perfect
for achieving a high-gloss manicure AIDS
free of parabens sulfates and satellites
that elites don't know how to say that
but anyway yes I agree with all of that
so I think the brush is really easy to
just get a nice even coat on your nails
and also um like I said I love the fact
that it's one coke you know this was
really really easy to do and it dried
within five minutes which is awesome
and no I did not like blow on them I do
not
put them under some little town it's
just they they drive like instantly so I
think that these are awesome if you just
want to change your nail polish up
really really quickly I think these work
really really well um and also I just
want to say like I know that they
mentioned some kind of nourishing a
green ingredient in there it really
feels silky like a true gel manicure
like when you're touching it it's really
really silky of course we'll have to see
once I take these off um if it I highly
doubt it damaged my nails but you know
what I made well we'll see when I take
it off if um if it is you know
nourishing and if my nails look damaged
whatsoever but um so basically I'm
really really impressed I think you know
ten different shades is a great way to
start with this new gel effect line and
I really really love these I will link
everything below where you guys can pick
these up and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
