thank you so much for joining me i am
doing an unboxing for you guys tonight
it is on naturebox i just want to put a
disclaimer out there immediately i am
not sponsored or affiliated with nature
box in any way i just wanted to put that
out because a lot of videos that I've
been seeing lately for naturebox are all
sponsored um I you know I pay to have
the box every month I just really like
snacks and I figured if I'm going to be
snacking it's better to have healthy
snacks so just wanted to put that out
there immediately because a lot of
videos that I've seen lately have been
sponsored but anyway this is the nature
box unboxing for the month of April and
I'm going to share with you guys what I
got so there's a little pamphlet here
and says spring has sprung time for
snacking fun and picture of some trail
mix yum yum and yeah it looks like
they're going to have this they have
like new ones that you can try they have
aged white cheddar caramel popcorn and
white truffle popcorn and probiotic
power mix so they're adding that into
their choices yes MA I hear my kitty
meow did she open that she opened this
while I was just talking who knows
whatever anyway so i'm going to show you
guys what I got the first thing I got
worthy cranberry papito crisps and these
are cranberry and pumpkin seed pita
crisps and I just thought that they
looked really yummy on the website they
have pictures of all the foods like when
you see it on the website so i thought
that this sounded just good be good be
good oh my god she did just come out of
the closet sorry guys she's just crazy
um but yeah so cranberry the pita crisps
um I just left these sounded really good
they you can have nine crisp for 140
calories five grams of fat and three
grams of protein so all of those look
yummy next I got double berry fruit
peels raspberry blueberry fruit strips
and you can have two strips for 90
calories zero grams of fat 20 protein
and the sugar is 18 grams of sugar
the next snack regards are the salt and
pepper lentil oops these are baked
lentil and potato crisps and it says on
the back one ounce is 130 calories has
five grams of fat and three grams of
protein they look like that and that's
like what they look like on the website
they're like these little loops um
little little loops um next I got the
honey dijon pretzels which I have tried
before I love these these are so so good
it tastes just like the Snyder's ones
except they are way way WAY lower in
calorie and fat and sodium so in here um
like I said honey dijon pretzels honey
mustard flavor pretzel bites and you get
nine pieces for 120 calories for grams
of fat and three grams of protein and
the next snack I got for this month are
the more mango orange fruit tues and
these come in like little separate acts
let me open 30 anyway they come in like
a little separate like prepackaged which
is nice because then you know exactly
what you're getting and one pouch is 70
calories and these are good these are
just kind of like I've had these months
to before the mega or mango orange and
they're just kind of like um just like
little gummies they're kind of like
shaped in like a swirl pattern and they
just kind of tastes like I don't know
like gushers are like you know gushers
but you know just like a fruit roll-up
or something like that this is just a
healthier healthier version and it says
like I said one pouch is 70 calories do
grams of fat let's see how much sugar 13
grams of sugar so and I like that they
are apportioned out already so that is
what I've got in my major box for this
month I hope you guys enjoyed this
unboxing I will leave below the
information for naturebox if you're
interested I believe it is nineteen
dollars a month and you get fat dick and
snacks but they are really really
healthy and I'm not gonna say really
really healthy but I am going to say
that they are healthy and they're a
better choice than going out and eating
you know whole bag of like potato chips
so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
