hope you guys are having a great day
today i will be doing an unboxing video
for you guys it is actually my nature
box unboxing for the month of august i
ordered what I wanted ahead of time like
in july i usually get my nature box
really early they ship really quickly
and i usually get it at the beginning of
the month and i actually went in and you
get to choose which kind of snacks you
want for each month so after my july box
i went right in right after i remembered
and um i actually put in uh you know
what I wanted for next month's box which
is now the most of august and it
actually came like literally a week ago
so my august fox has been here for like
a week and it's only august 3rd so
that's crazy but anyway I wanted to show
you guys what I got to eat my box um I
am not affiliated with nature box in any
way I get the subscription service that
is twenty dollars a month it's 1995 and
you get to pick five snacks each month
and they are healthy and i happen to be
someone who just hates a lot of cracks
so that is why i like to do this
particular subscription box I like a lot
of subscription boxes i subscribed to a
lot and i just particularly really like
this one as the food box so i will leave
below if you guys are interested to link
directly to the nature box website like
i said it's not an affiliate link i'm
not affiliated with them but um you
should definitely check them out they do
have bigger options for if you have like
a whole family you can get like 20 boxes
a month but then again you know the
price changes depending on what you're
getting so anyway i'm going to show you
guys the snacks i chose for the month of
august so the first thing I got worthy
praline pumpkin seeds I thought these
sounded really really good it says that
they are pumpkin seeds sugar pumpkin pie
spice and caramel color that's all
that's in them so I thought that these
just sounded really good and it'd be a
really really yummy little snack I'm
sorry if the lighting is changing as I
lift these up the orange rim right here
it's going to make me look a little more
colored it probably won't make me look
orange though because I'm quite pale but
it might make me look a little darker
but um this is the normal lighting
you can see it makes me a little darker
so I'm sorry about that it's just the
bright orange color but anyway so this
was my first snack I'm really excited I
do like pumpkin seeds but I only like
them if they're covered in something
sweet so gonna try the praline pumpkin
seeds the second thing I got worthy kung
pao pretzels um I kind of got things
from my boyfriend because he is age and
then I don't know I mean I know that
that sounds wrong that I saw comp out
and I thought of him but I thought I'd
really like the flavor and I would do um
so these are the kung pao pretzels and
it says nutritionist approved spicy
seasoned waffle pretzels so they're just
come pout flavored pretzels and let me
just review guys the nutrition facts
quickly so for the breathing pumpkin
seeds you can have a third a cup for
only 140 calories and 13 grams of sugar
four grams of protein and then for the
comp out pretzels you can have 16
pretzels for only 120 calories and they
have 2.5 grams of fat and two grams of
sugars and can we grams of protein so
pretty darn good the third a little
items that I picked up it would be dark
cocoa num-nums I've tried these before
they're basically like soft little
cookies I got the peanut butter ones and
I did like them my boyfriend wasn't a
huge fan so he wanted me to try out the
cocoa ones this time so they are
supposed to be many cocoa oat cookies
and they're very very soft and small and
these again our nutritionist approved
and it says one piece is 100 calories
five grams of fat two grams of protein
and five grams of sugar so still pretty
good especially for something chocolatey
um the next a snack I got the fourth one
is the honey macadamia pretzel pops like
that be sounded really really good they
are honey and macadamia coated pretzels
so they come like these little balls and
they are nutritionist approved I think
all of them are ya they all are and you
can have a third cup of 4 130 calories
for grams of fat let's see here sodium
is very low on all of these by the way
only a 120 in this and by that I mean
relatively low it's not up there like
soups or something which are like
500-600 so I'm pretty good for that
carbohydrates are 24 sugars or 13 and
protein is too so these are a little
higher in the sugar category
but they are quite low in calories and
the last snack that I chose for this
month's box are these sweet blueberry
almonds which is something we got in
last month's box my boyfriend loved
these they are basically just um raw
almonds and you know which are very good
for you and they really help fill you up
however sometimes I need like flavoring
for mine um my boyfriend can eat his
just plain and be like okay that tastes
so good and I'm like I want a little
more substance like either something
savory on it or sweet so the sweet
blueberry I'm like powder is really
really nice on them and they're just
these tiny little purple elements
they're so cute by the way this is not
my bra strap it's just spaghetti strap
underneath but it keeps showing through
this you can have a fourth cup of these
for 170 calories 13 grams of fat however
these are almonds so they are good fat
and six grams of protein so pretty darn
good he's going to be really excited
about those and I'm really excited about
everything else so I hope you guys
enjoyed this month's unboxing for
naturebox this is my August nature box
box naturebox box yes okay anyway that's
what I got I will link below if you guys
are interested in checking them out they
really do have good healthy snacks if
you are somebody who snacks a lot like
on potato chips and just whatever you
can get your hands on this is a good way
to do it while being a little conscious
of what you're eating so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this I'll see you my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
