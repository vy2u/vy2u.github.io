today I'm doing a nature box unboxing
for the month of January I really wanted
to do this because honestly I am hungry
and I want to open these tax and eat
them ha so let's just get started um the
first thing you see when you open this
is a little card and it says naturebox
the new issue knew you knew eats so it
looks like they have new appeal cups
that you can get that's like a breakfast
item and like to start a free trial up
naturebox its nature box calm / invite
um yeah things like that so live that
the first thing i got was the nature box
sour cream and onion almonds it looks
like this I'm really really excited to
try these because I love sour cream and
onion and almonds up right so I think
that's a healthier alternative to sour
cream and onion chips next I got these
strawberry Greek yogurt pretzels it says
their pretzels coated with strawberry
flavored yogurt they looked really
really good I also got a carrot
strawberry fruit shoes and they actually
come like individually packaged which I
think of adorable so those are easy just
to take on the go with you or things
like that so I'm excited for that next I
got sriracha roasted cashews this is for
those people that are spice lovers which
I totally am it says that this is
sriracha flavored cashews and
nutritionist of food so excited to try
those and the last thing i got was the
asiago and cheddar cheese crisps and i
actually got this last month in my box
and i absolutely love them and i knew i
had to give them again so that is my
nature box unboxing i hope you guys like
this and i'll see you in the next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
