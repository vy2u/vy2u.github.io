doing an unboxing for you guys today
from a nature box and before I even get
into this video I just want to say right
away I know there are a lot of youtubers
that are sponsored or have like
affiliate links with nature box I have
none of that I have no affiliate link
I'm not sponsored by them they did not
send me this box I just wanted to put
that out there not because I mean like
oh yeah companies send me stuff all the
time no it's not like that i'm literally
just telling you guys because I know
that nature box has the tendency to send
boxes out to like youtubers quite often
whether they're really big youtubers or
small youtubers like me they tend to
send boxes out like quite often but I
just wanted to tell you guys right away
I am not affiliated with them in any
sort of way so I nature fache is
basically like a healthy food
subscription box where you can get
either you can get it weekly or you can
get it monthly I get it monthly it is
very expensive it as $19.95 a month and
the reason I paid for it and the reason
I do the 1995 a month is because I'm
trying to change my eating habits I love
junk food I love especially salty foods
you guys will see in this box you get to
pick 5 snacks each month um so I picked
my you know snacks for the month you
guys will see like I love salty things
I'm either have like a huge sweet tooth
or I really really love salty things
that I just don't eat very healthy
that's one of my new year's resolutions
is to be a little more conscious and
aware of the stuff that I'm putting into
my body and also you know going to the
gym and things like that but for the
most part I really do like nature buffs
I think they have really really tasty
snacks that don't taste like they're
healthy if that makes sense like they
really taste like they're bad for you
but I enjoyed knowing that I'm not
putting so much crap into my body so
anyway um this is what this month box
looks like i'm not going to flip it over
and got my address on it but this is
what the inside looks like i used to
unbox these all the time on camera i
have been getting naturebox did i
mention that
already I've been gave them since last
September so for quite a while now
actually but anyway let's just get rid
into it's the first thing that I picked
were the sea salt pop pops and I've had
these before these are sea salted
popcorn kernels they're really really
yummy half a cup is only 170 calories it
has nine grams of fat but it's got two
grams of protein this is what the sea
salt pop-pop's look like and I really
really love these they're basically just
like popcorn kernels um and they're
super crunchy and super super tasty you
can eat half a cup of these and you feel
like you're eating a lot because they're
really crunching they kind of take a
long time to chew so I really really
like those and I like them so much that
I went ahead and got the parmesan garlic
pop pop's also however naturebox is now
doing these little like single surfing
bags which is fantastic because they are
calorie portion so that you're not
literally going through the whole bag in
one sitting because that is what I do I
will be sitting in front of the TV now
let's go through the whole bag just hit
myself in the mouth if any way I would
go through the whole bag very very
quickly so I thought it was really cool
that they now have this option where you
can get four little packs um you know
for the price of what a big pack would
be but these are like calorie portion
and these are the parmesan garlic ones
and these ones taste amazing they are so
flavorful and so delicious and they're
just parmesan garlic popcorn kernels and
one packet is 150 calories again nine
grams of fat two grams of protein and
this is what the little packets look
like and I just like these I liking
things are like pre-portioned so that I
know exactly what I'm putting into my
body and so that I feel like I'm you
know giving myself boundaries so I'm not
just going my god yum you know ok the
next thing I really really love from
nature box as well I get this very often
these are the honey dijon pretzels these
are so good they are so flavorful their
honey mustard flavored pretzel bites
they are nutritionist approved nine
pieces is 120 calories sodium is a
little high it's 370 milligrams but
that's pretty low compared to other like
potato chips or things like that and you
do get three grams of protein in there
so they're basically these big chunky
little pretzels and they are so good you
guys and they really
it takes like a lot to eat them they
kind of have this Peggy like honey
mustard sort of flavor but they really
take a long time to choose so again um
nine pieces or 28 grams feels like a lot
like when you're eating it so I love
those and then this is a new product I
haven't tried this one yet this is the
cinnamon yogurt mini grams so they are
yogurt covered graham crackers I was
like that sounds really really yummy
they are nutritionist approved again you
can add eight pieces or 30 grams for 140
calories they do have a gram of protein
and the sodium is relatively low it's
only at 100 so 100 milligrams so yeah
I'm really really excited to try these
they look like they're about like
quarter size with you guys can see
they're about Porter sighs and I'm
excited to try them I think yeah they're
just basically cinnamon yogurt covered
graham crackers they just sounded really
really good so I'm excited for that and
then the last snack I got for the month
is one that I really really love I have
gotten this a lot this is the asiago and
cheddar cheese crisps I love cheese
cheese is probably my favorite food I
thought which is why I was very
difficult when I was vegan but i just
love cheese and these are really really
nice they're basically let me show you
guys actually feel like I should open
these you guys can see but this is
something look like they're basically
like these little cheese crisps and
they're basically just like baked cheese
snacks and they are super super tasty
they have a little bit of spice to them
and you can have 10 pieces or 28 grams
for only 130 calories and six grams of
protein sodium is 160 so not too bad
especially for cheese um and these are
just delicious you get a lot in here
smells like ass Iago so good you can
also use these as like croutons on top
of salads I've tried that before I put
it in my life my food processor or my
blender or whatever and chop it up and
you can get like really really tiny like
fine little crumbs you can cover that
with fish you can like bake it it's like
a crust or you can even just cut these
up a little bit and toss them in a salad
really really good so I love these
asiago and cheddar cheese crisps so
anyway about to isn't my nature box for
the month of
what math are we january january odd
naturebox like i said i'm not sponsored
or affiliated in any way i just want to
show you guys the snacks that i
purchased and i'm really excited to get
into them thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
