about what i got in this font naturebox
i have the deluxe nature box which means
that i can choose five different snack
bags or they can send me five of their
newest snacks and it is nineteen
nineteen ninety-five a month they also
have the happy snack er um which is ten
bags five different snacks double each
snack and they also which is twenty
twenty nine ninety five a month's give
me and they also have the smarts snapper
which is 20 different bags of snacks a
month and you get five different snacks
four times each snack and that is 4995 a
month like I said I do get the deluxe
box which means that I get to pick five
snack bags and it is twenty dollars a
month I think it's really worth it I
like to you know try and eat as healthy
as possible when I can and snacking is a
big thing for me I always tend to snack
on the wrong kind of foods so nature box
has really helped with that it helps me
to eat just a little healthier so let's
open this up and I'll show you guys what
I got it so the first thing here is just
a little pamphlet of nature box it says
you know it just kind of has a
description of what they are it says our
promise is less than 200 calories per 30
gram serving no hydrogenated oils no
artificial colors sweeteners and flavors
no added sulfates or so sulphites yeah
sulfates doesn't sound right that sounds
like a hair product sulfite I meant and
it says yes to high-quality nutritious
ingredients yes to thoughtful sourcing
and yes to the new the delicious and the
wow so that's kind of a cute little
pamphlet it shows you little things you
can get the next thing is just my order
of what I got and let me just start with
a snack so the first thing I got is the
nature box honey dijon pretzels which
are honey mustard flavored pretzel bites
and I think these look amazing I think
this is a really nice way of snacking
and getting that nice savory flavor
without having too many calories so nine
pieces of this is 120 calories and
you know it's very natural at the
ingredients wheat flour canola oil sugar
salt mustard powder you know nothing too
crazy in the ingredient list so I really
really like that excited to try those
the next thing I got were baked sweet
potato fries and it says baked sweet
potato flavored crackers and these just
look really really delicious I love
sweet potato fries I love sweet potatoes
in general so if these tastes similar to
sweet potato I'll be very excited and
I'll read you the nutrition facts I'm
one ounce of this is only 70 calories so
that's pretty good um the next thing I
got was banana bread granola which
sounds amazing and it says banana
flavored granola with raisins and it
says nutritionist approved and it says
half a cup is 230 calories really
excited to try that the next thing I got
was parmesan garlic pop pops which are
parmesan garlic popcorn kernels so
they're kind of like those um you know
what is that core that corn brand or
whatever uh corn pops or whatever that
you can get at the drugstore these are
kind of like that but healthier
healthier healthier alternatives so you
can have a third cup of this for 170
calories those look delicious the next
thing I have is orange apple fruit chews
nutritionist approved it said you can
have a fourth cup of these for 110
calories um I wanted to include
something a little sweet because even
though I tend to be more savory and you
know salty fan I do also like sweetness
so these are going to be nice to dry out
and the last thing i got is um the
everything bagel sticks which are sesame
sticks was poppy seeds garlic and onion
and it says right here that this was a
bonus snack I didn't even realize yeah
so um oh that's right I did get five so
they added an extra bonus snack in there
which is really great and these look
delicious you can have a third cup of
these for 170 calories so I'm really
excited about that anyway I really love
your box I think that they have great
snacks and it really helps me to beat a
little healthier I do think that you get
quite a good amount for twenty dollars a
month if you get the deluxe bag so I
definitely think it's worth the money
especially if you're trying to eat a
little healthier so that was my unboxing
or just me showing you guys what I got
I'm in my nature box and I hope you guys
enjoyed i'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
