her lost an earring that was weird
anyway welcome back to my channel I hope
you were all having a wonderful tuesday
i have some weird lighting going on here
right now so i apologize about that um
but i am here to share with you guys
what is in our major box for the month
now before I even get started I just
want to say i do of us 24 haul video
going up after this one I wouldn't do
you guys like that like just posted like
unboxing video that's like food unboxing
that would not be my video for the day
so there will be two videos today we
have the snack unboxing and then I will
have my Sephora haul I'm okay with just
posting a subscription box like as the
video for the day but only if it's like
beauty related so anyway I have not
unboxed naturebox forever on my channel
if you go back in my unboxing playlist
you'll see that I have been purchasing
naturebox with my own money uh-huh sense
movie last year or the year before even
like a really long time and I just want
to say I'm not affiliated or sponsored
with him in any way shape or form I
don't have a little link for you to
click down there I don't have a discount
code or anything I personally do
purchase this as my own money and Tom
and I really do like the brand so anyway
we get the little um five pack snack
thing which is I believe in nineteen
dollars a month which is so ridiculously
expensive like you literally could get
so much more food than this for nineteen
dollars a month like I'm not even
getting like snack related but we really
do like the pics that they have Tom
really really enjoys a lot of their like
coffee flavored items and this month he
did get to pick at the box we switch off
each month so i did not have we been to
come on here and share with you guys
what he picked out for the month
although i can't get his ass home camera
at least i can show you guys what he
likes to pick for nature bugs so anyway
i'm going to share with you guys that
and then maybe next month i'll come on
and share mine like i said i normally
don't do these of boxing's but i saw at
my door and I was like what the hell
might have fallen box it so let's get
started the first item that he purchased
were these little mocha almond bars
which again I'm not surprised he loved
anything like coffee flavor but he
doesn't drink that much coffee very
strange anyway this is what they look
like they're just a mocha almond bar and
he likes to eat these in the morning and
just like bars in general i also like
snack bars
not too much you guys know I am on a
vegan diet five days a week monday
tuesday wednesday thursday friday and
like in here i'm already seeing tons of
mmm i'm already seeing a lot of let's
see here lactose yeah lactose honey just
like things that I can't eat most of the
week but I probably could munch on these
during the weekend but again we do
switch off each month because he tends
to eat a lot healthier than I do I like
really really junky food like very
savory or very very sweet items he
usually gets like good healthy stuff I
mean naturebox is just overall very
healthy ah but so I like them really
kind of crappy I'll be stuck all right
so anyway one of our is 210 calories it
does have 15 grams of fat in it but
that's probably because of the actual
nuts in there 35 grams of 35 grams 35
milligrams of sodium and 5 grams of
protein so yes that is what he got to
that is the first snack that he chose
and you get a little pack of three there
the next item sheet shows I'm not
surprised about fuel of anything sesame
so he got the honey crunch crisps and
these are basically just honey-coated
sesame chips and it says they are
bite-size crunchy and oh so slightly
sweet and yeah this is what they look
like and a fourth of a cup is 160
calories and get 10 grams of fat in here
and three grams of protein so not
horrible not great but not horrible the
next item he ordered we're whole wheat
chocolate animal cookies basically
animal crackers I don't like chocolate
animal crackers but he does um so nine
cookies is 120 calories for grams of fat
three grams of protein you do get 100 30
milligrams of sodium in here which is
not too bad now on the little of honey
crisps or whatever there's three hundred
80 milligrams sodium those are super
super savory and kind of salty so not
really I'm surprised about those but
yeah he likes to eat chocolate and more
mattresses he's adorable like that
alright the next item he chose I told
you guys he loved coffee so he got the
coffee kettle popcorn these are kettle
corn with coffee caramel caramelized
caramel iced caramel is caramelized
caramelized Caroline cowboy with coffee
caramelized popcorn so basically there's
just popcorn in here with let's see here
I guess coffee and caramel
which actually sounds really good i will
probably eat some of this but it does
contain milk and soy so i have to wait
till the weekend the three fourths of a
cup is 120 calories there's four grams
of fat in here per serving and 200
milligrams of sodium so not too bad only
one gram of protein but you know that's
what you get when you're eating popcorn
and then you last I don't think he chose
the for it this month are the pistachio
power clusters and these are nut squares
with almonds cashews and pistachios this
is the kind of that I don't like
and I know like as someone who does eat
a vegan diet like five days a week I
really should love nuts because i need
to get my protein but I'm not a huge fan
of this kind of stuff it just tastes a
little too healthy for me I just don't
like it but a fourth of a cup of these
is 150 calories 12 grams the fat again
the pot is probably good fat and you're
getting it from the nuts and then five
grams of protein so yeah anyway that is
what those look like and they're
basically just little nut clusters so
those are the items that Tom chose for
this month naturebox again I'm not
affiliated with them in any way but I
will leave a link below where you guys
can just go directly to the website not
an affiliate link or anything like that
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
little video and I'm gonna go film that
Sephora haul now I'll see you guys soon
but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
