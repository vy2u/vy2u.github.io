my channel today I have a Sephora haul
to share with you guys so if you are
interested in seeing what I placed in my
online order for then please keep on
watching so the first item I have here
is from Tarte so this is the new foil
finger paints a shadow palette I have
already gone ahead and swatch this a
little bit so I will share some swatches
with you guys as well you can see the
packaging is absolutely beautiful you
open it up you have a nice sized mirror
it is from the chart rainforest of the
sea collection which is one of the more
trusted collections from Tarte in my
opinion now you have three different
foiled shades in here as well as they
split pan that has kind of like glitter
finishes and these look really really
beautiful in my opinion I have only
swatched them so far so I've not used
them on my eyes but I plan to use them
in an upcoming first impressions video
like I said I've only swatch them so
technically I haven't worn them on my
eyes yet which is why I will probably
use them in the first impressions video
but the shades are beautiful especially
that burgundy and especially that really
gorgeous champagne color so that is the
first item that I picked up I also
picked up with this little highlighting
palette here from Urban Decay I will
have a it's on sale is it worth the
video coming up very soon for you guys
and this is the Urban Decay afterglow
highlighter palette inside of here you
have a nice sized mirror it is cardboard
packaging and then you do have four
different highlighters these shades are
ons cliche wicked as well as all what
does that one say oh I'm sorry no angel
so these are all really beautiful so far
I have been enjoying at this palette and
like I said when I do my upcoming it's
on sale is it worth it video I will let
you guys know if it is worth the sale
price and also if it is worth at the
full price but that is the Urban Decay
afterglow highlighter palette moving on
I did also pick up a palette that I told
you guys I was very interested in in my
December 2017 makeup wishlist video and
that is the new Kat Von D mini metal
matte palette I love the full size and
metal matte palette so I was very
excited for this one you have a nice
large sized mirror but this is very
compact in size and very travel friendly
in my opinion you have five a different
and metal crush eyeshadows on top and
then you have five at different mats on
the bottom I know that these are over
lapping shades and a lot of people were
complaining about
but for me personally this is definitely
something I will get a lot of use out of
especially if it is just as good of
quality as the full-size and mini metal
matte not mini just a regular metal vac
palette I will also go ahead and feature
this in the first impressions video so
I'm not gonna swatch it just yet but it
looks really beautiful so far and I'm
super excited for the shade
thunderstruck moving along to some
products from the ordinary I was so
excited to see that the ordinary is now
at Sephora I personally feel like they
would be a better fit at Ulta but I
don't mind them being at Sephora I did
pick up the high adherence silicone
primer which I have never tried before
again I will use this and feature it in
the first impressions video next week
and this is a high adherence bluring
surface smoother and a primer and I'm
very excited for it it comes in a nice
little squeezy too but just like this so
we shall see what that's all about
I've heard good things as well as
not-so-good things about that primer and
then here we have the buffet a multi
technology peptide serum I actually
picked this up for my boyfriend he was
asking me to find him a good a day and
nighttime serum I have tried the buffet
serum before I didn't love it at first
but then I did end up enjoying it quite
a bit and this is something that's not
going to irritate your skin you can wear
it during the day as well as at night
time so I did pick that up for him and
then for me I went ahead and picked up
the grand active retinoid 2% emulsion
I'm getting kind of sick of the luna
sleeping at night oil or I'm not really
getting sick of it I feel like my skin
is getting used to it so I wanted to
pick up a new a nighttime treatment so I
will be going ahead and testing this
baby out
moving on to a lip gloss formula that
you guys have been asking me to test out
for a while this is the Becca liquid
crystal lip topper I got the shade of
champagne dream flashes Bellini and
these were on sale for 50% off for the
past couple of weeks and originally I
did not pick these up but when I picked
up and B Becca light chaser highlighters
I do own all six of those in my favorite
shade is champagne dream flashes Bellini
so that's why I picked it this
particular one up but a lot of you are
saying that these are beautiful they
make your lips look a little more plump
and they apparently smell really good so
let's take a whiff kind of smells like
sunscreen really like a sweet scent it's
almost kind of savory um yeah it smells
a little interesting kind of smells like
suntan lotion to be completely honest
but this is a gorgeous a peachy color
with gold iridescent as well as like
green you can see all sorts of
holographic goodness in here
I'm very excited to go ahead and test
this out and then the final item that I
did pick up is the two-faced diamond
light a multi-use a diamond fire
highlighter you have the box within a
box a hand s you guys can see this is a
gorgeous highlighter now I have been
testing this out so I will not be using
it in the first impressions video I
actually purchased two of these so far I
have had some issues with mine I
purchased two it that ended up
shattering from Ulta so I went ahead and
just replace my order on Sephora but
this is a very very err light
highlighter unlike normal typical sort
of baked highlighters it doesn't feel
scratchy to the touch it's very very
smooth it's very very creamy I will
insert a swatch here so you guys can see
what it looks like so far so good mine
does pull a lot of green and blue sort
of reflect to it but I don't mind
looking like a beautiful little unicorn
or a little new so I definitely don't
mind I think it's beautiful I like the
colors I'm going on in here and I've
been very very impressed with the whole
entire chocolate Gold Collection from
Too Faced and finally guys the last
couple of items that I have here are
just samples as well as hundred-point
perks and the first one is the 100-point
perk of the good jeans lactic acid
treatment from Sunday Riley I personally
really enjoy my lactic acid treatment
from the ordinary for a fraction of the
price but I thought I'd pick this up it
is so tiny this is only gonna last me a
couple of days that kind of what is
wasn't worth it in my opinion for a
hundred point Burke and then here I have
a sample of the sol de janeiro acai body
power cream as well as a sample of the
belief hungarian water essence which is
not what I wanted but apparently they
gave me that so anyway guys that is it
for my Sephora haul like I said I will
be doing a first impressions video
testing out quite a few of these
products and next week so stay tuned for
that thank you so much for joining me
guys and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
