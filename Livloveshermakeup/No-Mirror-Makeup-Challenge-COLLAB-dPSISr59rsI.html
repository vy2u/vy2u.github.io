to my channel I look like a sheet this
morning like I am feeling like crap
today Oh fell asleep I photo but I
cannot speak I fell asleep with makeup
on last night like a full face of makeup
and I woke up really early to remove all
of it and by the way yes i have my
viewfinder showing right now I'm going
to turn it when i started the actual
challenge in a second but i feel like
such crap of my skin looks like such
crap i'm so like oh why um anyway as you
can probably tell from the title of this
video yeah i have a tempting indeed no
mirror makeup challenge today this is a
collab with my friend Amy and also my
friend Tiffany you're on YouTube I'm
going to link their instagrams their
videos their channels down below it will
be the first thing that you see in the
description bar but I I'm really excited
about this because Tiffany and I were
originally going to do this after we had
done the five minute makeup challenge
and then a lot of people were also
asking Amy if they would if she would do
the no mirror makeup challenge so I was
like join us this will be great we can
make this into a little group thing so
that is what we are doing today we did
go ahead and decide that we all wanted
to wear a bright lip so I did pull out
my NYX liquid suede a creme lipstick in
the shade pink last L scl 08 that is
what it looks like and I'm going to be
wearing that on my lips but I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys for the
most part I am actually trying to go to
work after this so I'm hoping to kind of
keep things a little bit on the natural
side and hopefully I'm not going to look
like a hot mess and I can actually go to
work of course it may not work out like
that will see again oh I just feel like
crap because I feel like I felt extra
makeup on my face right now I'm gonna
remove anything that I might have with
some extra makeup remover wipes before
we get into it but I really am trying to
go to work after this and not have to
reapply my makeup like take my makeup
off and then reapply it because I just
feel like my skin like won't be able to
handle that today but I might be after
all it might just happen that I do have
to go ahead
you know obviously reapply everything
but i'm hoping i don't have to so let me
know if you guys would like to see me at
amp like a full-on some mochi I and all
that kind of stuff in a future video for
like no mirror makeup challenge because
I can make that happen but today I'm
gonna try and keep it a little more
subtle and natural we'll see how that
goes so anyway like I said because the
difficulty put makeup on I'm going to go
ahead and cleanse my face quickly with
the ponds evening soothe wet cleansing
towelettes with chamomile and white
teeth and now I'm going to flip that
little viewfinder around and we are
gonna start this video and I'm freaking
out because I feel like people either do
really really good with this a challenge
or they do really really bad I know I'm
gonna do really really bad so um I'm
excited I hope that I can entertain you
guys um we'll see what kind of stuff did
I pick out oh I'm going to be using one
of these little steel pellets that i
will be reviewing after this video as
well which is another reason i don't
want to have to redo my makeup is
because i'm going to be reviewing these
so fingers Rob I might have to remake a
bob when I feel message means I did
indeed have to completely redo my makeup
cuz I was such a hot mess but i'm gonna
be using that i'm going to be using my
Urban Decay I'm highlighter in hora I'm
gonna be using my little Malley pro
tricks nose contour kit i'm going to be
using um just some stuff i'm going to be
using some color correctors this little
mixed salad and for foundation I'm going
to be using make have a girl + olay and
of course i'll link everything in the
description bar or not linked it but you
know write everything out so you guys
know exactly what everything is but yeah
all right so it looks like we got all of
them excess makeup off i'm going to turn
you guys around I'm scared look at my
hot mess of a hair like what is going on
here what is this alright I'm going to
turn you guys around and we are gonna do
this and i'm scared i'm scared i can't
see you guys it feels so weird alright
so the first thing admitted you i'm not
going to tend to hold anything up
because i don't know where the freak you
guys are okay alright so i'm going to be
using this Oprah silicone primer gel I'm
just going to take a little bit of that
and put it all over the back of my hand
that was way too much oh well this whole
challenge is just going to be made up of
way too much way too much everything
probably so I'm just putting this all
over my face and a little
beneath my eyes as well what kind of
tinkles oh boy probably shouldn't have
tried a new primer for the first time in
this video alright so I'm just gonna let
it go ahead and kind of sink in sorry
there was just like a loud noise out
there look what the hell with that I'm
looking out this way by the way I did
open my shades up I don't have a mirror
over there you guys are curious or
people watching for a while you know
that I still don't have a mirror in the
beauty room um well I mean I don't have
one that like faces out towards the
window I went over here but I'm not
looking at that um but what was I gonna
say oh yeah I'm just kind of looking
there's like a lot of noise I don't know
if you guys heard that but I'm looking
out towards the actual like downtown
area so if I look out there that's
that's what I'm doing so that I'm not
staring at you guys the whole time and
looking into your soul alright moving on
let's go ahead and put on some I primer
so I'm going to be taking my ELF eyelid
primer this is in sheer I believe this
is just like their one dollar primer and
I'm just gonna just gonna put this on my
eyelids yeah that feels wrong and right
and wrong pretty much wrong all right
just keep swimming all right just go
ahead and tap that in yes yes yes you
guys that feels great this is no I don't
like it I don't like this I don't have a
good feeling about this I felt like a
medium could possibly do my face without
freaking up and I'm thinking go all
right guys we're gonna go in with the
next color correcting palette and I'm
going to be using the yellow shade I'm
going I don't know where my redness is
on my face so on right now because I
can't see anything so I'm not going to
use my green but I'm gonna use the peach
the lavender and then this down here so
first we're going to take this color
down here I'm just going to put this on
the areas where I have hyperpigmentation
along my jawline hopefully so weird an
even know where to look right now guess
I just stare at you guys hey part it I'm
tapping this in and then I'm going to go
in with the yellow shade and I'm going
to put this above my eyebrows too kind
of wear on my eyebrows all right to kind
of lift no no you guys are probably
watching your like and no added fat all
right that's okay and then I'm going to
go in with the kind of peachy shade here
and I'm just going to attack this in
underneath my eye holy I almost
just got that in my eye no no I'm going
to put a little on my eyelid as well
okay all right other side underneath the
eye cancel out blue tones and then on
the eyelid as well by the way have my
ring light turn down a little bit just
because I don't want it to be like wham
bam in your face looking like a hot mess

lavender shade going on the outside of
my mouth to kind of fill in my little
fine lines right there okay how do I
