have a grocery haul for you guys and
this is a non-vegan grocery haul and it
is from trader joe's a lot of you were
asking if I would show some foods from
Trader Joe's and i know that i just
posted a grocery haul a few days ago but
i thought what the heck i'll do another
one since i did stop at trader joe's
obviously to pick up some groceries
tonight so anyway yeah i do not eat
vegan on the weekend so i'm sharing with
you guys what Tom and I will be eating
for the next couple of weekends so let's
go ahead and get started the first item
that I picked up over some chunky
chocolate chip cookie dough basically
these are just cookie dough that you
make into chocolate chip cookies I
thought both looked really really good
and I'm excited to eat those and then
for Tom he really likes anything with
meat so I thought that I would make some
pasta dishes and then put in this just
grilled chicken strips he really seems
to like those so I got those for him I
got a container of strawberries and then
right now at trader joe's they have all
of this like mango stuff going on so I
picked up these naturally flavored mango
waffles I thought those looked amazing
i'm super excited for those i also
picked up some low-fat yogurt strawberry
smoothies and also the wild berry
smoothies be very nice they're just
little probiotic drinks and they taste
really good both Tom and I like those a
lot here is Tom's favorite flatbread
pizza these are the mushroom and black
truck truffle flatbread pizzas with
mozzarella cheese I've told you guys
before he's obsessed with ruffles so he
likes to eat those and then I like these
little French thin crust brie pizzas
with tomatoes on it it's so so good so I
picked that up and then I also got to
some of these little sweet mini peppers
they just come in a little ziplock bag
like this these are so nice for dipping
and hummus or just eating plain they're
so so so good so I got a bag of those
and then I got my favorite juice from
trader joes which is there a hundred
percent pure tangerine juice it kind of
tastes like orange juice but a little
more tangy and then I did get two boxes
of the morning star bacon strips these
are non meat bacon strips they're the
best ever taste way better than regular
bacon in my opinion I also got the
trader joes petabyte crackers I love
these so much and i am going to be
eating that with
this little baby right here I got my
favorite brie cheese ever or just my
favorite cheese in general is brie
cheese this is the double cream brie and
I like to put a little bit of this on to
the petabyte crackers it tastes so so so
good all right we got some sliced
Delmont a gold spheres which is just
pineapple we also got some sliced
watermelon tom knows how to cut
watermelon so I'm gonna bring home a
whole watermelon next time and we'll see
if he can actually do that because i do
not know how to cut a watermelon for my
life I know it's a lot cheaper to just
get the whole thing but yeah we got some
watermelon strips and I got Tom a bag of
raw almonds he really likes almonds and
I to I normally like them flavored but
it's okay we'll eat those and then I got
us some garlic fries these are so
ridiculously good and nice for the
weekend so we really like those a lot I
got some Parisian cucumbers I just like
the little Parisian ones because they're
tiny and they are sweet super good for
dipping into humus or any sort of dip we
also got some pink lady apples these are
my favorites they just come in a bag
here I like the pink lady apples because
they're super super super excuse me
super crispy and really really sweet so
I like those a lot and then I got these
little angel cots these are white
apricots which I thought was so cute so
I'm excited to eat those and then I got
Tom some bananas he eats a banana every
single day and then we got some frozen
fruit we got two bags of strawberries
family likes smoothie so we thought that
we would make some smoothies and then I
got two bags of the Sam seaberry medleys
which have like eat your blueberries
they have blackberries raspberries and
them so triple medley there and then
this is also one of their mango like
items right now this is the limited
edition mango chili chicken it's a dish
of gender a tender a battered dark
chicken and diced mango in a slightly
sweet and spicy mango sauce so this is
basically their take on their orange
chicken for the summertime and then they
