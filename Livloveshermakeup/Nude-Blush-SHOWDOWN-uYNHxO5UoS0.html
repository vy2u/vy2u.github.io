you so much for joining me I hope you
are all having a fantastic day in this
video we are finally doing the nude
blush showdown video where I share with
you guys cream drugstore high ends
blushes that are in the nude category
pinky nudes peachy nudes just like warm
bronzy nude and basically we go through
them and i will swatch them out for you
i will let you know if they are good for
like particular skin tones or types and
also i am going to let you guys know at
the end sorry there's like a bird of
flying over there very distracting very
pretty bird anyway at the end of the
video i will let you guys know which
three blushes and nude blushes are my
all-time favorites so anyway i want to
say really quickly i did do the what was
it called - the champagne battle of the
champagne highlights video and i did
forget to include a few highlighters in
that video people were like what about
Urban Decay sin and all of these things
so I really tried to go over my
collection and pick out exactly the nude
blushes that I really thought should be
in this video and I double-checked
everything so I'm sorry if I do leave
something out but I really tried this
time to make sure that I don't but I
would love to know if you guys would
like to see a video on my favorite blush
palette I do have a lot of blush
palettes that you include nude blushes
in them however for the sake of this
video I did decide to go ahead and just
show you guys single so let's go ahead
and get started and here alright the
first nude blush that i want to talk
about east from the brand Illamasqua and
this is the Illamasqua powder blush in
the shade Naked Rose Naked Rose is
beautiful as you guys can see it is
matte it is absolutely stunning and I
feel like this is beautiful on a lot of
different skin tones if you have very
very very deep like chocolaty skin I
don't know what this will show up on you
but I do think if you have fair skin if
you have a light to medium skin I think
this would be beautiful on you and I
would say this one definitely leans a
little more on the mob side but it's
absolutely stunning and ever sends Tarte
released their knotty nudes collection I
really have been obsessed with new to
blushes so this is the first one again
this is naked Rose from Illamasqua and
there it is absolutely beautiful
alright the next one I want to talk
about is from the drugstore and this
will leans more on the nudie pink side
and you may look at this and be like
that's not nude that's pink but honestly
I feel like it does have a little bit of
a nude undertone in it this is from
L'Oreal
yes L'Oreal this is the True Match blush
in the shade of baby blossom and this is
in their cool category it's c12 they
have them color-coordinated based on
like you know your undertone in your
skin or whatever so this is what it
looks like to me on my fair skin this
still is a very very kind of nudie blush
I really really like it and I think it's
beautiful I think this would be gorgeous
on anybody who has like fair skin to
light-skin medium skin if you do have
really really deep dark chocolaty skin
again I'm not going to sure if this
would show up on you but if you do have
fair to light or medium skin I think
this would be beautiful if you do pull
more of a cool undertone I think this
one would be a better option rather than
the Illamasqua if you pull more of a
warm undertone the Illamasqua might be
better for you so there are the two of
those together and I know that this
particular color does show up a little
more pinky on some complexions but for
me personally it actually shows up a
little more nude alright moving on the
next blush we are going to talk about is
from Tarte of course and this is part of
their and naughty nudes collection this
is the shade risque and risque looks
like this really really beautiful you're
getting a little bit of ma B undertones
in there overall it's just a really
really stunning color I think it's
beautiful and there it is it's just that
true nude with a little bit of like a
Mavi undertone so here is what risque
looks like risque is going to be
beautiful on pretty much every single
skin tone in my opinion even if you have
really really deep skin I feel like this
will show up on you you may have to
build it up a little bit but I think
it's beautiful if you do pull more of a
warm undertone I think you would
absolutely love this blush and there it
is risque now right next to that one
we're going to go ahead and swatch
sensual which is also from the naughty
Newton and sensual definitely leave a
more on the warm tone at warm side as
well warm tone side as well you guys
know what I'm trying to say this is a
beautiful blush as well and this one
definitely has more of the peachy peachy
nude thing going on I would say a little
more grungy peachy nudie color going on
I think it's beautiful
again if you lean more on the warm side
I think this one would be right up your
alley and this one I think will show up
really nicely if you do have fair to
light medium skin tones risque is going
to be better if you do have a really
deep complexion but this one is going to
be better if you do have more like fair
to light skin tones alright moving on
let's talk about one from ELF that is
actually a loose mineral blush of this
is what it looks like I'm totally going
to tip over all over my floor I can
already feel it if this is the elf
mineral blush in the shade joy and I
really really enjoy the shade this is
like a typical kind of nudie pinky color
with a little bit of a mob undertone and
you definitely can build it up on the
skin it does remind me a little bit of
risque which is from the Noddy news
there it is it has a beautiful Sheen to
it and I think this would be gorgeous on
anybody who has fair to light skin tones
and if you do pull a cool undertone or
you have cool undertone or pink
undertones in your skin I think you
would absolutely love that one the next
one we have here is from Anita I love
this one this is more of almost like a
bronzy color but for me I still put this
in the nude category because when you
use a light hand with it it's absolutely
stunning on the cheeks and this is the a
meet a makeup artist color powder blush
in the shade 1:08 look at that baby
isn't that gorgeous oh god I love this
blush so it definitely has more of like
a bronzy undertone as you can see but I
swear to you if you use a light hand
with this it is just the most stunning
beautiful light nude color on your
cheeks it definitely leaves a little
more on the warm tone or warm side as
you guys can probably see my god by
swatching my swatching is ridiculous but
let me go ahead and kind of
lend it out for you guys you can see
blends up beautifully this is a really
nice nude blush
kind of bronzing nude blush if you do
have really really deep skin tones I
feel like this would definitely show up
on you it's very very buildable which I
really really enjoy and I will say this
is one of my things at the end this is
one of my favorites it's absolutely
beautiful
all right the next one I want to talk
about is from L'Oreal this is a cream
blush and this is the l'oreal visible
lift blush in the shade nude lift this
is gorgeous this is very very kind of
bronzy nudie colored if you do have I
would say just like a neutral undertone
you don't pull too much cool tones or
too much warm tones I think you would
love this it's very very light and airy
like the actual texture of it really
really easy to blend on the cheeks and
this is one of the only cream blush
formulas that I'm really in love with if
you guys have heard me talk about like
its sister which is the what is it
called I think it's called rose gold
lift it's the same sort of formulation
as this one one of my all-time favorite
blushes is the rose gold one it's
absolutely beautiful
so I think this is a beautiful beautiful
nude blush if you do have fear to light
skin tones this is definitely going to
show up on you have the beautiful
iridescent sand it definitely hits the
light really really nicely you can wear
it very very lightly on the cheeks or
you definitely can build it up I think
if you do have a really really deep
complexion this probably isn't going to
show up on you but you could probably
use it as a highlighter so that is the
next nude blush really really stunning
again that is the L'Oreal visible lift
in the shade 7:05 new to lift and that
would definitely leave a little more on
the warm side one of the things a little
more on the cool side again is a cream
product this is from Clinique this is
the chubby stick in the shade 0-1
amped-up apple i actually love this
product like I said I'm not really that
into cream blushes I'm just not really
into them but this is a beautiful
beautiful color it reminds me a lot of
the risque shade from the United nudes
collection from Tarte it's got a lot
more cool undertone so here's one that
has a little more warm undertones here's
one that has a little more cool
undertones it's very very blendable and
I feel like this would show up on all
sorts of complexions and if you do have
dry skin I think that it's really really
nice to use a cream blush because it's
not going to over emphasize
any sorts of texture on your face or
dryness or fine lines or wrinkles or
anything like that so that is a really
really nice option I would say this one
from L'Oreal and also you know the cream
products in general are really nice if
you do have dry skin but I really like
this particular color and I'm actually
thinking of next week for shot my stache
layering this one with the shade of
risque because I think they would be
absolutely alright moving on and the
next one I want to talk about is from
covergirl I freaking love this blush
okay I'm obsessed with these blushes
these old-school blushes that are called
their classic color blushes they oh girl
they smell like Grandma and not that's a
bad thing I actually really really like
that scent it actually does remind me of
my grandmother but they're very
old-school look at this clunky ass
packaging like nobody would think to
pick this up but this is an absolutely
beautiful blush right here this
particular sheet is called 590 soft mink
and I picked this up because I'm Emily
Noelle 83 here on YouTube was raving
about this and you guys God she was so
right this is a beautiful beautiful
blush every single one from this
particular classic color line the row
silk shade soft mink and the plum shade
these all have the most gorgeous silver
iridescent to them but look at that
beautiful nudie kind of color right
there it's absolutely stunning again it
reminds me a little bit of the risque
shade from The Nanny nudes collection is
definitely a little more deeper and has
a little bit of a plum undertone but
it's definitely still in that kind of
nudie category absolutely stunning on
the cheeks and it really really lifts
with a little bit of iridescent that it
has there love that and if you do have a
cool undertone I think that would be
beautiful again this one is probably
better for those who do have fair to
light maybe medium skin tones you might
have to build it up a little more if you
have a deeper complexion but again we
are talking about nude blushes and
unfortunately I feel like the majority
of them really only show up on you know
fair to light skin tones or medium skin
tones but there are a few in here like
that Clinique one and also the amita
that I definitely think could show up as
a nude blush on a deeper skin tones
alright and then the last blush that I
want to talk about is the Too Faced at
love plush long-lasting 16 hour blush in
the shade baby love baby love is
beautiful
it definitely posed a little bit more of
a
undertone on my particular skin tone so
if you do have a fair complexion I think
this is absolutely beautiful and I don't
know guys I just I'm absolutely obsessed
with this I think it's absolutely
beautiful it definitely pulls more
peachy on me personally even though I do
have a cool undertone but there it is so
there is that soft mink shade and then
there is baby love and baby love really
looks different on everyone seriously I
feel like these love flush blushes look
different on everyone my all-time
favorite color from the actual like
formulation is love hangover and that
shows up so like corley and peachy on my
cheeks that it looks like mob on other
people so I just wanted to put that out
there but on me this is very peachy
nudie and leans a little more on the
warm side but if you do have it it's
weird because I have a cool undertone
but it could lean a little more on like
the cooler side for you it really just
depends I swear this is like one of
those mood rings like it changes color
on different people's skin tone or like
on their actual skin so a very very
interesting blush but I love this one
and I think that this would show up on a
lot of different skin tones so overall I
think that all of these are really
fantastic options as you can see you can
pick up crave ones depending on if you
have me the aging skin or dry skin you
can pick up powder ones if you do have
oily or combo skin like I do and you can
also pick up you know nude blushes from
the drugstore for sure so my top three
the first one is the Too Faced love
flush in baby love absolutely love this
I'm going to go ahead and swatch the top
three for you guys so here is Baby Love
and the reason I love baby love mostly
is just because of the formulation the
love flush blush like formulation is one
of my all-time favorite blush
formulations if not my favorite I think
it's absolutely beautiful and absolutely
stunning and it's just it's like I'm
obsessed I'm absolutely obsessed alright
the next one is the L'Oreal visible lift
in nude lift and this one was hard for
me because I was like
you know I do love the rose gold shade
more than this particular one but I
still think this is absolutely beautiful
and it makes for a gorgeous gorgeous
nude blush and then the third one I
already told you guys I wish I could
pick four I kind of want to pick for you
guys I kind of want to pick risk' and I
kind of want to pick the amita and I
really want to pick the hue of Mosca
it's super super hard because they're
all so beautiful but I'm going to have
to go with the in detail beam at the
third one and here is the mej all right
so those are the three of them you may
be like that I'm not a nude blush but
when you blend it out like I did earlier
you can see that it definitely turns
into more of a nude blush let me blend
it out so that people aren't yelling at
me in the comment section so there are
the three of them here we have the Too
Faced and then we have the L'Oreal and
then the unmeet a so those are my top
three nude blush picks I hope that this
video was helpful thank you so much for
joining me again let me know down below
if you would like me to do a video on my
favorite blush palette or my height
favorite highlighting palettes I would
love to do that as well and yeah I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
