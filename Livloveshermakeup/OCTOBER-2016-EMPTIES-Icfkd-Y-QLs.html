are super up close and personal for this
video because I am sharing with you guys
my October 2016 empties and I have this
literally balance between me and my ring
light right now so anyway I'm going to
share with you guys the products that I
used up for this month if I sound a
little raspy in the voice it's because
I'm still not feeling a hundred percent
so I hope you guys can understand but
anyway let's go ahead and get started
the first item that we used up was from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this is the golden
autumn day deep cleansing hand soap and
this is what the bottle looks like and
oh my god this stuff smells amazing this
is a blend of sunny mandarin autumn
leaves and blonde woods and it smells so
so so good so when I would repurchase
that we would also repurchase this deep
cleansing hand soap in the scent I was
in say shade in the scent crispim
morning air this is a blend of soft pine
fresh juniper and juicy pear it smelled
amazing as well alright moving on
another item that would definitely be a
repurchase is The Rock daily resurfacing
disc and this is something that I used
as the second part of my makeup removal
at nighttime so I'll go in with a makeup
remover and oil base 1 or right now I'm
using the purity made simple cleansing
gel and then I like to go in with one of
these I remember all over my face over
my eyes just to pick up any residual
makeup I love those would repurchase
here we have the Sephora avocado hand
mask this is supposed to be nourishing
and repairing I actually really enjoyed
this and I definitely would pick this up
again I seem to like all of their mass
except for their face mask so I like the
under eye math I like their like foot
mass and I like this one so I would
repurchase that I went through a little
container of these Olay daily cleansing
cloths or daily facial cloths I believe
they are so it comes in this little
package here and as you guys can see you
have all of these little cloths that are
in here obviously I use them up so
there's nothing left in there but it
just came in a little box like this I
honestly didn't really like these I
don't feel like they removed my makeup
all that well I got them because I know
that emily noel 83 here on youtube who I
really really trust raves about these a
lot but she does have kind of like
normal skin I'm a little more on the
combo to oily side so maybe that's why
these didn't like deeply cleanse enough
but I would not repurchase those let's
see here I've used up a Gillette Venus
Olay sugarberry bliss this is a shaving
cream
it smelled like candy it was really
really good but right now I am using
something from tree hut the
moisturizing shave oil that's even
better so I don't know if I would
repurchase that I thought I would
mention these is why the hell not these
are from vitae fusion these are the
fiber well gummies but we all get
constipated sometimes okay it happens
and I swear that these actually help a
lot so you take two gummies every single
day and they taste really good and I
feel like they really do help to keep
everything flowing correctly so I do
enjoy that let's see here I went through
a simple micellar cleansing water if
you're like I go through one of these
every single month I adored this
cleansing water this is beautiful and
very very nice and very very gentle if
you are someone who has sensitive skin
or dry skin you would love this
another micellar cleansing water that I
went through this month is the Garnier
skin active micellar cleansing water
with the pink cap this is my sensitive
skin version and this is beautiful
really nice if you do have combo to oily
skin it's a little more deep cleansing
and I really do enjoy that so I would
repurchase that let's see here Tom went
through the nest fragrances woodland
truffle liquid soap I seem to get this
oh there's so little at the bottom how
dare he I seem to get this room every
single time it is on sale at Sephora he
loves the scent of like truffle woods
like stuff like that so he really enjoys
this soap and I'm gonna put that to the
side because there's still some prodding
left in there and he needs to reduce it
the next item that I used up is actually
a primer it is the Too Faced hangover RX
replenishing facial primer and this is
what it looks like and this is in my
current project pan video so yeah I
finished that up we have some candles of
course the first one being leaves and
leaves is a blend of crisp red apple a
golden nectar and warm clove spice we
would definitely definitely repurchase
next year we love that scent also autumn
is a really really wonderful one as well
and this one is a blend of let's see
here bright red Gala apple juicy fig
eucalyptus and fir balsam so really
enjoy that would repurchase next fall
again as well pumpkin pecan waffles this
is what it looks like this is an amazing
smelling candle too it is a blend of
maple syrup of golden waffles pumpkin
spice and brown sugar I really do enjoy
that we would repurchase or at least I
would repurchase moving on we have the
three wood candle in pumpkin cupcake
another really really good one as well
enjoyed that quite a bit would
repurchase I feel like I'm saying that
about every
but these candles really do smell good
all right moving on we have another deep
cleansing hand soap here I'm sorry it's
look most of these are like home empties
this month anyway and this is sparkling
seas this is a blend of water lily
morning dew and coral musk it didn't
smell that good we would not repurchase
this next summer but this one smelled
really good this was summer sale this
was a blend of salty air pink peppercorn
and blonde woods
anytime Bath &amp;amp; Body Works has something
called blonde woods we seem to like it
like anytime that's in some sort of a
scent I love it all right another little
pack here of the Olay facial towels like
I said they didn't really work for me
they do come dry and then you moisten
them and then you take off your makeup
but I felt like I needed two or three to
get off my full face let's see here I
used up these skin food yoghurt this was
one of their little masks that they had
sent me for PR I don't think these are
very good at all of they are they're
sheet masks they're very very hard to
fit onto your face and very very thick
so I don't feel like anything really
absorbs into the skin is just weird I
don't like these so I would not
recommend these to you guys would not
repurchase did not purchase them in the
first place but I would not buy those
with my own money I'm looking here I
went through two packs of these Sephora
cleansing wipes the first one is the
ultra moisturizing and brightening rose
version these are my all-time favorite
cleansing wipes at the moment would
repurchase and second favorite are
definitely the yuzu and that is what of
these look like these are beautiful
these are revitalizing and toning so I
really like these in the morning kind of
it's like a cleanser basically in like
towelette form and then I will use the
rose ones to remove a my makeup at
nighttime all right we used up a little
Wallflower here this one was pumpkin
wait what does this a marshmallow
pumpkin latte we have that in the Beauty
room right now it smells amazing another
three would cancel a pumpkin or french
toast a really really good one as well
and this is a blend of let's see here
maple syrup pumpkin spice and
thermalized a brown sugar we definitely
wouldn't repurchase that we have even
more of these Sephora wipes the first
one here is the charcoal version this is
the exfoliating purifying and
detoxifying version it's just okay and
not my favorite probably baby would
repurchase we'll see and then another of
the YouTube like I said I adore those
they smell like lemon very uplifting
would repurchase though is another a
three week handle in let's see here
pumpkin pie they did change the scent on
this this year
it used to smell better like last year
but it is a blend of creamy pumpkin
vanilla creme fresh ground nutmeg and
graham cracker crust I love that that
was actually my favorite fall cancel if
you guys are curious and we actually
have two of those because we had those
in the living room all right moving on
and the next item that we have here is
from here a table oh I'm sorry I'm
digging in here
and this is the purity made simple
one-step facial cleanser I used this to
actually clean up my makeup brushes it
works really really well I love it and I
would go ahead and repurchase that all
right so we have some little samples
here I've used up the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana rose spray perfume this
was nice I'm not quite sure if I would
purchase a full-size though I do like
the bourbon one though here we have the
antibacterial salted pineapple punch
pocket back I can never get the little
last little bit out here this is from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it was a nice scent
would repurchase a little mini of the
sundae Riley Martian mattifying melting
water gel toner I already went ahead and
purchased a full-size of this I love
that I used up a sheet mask here this is
from let's see here this is the purify
with lavender and arnica it's called
fango essentiality this is what it looks
like this was just okay I didn't really
notice that big of a difference again
like we she passed it's either they're
really really good or they're not very
good Tom used up a seer of a skin
redoing now I'm second redoing skin
renewing night cream with nve delivery
technology he told me to tell you guys
this was just okay so I'm currently he
would not repurchase all right moving on
we have some more wipes down here again
these Sephora rose wipes like I said
ultra moisturizing and bright me they do
leave a little bit of something left on
your skin so if you don't like that you
would not like these I used up these
Sephora eye mask in the LG version
version this is tawny and detoxifying
would repurchase I enjoyed that quite a
bit and then we have a bunch of little
again more samples and wallflowers let's
see here these cinnamon spice vanilla
antibacterial hand gel from Bath and
Body Works really liked that scent I
juiced up the Josie Maran I'm sorry
just keeps dropping the Josie Maran pure
argon milk intensive hydrating treatment
I do enjoy this I probably would
purchase a full-size of that and then we
have a bunch of little wall flowers
again we have one of the autumn we have
I kept all the tags and stuff a little
messy bottles we have leave
and then here I have a perfume spray
this one was in bourbon so to go along
with rose you can pair them together or
you can choose not to pair them together
I did use up this little lightning lipid
bubbles solution this is a my stellar
water it smelled really good I didn't
notice the difference in lightening my
skin though so I would not purchase a
full-size and the final item that I used
up with the fresh black th delay firming
serum I would consider getting a
full-size of that it is very pricey but
very much a worth it so anyway that's it
guys I hope that you enjoyed today's
video sorry if I seem a little out of it
it's because well I'm not feeling good
but I still wanted to get something out
for you guys today so I hope you have a
wonderful week and I'll see you guys
hopefully tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
