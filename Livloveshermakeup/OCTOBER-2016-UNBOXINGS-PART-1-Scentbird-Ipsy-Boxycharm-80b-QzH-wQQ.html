video is going to be my October 2016
unboxings I have six the different
beauty subscription boxes to share with
you guys and I tried filming this all in
one take and it was a 35 minute video 35
minutes ok so what I realized that I
need to do with these kinds of videos is
probably split them up so probably do 3
and 3 do part 1 part 2 or I need to stop
reading off of the little cards like
everything that comes with them because
this was way too long of a video so what
I'm gonna do in this one is split it up
into two sections I'm gonna do three
unboxings now and then three unboxings
in the next one this one is going to be
sent bird if see an owl so boxy charm
and then the next one will be Sephora
play it will be a glossy box and then
pop sugar must-haves and I will post it
right after this video so you guys don't
have to worry but yeah 35 minutes I
think it's a little excessive I know a
lot of you guys don't mind watching long
videos but come on 35 minutes is very
excessive so I'm gonna try it this way
and the next month I will try and not
like read off of the cards and just go
through and show you guys all the items
but anyway I want to say really quickly
all of these boxes were purchased with
my own money except for one of them
Sandford did send me this this month is
the first time I've ever been sent
something from Sanford and this was just
for PR which means it's just I give you
guys my honest review on it they are not
paying me I'm not being sponsored in any
way shape or form so anyway let me tell
you guys a little bit I guess we'll
start with Sanford so simpered is $14.95
a month you do get to choose from a 450
different fragrances on their website
and basically what they do is they send
you one little pouch now because they
wanted me to try different things out
they did send me two but for you if you
were to order every single month and do
their subscription you would get one
little vial of perfume basically each
month so their little motto is to date
perfumes before you marry them and the
technic is kind of cute if you are
someone who collects perfumes like I do
if you would like to see my perfume
collection I will link it down below I
think I have well over forty to fifty
perfumes forty to fifty per views body
mists fragrances things like that so I
will link that video down below but if
you are someone who really is an avid
collector like I am this is actually a
subscription I think he would be
interested in I've seen simper do a lot
of different kind of collaborations on
YouTube and nothing against scent bird
but I just find that some of the people
that they do collaborate with I don't
find the most trustworthy so I
kind of had like a weird feeling about
some bird but when they reached out to
me their customer care and service was
impeccable really really wonderful and I
got a good vibe for them so I thought I
would try it out so anyway every single
month like I said you do get charged
$14.95 you get this little velvet pouch
and the first month that you order you
actually get this cute little you get
one of these little travel cases so the
actual vials come out like this as you
guys can see and if you are curious you
are getting let's see here
0.27 fluid ounces of product in here now
you may be thinking that's not a lot but
that is actually the exact size of a
standard rollerball so here is a
rollerball that is the same exact size
this is obviously a rollerball this is a
spray version I always prefer a spray
version and for 1495 this is pretty darn
good because if you go onto these
sephora.com website and say you know
this one right here is Versace at
Crystal say I want a rollerball in this
that would cost me between $25 and $28
per 0.227 ounces or whatever it was I
said so I actually think this is quite
good
for 1495 a month and I love the fact
that it is a spray so the two that I
asked them to send me were a Versace a
bright crystal and also DKNY be
Delicious because those are two that I
actually own in a full-size and I wanted
to make sure this was legitimate I
wanted to make sure they were identical
to what I have in a full-size I wore
half of it on my body like on the left
side and then the original on my other
side they are the same exact things so
these are the perfumes that come in
these full sizes they are basically just
putting them into these little vials for
you guys so I would say if you are
someone who is a big fan of perfumes and
you go through a lot of them you like to
wear different fragrances if you guys
watch my fails and holy grails every
week I usually have a different
fragrance mixing or pairing that I do
every single week and this is definitely
a subscription you should look into if
you're someone who really doesn't change
up your perfume all that often this is
probably something you wouldn't be that
interested in but I am very very happy
with the subscription I think it's great
and just for a reference let me show you
guys what it looks like next to like a
little sample size so obviously you are
getting way way way more product in here
but I think this is great really happy
with the fragrances I chose like I said
I already knew these fragrances quite
well Versace right crystal is one of my
favorites and DKNY be Delicious is also
one of my favorites but yeah very very
happy with this subscription service and
even if they didn't send me
another box next month that this would
be something that I would definitely
think about going ahead and purchasing
on my own and becoming you know
subscribe to it so anyway I usually
don't do like affiliate links and things
like that but they did give me a coupon
code for you guys and I actually thought
it was quite good so the coupon code is
LL hm a 25 all in capital letters live
loves her makeup and you can get 25% off
your first subscription which i think is
great so anyway I will leave that code
down below if you guys would like to use
it I will also leave their website down
below so you can go read a little bit
more about them it will not be an
affiliate link it will just take you
directly to the website but yeah really
really happy with Sempron I was quite
surprised and like I said you could just
put any of your little files in here
like this and this is a really nice
little travel thing because I've tried a
few ADA misers optimizers when you call
them 8o my service I think it's bad I
have tried quite a few I've tried these
so for one I've tried quite a few and
honestly a lot of these are not good you
guys they leak I don't know if you guys
can tell but they leak they're really
hard to travel with this one right now
has Tom issei Miyake cologne in there
and it's leaking all over my hands so I
really like this one because it's really
cool and you basically could just
interchange out every single month you
just put in your new little fragrance so
you only get this little case the first
month but I feel like it doesn't matter
because every single month if you were
to get this case you would just have a
bajillion of these so you basically just
interchange out your little perfume
every month so I think that's adorable
I love that so that was from a sense
bird moving on it we have if see so here
is my empty pouch and let's see what the
little bag looks like this month
here is the Ipsy bag this is so cute oh
my god it's Halloween themed obviously
so you have a little witch you have a
little spell book you have some fangs
you have a cute little ghost here so
let's go ahead and see what I got
alright the first item that I see in
here is from where is this from Lottie
London and this is like a flat shader
brush really really cute I love that
color and it definitely has like a
little bit of pink at the ends as well
feels really really soft and smooth so
that's great the next item that I got in
here let's see here it looks like it's
for the hair this is the pure Brazilian
miracle leave-in conditioner with
keratin 4 gorgeous silky smooth hair
colors faith UV protection amazing 10
benefits in
formulation so that looks very similar
to like the it's a tan and miracle spray
so excited to try that out I also got
the hot mama blush from the balm
cosmetics a little mini here I'm gonna
go ahead and declutter this to a friend
because I already have this in full size
but it is a beautiful really nice peachy
kind of NARS orgasm sort of color so
that's really cute I also got let's see
here it looks like a eyeshadows single
and you shade satin taupe that is what
it looks like and this is from a beauty
basics mm-hmm let's take a look at this
if you guys saw my single eye shadow
declutter you probably know I'm not a
huge fan of tons and tons of eyeshadow
singles but let's go ahead and swatch
this oh god it feels soft it actually
feels like a foil to shadow you know
what I think I will keep that that's
beautiful there is you see that color it
actually looks a lot like Mac's satin
taupe and then the final item that I got
in this month's box is or this month's
bag is the essence superfine eyeliner
pen this is waterproof
it says precise ultrafine smudge proof
extra long-lasting I will not use this
I've heard great things about this
though but you guys know I don't use um
liquid eyeliner pens but there it is
very very nice so I would probably go
ahead and declutter that alright so that
is what I got in my Ipsy let's move on
to boxycharm I heard a boxy term was a
really good box this month so let's take
a peek at the first I know we have here
is the Brio Gio Ross Arco risako right
rods are Co a below dry perfection and
heat protectant creme this has no
sulfates silicones or parabens in it
this is a blow dry cream
I don't do with my hair so I
probably won't use this but I may keep
it around maybe if I want to start
blowing my hair out um let's see here I
also have a little pack of luck CI
Blender brushes now I really like the
luck see bum brushes in general I think
the first time I ever got Alexi brush
was in a boxy charm so this looks like a
little trio here of eye brushes which is
awesome so this is like a little
blending brush tapered blending 2:05
brush and these are super silky alike
that it's very very long and it not
super densely packed but pretty nice and
then this one right here is called the
lux e 229 tapered blending so this one's
a little more short a little more
densely packed and then we also have
this
little one this one's so cute this is
the Luxy blending 237 brush and this
would be great for like upper crease
work I'm blending out alright I'm
excited about that next I got something
here in a little bubble wraps package
let's check it out this is the IB IB IB
Y beauty I've never heard of that I will
say sometimes like I noticed with these
subscription boxes I tend to give
products and brands that like I've never
heard of and there's nothing wrong with
that I don't mind supporting a brand
that isn't very well known things like
that but I just like have never ever
heard of some of these brands and I
don't know if sometimes that's kind of
interesting because it's like if it
doesn't end up being a good product and
they keep sending you something from
that brand in your next box you can get
kind of annoying but anyway so here is
what the little palette looks like
that's so cute it says Three's Company I
shadow tree oh oh that is nice
those are some pretty colors this would
be great for the purse you have a little
dual-ended
sponge tip applicator probably won't use
that but this is what the little trio
looks like let's swatch these oh they
feel quite good these feel foil - nice
those feel really good Wow I am I'm
impressed
yep love it look at the three of those
shades even the matte went on really
really nicely so I'm actually very
excited for that actually paired
together with this little single that I
got from Ipsy that would be beautiful
alright I also got the ten - what is
this this looks like a shimmer bronzer
here it is and it looks quite hmm it
looks a very very cool tone I don't know
if I would use this it's like a liquid
bronzer I think I'll just go ahead and
send this to my friend Rochelle she's
really good with liquid bronzers I'm not
so I'm gonna pass that along and then
here we have these star looks what is
this liquid lipstick so if you guys see
me on packaging all this I made it
through pretty much every single box and
that other one and I did not make it
through boxycharm
this is MLP for because this is I think
a liquid lipstick I guess there's no
liquid lipstick I'm pretty sure this
little liquid lipstick um we shall see
what it's like it's a beautiful
beautiful color but I don't know if I
would personally like the formulation so
anyway alright guys
anything that I got in my Sanford my
Ipsy bag and also boxycharm
I will move on to the next one and then
I will upload that video for you guys as
well see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
