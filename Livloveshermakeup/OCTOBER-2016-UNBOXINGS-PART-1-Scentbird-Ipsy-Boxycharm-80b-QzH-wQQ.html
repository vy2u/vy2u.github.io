video is going to be my October 2016
unboxings I have six different beauty
subscription boxes to share with you
guys and I tried filming this all in one
take and it was a 35 minute video 35
minutes okay so what I realize that I
need to do with these kind of videos is
probably split them up so probably do
three and three do part 1 part 2 or I
need to stop reading off of the little
cards like everything that comes with
them because this was way too long of a
video so what I'm going to do in this
one is split it up into two sections I'm
gonna do three unboxings now and then
three unboxings in the next one this one
is going to be sent bird if see and also
bucks each arm and then the next one
will be Sephora play it will be a glossy
box and then popsugar must have and i
will post it right after this video so
you guys don't have to worry but yeah 35
minutes I think it's a little excessive
I know a lot of you guys don't mind
watching long videos but come on 35
minutes is very excessive so I'm gonna
try it this way and the next month I
will try and not like read off of the
cards and just go through and show you
guys all the items but anyway I want to
say really quickly all of these boxes
were purchased with my own money except
for one of them Sanford did send me this
this month is the first time I've ever
been sent something from Sanford and
this was just for PR which means it's
just I give you guys my honest review on
it they are not paying me I'm not being
sponsored in any way shape or form so
anyway let me tell you guys a little bit
I guess we'll start with Sanford so
simpered is 14 and dollars and
ninety-five cents a month you do get to
choose from a 450 different fragrances
on their website and basically what they
do is they send you one little pouch now
because they wanted me to try different
things out they did send me too but for
you if you were to order every single
month and do their subscription you
would get one little vial of perfume
basically each month so their little
motto is to date perfumes before you
marry them and técnicas kind of cute if
you are someone who collects perfumes
like I do if you would like to see my
perfume collection i will link it down
below i think i have well over 40 to 50
perfumes up 40 to 50 per views body miss
fragrances things like that so i will
link that video down below but if you
are someone who really is an avid
collector like i am this is actually a
subscription i think you would be
interested in I've seen semper do a lot
of different kind of collaborations on
YouTube and nothing against sent bird
but I just find that some of the people
that they do collaborate with I don't
find the most trustworthy so I
kind of had like oh we were feeling
about some bird but when they reached
out to me their customer care and
service was impeccable really really
wonderful and I got a good vibe for them
so I thought I would try it out so
anyway every single buns like I said he
do get charged $14.95 you get this
little velvet pouch and the first month
that you order you actually get this
cute little um you get one of these
little travel cases so the actual vials
come out like this as you guys can see
and if you are curious you are getting
let's see here 0.27 fluid ounces a
product in here and now you may be
thinking that's not a lot but that is
actually the exact size of a standard
roller balls so here is a rollerball
that is the same exact size this is
obviously a rollerball this is a spray
version I always prefer a spray version
and for 1495 this is pretty darn good
because if you go on to these
sephora.com website and say you know
this one right here is versace bright
crystal say I want a roller baldness
that would cost me between twenty-five
dollars and twenty-eight dollars per
0.27 ounces or whatever was I said so I
actually think this is quite good for
1495 a month and I love the fact that it
is a spray so the two that I asked them
to send me word versace bright crystal
and also DKNY be delicious because those
are two that I actually own in a
full-size and I wanted to make sure this
was legitimate I wanted to make sure
they were identical to what I have in a
full-size I wore half of it on my body
like on the left side and then the
original on my other side they are the
same exact thing so these are the
perfumes that come in the full sizes
they are basically just putting them
into these little vials for you guys so
I would say if you are someone who is a
big fan of perfumes and you go through a
lot of them you'd like to wear different
fragrances if you guys watch my fails
and holy grails every week I usually
have a different fragrance mixing or
pairing that I do every single week and
this is definitely a subscription you
should look into if you're someone who
really doesn't change up your perfume
all that often this is probably
something you would it be that
interested in but I am very very happy
with the subscription I think it's great
and just for a reference let me show you
guys what it looks like next to like a
little sample size so obviously you are
getting way way way more product in here
but I think this is great really happy
with the fragrances i chose like i said
i already knew these fragrances quite
well versace bright crystal is one of my
favorites and DKNY be delicious is also
one of my favorites but yeah very very
happy with the
service and even if they didn't send me
another box next month that this would
be something that I would definitely
think about going ahead and purchasing
on my own and becoming you know
subscribe to it so anyway I usually
don't do like affiliate links and things
like that but they did give me a coupon
code for you guys and I actually thought
it was quite good so the coupon code is
ll h 25 all in capital letters live
loves her makeup and you can get
twenty-five percent off your first
subscription which i think is great so
anyway I will leave that code down below
if you guys would like to use it I will
also lead their website down below so
you can go read a little bit more about
them it will not be an affiliate link it
will just take you directly to the
website but yeah really really happy
with a separate I was quite surprised
and like I said you could just put any
of your little vials in here like this
and this is a really nice little travel
thing because I've tried a few atomisers
optimizers when you call them 80 my
service I think it's that I tried quite
a few I've tried these two for one I've
tried quite a few and honestly a lot of
these are not good you guys um they leak
I don't know if you guys can tell but
they leak they're really hard to travel
with this one right now has Tom Issei
miyake his Cologne in there and is
leaking all over my hands so I really
like this one because it's really cool
and you basically can just interchange
out every single month you just put in
your new little fragrance so you only
get this little case the first month but
I feel like it doesn't matter because
every single month if you were to get
this case you would just have a
bajillion of these so you basically just
interchange out your little perfume
every month so I think that's adorable I
love that so that was from a scent bird
moving on it we have if see so here is
my HP pouch let's see what the little
bag looks like this month here is the
Ipsy bag this is so cute oh my god it's
Halloween themed obviously so you have a
little which you have a little spell
book you have some fangs you have a cute
little ghost here so look go ahead and
see what I got alright the first item
that I see in here is from where is this
from Lottie London this is like a flat
shader brush really really cute i love
that color and it definitely has like a
little bit of pink at the ends as well
feels really really soft and smooth so
that's great the next item that i got in
here let's see here it looks like it's
for the hair this is the pure brazilian
miracle leave-in conditioner with
keratin for gorgeous silky smooth hair
color safe UV protection amazing 10
benefits
one formulation so that looks very
similar to like the it's a 10 miracle
spray so excited to try that out I also
got the hot mama blush from the bomb
cosmetics a little mini here i'm going
to go ahead and declutter this to a
friend because i already have this in
full size but it is a beautiful really
nice peachy kind of NARS orgasm sort of
color so that's really cute i also got
let's see here it looks like 8i shadow
single in the shade satin taupe that is
what it looks like this is from a beauty
basics mmm let's take a look at this if
you guys saw my single eyeshadow
declutter you probably know i'm not a
huge fan of tons and tons of eyeshadow
singles but let's go ahead and swatch
this oh god it feels soft it actually
feels like I foiled a shadow you know
what I think I will keep that that's
beautiful there is you see that color it
actually looks a lot like Max satin coat
and then the final item that i got in
this month's box is or the son's bag is
the essence super fine eyeliner pen this
is waterproof it says precise ultrafine
smudge-proof extra long lasting i will
not use this I've heard great things
about this though but you guys know I
don't use um liquid eyeliner pens but
there it is very very nice so I would
probably go ahead and declutter that
alright so that is what I got in my Ipsy
let's move on to boxy charm I heard a
boxy charm was a really good box this
month so let's take a peek the first I
know we have here is the Brio geo bro
sarku row Sarco right Rose arco below
dry perfection and heat protectant creme
this has no sulfates silicones or
parabens in it this is a blow-dry cream
I don't do with my hair so I
probably won't use this but I may keep
it around maybe if I want to start
blowing my hair out let's see here i
also have a little pack of luck see I
blender brushes now I really like the
love see bum brushes in general I think
the first time I ever got Alexi brush
was in a boxy charm so this looks like a
little trio here of I brushes which is
awesome so this is like a little
blending brush tapered blending 205
brush and these are super silky alike
that it's very very long and it not
super densely packed but pretty nice and
then this one right here is called the
Luxy 229 tapered blending so it sounds a
little more short little more densely
packed and then we also have this
tiny little one this is so cute this is
the luck see blending 237 brush and this
would be great for like upper crease
work i'm blending out alright i'm
excited about that next I have something
here in a little bubble wrapped package
let's check it out this is the ib ib ib
y beauty I've never heard of that I will
say sometimes like I noticed with these
subscription boxes I tend to give
products and brands that like I've never
heard of and there's nothing wrong with
that I don't mind supporting a brand
that isn't very well known things like
that but I just like have never ever
heard of some of these brands and I
don't know if sometimes that's kind of
interesting because it's like if it
doesn't end up being a good product and
they keep sending you something from
that brand in your next box can get kind
of annoying but anyway so here is what
the little palette looks like that's so
cute it says Three's Company I shadow
trio oh that is nice those are some
pretty colors this would be great for
the purse you have a little dual-ended
sponge tip applicator probably won't use
that um but this is what the little trio
looks like let's watch these who they
feel quite good these feel foil too nice
those feel really good Wow I am I'm
impressed yep love it look at the three
of those shades even the mat went on
really really nicely so I'm actually
very excited for that actually paired
together with this little single that i
got from Ipsy that would be beautiful
alright i also got the temp 2 what is
this this looks like a shimmer bronzer
here it is and it looks quite um hmm it
looks very very cool tone i don't know
if i would use this it's like a liquid
bronzer I think I'll just go ahead and
send this to my friend Rochelle she's
really good with liquid bronzers I'm not
so I'm going to pass that along and then
here we have these star looks what is
this liquid lipstick sir if you guys see
me on packaging all this I made it
through pretty much every single box and
that other one and I did not make it
through boxy charm so I didn't open this
one yet but this is AB MLP for because
this is I think a liquid lipstick is
this is a liquid lipstick I'm pretty
sure this little liquid lipstick um we
shall see what it's like it's a
beautiful beautiful color but I don't
know if I would personally like the
formulation so anyway all right guys
everything that I got in my sent fer dat
my Ipsy bag and also bucks each arm I
will move on to the next one and then i
will upload that video for you guys as
well see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
