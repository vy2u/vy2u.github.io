be part 2 of my October 2016 unboxings
I'm sorry if I look a little jacked up
um I films my first video this morning
that was the update on the project pan
and right now I'm home for lunch break
and I lake down for a little bit i eat
some Oreos laid down on the couch and
now I'm filming I feel like my hair
looks like a mess and my teeth are all
jacked up but it is what it is anyway if
this is going to be part 2 we have
support play we have GlossyBox and a
scope option for must have box so let's
go ahead and get started we're gonna do
so for a play first and this is what the
little pouch looks like for this month
it's adorable it says lipsticks and
chill my check think is so cute hashtag
before a play there it is so let's see
what we got here i have opened a few of
these items because if you guys watch
part one you know that i tried filming
this video all in one all six boxes than
it was 35 minutes long but anyway the
first item we have here is madam CJ
walker beauty culture sent in shine
coconut oil this is for your hair and on
the back it actually says this is to
protect your curls now I obviously do
not have curly hair but it's supposed to
be fast absorbing light weight of
multitasking and is supposed to have a
really nice scent of a woods coconut and
sweet vanilla so this is what the actual
oil looks like it is obviously for your
hair I wonder if you could use this on
your skin as well it does come with a
little dropper but yeah super super cute
excited for that I do love oils I also
have the pharmacy skin dude this is a
hydrating essence mist and setting spray
I have heard that this is not that great
but i will try it out for myself it is a
hydrating essent miss that tells the
skin restores radians and freshens and
makeup you guys know I do love facial
mist so like I said I've heard some
pretty bad things but I will still try
it out all right I also have the TLC a
glycolic night serum from drug elephant
very excited for this drug elephant is
an amazing skincare line seriously drunk
elephant sunday riley really really good
skincare lines right now at sephora so
i'm very stage try that I've heard
fantastic things moving on we have
something from the st edited to this is
the flash photo bloss and i swear i have
one of these and i don't really like it
so i'm probably gonna go ahead and
declutter this it basically is just a
clear gloss and it has all of these
little light reflecting particles then i
suppose to make your teeth look whiter
and like and pull your lips plump or
whatnot I don't feel
those shits so I'm gonna go ahead and
just let that go and we also have a
perfume here this is called Derek a lamb
I Oh Crosby silent street oh no no nope
it smells like smells like it smells
like baby powder it doesn't smell good
yeah it smells like baby powder it's a
little too powdery for me so I don't
like that nope I won't be using that and
then here let's see I'm sorry I feel
like all my unboxings have been really
negative today I'm like I won't use this
I won't use this I won't use this but
that's what it's like do the unboxing
like ether you're into it or you're not
alright this is one of these Smashbox of
liquid lipsticks again probably not
going to use this but i will try out the
formulation I don't love liquid
lipsticks but this is a beautiful shade
so anyway that is everything that I got
in my Sephora playbox moving on to a
glossy box which is my all-time favorite
subscription of life I adored this box
let's see what we got in here alright so
the first item that I see to work this
open is from delcour this is me to the
true botanical powerhouse I don't know
this is what is this is this like a
skincare item it looks like it's a oh
it's a neroli oil yes it's one hundred
percent pure chlorine to free mineral
oil free and paraben free I have been
waiting to try neroli oil I've heard
such good things about neroli oil this
is a beautiful little frosted glass
bottle um yeah I heard wonderful things
about neroli oil I have so many oils but
not neroli so very excited to try that
out you can use this in your hair or on
your skin next we have the unani this is
the 01 8 milk cleanser I'm so excited
because they sent us a product from you
naughty about two or three months ago it
was a beautiful beautiful face mask so
very excited to try this out is a milk
cleanser it is supposed to be gentle
formulated with nourishing natural oils
that purify and protect the skin by
removing impurities as well as make up
leaving it soft and restoring the
elasticity so maybe something I want to
use in the morning or as my second
cleanse to completely remove my makeup
at nighttime alright so far five out of
five look at tech glossybox always wins
for me then
item we have here is a mask for mess bar
this is called the brightening sheet
mask and it looks like it has orange
extract licorice root and also vitamin C
and it's very excited to try this out
you guys know I love to mask we also
have a product from oh GX which I love
oh gx I feel like it's either a brand
that you love or you hate for your hair
it works for me this is called the fight
followed niacin and caffeine root
stimulator spray indulge your scalp by
massaging this powerful blend of niacin
and caffeine alpha hydroxy acid and DHT
blocker to encourage a healthy scalp
environment and help prevent hair fall
out caused by breakage this is perfect
for me right now because I have a whole
lot of disgusting scabs on my scalp
right now from my left lupus flare-up
and I know TMI but whatever so I will
definitely try this out and see how it
goes and the final item that we have in
this month's blocks blocks the box is
from a meaty makeup this is called the
lip and cheek tint look at this that is
beautiful packaging and I'm so excited
that it's a tint and not liquid lipstick
because i love tints and lip oils and
things like that so there is absolutely
beautiful oh my goodness 5 out of 5 for
GlossyBox I feel like GlossyBox never
does me wrong I swear to you i love
GlossyBox so definitely 5 out of 5 stars
as far as the lossy box is concerned
this month all right guys let's move on
to the last one popsugar must have and
this is gonna be heavy there it is
popsugar must have and we shall open
this up and see what we have alright so
the first item that we have here is my
cup of cocoa all natural velvety hot
chocolate drink drinking chocolate it
says I'm sorry dank it's dank you guys
I'm so cool dank drinking chocolate made
with real chocolate and no artificial
flavorings this is why I love popsugar
must have I will say the lossy box and
pop sugar must have are my favorite
subscription boxes GlossyBox because
it's if you're a lover of all things
beauty like skin care hair care all that
kind of stuff you get a little bit of
something with glossy box and then
popsugar must have box it just kind of
brings out like the inner I don't know
like I don't know I had already know how
to describe it I feel like it's just
very cute it brings out my inner
artistic side so i might not like this
I'm excited to try that next we have

it says have an epic lists of guilty
pleasure is not feeling bad about eating
chocolate with your salad it means
giving yourself permission to take
shortcuts knowing it's okay to be 25 and
not knowing what you want to be when you
grow up it means not being afraid to
take risks so that sounds like a really
inspirational cute little book moving on
