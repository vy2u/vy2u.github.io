channel do you guys ever have those
weekends where you know you don't have
anywhere to be or anything to do so you
just kind of relax throughout the whole
entire day and then later that night you
find out you actually do have somewhere
to be and something to do and that is
exactly what's happening with me today I
didn't start getting ready until about
an hour ago and then suddenly I found
out I am late for a dinner or I'm not
even late I have to be there in 45
minutes with some old friends so today
I'm going to people me a different video
that I had promised you guys should
always take what I say is like my
schedule with a grain of salt I have an
ever-changing schedule I do work full
time so sometimes I'm just not able to
get up the videos that I want to be able
to get up so today we're gonna go ahead
and do my empties videos and Monday and
Tuesday will probably be holiday 2017 at
best and worst of makeup as well as the
Tarte toasted review I'm not exactly
quite sure yet but I promise to get
those videos up and this coming week for
you guys but my schedule has changed
just a little bit because this was not
supposed to be the video I was going to
film today but alas it is so anyway
let's go ahead and just jump right into
it guys if you are interested in seeing
the products that I used up this month
then please keep on watching so let's
start with some makeup products I did
use up in essence all about Mac fixing
compact powder as usual and I did also
use up the wet and wild or I finished
off the wet and well cover all primer
the essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder is one of my all-time
favorite face powders I love it for
setting my whole entire face I do have
it on today obviously a new one and it's
just a really good powder so I will go
ahead and repurchase that it is cruelty
free and about 399 at the drugstore or
on the Ulta com website as far they went
and well cover all primer I actually
think the covergirl foundation and cover
all Prime wearables very very good if
you do have more I would say normal more
oily and not even normal I would see
more combo oily skin okay because I'm
noticing that this is just a little too
drying on my skin personally I don't
feel like my foundation glides on as
beautifully when I am wearing this so
I'm not gonna repurchase but it
definitely is a good product so I did
enjoy its but I would not repurchase up
next I do you have two sponges here that
have definitely seen their day they've
seen better days but this one right here
is from ELF this is from me beautifully
bare precise sponge collection this is
the larger one and it definitely is a
little on the firm side if you don't
like firm sponges
not going to like this but I do find
that sometimes firm smudges are really
great at first of all baking and second
of all they are very very good when you
are applying more liquidy or water or
serum based foundation so I think I
would go ahead and repurchase that and
then here we have it the Real Techniques
a diamond and miracle complexion sponge
as you can see when they start to really
like tear up and fall apart that's when
I toss them this one is great I
especially love this little pointed tip
for going ahead and it basically carving
out any sort of foundation that gets
stuck in my nose crevices as well as
getting right into those tiny little
creases and fine lines and wrinkles
underneath my eyes so I would also go
ahead and repurchase all right up next I
have a product here from glossier this
was said to me for PR and I love it this
is the milky jelly cleanser it is a
conditioning face a wash I found out
that glossier is cruelty free I wasn't
really sure of their cruelty-free status
until recently they did go ahead and
send over a few products I want to do a
best and worst video comparing some of
their really good products to some of
their not so great products I'm not a
huge fan of their makeup products but I
will say their skincare is pretty darn
good so I will be going ahead and
purchasing that with my own money some
other skin care products here are
actually two of oyster Iser is that now
I purchase these for myself but my
boyfriend ended up finishing it them off
they were just not moisturizing enough
for me personally the first one is the
talkshow water cream but this packaging
is just so cute it has a little spatula
at the top he didn't know what this was
so he didn't use the spatula but I used
it when I did go ahead and use this base
cream it's very very watery I'm like I
said adorable little packaging here I
think this retails for around 60 to 70
dollars which is quite pricey
it was just not hydrating enough for my
normal to dry skin but for combo oily
skin I think you would enjoy this and I
think maybe he wants me to repurchase
this for him
maybe I'll get him that for Christmas or
something like that or at least one of
his Christmas gifts and then here we
have the drugged elephant to be hydro
intensive hydration gel also just a
little too drying for my skin personally
so I passed it off to him he also did
like this I don't think he could really
tell that big of a difference between
moisturizers he just wants a good one
alright moving on we have two eye creams
here I did finish off the elf
illuminating eye cream as well as the
Neutrogena hydro boost gel eye cream I
thought this on my collector
for about six months I really did enjoy
this but Neutrogena does tests on
animals so I would not repurchase and I
also don't feel like it's not moisture
for my eye area currently and the elf
illuminating eye cream I always just
thought this was so so you get a lot of
product in here if you are someone who
is new to skincare say you're 16 17 18
years old and you want to start using an
eye cream this is a nice one to start
out with it definitely has a little bit
of a cooling sensation it's only about
ten dollars need to get a large amount
of product in here but if you already do
have the starts of fine lines and
wrinkles underneath your eyes or you
need a lot of intense hydration and this
is just not gonna be the eye cream for
you but it is a good beginner eye cream
so I would not repurchase that would not
repurchase the Neutrogena up next I do
have my breasts those who likes cream if
you guys aren't familiar with me I do if
suffer from ADHD as well as lupus which
is a autoimmune disease
I do get uncontrollable or just to both
my legs this is basically a cream for
uncontrollable urges to move the legs
ADHD is attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder so I am constantly moving
around it is something that I have
basically suffered with my whole entire
life and I know a lot of people think
ADHD might be something that would be
very fun to have but it is very
difficult when you are trying to sleep
in the middle of the night and you just
want to move your body so this is a
great cream for that I do find us at
Walgreens and also it's very nice
because I do deal with blood clots in my
legs from lupus this does kind of helped
you I don't know like when you kind of
get in there and you're kind of rubbing
it in and helps to make sure the blood
clots don't form and also it is very
cooling and tingling so I really like
this and I would repurchase they are
cruelty free up next I do you have the
karez wild rose a vitamin C active
brightening oil I love this especially
when I did have a more competently skin
but this is really great too because
it's an oil that will definitely help to
brighten your complexion it does that
vitamin C in here and it smells
beautiful I really love Korres I never
knew they were cruelty free until
recently I love their wild rose line
especially and I think a lot of people
know of their brightening overnight
facial masks that one is fantastic and
this one
fantastic now it's not as hydrating as I
would like personally right now for my
more normal to dry skin but I think I
will actually repurchase this because
this is great absolutely fantastic for
mixing into foundations during the
daytime I have been mixing oil every
single day with my foundation just
because my skin is a little more dry and
I need that more skin like vibe right
now because every single foundation that
puts goes on to my skin lately has just
been looking like to be completely
honest so I think I would actually go
ahead and repurchase that really do
enjoy this all right up the next guys I
have some little minis hair that I
finished off from Ola Hendrickson the
first is the truth serum and this came
in the Ola Henriksen what was it called
advent calendar for the holiday season
and then I also finished off the nurture
of the moisturizing creme I would go
ahead and purchase a full size of each
of these I pop those on two of my
wishlist for the Sephora vib sale sale
basically and I will be doing my
recommendations video as well as my
wishlist video next weekend for you guys
up next idea to try out a products here
from first-day beauty that I was
actually pretty impressed with um these
are the facial radiance pads they help
to exfoliate tone and brighten I think I
got these over six months ago I'm not
quite sure of firstly beauty's
cruelty-free status any more I've seen a
back and forth on if they're actually
cruelty free or not but these were
pretty nice they don't compare to like
my Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkled peel
pads which of course I won't repurchase
those because they are tested on animals
but I don't like anything from the first
day beauty line except for these so I
feel like that says a lot I've always
thought that first date beauty was just
kind of a generic brand never thought
they did anything amazing for my skin
personally but these were pretty good
alright moving on I do have the hamsa
blushing grapefruit and raspberry creme
in shower hydrating moisturizer so this
was really nice it smelled amazing I
love the hem sign they are vegan as well
as cruelty free the current self tanner
that I use is from them if you guys are
curious I need to self tan obviously I
know a lot of you've been saying that
blending into my wall I apologize I'm
gonna get some color on my skin soon
so anyway this is definitely a nice in
shower body lotion I did kind of use it
for shaving towards the end of the
bottle just because it's not hydrating
for me anymore it's not hydrating and
that I should say I did like it when I
was more oily combo skin again
my body just have a little more oil on
it what I was living in the Midwest and
now I'm a little more dry so this is not
enough moisture I wouldn't repurchase
but this scent is really good so maybe
look at the moisturizer in the sex
all right I've used up to at different
bubble bars here from a lush the first
one was called sparkly pumpkin this is a
limited edition top holiday 2017 I
finished this off last night it smells
amazing it does have sparkles but they
actually just kind of evaporate into the
water so you don't deal with a messy
bathtub after it smells like pumpkin
spice and a little bit of sweetness so I
really like that would repurchase next
year during the holiday season and then
this was a break tight bubble bar which
is a citrus scent really really enjoyed
that and it makes really lovely bubbles
all right we used up the yeardley
oatmeal and almond moisturizing and
luxurious hand soba would not repurchase
this I don't know when we got this I
think we got this right when we moved
before our boxes had gotten here yet I
think my dad picked this up at like the
dollar store or something it smelled
really really strongly of almond and
normally I like that but this was just
too much so we're not repurchase that
here I have a Venus spa breeze Gillette
razor head
we're not repurchase these I need to
find out about like Gillette and Venus
and who they're owned by and all that
kind of stuff because I'm not quite sure
where to go with the whole cruelty free
toothpastes as well as cruelty free
razor things so if you have any idea of
what I should be doing please let me
know because I'm a little confused
currently but I yeah would not
repurchase that didn't think they were
that great they do have like those built
on like blades that have the luxurious
like shaving cream attached to them
they're just really messy and gunk up
your whole sting so I wouldn't recommend
them and then finally guys I did use up
a Pacifica Campbell um at this
particular candle is called
French lilac it smelled really really
good and I did enjoy it so I would
probably a repurchase but probably more
towards the spring and summer time so
anyway guys those are it those are all
the products that I have for my empties
that was so loud I apologize
those are all the products that I used
up this a month please let me know down
below what products you used up and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
