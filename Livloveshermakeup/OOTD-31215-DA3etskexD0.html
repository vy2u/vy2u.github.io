have an outfit of the day video for you
guys I am in very very bright nothing
today um I'm just I'm telling you guys
why so the first thing that's on here is
this workout shirt it's like that really
nice like ventilated thick like workout
gear so it's kind of like sweat proof
and stuff it has cute little thumb holes
- I love that but I wore this today I
usually don't wear like my workout
clothes like with my actual outfits
during the day but I'm just really cold
last night and this kept me really warm
it's a turtleneck it goes up all the way
and I just think it's really really cute
next this little black fleece right here
this is from Old Navy I believe it was
long looking like five or seven dollars
and I actually have it it's pretty loose
normally so I actually took it and kind
of twisted it in the back like it has a
little tail and I put the tail through
one of the belt holes in the jeans so
hold it like that and then I kind of
just tucked it away and it just makes it
a little more flattering because it's
not all baggy is saggy so I really
really like that and then I'm wearing
these jeans these are from forever 21 I
love them they're not the most
comfortable jeans but um they were only
like 12 dollars so you know I love them
they're super super comfortable and I
just think the print is so pretty I
usually have a hard time hearing it with
certain things I always just go for
black but today I'm doing pink because
there is a little bit of pink in the
flowers on there um and the last thing I
have on are these shoes these are from
JustFab common and they have like a faux
cork heel but so they're really nice
they're like what is it suede yeah suede
so they're suede so they look really
really pitch dark and black which is
nice because that matches this and also
the jean because so yeah this is my
outfit of the day
and I just wore my hair down today and I
did really minimal makeup since I'm kind
of all out there right now so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
