have an outfit of the day video for you
guys I wasn't gonna do one of these but
then I thought I'm will matchy-matchy
I'm all like black and white or the
leopard print whatever I've had to meet
you to show you guys what I am wearing
so let's start with liking my
accessories and everything so I'm
wearing a pretty minimal make-up today
not a whole lot of color or anything
like that but I have this little Tiffany
and Co a bracelet on and then I have
this little headband from forever 21
keeping back my super super greasy dirty
hair yes my hair is super super dirty so
I put it in like a double bun like I
wrapped it around and then wrapped it
again with another hair tight and then
just pulled out little random sections
so that it looked a little Messier and
then the actual tunic that I'm wearing
is keep on forever 21 it's very very
comfortable it's like that not elastic I
don't know it's like 5% spandex 95%
cotton blend is a very very comfortable
I like it because it does have like
those at these three three-quarter
length sleeves you know like they go
halfway down and I just made it very
very comfortable just have like a little
likeyou neck or like a scoop neck and I
think you can wear it like you know kind
of like lift it up in certain areas or
you can just wear it you know completely
down like I like to do it because I feel
like it's a tunic so it could
technically be a dress or it could be
kind of like a shirt and then the ladies
I'm wearing art from TJ Maxx I believe
the brand is called like Romeo and
Juliet god I don't know something like
that I think something like gone Juliet
Romeo super super weird name but anyway
I love these look you guys they have
feet I really really love the leggings
have feet because then my feet don't get
hold and I think that's amazing
and then the booties I'm wearing are
from go Jun calm and I love these
because they give me height without
being uncomfortable they are a wedge so
they're very very easy to walk in and if
you're having a casual day like I am
today it's a Sunday I feel like I can
just take the shoes off and then just
lounge in like the leggings yes the
tunic so anyway that is my quick little
outfit of the day I really really like
this very very comfortable and my
boyfriend I are going out later for
dinner and I feel like it can be
like interests as well yeah that is my
outfit of the day hope you guys enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
