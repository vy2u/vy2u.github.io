you this is the outfit it's very clean
and simple I really like it I just have
class today so it's nothing to who I am
I am not wearing any jewelry or anything
like that I have some pretty heavy
makeup on today plus I thought the shoes
I'm wearing were enough accessories and
about so these are from Target
they had like a bunch of different
colors like leopard print gray I just
thought the black ones are really really
cute - they're from Sam and Libby they
have like a textured reptile kind of
thing going on they're kind of cut out
and then they have a little bit of a
wedge these run probably a half-size too
big I'd say I'm a size 6 and I probably
could use a 5 and a half so keep that in
mind but I just think they look really
really cute and I love that they have
like that pointed toe I think that makes
it look very formal and elegant so the
dress I'm wearing is from forever 21
effectually from the love 21 which is
like a part of forever 21 but it runs
about a half size to a size bigger than
the forever 21 clothing and so you
couldn't just pair this and how about
it's very very cute but um I just
thought because it was a little more
loose fitting and because it doesn't
have anything that dips too low no
cleavage showing the arms not even in
the back I just thought just to make it
look a little more thing I guess or a
little more sexy I thought I would just
take a belt and cinch it at my waist I
think when you see something at your
waist it's usually the smallest part on
your body if you're a female at least
for me it is so I think right there just
gives a really nice shape you know to
the dress and he makes it look like you
know I have a little more shape to my
body other than just the dress so this
little belt is just a cheap little thing
it came with a shirt from Wet Seal but
anytime I get a you know product that
comes with a little belt or something I
always keep it and I kind of just take
them off of the shirts and put them in
my little belt box and if a box filled
with them and I just used them for
different outfits so this didn't look
very cute with the grey shirt it came
with I thought it was kind of tacky and
shiny but I think
does look cute with dresses so really
really like that I think you need so
much more parking so here is the outfit
again just would be nice and tight and
again here in Manhattan it's not to have
yet so it's nice that this is covers a
little more than say like a typical
sundress um I said I'm just laying my
hair natural today didn't do anything to
it just let it air dry I'm wearing it
down no jewelry except for well I guess
accessories except for the belt and the
cute shoes and yeah so it's really easy
to put together and help you guys
enjoyed it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
