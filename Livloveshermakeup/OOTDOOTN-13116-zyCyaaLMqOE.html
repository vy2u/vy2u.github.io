channel this video is going to be an
outfit of the day or outfit of the night
video for you guys it is Sunday and I'm
going on a date night tonight so I
thought I would show you guys what I'm
wearing I'm going to plan we're going to
try to put up one of these videos every
single week they're not going to
interfere with anything that I already
have like pre schedules but I thought
would be fun to throw them in because
people have been asking lately about you
know like the plushies my where on
camera and like my earrings that all
that kind of stuff so I'm going to be
finding to sometimes just come on here
and show you guys the outfit so anyway I
have my hair in a fishtail pony today I
will be doing a tutorial on this in the
next couple of weeks I love the way this
looks just because I naturally have very
fine flat hair that it's not textured so
I really really like the way that this
looks kind of messy and I'm wearing
these little tassel earrings these are
from forever 21 I really really love
these these were under five dollars
and they're just so comfortable they're
very lightweight they're made out of
like felt so they're not like metal or
heavy or anything like that so that is
what I'm wearing for accessories and
then and this is the app that I bring so
I'm right black seems to be black okay
times I'm where it goes but the first
thing are these shoes these are from
Charlotte Russe these are just little
black flats I've had these for two years
now and they have just worn really
incredibly I mean I love the way that
they heal on my foots I have a very
small foot so it's nice because it's a
very narrow little heel and they're just
very very comfortable I don't know like
for 15 bucks on my Deanna love it so
anyway I had those paired with my aunt
Taylor
these are the black opaque tights I
didn't get the critique version I on
five two and plate shorts so anytime
we're gonna bring in a person that takes
literally stretch all the way up to my
neck so I do you get the petite version
just because I am a quite short um I
like these because they are completely
opaque but you guys can see I think you
get a little um transparent to work like
the side right which I think it's pretty
if you're going to be riding a shorter
dress or what I'm wearing which is the
tunic but again I'm sure it's oh the
dress ballgame so anyway yes this tunic
I got this at Kohl's it was $20 and I
think it's so comfortable it's actually
this ribbed texture while just like
pulled it off my shoulder it's this
ribbed texture which is actually really
being warm I think there's even a little
bit of wool in here
had this for years and years and years
and years now and it just wears like
incredibly like I literally have washed
this a bajillion times and it just is in
good shape and right here it has these
three little rhinestones which I think
are very cute but pairs very well they
never come off in the wash but what I
like about this is that it does come off
the shoulder which I think it's really
really pretty especially if you're
around your hair up and also if you
don't want to be showing other areas of
skin like this is a very pretty feature
you know I need to move the shoulder
area is actually very pretty so anyway
that is the outfit oh I forgot about the
belt I got this belt um with a shirt
from Wet Seal it looked horrible with
the shirt so I cut it off and I like to
wear it with his dress I even wear it
around my waist to try and give myself
more like hourglass shape or usually I
just wear it right underneath the bust
so that can lift those big O's up so
anyway this is the outfit so it's just
really really comfortable and it's nice
because like again I'm wearing flats and
I think it is date made appropriate and
just really really cute so thank you for
joining me for this video see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
