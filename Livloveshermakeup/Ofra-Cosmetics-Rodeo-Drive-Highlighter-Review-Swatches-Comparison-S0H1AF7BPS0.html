video is going to be a quick review
swatches and also a comparison for you
guys on the new Oprah cosmetics Rodeo
Drive highlighter I purchased this for
$35 on the Oprah cosmetics calm website
and I did used a 30 percent off coupon
not my coupon I don't have one for you
guys but it's called kitty so it's ki T
TTY and if you type that in in the
little coupon section when you checkout
you can get 30% off your order /
Cosmetics is really good with having 20
to 30% off on all of their products so
if you are thinking that 35 dollars is a
little steep for a highlighter you can
go ahead and try that code I'm pretty
sure it still works if not I know that a
lot of bigger youtubers do have a code
for this particular product but anyway
this has 10 grams of product in it so
like I said it is $35 so when idea to
put the code in everything like that
with shipping it totaled out to be about
25 or 26 dollars which I think it's
pretty darn good this is what the outer
packaging looks like it just comes in a
matte black box like this kind of just
like all of the other oprah cosmetics
products i haven't tried that much out
from over cosmetics i do really like
their liquid lipsticks that's kind of
how i discovered them i feel like
they're very popular because they do a
lot of liquid lipstick collaborations
and just collaborations in general with
bigger youtubers like kathleenlights
mani MUA i got the little trio aries I
can't remember charmed and hypno yes
Ares charmed in hypno which was a little
trio of liquid lipsticks that matty MUA
collaborated with them on and i really
really liked those those are probably
one of my all-time favorites liquid
lipstick formulations I'm very picky
about liquid lipsticks so that kind of
says a lot I guess you could say so
anyway when I saw that this released I
really wanted to jump on it right away I
saw swatches and just pictures a bit on
trend mood it looked absolutely gorgeous
it's like a gold with like a rose gold
and also a little bit of like a
champagne tone in there and you do get
10 grams of product in here I don't
remember if I said that or not but 10
grams is definitely more than the
standard amount of highlights normally
in a highlighter you're getting anywhere
between 5 to 8 grams so if the price
does seem a little steep even with the
coupon code just know that you are
getting quite a bit of product in here
so this is supposed to be a really
high-impact gorgeous highlighter
as you can see it's supposed to be very
very buttery to the touch easy to blend
and it's supposed to be compatible on
all sorts of different skin tones and I
definitely think that this is absolutely
amazing it really does live up to its
claims and it's a really really good
product so anyway here is what the
actual packaging looks like it is quite
cheap it's just in plastic packaging I
wish they could have done maybe a little
bit more with it but this is kind of
typical standard over packaging um it
does say 10 grams of product on the back
and then it shows the actual name and
then as you guys can see it just opens
up like this and here is a closer look
at the actual product so as you can see
when I'm kind of turning it you're seen
like gold reflux you're seeing a little
bit of rose gold and also to me I'm
seeing a lot of champagne in here and
it's interesting because when I was
looking at pictures online it looked
different in every single photo I
actually thought that they had released
two shades one was the deeper gold and
then one was more of like a champagne
color but I swear this is just one of
those like light reflecting highlights
that looks different like how you turn
your head like it looks different so I
am wearing it today on my cheekbones I
have it on it down the bridge of my nose
and also on my chin my chin my chin and
also my canvas bow McKean anyway like I
said I do have it on today it's really
really beautiful it's a gorgeous
gorgeous glowy product and I have to say
I'm just really really impressed with
this it is incredibly incredibly soft
and buttery like to the touch probably
the softest highlighter I have ever put
my finger in ever and when you put it on
the skin it just blends out super super
gorgeously so there is a swatch on my
finger what I really like about it is
that it almost goes on like a baked
chalet formulation even though it
clearly isn't like when you put your
finger in there you can clearly feel
that it is a powder formulation however
when you're like putting it on there's
just no skipping it's almost like that
baked chalet formulation where there's
no like chunks of product is just so
smooth and buttery so I have no idea
what they did with that particular
formulation but this is an amazing
amazing formulation today I did put it
on with a cm brush and I feel like this
is a very very high impact highlighter
so if you are someone who doesn't like a
very very in-your-face kind of highlight
you're probably not going to like this
if you do want this to be built up even
more you can use something that is a
little more dense like
today I used a fan brush just kind of
dusted it onto my face but you can also
use something like a tapered highlighter
brush from Sigma or the what's the other
one there's another one that I like oh
yes from lousy that one's really good
too but I also used it the other day
with the elf blending brush and a lot of
you were asking what highlight I had on
if I was using this particular highlight
with this brush it's gorgeous super
super super dense and I just feel like
you just buff it onto the skin lightly
and it looks amazing now like I said
it's not an actual Big Chill a
formulations you don't need to kind of
like buff it into the skin it is a
powder so when you dip your finger in
there like I said it is so soft you are
going to get a little bit of kick up or
a little bit of kickback with your
particular brush like the powder will
kick up however I just love the way it
goes onto the skin I don't feel like it
emphasizes any sort of fine lines or
wrinkles on my skin I don't feel like it
emphasizes texture which is huge for me
because I do have a combo skin that's a
little more problematic and I do start
to get breakouts in this vicinity so
over here on my cheekbones I sometimes
do get breakouts and I have large pores
and also texture and I just feel like
this glides over it absolutely
gorgeously it is definitely not a
natural highlight so if you are someone
who is looking for a really really
natural highlight this is not what this
is gonna be this is a really wham bam in
your face super super highly pigmented
highly shiny highlight so if you're into
that I think you would love it I think
this is a great option for all sorts of
different skin tones right now I am self
tan time I'm at about I would say an NC
20 but normally I'm anywhere between an
NC 10 to NC 15 in matte foundations just
for reference I am quite fair and I love
the way that this looks on me it does
darken up on my skin a little bit so I
wouldn't call it a true highlight but
that doesn't mean it can't make your
skin glow so I do think it's an
absolutely beautiful product at the wear
time on this it's like really really
darn good which I was surprised about
because it's so soft and buttery I just
thought that this was gonna melt
off my face I really did like it is that
soft probably the softest highlighter I
have ever touched I honestly thought
this was just going to melt off my face
with all my other makeup especially
during the warmer months right now
however I was just really pleasantly
surprised to see that it's stuck on my
skin all day long kind of like a base
gel a formulation would you know they
really kind of adhere to the skin I just
love it so I really only have good
things to say about this you guys I
think the color is absolutely beautiful
for fair skin it still works although
it's not going to be a true highlighter
for you like if you're lighter than me
like I said right now I'm self tanned if
you're lighter than me this is not going
to be true highlighter on you it will
darken up a little bit like when you
turn your head a certain way however the
light does reflect off of it and it
still can make your skin look really
really gorgeous and glowy if you have
really really deep dark skin I think
this will still work on you it's gonna
look a little more champagne color than
golden but if you have like a medium
skin tone I think this is going to be
beautiful too I think this would work
for all sorts of different skin types as
well like I said I have combo skin and
although it is super soft and buttery it
did not move on my face at all and I did
set all of my makeup in the past couple
of days with the elf makeup mist insect
and that probably helped it quite a bit
but also I've been using a nice tacky
primer and things like that but honestly
this just doesn't go anywhere it stays
on the face which is amazing so I would
say it's good for any sort of skin tone
any sort of skin type it's really just a
universal highlight exactly how they
described it on the website so I am very
very impressed with this so let me go
ahead and do a little swatch a rouÃ© for
you guys so here it is I want to show
you guys really quickly you see when I
put my fingers in there how it does
start to kick up a little bit it's just
because it's so freakin soft and buttery
so there it is let me go ahead and do a
swatch for you guys so there is the
swatch on my hand as you guys can see
it's incredibly glowy and just really
really beautiful and it blends out so so
so easily and so nicely so there is
blend it out on the back of my hand I
just love it I love the tone I love the
color I love the high shine impact and I
just love how blendable it is so let's
do a little bit of a comparison as well
a few of you guys were asking if it is
comparable to the new Tarte highlights
this is the Tarte exposed highlight it
sort of has the same sort of thing going
on a little bit of like a nude base or
golden base with some rose gold
undertones and also a little bit of
champagne eNOS in there so I'm going to
swatch this one next to the Oprah
highlight and I'll let you guys know
what I think of the two of them I think
that that Tarte highlight is incredibly
soft and buttery and I gave that like an
amazing amazing review but I would say
that I do prefer the formulation of
people for highlight and as you guys can
see here is the Tarte and here is the
Ofra The Oprah definitely has more of a
golden undertone whereas the Tarte has a
little more of a nude undertone I would
all this more of a nude undertone and
this is more of a golden undertone so
they are definitely not a dupe for each
other but they are kind of similar when
it comes to like high shine impact on
the actual cheeks and then you guys also
asked if I would swatch it next to the
Bobbi Brown afternoon glow highlighting
powder this is the Bobbi Brown afternoon
glow this is a true rose gold highlight
so let me go ahead and swatch this one
here is the afternoon glow which is
another beautiful beautiful highlight
and then I'll swatch the Ofra next to it
and again definitely not a dupe a few
people were asking because again when
you photograph this particular
highlighter it just kind of looks
different in different lighting if
you're in the shade it looks more rose
gold if you have it in the sunlight it
looks more golden but here you guys can
see there is the Bobbi grip Bobbi Brown
cannot speak today Bobby Brown afternoon
glow highlight and that one is
definitely more rose gold and then this
one is just a true golden color and then
the last one that I want to go ahead and
squash it next to you I would say this
is the most comparable is definitely the
Laura Laura Geller fake gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade gilded honey so
this one is more of a big Chalet
formulation so it doesn't have the same
sort of formulation however the color is
probably the closest out of the three of
those so here they are next to each
other so there is the gilded honey and
then there is the Oprah so you may take
a look at the Oprah and think oh my god
I totally have a do for that in my
collection and let me tell you I have a
lot of highlighters and I was spending
almost the entire night the other night
just going through and swatching them
side by side I cannot find an exact
color dupe for this so I really do think
it's beautiful very universally
flattering I did put it on my friends
yesterday at work who has a really dark
deep like chocolatey skin tone
it looked freakin amazing on her so I
don't think it's a beautiful product
highly highly recommend like I said I
believe the coupon code down below and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this little
review swatches in comparison thank you
so much for joining me guys and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
