today's video is going to be a review
and demo for you guys on the new Olay
Henriksen of facial waters there are
three of them and I did pick two of them
up the first is the Greece relief facial
water and outs with each fruits facial
water there are three that you can pick
from and they all retail for $22 apiece
on these sephora.com websites I will
link all three down below so three
different links will be down below in
the description bar so you guys can go
check out which one you would like to
get the Greece relief line and is the
truth line I am familiar with which is
why I purchased these two but they also
do have one in a purple label which is
called the nurture me facial water so
anyway these are basically supposed to
be toning waters and one of them is more
of like a facial mist and one of them is
more of an actual toner it's so funny
because as I have been using these you
guys my opinions completely have changed
on them so at first I loved this one and
I really didn't like this one and now it
has completely changed I really don't
like this one but I love this one so let
me show you guys I have been using these
for about a month now so I am almost
completely I have almost completely
emptied out the truth facial water and
then the Greece relief I have about
right there on and that is because you
don't use as much product so anyway I
just wanted to let you guys know I have
had plenty of time to play with these
they are no longer new I did pick them
up when they are when they were new but
they no longer are so yeah I'm just
gonna talk to you guys a little bit
about what these are they are different
from a lot of different facial waters
that I have personally tried you guys
know I'm a skincare junkie and I love
facial waters these are little different
I really wanted to get them because
again I love the truth facial like lying
in general and also the what is it
called the crease relief line so the
greatest relief line has these wonderful
little cleansing towelettes that I adore
and then the actual truth line has an
amazing amazing polishing mask that I
love and also one of my favorite serums
is from this particular line so anyway
the outer packaging looks like this you
do get 118 ml in each of bottle for only
22 dollars which is really well priced
and of course they are color coordinated
which i think is totally awesome
the grace we'll leave one is supposed to
purify and mattify your complexion while
indulging your senses within an herbal
botanical blend of lactic acid
goldenseal and hops extract it says the
refreshing water helps reduce oil free
and keeps you shine free all day long
and what you're supposed to do with this
is miss five sprays onto a clean dry
cotton pad and then you want to swipe
over clean face and then dry the face in
a circular motion which sounds weird
you're like dry face in a circular
motion so what you want to do is
basically spray onto a cotton pad put it
all over your face
and then rub in circular motions after
you have distributed on your face I
really really like this one a lot I
think it's amazing but the other one the
truth one I'm not that obsessed with so
this one says it energizes and hydrates
your complexion while indulging your
senses with the citrus botanical blend
of sweet orange and Mandarin oils while
tea and pomegranate extracts help to
rejuvenate and replenish the skin for a
healthy looking Olay blow so anyway like
I said really like the packaging I think
these bright boxes are super cute and I
like that Olli Henriksen does color
coordinate his lines so the nurture me
line is more for anti-aging and aging
skin the truth line is more for
rejuvenating and just like kind of
brightening up your complexion and then
the Olay Henriksen Greece relief line is
really for those with combo to oily skin
for reference I do have combo to oily
skin I get a lot more oily during the
summer time and yeah alright so first of
all I just want to say obviously I have
no makeup on my skin is completely clean
I did use a up-and-up premium cotton
oval from Target and I did wipe my face
down with my seller water and then
around my eye area I've used these
Shiseido facial cotton with some
micellar water so overall like I said
when I first got these two products I
was obsessed with this one at first and
I didn't like this one I was using this
the wrong way any time something says
it's a facial water that usually means
you can use it as a toner ie you can
spray it onto a cotton pad and use it as
an actual toner or you can just missed
it onto your face so the first couple of
days I was using this I was actually
misting it directly onto my face and I
was just so overwhelmed with the smell
if you do not know what the Greece
relief line smells like it's very
strongly fragrance with like eucalyptus
and just very very strong kind of minty
sense and
was just overbearing and I was like what
the hell is going on here I cannot spray
this directly on to my face I literally
was like this feels so weird
it was so tacky and so sticky and
finally I looked on the back of the
packaging and it said you need to go
ahead and spray it onto a cotton pad and
use it as an actual toner so when I
started actually doing that I realized
that I absolutely absolutely adore this
I have been using it in the morning with
a premium cotton oval from the up and up
Target brand and I spray it on directly
and then I go ahead and I do in circular
motions I will demo that after I kind of
review them for you guys but it really
is a beautiful product it will
completely leave you all free so if you
do have combo to oily skin I highly
recommend checking this out just don't
be fooled by the actual spray bottle you
don't want to spray this directly onto
your face you really do want to put it
on the cotton pad distribute it all over
your face your neck your decollete
wherever you get oily and then you want
to rub in circular motions since when
you do the rubbing in circular motions
that you really start to notice you're
getting a lot of like buildup and debris
out of your pores cuz you'll take a look
at the cotton pad and Gerlich yeah well
that was like on my skin it really
really tones the skin nicely and again
if you do have complet of oily skin this
is really really beautiful
I feel like it mattifies me instantly
and I have been enjoying using this
during the daytime I have not been using
it at nighttime just because it does
leave me slightly tacky like a slightly
tacky feeling on the skin basically and
that is my biggest complaint with the
two of these they are definitely very
very tacky and for $22 I just kind of
thought they would be a little better
than they are so although I really like
this one and I would repurchase I would
not say it's my favorite facial toner or
facial mist in general and then this one
on the other hand this has like the
truth line is known for having honey and
also Mandarin oils and things like that
in it so when I spray this onto my face
directly you guys it takes at least 30
to 40 minutes for this to completely
sink into my skin which i think is
ridiculous I will use this up and I will
not repurchase this is a total fail for
me if you are someone who does have very
dry dehydrated mature skin and you
really really need that extra moisture
it would probably work for you but I
just find it so tacky like I will
literally touch my face and it just like
if you
like my fingers are sticking to my face
which i think is ridiculous
so although it is beautiful it smells
really gorgeous and although it does
really help to kind of replenish
moisture and make your skin look a
little brighter I cannot like deal with
the tacky residue that Elise on my face
especially for my combo to oily skin so
anyway let me go ahead and demo this
product for you guys so how I like to do
it is I will use the grease relief in
the morning as my toner again you can't
use it at night time as your toner I
just haven't been because I've been
using a salicylic acid toner but what I
do is I take this particular product and
I go in with one of my up enough premium
cotton ovals which look like this one
side is soft and one side is textured
and I spray five sprays on there so five
sprays and then I'm just going to go
ahead and put it all over my face I like
to wipe it and distribute the product
everywhere that I want to put it the
smell is very very overwhelming you guys
which is why you definitely want to put
it on to a cotton pad and not just spray
it directly onto your face you know it's
so funny because you think that you know
so much about like facial mist I believe
I felt like I knew a lot about facial
mess and stuff like that and then I
realized I kind of didn't because I
didn't even realize the back of the
instructions said to actually spray it
onto a cotton pad alright and then next
what I like to do is kind of go like
this and actually cut the actual cotton
pad kind of paint it back with my
fingers and then I like to go ahead and
do these circular motions and I'm just
really lightly going over in circular
motions all over my face and that's when
I start to notice that my skin looks a
lot less oily and I think it's just
absolutely awesome so again you do kind
of want to but cup it in between your
fingers so you really can do the
circular motions you can use these
Shiseido facial Cotton's I noticed that
they start to kind of disintegrate when
I start using them in circular motions
so you definitely want a cotton pad that
is a little more durable and thicker
like these up-and-up ones I keep saying
up and up up and up but I love these
cotton pads so I just kind of distribute
it like I showed you guys and then I
like to do these circular motion and
that's what I really feel like my skin
is starting to get oil-free I look on
the pad and I notice that there is a lot
of extra gunk that I didn't even realize
was there that is now on the actual pad
so that is personally how I use it I'm
like I said this particular product does
leave a bit of each
keep residue they both do this one sinks
in within 10 minutes though so after it
has completely sunk in I go in and then
I will go in with my serum so here you
guys can see I have no idea if it will
show up but there's definitely some
gunky stuff on there and I feel like
instantly my face looks a lot more
modified and it smells really good when
you just use a small amount if you're
spraying it directly on your face it's
way too overwhelming but when you kind
of rub it in it does smell good and I do
feel like although it is tacky I look
pretty darn matched so that is how I
like to use the grease relief again I
would give this probably 3 out of 5
stars I think it is good like I said you
are getting 4 fluid ounces or 118 ml in
here so if you are using it as a toner
for $22 I still think it's pretty good
but honestly you can get toners for 5 or
6 dollars at the drugstore that are just
as good and will keep you just as matte
you want to find something with maybe
salicylic acid or glycolic acid just
make sure that when you're using this
product when you're using anything that
has a chase or any sorts of salicylic
acid you want to make sure that you are
some using some sunscreen so that you
are not getting like a third-degree burn
all over your face all right and then as
far as the truth facial water is
concerned I definitely have to use this
differently than I normally would with
my facial mist what I like to do is
normally with my facial mist I will set
in my skincare in the morning and at
night time after I have done all my
steps after I have toned after I put on
my serum after I put on you know my
athens whatever I want to put on my
retinol whatever I go in with a facial
mist and I usually spray it all over my
face and my neck like directly spraying
it like this I can't really do that with
this product what I have to do is spray
it above and let it fall down on my face
you guys because if you spray it
directly I swear to you you will be
sticky and tacky for hours for hours so
like I said I spray it directly up in
the air and I let it fall down on my
face and it smells really good it smells
like orange creamsicle like I said I
love the truth line but this has
honestly just been a bit of a
disappointment um it does not taste good
so don't leave your mouth open and also
it does have a little bit of alcohol in
here so it does burn here nostrils so
don't spray directly up your face just
let it kind of fall gracefully onto your
face or onto your skin and then you just
kind of let it sit there you don't want
to press it into this
you can go ahead and do that but I swear
to you you will have tacky sticky
fingers and you also want to make sure
you're using a headband so that you
don't get it in your hair because it
leaves the most awful greasy weird tacky
residue on your hair so anyway guys
overall I would say that these are good
products this one really isn't in my
opinion the grease relief is a good
product I would give it 3 out of 5 stars
as far as toning is concerned is it my
all-time favourite toner absolutely not
can you give other toners at the
drugstore I think you can but I would
consider repurchasing maybe in the
future for the summertime when I am a
little more oily they truths facial
water on the other hand I just don't
think it's worth it you can get much
better facial sprays out there the Mario
Badescu rosewater facial spray with
herbs and rosewater and things like that
is much better than this it does have
quite a bit of alcohol in it which again
I feel like it's just defeating the
purpose when you're trying to use a
spray that is supposed to be hydrating
and brightening wipe but alcohol in it
it's the same thing with like the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mess I'm like why why
is this spray filled with alcohol so
anyway
I would say that this is definitely a
fail I will not repurchase but I
probably would repurchase the Olay
Henriksen grease relief for next summer
so I hope that this was helpful thank
you so much for joining me guys and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
