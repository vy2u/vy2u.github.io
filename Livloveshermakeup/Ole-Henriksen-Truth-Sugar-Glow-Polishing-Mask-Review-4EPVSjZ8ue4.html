thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I'm
here to give you guys a review on a new
mask that I recently found on the super
calm website this is from Olli Henriksen
it is the truth sugar glow polishing
mask I was really really curious about
this I've recently kind of gotten into
the whole truth lime from Olay Henriksen
I really really enjoyed his cleansing
cloths and also the truth serum they
smell really good they all smell like
orange creamsicle they have brightening
properties to them and I just think they
really kind of help even out my skin
tone which I really like I do have
hyperpigmentation and discoloration from
acne scarring along my jawline so I felt
like these products have really really
helped me and I was excited to go ahead
and try something else from the truth
lines so this was $42 which is somewhat
pricey I'm not going to say it's like
the priciest item like as far as masks
go on sephora.com website because there
is the masks that are you know anything
from glam glow which is about seventy
dollars up to like fresh has some that
are like 98 dollars so it's not the most
expensive mask but it is definitely not
like drugstore priced um but anyway this
is supposed to be a polishing mask so it
has sugar in it
and it's supposed to basically give you
like the brightening properties like the
mask has a honey in it and it also has
just nice like vitamin C complex in it
that's supposed to help brighten your
skin up and then you get that sugar
scrub so when you're washing it off you
rub in circular motions and it's
supposed to take off dead skin so it
does have um let's see here like I said
sugar honey and vitamin C in it this is
what the outer box looks like and when
you open it up you get your little tub
of masks and I have to say I'm a little
disappointed this is not a glass tub and
I know that's like I'm being a little
picky here because honestly I don't
really store my masks out like in public
they are actually hidden in my closet
but I just thought for the price and
especially because it is only Henriksen
even this little truth serum comes in a
glass jar I just thought this would come
in a glass jar but it doesn't so you do
get 3.4 ounces in here or a hundred
grams of product so that is a nice
out and it just opens up like this and I
will show you guys what the kind of
texture looks like so like I said it
smells amazing like an orange creamsicle
and this is what the texture looks like
it is basically a very very thick
consistency and when I put it on my face
I notice right away I can feel the honey
in there so when I first applied it I
was like oh no about this because
honestly honey of the little sticky it
can be a little hard to get off the skin
but I do not have any issues with that
whatsoever so basically when you put it
on you can definitely see that there are
sugar exfoliators in there and you put
it on your skin and I think it's really
brilliant that they put the honey in the
mix because if you have tried any of
these exfoliating sort of or like
scrubbing sort of mass basically where
you put on the mask and then you scrub
it off basically um I know keep saying
basically a lot but you get these masks
that start to fall off your face like
the sugar particles or the tea leaves or
whatever has been there starts to fall
off your face so it's really brilliant
that they put honey in here because it
literally will stick to your face none
of this will come off your face it will
stay there the whole time and you are
supposed to apply a thin layer to clean
dry skin leave on for five to ten
minutes and then you add warm water and
gently massage in circular motions and
rinse clean and I have to say I'm really
really loving this mask I have used it
four times now which I feel like is a
good amount of time to try a mask and it
does say that you can use this three to
four times a week which is really really
nice so it's not irritating I wouldn't
say that the scent is overwhelming I
think if you have discoloration on your
skin whether it be from acne scarring
age spots any sort of thing like that
melasma you will probably really really
enjoy this mask I do think it is worth
the $42 and I really really like that it
has the vitamin C properties in there I
have noticed a huge difference with this
collagen booster this serum honestly
vitamin-c complex really does lighten up
age spots discoloration things like that
so I really am enjoying the masks a lot
I think that they puts it and put it
together very nicely in a way that
nothing really like falls apart on your
face even though there is
and tons of sugar in there it doesn't
really follow like a part on your face
which I really really enjoy I don't have
to sit there and worry about it drying
and getting all over my clothing or my
neck or whatever it really really just
sticks onto the face when you wash it
off it doesn't like turn into a foamy
sort of lather I have some masks that do
you actually do that which is really
like an extra awesome stack they
basically start to turn into a lather or
a foam cleanser on your skin as you are
rubbing it in this one just kind of
comes right off but I'd notice that the
honey doesn't stay tacky on my skin it
comes right off and I just noticed I
have really really clean clear smooth
looking skin it just looks very bright
and polished and beautiful so I give
this little Olay Henriksen truth sugar
flow polishing mask two thumbs up I
highly recommend if you have
discoloration on your skin I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
