am here to share with you guys of my
final thoughts on my 1 month one palette
challenge so I'm the month of February
went ahead and used only one eyeshadow
palette for the entire month and then
one that I chose was the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette and I
heard of this challenge it's not really
it's not even labeled as a challenge but
it was a challenge for me I heard of
this challenge from Christy Kay here on
YouTube I will go ahead and link her
video below as well as her channel she's
wonderful she does a lot of project 10
pans she does a lot of like stuff like
this like really is like digging into
certain products using the map hitting
pan on them she's awesome and she's
great at doing that so I will link her
channel on her video below but she
really inspired me to go ahead and
choose that a palette specifically an
eyeshadow palette to focus on for the
entire month and I'm so happy to tell
you guys like I did relatively well I
think there were six days six or seven
days out of the month where I did reach
for something different and that was
because of a collab video or a tutorial
or like a review video things like that
it actually wasn't really by choice
which i think is great and I'm happy to
say there were only a few days where I
did reach for like an eyeshadow single
or something like that and pulled it
into the look I will say after using
this for an entire month I have
definitely noticed which shades and here
are duds and which ones I don't really
like and also which ones I really really
do love you guys probably won't be able
to tell but I have really dug into a few
of the shadows in here I would say my go
twos have been nougat coconut creme
butter pecan bonbon caramel and peanut
butter so this one this one this one
this one this one and this one I love
those kind of warm tones in there I
think they're beautiful I think caramel
bonbon um and butter pecan make great
lid shades but for the most part I kind
of wish that they had done another color
in here that could go on the lid like a
nice light like champagne II shorter
sort of color like the butter pecan one
this color right here called pink sugar
is basically a Presta glitter and it is
so disappointing I never realized how
disappointing that shape was until I
started to really dig into this palette
so I really felt like I have spent a lot
of time with this
now I really know which sheets I love
which shapes I don't I love that there
is a nice mixture of warm tones and cool
tones in here I can go dramatic I can go
subtle I can go neutral there was a
whole week where all I wore was coconut
creme and nougat in my crease and then
like this past week I wore a lot of the
warm tones in here like bonbon peanut
butter caramel butter pecan and then
they have some great cool tones like
truffled and put in and mousse and just
some amazing amazing colors in here I
think that literally like this is one of
those palettes where if you have this
you probably don't need other eyeshadow
palettes of course I collect eyeshadow
palettes so I want more and I use more
but I'm really happy to say that even
though this was a bit of a challenge
because I have so many and I do want to
reach for other things I think I did
relatively well I've never got really
bored with this palette I never got
super antsy with it I would say this
past week I got maybe a little antsy
because I'm really really wanting to
jump into my collection now and pull out
my palettes that have really really nice
like beautiful bright colors because
spring is around the corner but for the
most part I think I did really well I
didn't find myself being like oh you
know now I have to use that semi-sweet
palette or this or that it was really
just fun everyday to kind of fool around
with this palette and I have started to
make a dent in a few of the shades here
so overall I think the one month one
palette challenge was a success for me
I'm very happy let me know if you guys
participated in this little challenge as
well I know a few of you were doing it
at the same time as me so let me know
how your results were how you feel about
the palette do you still love it do you
hate it do you not feel anything about
it what do you think and also I just
wanted to say I probably will be doing
another one of these in the future so
expect to see those kind of videos
popping up so I hope you guys enjoyed
this little check-in and final update on
me one month one palette challenge thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you guys in tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
