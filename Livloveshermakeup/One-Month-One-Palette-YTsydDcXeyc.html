know I have like a little thing of dried
mascara right there I can't get it off
so I apologize anyway I recently saw my
friends at Kristen k here on YouTube do
a video called one month one palette and
I was so super excited when she put it
up I was very intrigued and I thought
you know what I'm going to do that for
the month of februari so this is my
little announcement video a little well
I think it's a challenge i will be doing
this challenge for the whole month and
basically it is where you focus on one
palette for the entire month it can be a
lip palette a face palette a blush
palette a I'm shadow palette whatever
you want I went ahead and show something
a little neutral just in case you know I
have shows or something I'm also
teaching you know I want to I want to be
able to reach for the eyeshadow but not
like go crazy and reach for a really
colorful eyeshadow palette that makes
sense so I chose the two-faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette oh by
the way I'm going to link Kristen's
video below and also her Channel I don't
remember if I said that but she's really
really fantastic anyway so this is what
this little guy right here or just want
to eat him you smell so good too i am
going to focusing and sending some
quality time with him for the entire
month i love this palette it is my
favorite chocolate bar palette that
two-faced release you get a nice
arrangement of cool Tom Shaye's warm
tone shades a few pops of color
absolutely gorgeous I feel like I can
wear this all the time the only time I
will not be wearing these is when you
see collab videos or reviews because I
like to wear you know if I'm doing a
review i like to wear whatever it is
that i'm reviewing on my eyes and I know
that to face is releasing their peanut
butter palette at the end of peppy right
and i will be getting that but anyway i
was super super excited to do this i
think it's really gonna help me to kind
of I don't know get into this palette
like I said I really enjoy it and love
it and I think I haven't reached for it
in about five months so I think this is
going to be like an eye opener on how
hard it is to get through you don't have
to like hit pan or use the whole palette
but how hard it is to really get through
a whole palette you know I think that we
all buy tons and tons of pallets
including me hello I've been doing is
Sephora haul pretty much every week on
my channel but we buy and buy
I and I'm starting to realize that there
are so many different looks you can
create with this palette and I think
it's going to be really really fun and
easy for the month of februari I think
it's very very doable it's a doable
challenge instead of something like use
up 15 products in one month which by the
way like Kristin she is awesome she
really does videos like that and she can
get through those kind of products me on
the other hand I'm like okay I'll get
through this one and then by five new
ones I'm trying to get better about that
but yeah I'm not there yet so anyway I'm
really really excited to do this I want
you guys to join me as well if you are a
video creator go ahead and film a video
on this and talk about what palette
you're going to use or if you're someone
who just leaves comments let me know
down below which palette you are going
to use for in the month of februari and
keep me updated on your progress so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video is very
short and sweet it's kind of just a
little announcement but that is what I
will be doing any time you see a
tutorial or a get ready with me this
month it will be with this little guy
super super excited I just want to eat
in peace so cute alright guys thanks for
joining me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
