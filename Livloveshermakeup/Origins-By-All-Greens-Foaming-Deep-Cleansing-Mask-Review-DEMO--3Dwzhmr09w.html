channel I am here to do a review and
demo for you guys on a new map from
origins this is the origins by all
greens foaming deep cleansing mask with
green tea spirulina and spinach I
recently did a Sephora haul I'll go
ahead and link it in the description bar
if you guys would like to watch it to
see all the products that I picked up
but I recently did a Sephora haul and I
hope this product and a lot of you asked
if I would do a first impressions on it
cuz you were very curious about it and
unfortunately I did not see those
comments until after I had actually used
it on my face like the day that I hauled
everything I ended up like using this
product so I am here to do the next best
thing which is scuse me
runny nose I'm here to do the next best
thing which is a review and demo on the
product for you guys so I have used this
a few times I'm really liking it so far
I will say I don't think it's friendly
for all skin types and I'll get into
that in a little bit but you do get 2.6
ounces of product in here which is a
nice amount for a mess it is $36 and it
is a Sephora exclusive this is a two and
one products so you can either use it
it's kind of like glam glows dual
cleanse treatment you can use it to
either cleanse your face or use it as an
actual intensive mask so if you want to
use it as a cleanser what you do is you
push it into your hand you're gonna foam
it up on your hands like lather it up
and then you're going to apply it to
your face
let it sit there for a couple of seconds
and then wash your face I really like
using it that way I feel like it really
clears out like gunk and debris from my
skin it is supposed to be like it was
inspired by detox juicing
which is all about like green tea
spirulina and spinach you know how
people like drinking the green tea like
or not green tea the green juice is kind
of like detoxing your system this is
basically supposed to be the same sort
of concept before your face so supposed
to detoxify your skin of any debris and
like gunky pores things like that it
says it is a self activating foam mask
that helps deep clean and a clog the
pores without stripping your skin I
don't know if I really agree with that I
feel like it will strip your skin a
little bit depending on your skin type
and it says as the mask is transforming
you may experience a cooling and
tingling sensation I definitely get that
so like I said the first way you can
apply it is literally just I put you on
your hand rubbing it together putting it
on and then washing
face it works really well that way but
my favorite way to use it is as a mask
so what you do is let's go ahead and
just look demo this right now I'm gonna
put my hair back so as a mask what you
want to do is they recommend shaking it
up it is like in a little aerosol can
you're just gonna put it on the back of
your hand just like this you're not
going to start activating it don't rub
it together you want to literally just
start placing this all over your face
and then you're supposed to let the foam
start to activate on your face and you
will see in a couple of seconds the
Spohn starts to kind of activate and
then it starts to kind of disintegrate
into the skin and you start to feel a
little bit of a cooling or tingling
sensation it's kind of like one of those
like masks that are very popular right
not like bubble mass so right now it's
on there and you'll start to see it will
start to kind of sink into my skin in a
minute so as you put it on it's super
super bubbly and the reason you don't
want to rub it together and then put it
on if you're using it as a mask is
because it will just start to like to
centigrate right away you want to let
the bubbles actually work on the skin so
that they are like picking up you know
all the debris and pollutants in your
skin or whatever that's the concept of
it and I will be taking this off with my
makeup eraser a little sponge after we
are done but anyway I'm gonna let it sit
there for a little bit they recommend
using this for about five to ten minutes
so I'm just gonna walk you guys through
what I think of this product so kind of
like it's orange smell to it it is free
of parabens and satellite's if you guys
are curious but it has kind of like an
orange creamsicle sort of smell to it it
reminds me a lot of the Olay Henriksen
truth line which is like the orange line
it kind of smelled like our Musa
creamsicle
I feel like this kind of smells like
that as well I don't know why it smells
like that because I feel like this is
filled with like green tea spirulina
spinach like you would think it wouldn't
smell good but it actually smells it
very very good and when you put it on
you can really start to kind of feel it
tingling now I noticed I personally have
combination skin and right now as the
like months are starting to get warmer
if it's starting to get warmer my skin
starts to get a little more oily so I'm
more like combo slash oily skin so I
personally really like this for my skin
type but I have to tell you right away
if you have aging skin dry skin or
sensitive skin this is going to be a
no-go
for you I honestly can feel lots of
tingling sensations right now and I feel
like the fragrance is very strong in
here which is why I don't think it would
work for those with sensitive skin and
also when I wash my face even if I just
use it as a cleanser or if I use it as a
mask like I am right now
I find that when I rinse my face or when
I wipe my face clean
it does feel stripped like I can
definitely feel on the outer perimeters
of my face where I'm a little more dry
it feels like there's it's like squeaky
clean and almost a little uncomfortable
and tight so I think if you have aging
skin or dry skin you're not gonna like
this it definitely does not put moisture
back into your skin I think you're only
gonna like this if you have oily or
combination skin because it really is
pulling all the gunk out of your skin
now you have to understand there are
also like deep clay cleansers in here
which is really really cool which is why
I wanted to try it out because I was
thinking I love clay masks but the one
thing I don't like about playing Mass is
that they leave my face feeling so tight
and just like I can't move it you know
when I have the actual mask on this is a
foam and it's really cool you guys can
see that it's starting to kind of go
into the pores now and that's when you
know you're ready to take it off so once
everything starts to kind of look like
it's your skin again and the foam has
completely activated and kind of eaten
off the top layer of the skin then you
can wipe it clean or you can rinse it
clean so my favorite way to use it is
definitely as a Mac I really do like it
I just feel like the scent is a little
strong and definitely if you have
sensitive skin you're not gonna like
that tingling sensation because it's
quite strong and it can even like make
your eyes water a little bit but I think
if you have oily or combination skin you
would really really like this because it
is going to pull all of the oils out all
of the gunk all of the oils this has
been working really really well on
little active breakouts that I have I
have like a cystic pimple I can't
remember where it was
I used this twice and this really really
helped that area as well so I think it's
a really cool products like if you were
traveling and you wanted to use this as
your cleanser and your mask you can do
that I like that you get 2.6 ounces of
product in here again for $36 I feel
like that's like okay that's still kind
of expensive but I think this is a good
product from origins I like that it's
like a little aerosol can and yeah
most of the ingredients in here are
pretty natural there is citric acid in
here which
again is why I don't think it would be
good for sensitive skin there's algae
extract do they have bergamot fruit oil
citrus lemon oil they have orange oil
just a lot of citrus stuff so it kind of
feels like when it's on the face like if
you have it on as a mask right now I
kind of feel like I'm using a citrus
acid peel like if you've ever used an
AAA product or something with like fruit
acids in it it kind of eats off the top
layer of the skin I feel like that's
what this product does but it's in like
a foaming sort of thing so it feels
really really cool as its on but now I'm
starting to feel my skin is a little dry
and when I wipe it clean I will
definitely have super super squeaky
clean skin now I personally like that
because like I said I have combination
skin but I think if you have sensitive
skin this is gonna be a no-go if you
have aging skin because usually when
your skin is aging and you have lots of
moisture loss I don't think that this is
going to be good for you I'm not saying
everybody who has aging skin has dry
skin I'm just saying you loose most
moisture over time and you tend to be a
little more dry I feel like this is just
gonna dry you out more it definitely
doesn't do anything for like fine lines
or wrinkles although it doesn't claim to
do any of that what it really does is
just clear the gunk out of your skin and
I think if you have oily or combo skin
you're going to love this
so let's go ahead and wipe it off I have
my makeup eraser here I'm just going to
start kind of wiping those off as you
guys can see it starts to kind of foam
up a little more which is why it's nice
because it really is kind of like a
cleanser slash mask so now I'm taking
the dry side and I feel like I get a
little red around like my nostril area
and around my lip area with this product
and that's where I can feel like the
acids really eating away like the most
is around my nose area I'm always very
sensitive there so I feel like I do get
a little bit of a tingling sensation
there and I am a little red afterwards
but you guys can see right away like
there is no excess oil on my face right
now and I'm
it's like almost like tacky feeling so
it does help a lot of course I will wash
my face after this but again since I
don't edit my videos I can't go to the
sink with you guys but I think overall
it just leaves me very very matte no
shine whatsoever
and you don't get that like tackiness if
you actually wash your face at this
thing but of course I'm using the makeup
eraser so I'm kind of just moving the
product around but also just wiping it
off so there is a little bit of a tacky
residue but I feel like my face feels
slightly tight right now around my eye
area in my t-zone it feels really good I
just feel like it's nice and clean but
in my cheek area
I'm almost like oh it feels a little
tight so I feel like like I said if you
have combo skin oily skin I think you're
gonna love this especially during the
summer if you tend to get a little more
oily like I do and my skin just feels so
clean now and I'm gonna go and put my
makeup on and I feel like it's gonna go
on really nicely but if you have dry
skin aging skin or sensitive skin this
is just not going to be the products for
you so I hope you guys enjoyed this
little review and demo on the new
origins by all greens mask thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
