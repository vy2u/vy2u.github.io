welcome back to my channel today's video
is going to be for all of you pale
princesses out there I am going to be
sharing a pale girl must have these are
all makeup let me know if you want like
a skincare version maybe like
self-tanning version I don't know I
definitely definitely do embrace my pale
skin it's kind of funny that I'm filming
this video right now though because this
is the darkest you guys will ever see me
I would guess I'm probably about like at
NW or NC 20 right now in a Mac
foundation but normally I am anywhere
between an NW 10 and 15 so I'm not the
fairest of the fair I don't have like
any w5 skin tone but I am very very fair
complected with a strong cool undertone
so I thought it'd be fun to share with
you guys some makeup products that I
really do like although i do self-tan
during the summertime during the winter
time I just let my skin it be what it is
and I am very proud of my pill skin I
don't think there's anything wrong with
that you should always be proud of
whatever skin tone you are or color
alright so let's go ahead and jump right
into it the first couple things I want
to talk about are a white mixer if you
have pale skin you need a white mixer
foundation in your collection now it's
not necessarily like a white mixer
foundation but it's a white mixer that
you mix into your foundation so this
right here is the Mac face and body
foundation in white I'm not a huge fan
of this but I have recently found
something that's very comparable it is
from NYX Cosmetics it's their total
control a drop foundation and I don't
find that this has enough coverage for
me personally as an actual foundation
however these are very similar in
consistency if you want something that
isn't going to change the actual finish
of your foundation you can use one of
these this is really really nice and
lightweight but my favorite white mixer
is from Illamasqua this is the rich
liquid foundation in the shade RF 100 I
don't think they even sell this
particular shade anymore but RF 105 is
pretty much the same it has more of like
a pinky tone though so anyway I like
this because it does actually give more
pigment and more coverage into your
foundation but any sort of white mixture
is very very helpful all you do is just
add a few drops into your foundation so
that you can bring out that color up all
right speaking of foundations there are
a few different brands that I do think
actually cater nicely towards pale skin
the first one is from the drugstore this
is gosh cosmetics this is my all-time
favorite CC cream it is the illuminating
foundation in the shade 0-1 porcelain
this
just me absolutely perfectly when I am
like an NW ten so if you want a really
really nice shade selection from the
drugstore I would highly recommend
checking out gosh cosmetics and then as
far as high-end is concerned I would say
Marc Jacobs caters very very nicely to
those of you who do have a pale
complexion so the shade that I wear in
this genius gel supercharged foundation
is 10 ivory light this is like a perfect
match for me when I am at my lightest so
anyway would highly recommend checking
out those two brands and then also I do
have just like a few random foundations
here that well actually I should say one
random foundation here that I think is
really really nice from the drugstore as
well the maybelline superstay better
skin skin transforming foundation this
one right here is beautiful it's like a
perfect match for me when I met my
pianist which is kind of funny because a
Maybelline honestly doesn't have a very
good shade selection and their other
foundations but this one is really good
also you guys know I love the Josie
Maran vibrancy foundation fluid the
shade dynamic is a perfect match for me
as well alright let's talk about some
primers because I do think when you have
a fair complexion and is very important
to try and make your skin look a little
more alive for me personally when I met
my palest and even if I have moisturized
really beautifully I do look a little
dull my skin looks dull so I really do
like having a more illuminating primer
in my collection a lot of people love
the Becca backlight priming filter I
have a bunch of little marks on here
because I am trying to use this up I
don't personally love it for my combo to
oily skin but this one right here is the
immediate diamond Tarte to base primer
in the illuminating soft focus version
if you do have combo or oily skin I
think you would really really enjoy this
one if you are more normal to drive you
would probably enjoy the Becca I just
find that having an illuminating primer
gives a little more life to my face even
if it's not giving color it just looks a
little more illuminated and when you do
have a very very fair complexion you can
look a little dull and just lackluster
sometimes your skin tone can alright
moving on let's talk about bronzers I
think the best bronzers hands down from
the drugstore are these ones right here
from Physicians Formula these are the
more and more butter bronzers in new
shades light bronzer which has more of a
warm undertone and out so just bronzer
which has more of a cool undertone
I prefer this one which has more of a
cool undertone but this is so beautiful
and natural-looking on fair skin
honestly I don't even have a high-end
version to share with you guys I just
think you should pick these up like I
said if you have a cool tone okay at the
bronzer shade if you have more of a warm
tone this one right here which is called
light bronzer as
little more of like a reddish undertone
to it but these are absolutely stunning
on fair-skinned so highly highly
recommend those as far as setting in
your face is concerned I do have one
right here it's gonna come as no
surprise the essence all about Matt
fixie contact powder is beautiful it
won't darken up on your skin if you do
have for your skin you know that some of
those transparent or translucent powders
do actually have color to them this is a
fantastic fantastic powder for setting
your face in and it will not darken you
up also this little guy right here is
really nice for setting the under eye
area this is from wetting wild it is the
color icon bronzer with SPF 15 in the
shade reserve your cabana it does lean a
little more on the yellow tone side but
it's beautiful for cancelling out dark
tones underneath the eyes as well so
really really do enjoy that as far as
color correcting is concerned there are
just two that I would recommend the
first one is the urban decay color
correcting fluid in the shade pink and
then also the yellow version I use the
yellow one this morning and it's still
in my makeup drawer like my shot my
stash makeup drawer so I don't have it
here to show you guys but these are
awesome because they do have that pastel
sort of quality to them so they're not
going to be too dark on your face on
this this one is really really great if
you do have a cool undertone and then
the yellow one is great if you do have a
warm undertone so those are really the
only color correctors that I would
recommend if you have a very very fair
complexion as far as concealers are
concerned the chart train force at the
scene aqua sealer in the shade fair
matches me perfectly when I met my pay
list it does have a little bit I feel
like it pulls a little bit of a pinky
undertone but this one right here the
Born This Way
naturally radiant concealer from Too
Faced pulls a very neutral undertone
this is maybe like half a shade too dark
for me when I am at maya fairest but the
shade is called very fair and it still
is pretty darn good another one I want
to recommend for you guys I can't find
it in my collection right now is the Kat
Von D whiteout concealer like it's like
a basically like a white mixer but it's
like a concealer that is fantastic would
highly recommend sometimes I just wear
that underneath my eyes and it blends in
perfectly with my skin I don't even have
to mix it together with an actual
foundation all right let's talk about
some illuminators the first one I want
to recommend is from NARS this is the
Copacabana illuminator I've talked about
this quite a bit I love this for mixing
into my foundations even if you don't
want to pick up like a illuminating
primer just mixing something like this
into your foundation can get a little
bit of a glow to your skin now
one definitely has more of a cool tone
but it is absolutely stunning it has a
little bit of a silver iridescent and it
won't darken up on your skin also this
one is great if you do pull a warm
undertone this is the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector in the shade at moonstone
you can also get this in the pressed pan
version which I have right here this is
really really fantastic like I said if
you are very fair complected and you
have a warm undertone I don't feel like
this is going to darken up on you if you
do have a very cool undertone I would
highly recommend Urban Decay's aura this
now comes in liquid illuminator form as
well as this powder version absolutely
stunning and beautiful a blush I want to
recommend that I think works on every
single skin tone is the Milani 0/5
luminoso baked powder blush this is what
it looks like I have used the out
of this do you guys see this it used to
have like a bubble right and I have used
it like crazy so this is absolutely
beautiful if you do want to rock like a
nice warm toned blush this is a really
really good one and honestly that works
for every single skin tone I have never
seen anybody that can't pull that off
honestly I'm something else I want to
recommend or another foundation
specifically if you do have combo or
oily skin is the YSL what is this fusion
ink foundation this particular shade b10
porcelain matches me really really well
I'm not absolutely in love with this
foundation but I know I'm gonna be
wearing it for sure during the
summertime all right some more blushes
right here we have some Illamasqua
powder blushes these are fantastic
because the actual matte versions have
like a boyish undertone to them so this
particular shade right here is called
lover and like I said they just have
like a really pasteles toward equality
to them if you do have a very deep
complexion these are gonna be a little
ashy on your skin but if you are pale
they're great this one is really nice if
you have a cool undertone this
particular shade is called Katie it's
almost like a whiteout cool toned pink
let's see here for a highlight if you
want just a straight-up really really
natural highlight that you can also use
to set in your face I would highly
recommend the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in the shade ethereal light it
doesn't get much lighter than this this
is a cool toned opalescent white powder
as you guys can see this is a really
really nice product to have in your
collection if you do have fair skin also
I know that the dual chromatic thing is
really in right now holographic
highlighters the Anastacio Beverly Hills
moonchild bloke it is stunning
absolutely stunning on fares
I think it looks beautiful on a lot of
different skin tones but I will say
there's something about a holographic or
do a chromatic highlighter on fair skin
that I think looks so ethereal and
gorgeous so this is what this particular
glow kit looks like it is permanent and
I would highly recommend checking it out
obviously these two shades right here
you're gonna have to layer with the
other ones but all four right here are
not too dark for my skin tone so would
highly recommend checking that out make
up forevers recently released these
wonderful highlights these are the
profusion undetectable Luminizer 's this
particular shade 0-1 is very similar to
yours glowing garden's highlight in the
shade of glowing pink so this is what it
looks like these are permanent this is
amazing if you do have very very fair
skin with a cool undertone equal not
dirtying up on your complexion because
it has a white base if you do want
something with a little more of like a
champagne color to it the Illamasqua
beyond powder highlight in the shade oh
my god is amazing it does have the
perfect amount of gold in it now if you
do have fair skin you know that gold
highlighters usually are a little too
dark but this one has the perfect amount
of gold with a little bit of like a
white base as well as a champagne
undertone so that is what it looks like
really really gorgeous as well and then
I also want to recommend to you guys
also having just some sort of a silica
powder on hand these are very very
helpful if you put on all your makeup
and you're noticing you're looking a
little dark having any sort of silica
powder is helpful so this is the by
Terry hyaluronic hydra powder this will
lighten up your foundation just a little
bit which is why people with deeper skin
tones are always like oh it gives me
like flashback or you know what I mean
wouldn't they take photos but this is
really really helpful if you do have a
fair complexion also the elf one is
great makeup forever Tarte makes one too
everybody seems to have one of these
would highly recommend and then finally
I do have one blush here that I want to
recommend to you guys that I think
always looks laddering on the skin it is
from ELF and it is called let's see here
pink passion and I really love this but
as you guys can tell I'm sure you can
probably see it this has gone bad so I'm
saving this particular blush so I can
show you guys when I do my how to tell
when your makeup has gone bad video but
this is a really really nice cool toned
pink shade kind of similar to Illamasqua
Katie so anyway that is just a handful
of recommendations for those of you who
do have a fair complexion whether you're
more warm tones or cool tones definitely
let me know if you want any of these
items swatched out on my Instagram and
yeah that's pretty much it thank you so
much for joining me guys and I will see
you tomorrow for a what's in my
video so yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
