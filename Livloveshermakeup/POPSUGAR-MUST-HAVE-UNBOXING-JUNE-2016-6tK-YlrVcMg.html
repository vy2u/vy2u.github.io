thank you so much for joining me i have
another video for you guys today and
there may be another one later too lots
of reviews coming up so there may be
videos popping up all day I apologize
ahead of time anyway I have my unboxing
my popsugar must have box unboxing for
June 2016 this just got to my door and I
was like I have to do it because I've
been slack in the past two months i have
not unbox this baby on camera and i'm
making myself doing right now I'm and
I'm good coming sorry a lot of energy
going on there but anyway I wanted to
say something really quickly the box is
like a lot thinner than what it usually
is so it seems like things are getting
more compact which is nice because this
box used to be freaking humongous
alright so let's go ahead and get
started here is the little pamphlet
which shows us the pan-flute the
pamphlet which show though so what we
have in the box for the month and yeah
that's why I did you again alright so
the first thing I see looks like it
might be a scarf actually really cute oh
hey very very cute let's open it up and
guessing this is a shawl or ass part of
some sort oh it feels nice yeah so is
this a tablecloth no it looks like a
scarf you know what let's open the
pamphlet and feed it says yes nope yes
no that is not it where is it I don't
understand oh here it is lightweight and
easy to pack in your weekend bag this
multifunctional sarong is the perfect Oh
beach accessory switched out to tie and
you'll never get bored with the cover-up
oh my god so you can like use it as a
little cover-up and I have like your
body that goes through it okay that's
adorable I'm loving this I'm obsessed
super super cute so basically you can
wear this at the beach which is perfect
because Tom and I may be going to my
parents or our family's condo in daytona
for the fourth of july so this is super
cute you know I'm just complete design
alright moving on the next item here
that I see our sub Pacifica underarm
deodorant wipes that is so cute these
are odor Newton
minute odor neutralizing with coconut
milk and essential oils it's not it says
smell fabulous all day long without
harsh chemicals so these are actually
with deodorant wipes very very cool you
read no I've been on the search brand
natural deodorant so let's see here
Pacifica staying fresh on the go has
never been easier than with these travel
ready under arm wipes which neutralize
odors for hours so it's like putting on
deodorant all with an aluminum free
vegan formula and it's nine dollars for
that pack so cool by the way this little
sarong or this little scarf is $58 girl
alright moving on the next item I see oh
my god would but what is this what is
this I haven't absolutely no idea what
this is this is a what it is oh my god
it's a bottle opener of course I barely
drink so I wouldn't know all right here
it says cheers this is a bottle opener
you Greg this feels like so heavy and
waited and lovely in my hand see bouquet
and it says sisters of Los Angeles
Cheers bottle opener it says this golden
bar accessory is the ideal companion for
your favorite brew perfect for
displaying on a bar cart or cracking
open a cold drink at backyard bash
cheers and this is twelve dollars this
is so weighted it feels great that is
awesome very very cute that's why i love
popsugar must have box because they send
you stuff that you would never really
think of you would get like you know it
again in a sauce I should just stop
talking before I sound crazy alright the
next thing I see is game room Who am I
quiz it looks like this and we have
gotten games before from them Tom and I
actually played bingo all the time and
we got the bingo game from them anyway
these are like little cards it's like a
deck of cards ah let's see here it says
Who am I team up with friends to guess
the celebrity in this exciting easy to
play game that you can bring any where
it says it's great for parties too
because it will break the ice between
even the shy of strangers and it is 1295
for this little deck so let's read some
of the back let's see I was a classic
English actor in Hollywood my real name
is Archibald leach I am known for my
good looks I was married five times and
I am in North by Northwest Cary Grant oh
that is so cute i love that all right
awesome and the thing next item that I
seeing here is all wrapped up so let's
open this up what is that it's just ncl
a born on the fourth nail lacquer oh my
god that's so cute oh yes I love really
really quit or email fellowship I don't
know why because they are a pain in the
ass to remove but look at that red white
and blue super sparkly and glittery very
pretty it says this patriotic and
cruelty-free red white and blue polish
was exclusively developed with pop sugar
and we love how we can stand alone or be
born over another nail polish and this
was $16 very cool and in here it says
are you ready and there is a little
compact and i am not looking to a cute
right now because i just went out and
got groceries and came home and I look
like right anyway it says knock knock
and there's the little dual sided mirror
very very cute and it says don't worry
about stands I'm messing up this cheeky
compact mirror it says it's durable
enough to throw into your beach bag for
on-the-go touch-ups ten dollars very
cool and then a final item that I see in
here is in a little brown box oh yeah it
appears to be food it says these are
crystal thin and crispy pretzel chips in
the sriracha flavor so that is what they
look like it says here why can't I ever
find things when I'm just looking I'll
be there we go because they've got less
fat and sodium than other popular chip
options you can enjoy this scrumptious
hint of fight in these three addictive
snacks these addictive snacks oh these
addictive not 30 grazie all right it
says without feeling guilty 129 for this
little bag okay so I'm pretty happy with
everything that I got this month I
wouldn't say it was the best box that
I've ever gotten but this is actually
pretty cute this little sarong I like
this so yeah I'm excited about this I'm
definitely excited about the deodorant
white can't wait to try those out and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
