my channel today I am walking you guys
through PR products that I actually
would a purchase with my own money so
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
want to start with some products from
the Oprah brand the first one I have
here is the makeup fixer light mists and
this is a product that I don't feel like
a lot of people talk about it all but it
is really really good a setting spray
now I'm not quite sure if there is a
little bit of alcohol in here or not but
I really like this for my dry skin I
feel like it does lock in my makeup all
day long you get a huge amount of
product in here my only complaint is
that the sprayer sometimes is a little
hard to kind of push down on but overall
you get eight ounces of product here for
around $13 on the ulta.com website or
the oprah.com website it's cruelty free
it's a really good setting spray so that
is the first item and then also I
recently tested out to the
nikkietutorials Oprah collection so we
have three different liquid lipsticks as
well as a highlighter trio in the shade
ever glow and this is a gorgeous this
white shade mixed together with this one
right here which I believe is Rodeo
Drive are absolutely beautiful on the
skin if you do have a medium to well I'm
sorry if you have a light to medium
complexion and if you have a medium to
deep complexion this bronze shade down
here as beautiful as a highlight or at
least that's what I've seen in videos so
if this is gorgeous you do have to be
careful with over highlighters they do
have a lot of powder kickback so just
make sure you tap off the excess on your
brush a but it's a really really good
product and then the liquid lipsticks
are cuffin which is a beautiful deep
kind of raspberry color with a little
bit of a bronze sheen running through it
it's very nice on the lips and then we
have nude potion which I've actually
fallen in love with and this was
definitely a shade that I didn't really
think was a good match for me at first
but I do like it
and then this guy right here is called
spell and again this was a color I
didn't think I'd be able to pull off but
if I wear neutral makeup like just
mascara and nothing else on my eyes and
I pop this on it's a pop of color on the
lips and it's beautiful they smell
really good they wear a long time and
they do have a little more of like a
creamy lightweight texture to them so
they don't feel heavy on the lips which
I enjoy alright let's move on to Michael
tada Beauty I have a couple of products
here that they have sent to me the first
one is their sonic clear petite and this
is really really nice this is very
comparable to the Clarisonic so if you
are cruelty free and you know Clarisonic
is not a cruelty
Brande unfortunately so if you
repurchase their brush light they're not
cruelty free but I was originally just
gonna test out some different brush
heads and maybe picks them up on Amazon
but then they sent me this and I am so
impressed with this for a fraction of
the price
you can basically get the same exact
thing now I was interested in trying out
their luxe cashing your brush head I
ended up actually sending it back or no
I didn't send it back I decluttered it
to a friend because I guess cashmere
isn't technically really cruelty free
everybody has different thoughts on that
but from me I just don't think it is so
I'm gonna get these sensitive a brush
head there this one right here it's just
for normal skin and it is a little more
abrasive on my skin but you have
multiple different settings here and I
just really like this I always use it on
the lower setting but you do have three
different settings just so you guys know
so I really do enjoy that and then here
is the sonic eraser Pro you may be like
what the hell is that well this is one
of those products that kind of vibrates
when you touch it and it starts to heat
up but this is for a better absorption
of your serums as well as your
moisturizers but what I love this for
the most is when I put oil on my face
you know when you put oil on your face
and it doesn't immediately absorb you
take this and you do a circular motions
and it helps to push the product into
your skin it also will give a little bit
of redness and flush to your skin which
in return is basically a giving you no
blood flow to your cheeks and
circulation so I really do enjoy that as
well and now has become a staple in my
skincare routine guys up next we have
the Becca ultimate coverage complexion a
creme I mix these shades sand as well as
shell together to get my perfect match I
love this it's a very very lightweight
full coverage foundation so if you don't
like that heavy heavy feel kind of like
the Kat Von D luck at a tube foundation
you might want to look into this now I
do sometimes add a little bit of oil in
just to make it a little more skin like
for my dry skin but two or three pumps
of this will give you a full coverage
and it looks absolutely incredible
all day long the only area that I really
noticed this starts to break up is
around my nose area so would highly
recommend you guys look into the Becca
ultimate coverage complexion crap up
next I have some products here from
buxom the first are their customizable
eyeshadow so these are four they're
customizable shadow palettes I just have
a couple of singles here to show you
guys I don't know where my actual
customizable palette is but and these
are two of their shimmer shades I went
ahead and I did swatch them out here so
Braun shade is called a bronze bot and
then this guy is called a Twilight trice
and you know these are just
gorgeous they go on really really nicely
to the eyes I feel like a lot of people
don't talk about buxom shadows but I
would highly recommend you go and store
you pick out your customizable palette
and then you go ahead and you decorate
it with all sorts of different shadows
that fit you whether that be and that
finishes whether it be glitter infused
finishes if you want or whether it be
you know satin kind of shades I really
really do like the satins especially and
then also I love these buxom above a
pump liquid lipsticks I also really like
their full-on lip creams which they have
sent me as well as their lip polishes
which are really nice but there's
something about these shiny liquid
lipsticks that make me really happy the
shade I have right here is called wine
time and this one is just a really
really beautiful deep berry shade I like
the applicator it's easy to put on these
do remain a pretty glossy on the lips
for about four to five hours and then
they do dry down even when they dry down
you can put another layer of this on and
it won't look crusty which I'm a huge
fan of so then this guy right here is
called a Russian to you and this is a
little more of a peachy nude they have a
great shade selection like I said 20
different colors so if you want to
liquid lipstick that's pretty darn
comfortable but highly recommend looking
into those alright let's move on to 100%
here they are vegan and cruelty free
brand now this guy right here is their
fruit pigmented Oh blush I love this the
shade is called Moffitt it's
gorgeous it's buttery it's smooth it
goes on beautifully for being a vegan
makeup I'm very very impressed with this
particular product I'll go ahead and do
a little bit of a swatch here but it's
so smooth it's so buttery it kind of
runs me a little bit of the sugarplum
fairy blush from it cosmetics the ombre
blush really really nice it does have a
little bit of a silver iridescent
running through it as well so I really
love their fruit pigmented blushes I
wasn't a huge huge fan of their gemmed
Luminizer 's they did send over two
shades for me to try out and I wasn't
really into those however there is
another product from them that I love
and it's there overnight restorative
retinol balm if you have dry skin and
you need a retinol and like this Sunday
Riley Luna sleeping night oil breaks you
out or you have some sort of issue with
it or you have sensitivity that one is
fantastic it is very expensive this is a
very pricey brand but I would highly
recommend you guys look into
that now from Charlotte Tilbury descent
of the dream scent of a dream perfume is
absolutely gorgeous it reminds me of my
grandma and I know she passed away a
couple of years ago and I know a lot of
people wouldn't want to smell like their
grandma but it's actually very
sophisticated but I has a little bit of
sweetness going on there so this is
definitely a product that I would
purchase with my own money from
Charlotte Tilbury
and I would definitely also purchase the
full fat lashes mascara they've sent me
a lot of different PR it wasn't super
into their eye liners that they sent
over or all of their eyeshadow palettes
but this little quad right here I was
pretty into this is the sophisticate
luxury palette and it's super
boring I mean look at these basic colors
but God the formula is just top-notch it
is a top bitch kind of formula they're
super smooth creamy buttery I carry this
around in my purse so throughout the day
if I need to put some eyeshadow on or if
I have a gig right after work and I need
to put something on my eyes I've use it
this so I really really do enjoy those
products right there from Charlotte
Tilbury and finally guys I have kind of
a random one so this is skincare
oriented and it is if you have those big
painful kind of zits on your you know
chin or anywhere on your face these
would be covered acne care so I don't
know if you've ever heard of these I
believe Peter Thomas Roth has a similar
product these are from smart medic these
were actually sent to me through an
Amazon store but basically what they are
are clear blemish dots you've literally
peel them off like a little band-aid and
you put them on your blemish so you
don't have to use salicylic acid or
benzoyl peroxide they help with the
pasta they also do help to with the
swelling so if you do have a really
really big painful set and it hurts to
 hell
and it's really really sore these are
absolutely great for that so these are
really really nice it does say overnight
here at healing it does also help
prevent a scarring stops urged to
squeeze or pop pimples which it
definitely does if you are a squeezer or
a popper and this will help because it's
like you have a band-aid over your skin
so you don't want to go ahead and do
that and then they are waterproof so you
can wear these out I do notice that I
can see them throughout the day so
they're not something that I would wear
underneath makeup but I love wearing
these at nighttime this one right here
is the 36 pack and this one right here
is a 24 pack so again those are from
smart med so anyway guys those are some
PR products I would actually purchase
with my own
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
