my channel happy Wednesday today I
wanted to go ahead and walk you guys
through a video this will be part one of
five in a little mini series all about
PR products that would not purchase with
my own money
now let me know if you want me to go
ahead and flip this around and talk
about PR products that I would purchase
with my own money I was inspired to do
this because my friend Kate Lee bow too
recently did a video like this and I
loved it so I will go ahead and leave
her channel as well it's her video down
below please go share some love and send
her some love you guys know I love
Kayleigh I love her channel I love her
content but I thought this was a
brilliant idea I think it's really
interesting because for me if you guys
are unfamiliar I do not do a YouTube
full-time this is not what I do for a
living I'm actually a classical flutist
I'm a musician as well as a music
teacher and that is where my passion is
I will never be a full-time content
creator it's not in the stars for me
it's not anything that I personally want
I do this as a hobby now because I do
this as a hobby it feels slightly weird
for me to do things like sponsorships
where I accept $500 or $1000 from a
brand to talk about a specific product
but I still do go ahead and put ads on
my videos I do monetize the majority of
my videos not all of them but the
majority of them and I do accept PR I
get a lot of questions about PR people
saying and do you still get you know PR
from brands even though you talk shit
all the time
and the answer is yes I have a lot of
brands that have shied away from me I
have a lot of brands that I have had
some beef with and there have been
brands that have approached me and said
hey you got to take your video down and
we're taking you to court and there have
also been some brands that have been
very kind throughout the years and they
have gone and kept sending me PR so
there are a lot of different things to
talk about when it comes to PR let me
know if you guys would like like an
in-depth video talking about brands then
it kicked me off their PR list let's
talk about brands that handle you know
constructive criticism well because I am
one of those people that will never shy
away from telling you guys how I really
feel about something and I think one of
the reasons why I really can do that is
because this is a hobby but also I'm a
very passionate person if you couldn't
tell already I'm very passionate about
things that I love and I'm very
passionate about things that I hate so
anyway guys I felt like
had to do a little bit of a disclaimer
before jumping into the video because
they get a lot of questions about PR and
sponsorship sponsorship sponsorships and
all this kind of stuff so I wanted to go
ahead and preface it with that but
without further ado it looks like I had
to jump right into the video so the
first two products I would not purchase
with my own money that were sent to me
for PR are from amazing cosmetics and
this is the amazing concealer foundation
in the shade fair and this is the
amazing cosmetics illuminate primer in
the glow version so that this guy right
here was very very heavy on my skin the
shade fair is way too dark and it does
oxidize throughout the day so and that's
a big no-no I also noticed the first
time I used this it did start to
separate it has some like oily residue
in there and then you get the product
and it was kind of all bubbled up at
first I thought I got a bad one I
believe they resent me one in it was the
same exact sort of a scenario so I
didn't really like the formula of it
overall I felt like I couldn't really
blend this handle with a sponge I
couldn't really bunted it with a brush I
can't get this to look good on my skin
so the amazing concealer foundation I
personally would not purchase with my
own money if you are someone who does
have more normal skin and you are okay
with a foundation that feels a little
heavy on the skin and kind of smells
like ass I could see you liking this but
for me it's a no and then this guy right
here is the illuminate primer in the
glow version it does remind me a little
bit of the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in the liquid version which is
called pearl but this one has that more
plastered look to it I don't think it's
a good primer I think it really should
just be a mix in for your foundation it
definitely gives a little bit of glow to
your foundation so if you do have dry
skin this is nice but if you use it as a
primer you will see so much emphasis on
your pores and also little areas that
you don't really want people to notice
it kind of reminds me of the Becca
backlight priming filter which a lot of
people are gonna be like oh that's
fuckin fantastic I love that primer I
personally don't I think that looks so
artificial and plastered on the skin so
I will continue to use this and it mix
it into foundations but I would not
purchase with my own money alright guys
so let's move on to buxom buxom recently
sent over a PR package with I believe 14
of their different eyeshadows
and eyeliner and the big teeth plumping
mascara I really had high hopes for this
um the wand kind of got me curious and I
usually am a lover of all sorts of
different mascaras but this is way too
gloopy for me I just opened this up
probably about three or four days ago
you can see unfortunately because the
bristles are so tightly packed on the
wand you get huge galoop of product all
over the place so when you try and go in
on your lashes unfortunately it applies
unevenly
you can see at the little spout here as
well it's starting to get all clogged
and Gupta kinda reminds me a little bit
of the it cosmetics of what is it called
a superhero mascara but for me it's just
not a good one you guys I feel like it's
almost too clumpy on my lashes I know
I've been saying that lately I wonder if
I'm starting to be like I don't really
like clumpy lashes anymore but I don't
know I just feel like this really makes
my eyelashes look like little spider
legs which normally I'm into but weirdly
enough not really anymore so this is not
a formula I like it's also not a brush I
like and it's not something that I would
purchase with my own money all right
guys let's move on to Becca cosmetics so
Becca I did send over a bunch of their
ever matte shine proof of foundations
they also sent over the blurring primer
as well as the blurring powder so let's
start with the pepto bismol powder show
this is in pink haze it's called the
soft light blurring powder beautiful
beautiful packaging and I had never
tried a loose powder from Becca I'm a
big lover of a lot of Becca products but
unfortunately and this was just not good
I can't give the pink cast to go away
and I know it's supposed to be obviously
a little bit of a pink cast but this
looks like damn pepto-bismol underneath
my eyes even when I buff it in onto my
skin as a finishing powder you can still
see the pink even when I'm self tan
which is kind of weird I feel like the
packaging is very very difficult to you
is I do have a friend who I think will
like this so I'm going to go ahead and
send them to her but it's not something
I would purchase with my own money and
then here we have the velvet blurring
primer this is more for people who have
more I would say combo to oily skin it
really goes from a liquid to a powder so
if you do have more dry skin this is
going to emphasize the dry patches on
your skin I felt like you know when I
would first put it on and would kind of
dry down it felt like a light to layer
of like a silica powder on my face but
it felt weird going in with foundation
on top of that it was harder to blend it
looked a little chunky on my skin No
nation looks good with this primer in my
opinion on my skin personally so would
not purchase that with my own money and
then as far as the ever matte shine
proof foundation is concerned my god the
ever matte line has never works for me
whether it be when I had oily skin or
combo skin or now dry skin or normal dry
this doesn't work for me and I can
understand now that I'm normal dry it
wouldn't work for me but back when we
had oily skin and I tried this out when
it first came to Sephora which was ages
ago you guys I feel like Becca released
our ever matte line probably about four
or five years ago I was in college I
tried out to the ever matte shine prove
foundation as well as the ever matte
primer and I was like what book dear
look that fuck is this what on God's
green earth is this it is so difficult
and thick and hard to blend this stuff
dries really quickly and the primer you
take a little bit onto your hands you
have to rub it together then you have to
press into your skin I mean if you have
the oiliest of oïleus skin I feel like
this would work for you but for me you
guys I can't use it when I have oily
skin combo skin or dry skin that says a
lot so it definitely would not purchase
the ever matte shine proof foundation or
anything from the ever matte line from
Becca with my own money alright let's
move on to the sol de janeiro lino this
is the Brazilian foreplay moisturizing
shower cream gel
I believe that Kayleigh also had this in
her video it smells it smells really
good this is DeSapio caramel it smells
like the boom-boom cream so they have
sent me this they have sent me the acai
a body power cream which I kind of like
the boom-boom cream of fuckin love and
then the lip balm as well the
cooper-cooper lip balm I don't know how
to say it anyway this is just one of
those consistencies that kind of weirds
me out now I feel like this is a little
petty but I wanted to go ahead and bring
it up anyway
if you're a little bit of a consistency
snob when it comes to at your shower
gels this kind of feels like shampoo on
your body and for like the $25 Christ
mark I don't feel like it's worth it you
can get something at the drugstore that
will do the same exact thing and will
actually moisturize your skin so they
sold de Janeiro Brazilian foreplay
shower cream gel I would not purchase
with my own money
I love the bumbum cream
this guy right here not so much all
right moving on to pur cosmetics here is
the bear at all 12-hour four and one
skin perfecting foundation there had
been a lot of products from Pier
cosmetics that I have not liked but this
is one of them this is this is a tricky
one so initially it looks very very good
on the skin but it's a thick consistency
you guys you put it on and you feel like
you're putting fucking paint on your
skin it's almost like the Kat Von D
lock-it but it has a little more slip to
it you start blending it in which they
recommend using one of those like
mermaid brushes or like those oval
brushes and you're really pulling right
if you really want to blend this into
your skin and then after a few hours it
just kind of disappears now I believe
Kayleigh really likes this and it seems
to work really well for her skin and I
think my friend Samantha also likes this
but for me dear god this looks like shit
on my skin it really just doesn't look
good initially like I said it looks
absolutely fantastic this shade
porcelain which goes on very dark
actually lightens up a little bit
throughout the day so it kind of
oxidizes the other direction and
initially it looks beautiful but I would
say about five hours and this starts to
wear off I starts got all these little
patches around my nose and my chin and
this does not wear well on my skin and I
would definitely not purchase with my
own money
alright guys moving on to skin food so
skin food has been very good to me now
they are working on it becoming
completely cruelty free so right now I
asked them to take me off their PR list
just because I am not accepting a PR
that is not cruelty free and this was
sent to me probably about eight months
ago before I went cruelty free and this
is the volcanic and egg egg white pour
hot steam pack so and they send me all
their new products or they used to and
when they're cruelty free they will go
ahead and start again and I thought this
was just okay it's not something I would
purchase with my own money skin food
actually has a lot of really unique and
cool products and I believe that all
skin care brands that are Korean are
going to be going cruelty free in 2018
or something like that but if you are
interested in trying out two more Korean
skincare or just Asian skin care
products in general I really do like
skin food but this is just not one of
those products that I feel like is up to
par I believe this goes for fourteen or
fifteen dollars on the ulta.com website
which you might think is a good deal but
compared to their other like rice enzyme
cloths or even like your cucumber
emulsion it's just not worth the money
and it's not something I would purchase
with my own money so that is the
volcanic and egg egg white pour hot
steam pack didn't really notice it did
anything for my blackheads either
if
actually get rid of your blackheads but
you can kind of make them appear smaller
so enough didn't really do anything for
me
and then finally guys I do have some
products here from the balm cosmetics
they recently sent over a really
beautiful PR package and I do like a lot
of products from the balm cosmetics but
I am NOT a fan of this scuba water is
it's ended it that we're on a resistant
mascara I am NOT a fan of the sexy mama
anti-shine transparent powder nor am i a
fan of the balm of your hand volume 2
palette so I guess we'll go ahead and
start with this the reason why I'm not a
fan of this is first of all I mean you
can see I cracked that down there I was
gonna go ahead and repress it which I
will do before I send this to my friend
Brittany but yeah so basically you guys
I don't think that any of these are
similar to the full-size and when I
compare the ingredients it does look
like the ingredients are similar but I
think that these are just pressed really
really firmly normally in the eyeshadow
palette these eyeshadows feel a lot more
smooth and I have full sizes of every
single one of the face products so for
me I just don't think that this is worth
it you're going to be testing out the
products in here thinking that the full
sizes are identical to this and they're
just not and then as far as this guy's
concerned the sexy mama anti-shine
transparent powder incredibly overpriced
for what it actually is it does have a
little bit of a yellow tinge or cast to
it and I just feel like you can get you
know the essence all about matting some
compact powder for $3.99 instead of this
for ten dollars so this is not something
I would purchase with my own money and
then as far as the scuba mascara is
concerned I really liked the wand so and
this is what the wand looks like it
reminds me of the Bobbi Brown
what is it smokey lash mascara which I
have on today and a really nice tight
little bristles packed in there but
unfortunately this is just a really bad
waterproof mascara you guys it is so
hard to get off at the end of the day I
don't like waterproof mascaras because I
feel like they take my goddamn lashes
with them I take off the makeup and it
takes my lashes with them and I'm like I
want those back give them back today but
yeah this is just one of those formulas
that I feel like starts to flake
throughout the day it doesn't build a
lot of volume it doesn't build a lot of
length you're better off just going to
the pool with no mascara because this
just doesn't really show anything on
your lashes so anyway guys those are
some products or some PR products that
were sent to me for PR obviously
that I do not purchase with my own money
if you are a youtuber and you have care
products and that you would not purchase
with your own money I would love to know
down below let me know if you want a
second edition like I said I think I
have enough products to talk about for
at least five of these and let me know
if you would also like me to talk about
PR products that I would purchase with
my own money thank you so much for
joining me guys and I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
