today's video we are talking about
products that are meant to be together
okay
these are makeup products that were
matched in makeup heaven and this is
actually a subscriber requested video
one of my studies asked me if I would
talk a little bit about foundations that
go with certain primers and I
immediately was like that's a great idea
thank you so much for requesting this
video and I really liked the idea
because I know with certain foundations
immediately in my head I'm like gotta go
grab that primer so I know exactly which
ones go together in my opinion which
ones go together really well and I'm
going to share with you guys what I
think are matches made in heaven
so the first match is the maybelline
baby skin instant pore eraser paired
with the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 24
hour foundation I wear the shade 101
classic ivory all of the items will be
listed down below in the description bar
as well if you aren't serious but anyway
this is the first match I love the two
of these together the L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte has a little bit of a matte
consistency so it can be a little hard
to blend and I like the way it goes on
underneath or I mean on top of a silicon
primer because this gives it a lot of
slip and it definitely has silicone and
to method coat in there this is the
first match that they are wonderful
alright the next match I want to talk
about is the Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer in the elect version
paired with the Neutrogena Healthy Skin
liquid makeup of my shade is number come
on what shade are you classic ivory
number 10 so the two of these go
together really really nicely in my
opinion because the Smashbox the light
has that Dometic own feeling to it but
at the same time if you do have combo or
oily skin it's going to keep you matte
and the Neutrogena how these skin does
have a little bit of like a luminous
finish to it so I really like the two of
these pair together if I wear like a
hydrating primer paired with the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin I find that this
just like sinks into my pores so I
really like this little match right here
really really good all right you guys
smashed I want to talk about is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
plus concealer my shade is 0.5 breeze
paired with the Ofra silicone primer gel
this is somewhat new to me and this is
so somewhat new to me and the other day
I was fooling around I matched these
together and I was like yes yes yes yes
all about that life so the Clinique is
really nice it's a very very full
coverage but what I like about it is
that there's actually a little bit of
moisturization in there so you do get a
little bit of like emollient properties
that are gonna keep hydration in so the
over silicone primer gel I thought that
this was going to be very very like
slippery it's not it actually is quite
hydrating and it just makes sure that
you can like put the product on nicely
and blend it out but it really just kind
of extends the wear of your makeup and I
like that it doesn't add too much
hydration into this foundation but I
also like that it's not too slippery to
the point where this foundation is going
to glide off my face so I really enjoy
the two of those together the next match
I want to talk about is the Too Faced
hangover RX replenishing face primer
matched with the L'Oreal visible lift
blur foundation in the shade 2:01 light
ivory so this one has a very like moosie
consistency to it and even for me with
my like combo slash oily skin on the
outer perimeters of my face thick this
can start to actually patch up and kind
of emphasize areas where I do have dry
patches so I really like to pair it with
the Too Faced because they hangover RX
is not only replenishing it's also very
moisturizing so this is just a really
really nice primer I like the way that
the two of these go together I think
they definitely are a match made in
heaven
alright the next match is the Marc
Jacobs genius gel supercharge foundation
in the shade 10 ivory light paired with
the Stila aqua glow I'm gonna say
foundation the Stila a blue glow primer
this one also obviously pairs well with
its sister product which is the aqua
glow foundation but I really love this
stick primer it's very cooling and
hydrating it's just going to extend the
wear of your makeup without leaving
anything slippery on your face it's not
gonna really hydrate your skin but it
does give a little bit of like a
luminous sheen and I find that the Marc
Jacobs foundation gives me a little bit
of a luminous sheen so I like the two of
these paired together if I pair this
Marc Jacobs with a really silicone like
primer it just glides off my face and if
I use something too hydrating is just
going to sink right into my skin so the
two of these go really really nicely
together
alright the next little match we want to
talk about is the Josie Maran
see foundation fluid my shade is dynamic
I like to match this one with the Wet n
Wild coverall primer this is a really
really cheap primer it smells like
Elmer's glue it feels like Elmer's glue
but I'm telling ya it is just a makeup
where extender it is not going to leave
some sort of silicone like slipperiness
on your face it's not going to hydrate
your skin and I think that's perfect
with this particular foundation this
particular foundation has our motto
Island it's like it's filled with argan
oil so for me personally having like
combo to oily skin I have to be careful
not to mix this with a hydrating primer
because it's just gonna be too much on
my face and also it will slip right off
my face if I use it with the Dometic own
primer so I highly recommend buying
frenzy if you do want to match this with
something finding a primer that
definitely has just like makeup
extending properties to it like it's not
gonna do too much except extend the wear
of your makeup I just find that it
matches really really well with this and
it helps so that did the argon like oil
in here doesn't start to break up in my
t-zone throughout the day so I love
those two together they next match I
want to talk about is the bombs time
bomb face primer matched with the
superstay better skin skin transforming
foundation from Maybelline
my shade is number 10 porcelain these
have very very similar consistencies to
them which is why I think they match so
well together the Maybelline has
definitely a little bit of a mousse
equality to it so if you do have dry
skin I highly recommend going in with
like a really nice like oil or a really
nice moisturizer before putting this on
your face but I'm gonna like the way
that these two match this is kind of
like half makeup extender half silicone
primer so it definitely has some slip to
it but at the same time it's just going
to lock in the foundation on your face
so I really like the two of these
together the next smash I want to talk
about if you want that glowy complexion
well let me tell you the Becca backlight
priming filter or the priming yeah
that's really priming filter primer
whatever third with a Laura Mercier
candle blow soft luminous foundation my
shade is shale by the waves these are so
beautiful together like if I'm just
having a really like normal skin sort of
day and I really want to glow first of
all this gives maybe you
sort of like silvery luminescence to the
skin and then when you pair it with like
serum or even just a water foundation
that like the laura mercier one it's so
beautiful on the skin so I really like
the two of these together if you do have
dry skin and you really want to be glowy
and like you know shine like a goddess
highly recommend checking the two of
those palettes all right the next
pairing or the next match I want to talk
about is the YSL Touche Club primer with
the Kat Von D lucky' tattoo foundation I
will only use this primer with this
foundation this is like pure cement
going onto your skin if you use
something too hydrating you're still not
going to be able to blend it very well
and if you use something that's just
going to extend the wear of your makeup
you're still not going to be able to
blend it well on your skin even for me
with my like combo oily skin I need
something that is filled with the mecca
cone for this to be able to blend well
whether I'm blending it with my fingers
which I don't advise with this
particular foundation or with like a
brush I need this primer now I will tell
you guys right away the abilene baby
skin instant pore eraser is they dupe
for this so you don't need this one this
one's very expensive but I still do like
it's because it's pretty and it smells
good I don't know I'm a girl but that's
the way I see things but anyway I love
the way the two of these go together
this is the only primer that I really
can wear like you know I can really only
wear this foundation when I have this
primer on because I feel like I can
blend it into my skin I have more time
to work with it which is so so important
it's the same thing with like the estee
lauder double wear or the Revlon
Colorstay you put it on your face and
it's like girl you got a button that
right away or also it's just going to
dry down immediately I feel like I have
more time to blend this foundation out
when I use it with the tushy class so I
love the two of these together they are
a match made in heaven
and they last pairing I want to talk
about are the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation which is my all-time
favorite foundation my shade is fair
beige and I like to pair it with they
feel at the moment anti-aging ultra
hydrating sensory make me prior serums
but a such a long name but this is a
beautiful primer very very hydrating if
you do want to try out the Tarte and
foundation in you're worried that it's
going to stick onto dry patches on your
face if you do have dry skin I hide
recommend checking out the it's primer
this one works a lot better with this
foundation than the white one I have
both of them but this one is a lot more
hydrating I really really enjoy this I
use the smallest amount I let it sink in
for about 5 minutes then I go in I can
literally put five layers of this on and
it will not kick up on the outer
perimeters of my face like it looks
amazing so I really love the two of
those together they are definitely a
match made in a makeup heaven alright
guys those are all of my foundation plus
primers soul mates I hope you enjoyed
this video let me know which foundations
and primers you like to pair it together
down below in the comment section and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
