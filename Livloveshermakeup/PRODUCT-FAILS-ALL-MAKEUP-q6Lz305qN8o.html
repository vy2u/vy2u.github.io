have another video for you guys today
and this time we are talking about
makeup products that just are pieces of
 okay let's just let's just say how
it is but we are going to be talking
about product fails I do have a playlist
for this I think this is my third video
that I've done now normally I do talk
about like different beauty products but
today we're just talking about makeup I
have enough but like I'm ready to
declutter so anyway I will link at the
playlist down below if you want to see
the other ones but let's go ahead and
get started
obviously I hate that I have to put a
disclaimer on this but just because it
doesn't work for me doesn't mean it
won't work for you so if you love these
products I think that's great I'm not
trying to bash them in any way shape or
form I'm just telling you that they
didn't work for me alright so the first
two items that did not work for me we're
these Catrice liquid metal eyeshadows
the first one i have here is in the
shade zero one zero look me in the ice
and this is what they look like you do
get three grams of product in here which
is quite a bit for obviously a single
eyeshadow these just have a huge amount
of overspray on them I do have two of
them and this one right here is called
what do you see I really like the names
but here is what they look like as you
can see they have a lot of overspray I
hate products that have overspray like
why why why have overspray and honestly
these just go on really really chalky
they're very very pigmented but they
just they have so much fallout they're
very very messy to work with definitely
not a favorite of mine and definitely
something I would not recommend for you
guys to pick up hold I'm trying to grab
a makeup wipe here alright so those were
the first two items the next item is the
old Kat Von D locket tattoo concealer so
she has her new formulation which is
badass I love it but this particular one
would be like a shade in the old
formulation this is light 16 I just
self-tans last night and you guys see
the difference there it's ridiculous
this was so dark now I could try mixing
it together with the white concealer
that I have from her but honestly I felt
like this one dried down like cement
it's not as beautiful as the new
formulation so I'm obviously gonna
declutter that and it was a makeup fail
for me alright next we have a few
lipsticks here these are from Maybelline
so these are the ones that come in these
colorful tubes these lipsticks do not
work for me so the first one I have here
is called 420 deepest cherry I feel like
these are just not very pigmented at all
they barely stay on my lips
they look pretty when you swatch them
out but they're slightly sheer and then
also this one was from the bold
collection this particular sheet right
here is called grey over it this is the
only one that I do like I wanted to show
you guys like the actual like
pigmentation difference so I like this
one over that one I feel like the other
ones very very sheer but from the same
bold line there was this like wickedly
white shade and also a sapphire shade
it's just super super like interesting
colors that I wanted to play with but
honestly like even trying to mix this in
with a lipstick it just doesn't work it
looks like it's super super dry and
I don't know they're just very sheer and
strange so I don't like any of those I
feel like I will not be picking up any
sort of Maybelline lipsticks that come
in those colorful tubes the only ones I
seem to like are at the matte
formulations like I love what's it
called not pumpkin spice you know that
spice shade you guys know what I'm
talking about tell me in the comments
section that beautiful beautiful spice
shade that everybody wears during the
fall time I do like that but like the
more colorful tubes
besides the Vivid's collection I can't
think of any that I actually enjoy
alright moving on I have two lippies
here from wet and wild so I do like two
that I got so I got four of them I had
like the lilac color and they like pink
but these two right here are so drying
and patchy these are the Wet n Wild
Velvet Matte lip crayons the first sheet
is called eight three six three
hickory-smoked which looks like this and
it's just so so so drying very very
patchy kind of chunky looking can you
guys see that really really strange
definitely don't like that and then this
one right here is called a 364 cherry
charred and it looks like this so
they're very very like I said just very
patchy very very drying on the lips it's
weird because the formulation on the
other two I have is like impeccable very
beautiful really like those but these
are a fail I also have this L'Oreal
lipstick this is from doats and Dustin
Crowe as you guys know who she is she's
that Victoria's Secret model she came
out with this pink color and it does
nothing it literally does nothing there
is the shade it's like a really really
light kind of like silvery lilac II like
pink color and it doesn't show up I
don't like it I don't know if it's meant
to be a sheer formulation in the
commercial it was all like oh like you
know beautiful wash of pigments and I'm
just like what the hell is this so I
don't like that definitely going to go
ahead and let that go is definitely a
makeup fail also my steal of lip glazes
I recently
about these in my little inside my
collection video which I probably will
be doing more of those videos in the
future but I want to make sure I can
swatch everything for you guys but
anyway this is what they look like
they're so shitty it took me a year to
actually realize that I don't want these
in my collection they're very goopy if I
would never pick any of these up with my
own money but if for some reason I can't
one that's like in a holiday kit I guess
I could just declutter it but yeah I'm
getting rid of these and I'm tossing
them I'm not going to frickin give these
to people because look how gunky they
get once you start to use them it's so
disgusting I would wipe this down I
would wipe the cap down the lip brush is
gross I just I don't like them I don't
like them so I do not like that product
um let's see here a morphe concealer
let's just talk about the two products
from morphe so I don't like morphe
makeup but I think I've talked about
that before I'm just not a fan I don't
know what it is none of their makeup
really impresses me this was the morphe
concealer in the shade khaki also I got
another color and can't find where it is
but I'm decluttering these they're just
not good quality they're very very cheap
and I don't mean like cheap quality what
kind of cheap quality but I mean in
price they were very very cheap but
that's what they look like nothing
special and everybody was like put on my
face and I'm just like why why do we
hype up these brands like I understand
that like one of my favorite eyeshadow
brands violet boss he's definitely like
a hyped up Instagram brand but I feel
like their products worked for me the
makeup products from morphe never work
for me and the next for the next fail
that i want to talk about is the Jaclyn
hill favorites palette and every time I
talk about this somebody literally wants
to kill me in the comments section
I'm not subscribed to Jaclyn hill I
don't watch her videos and it's not for
the reasons that you think okay I don't
watch her because she's very very hyper
kind of like me and it makes me feel out
of my skin and also she does a lot of
tutorials I'm more of like a beauty
lifestyle channel I like like favorites
videos review stuff like that and she
doesn't do that much of those videos so
not not insulting her personally and
just because I don't like her palette
doesn't mean that I think she's a
horrible person I just personally don't
follow her on you know YouTube and I
don't know I I came across one video of
her as I saw her using this and I was
like I need it I need it I need it I got
it and I was like what what is that
smell how can this smell literally like
I literally every time I put this on my
eyes I literally smell it for like three
hours and I'm not even trying to be like
really really crazy right now I'm being
my own guy that's so horrible this is I
don't like this palette I do not like
the way it smells now there are a few
shades in here like this foiled like
orange shade and this one right here
which is a nice creamy matte that I do
like but I can't get over that smell and
I just no no no so yeah I'm not a huge
fan of more if you make up products in
general I probably will not purchase
anymore I just don't like them I love
their brushes let me just put that out
there absolutely adore their brushes but
their makeup products I have just I
don't I don't like it
alright moving on I have at this Melissa
OTT revamp lipstick here this is what it
looks like and I'm just gonna show you
guys did those look the same do those
look the same I thought this was going
to be a deep cherry color and obviously
as you guys can see it's like a pinky
color not much to say about that it's
just like false advertising
the next is the Too Faced the power of
makeup by Niki tutorial I am going to
declutter this to a friend originally I
was going to return it but I think that
if you are a makeup artist or very very
good at makeup you can get this to work
I am neither of those and I just feel
like this was so hard to work with so
hard to blend not my kind of thing I
don't like the you know what is it
called the glitter dust in here I don't
like that the sketch marker I can't use
because I can't do a wing for so
this is just not the right kit for me I
thought it would be but it's not so I am
going to pass this on to my friend
Jessica who's really good at makeup and
then finally I have this Smashbox on the
rocks photo op eyeshadow luxe palette
and not even gonna lie guys I bought
this because of the packaging look at it
it's so beautiful I have like a cushiony
feel right here and not very travel
friendly if you think about it you do
have a mirror and the inside is gorgeous
as well but these are not a good
formulation in my opinion I heard Emily
Noelle eighty-three talking about the
photo op formulation and how she liked
it and I really wanted to get I think
this is the first item I have picked up
something that I have not liked the
Emily Noelle 83 recommended she usually
has just spot-on recommendations but
this was not a good palette I don't like
the formulation they're very very hard
to blend it very like crispy to the
touch I'm gonna be declaring that so
anyways those are some makeup fails like
I said
nothing against you if you do like these
items if you do like morphe or whatever
I do like morphe as a brand as well I
just don't like their makeup products
but yeah
none of these works for me they are
definitely being decluttered when I do
my declutter series in October and yeah
I hope you enjoyed this video thanks so
much for joining me guys and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
