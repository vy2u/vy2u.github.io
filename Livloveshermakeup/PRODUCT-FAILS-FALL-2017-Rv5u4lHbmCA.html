welcome back to my channel or should I
welcome myself back I know I have been
gone all week the reason for that was
because I was traveling I have quite a
few travel plans this month as well as
next month so I'm gonna make sure that I
kind of go ahead and do some pre filming
for you guys but anyway I am back and
today I've wanted to do a product sales
video I have not done one of these
videos in five to six months so there
are a lot of products to talk about if
you don't like videos like this don't
watch I can never understand why people
who hate me talking about products I
don't like I can never understand why
they even watch this video in the first
place
yeah I'm going to be shit-talking some
of these products if you don't like that
don't what okay so anyway let's
go ahead and jump right into it fold
this claim of some of these products
were sent to me for key are and some of
them I did purchase myself these are
just products that didn't work out for
me and just because I pick up your
all-time favorite product and I say it's
a piece of and I hate it
doesn't mean I'm saying that you are a
piece of and that I hate you I love
you okay it's just this product didn't
work for me so anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it we're gonna start
with some products from Becca watch yeah
okay we're gonna start with some
products from Becca the first one I have
here is the velvet blurring of primer
now this particular shade is called
apricot haze which makes me believe
this taken their status called apricot
cave which makes me believe that they
are going to be going ahead and creating
new shades of this which I don't really
understand you can see it does come out
an apricot color but once you rub it
into the skin it fully absorbs and it
doesn't change the color of your skin
tone so anyway this is supposed to be
like a silicon-based sort of primer but
it really isn't that smooth or slippery
it goes from like a liquid to a powder
and honestly this looks like
 on my skin it looks horrendous I
feel like if you do have normal or dry
skin you need to moisturize incredibly
well before even attempting to put this
 on your face because it looks very
dry and it kind of just makes your hand
and your skin in general feel like
sandpaper and I don't like that now I
did not notice any sort of longevity as
far as my makeup is concerned like how
long it kind of least my makeup on
throughout the day I didn't notice any
sort of increase in longevity so I
like for me I'm just dropping
everywhere I just feel like for me this
really good we didn't do anything I know
a lot of people are liking this I was
very very hyped up to go ahead and try
it out but unfortunately it's just not
for me alright next we have another
product here from Becca this is the soft
light blurring powder in pink haze I
love this I love this aesthetic
if I was a powder this would probably be
me you open it up it kind of has shitty
packaging even though it looks really
pretty it doesn't really make sense
until I crack the lid then pull up you
guys can see it doesn't have a sifter or
anything like that so it does get
everywhere now one of you were joking
around with me on Instagram saying that
this looks like pepto-bismol on
your face and girl I agree this is
straight-up pink and it really really
looks pink on your complexion so if you
are lighter than me if you have my skin
tone this is not going to work for you
I'm gonna go ahead and declutter this to
my friend Senora who does have a deeper
complexion she really wanted to try this
to set her under-eye and I think that it
would be absolutely gorgeous on her but
for me it was not it also has this
really really grainy consistency to it I
know a lot of people are saying oh and
such a smooth powder I don't feel that
way at all it doesn't feel smooth to me
it doesn't feel like a nice silky silica
sort of powder I don't like it I know
it's supposed to be a finishing powder
not an under-eye powder but it makes my
skin look big so this is not for
me I know they have another shade that's
called nude but that one would probably
be too dark as well so come on Becca I
love you you know I love you this is
such a great brand but I hope that you
come out with more shades of this so
that people can try it out and on top of
that I mean for 10 grams of product I
didn't even think the pattern was that
spectacular so I probably wouldn't
purchase anyway if they did come out
with new shades but I know a lot of
people have been too curious about this
I didn't notice any sort of blurring
effects I can notice that it did really
anything so least you products here from
Becca are an utter fail for me
alright I actually have a third and
fourth products here from back on hey
you guys know Becca is a brand that I've
been incredibly loyal to okay but this
guy right here which is called the Edgar
matte shine proof foundation these are
horrible if you do have obviously normal
to dry skin now I know that these aren't
technically made for my skin type so I
don't want to really complain that much
but I will say even when I did have very
very combo oily skin and I tried out the
ever matte primer it was still too much
for me I mean their ever matte it's
completely ever massive
Kalil on your face if you do have
incredibly incredibly oily skin I could
see this working for you I'm gonna go
ahead and declutter it's my friend
Brittany who does have very very oily
skin but for me this was just a no-go if
you do have normal to dry skin this is
more of like a warning don't even try
these okay it's too much it's too much
all right guys moving on to some stuff
from Burt's Bees that I recently picked
up from CVS first one is this little
piece of is the second one is this
a little piece of and the third one
you guessed it is this little piece of
 so I'm going into the makeup
removing aisle and trying to find
something that's cruelty free that can
remove my makeup if I'm traveling or
something like that I don't know why I
keep going back to Burt's Bees facial
cleansing towelettes
I will not purchase these again I know a
lot of people say that they don't
irritate their skin and that they're
very very nice but for me the normal to
dry skin cucumber and sage as well as
the normal skin with white tea extract
were way too drying on my skin they
didn't cause irritation which I do a
probe of and I do enjoy okay I like that
they didn't cause irritation because
we've all been there with makeup remover
wipes where we put them on our face and
our face turns bright red and we're like
well that was a bad idea these
don't do that however I really don't
feel like they are that soft they really
don't have that much moisture to them I
feel like if I'm gonna use the makeup
remover why I like it to be sopping wet
okay I'd like you to remove all my
makeup hopefully with one wife I had to
use like four or five of these to get my
whole face off which I guess proves that
I wear a lot of makeup but still four to
five it's way too much so won't
be producing these anymore from Burt's
Bees they were just not worth it and
then carrot happy I makeup remover pads
these have keep me extract no fragrance
added 35 different pads I should have
known when I watched these in my friend
Kate Lee's empties video but these were
gonna be
she said that they weren't horrible but
they also weren't good they really
weren't good it's true I mean they have
this nice soft pillowy sort of texture
to them and actually they're quite big
so you can use one for each eye I'm
sorry one for both eyes but
unfortunately these really didn't remove
makeup all that well I feel like I have
to go to two to three for each guy and
they were quite expensive so I'm not
going to purchase those ever again
alright guys let's move on to some
products from the balm cosmetics
recently
the loan Cosmetics did send over some
products for me to try out I want to do
a best and worst of the balm cosmetics
because there's a lot of products that I
have in my collection from over the
years that I've also purchased myself
but these guys right here just did not
work out for me I'm like a lot of
products I'm like seventy three percent
or 75% of the products that I have from
the balm cosmetics but this first guy
right here which is called the scuba
water resistant black mascara really was
just horrible I mean this really really
kind of flakes throughout the day and
you would think because it is they
wanted proof mascara that wouldn't
happen but it does and also when I take
it off at night it takes all my
eyelashes with it that's why I don't
like waterproof mascaras okay because I
put it on I take it off and it takes on
with the idea of eyelashes too and I'm
like buh-bye pal why you got to be like
that so I'm actually pretty excited
initially because this one actually
reminds me a lot of the Bobbi Brown
smoky lash mascara now that is a
fantastic fantastic natural bristle worn
with a lot of little tiny bristles kind
of packed in there but unfortunately
this was just it was just not good and I
was very very surprised that it did
start to flake throughout the day I can
understand why waterproof mascaras do
get a little dry on the eye area and do
start to come off a little bit towards
the end of the day but like within 30
minutes this was starting to come off it
doesn't build a lot of volume it doesn't
give a lot of length it's nothing
special I would recommend just going to
the drugstore and getting yourself
like the covergirl LashBlast or some
 in a waterproof mascara form if you
want it because although this has really
cute packaging you really do nothing I
read up next to get these sexy mama
anti-shine transparent powder this is
something that used to work for me I
purchased it with my own money back in
college I believe and it was really
really nice for my complet to oily skin
but now it just feels dry it doesn't
look good on the skin it's not a setting
powder this is definitely one of those
powders that you would use to touch up
throughout the day if you're getting
oily in your t-zone
it used to work for me but I'm just not
oily in my t-zone anymore so it didn't
really work for me not a horrible thing
it's not like a horrible product okay
it's just it didn't personally work for
me and then finally we have the in the
bottom of your hand volume 2 greatest
hits palettes
this is kind of like their holiday
palette that they released this year
unfortunately I dropped mine and frat
boy had a little bit of a crack as you
can see now I own all of these in at
full sizes and I have to say these are
just not comparable to the full size
especially mary-lou manizer if you're
thinking that you're gonna buy this
palette and you're going to be getting
what you would get in a full size and
you want to test out and sample some of
these I don't think they're the same I'm
sorry I've looked and compared the
ingredients list and I don't know if
it's just because they've been pressing
certain things firmer or what's going on
here but the instinct Baloch this is
really really firmly press especially
mary-lou manizer doesn't feel anything
like the full-size down boy blush Bahama
Mama and even these eyeshadows here
really don't feel like what you would
get in the palette so this is not
something that I would recommend to you
guys they know a lot of people were
excited about this palette but it's not
anything that I think is comfortable to
the full size so if you're hoping to try
this out because you want to get a full
size product and you don't know which
one you want again just go onto like a
flash sale website like whole look or
something like that I'll go ahead and
pin it to the top in the comment section
go ahead and go into like whole look and
see if you can get something for 30 to
50% off because although this is a nice
concept it really is just not the same
as these full-sized products alright
guys I'm moving on we have a product
here from actually two products here
from Catrice cosmetics the first one is
the nude blossom collection eyeshadow
palette and the second is the Catrice
cosmetics highlighting powder and
champagne campaign so Jif a campaign
isn't horrible I actually really like
this color it looks like it would be a
little more like a pinky color kind of
comes off more as like a peachy
iridescent color it does smell like
cocoa which is kind of cool everybody's
getting into that even if the drugstore
brands and I really do like Catrice
cosmetics in general but I will say I
feel like I really really have to pick
this up with a brush and actually layer
it onto my skin I am the kind of girl
it's either I am wearing highlighter and
like literally I'm a beacon of
light for the astronauts in outer space
or I'm wearing no highlighter so I don't
like something that I have to build up
on my skin it's not a bad formula it's
not a bad product it's just not for me
and then this guy right here that Newton
blossoms collection eyeshadow palette
this reminds me of kids makeup
it's like kids makeup this is like a $5
99-cent ice shadow palette these three
shades right here actually make for a
beautiful highlight but overall these
are chalky they are actually they are
hard to blend not easy to work with and
if you aren't child I mean I feel like
you would have a difficult time working
with this as well because I have a
difficult time working with it I have no
professional when it comes to makeup the
Jesus this is really really hard to
blend so I would not recommend this to
you guys that was not definitely not
worth the money
are we moving on and we have the wet and
wild a limited edition mega liners from
the wet and wild
midnight mermaid collection so we have
three different shades here the first
one is called trident
what does this trident shiver this one
right here is called sea dreams and then
this one right here is called sea
symmetry I'm not really a liquid liner
kind of girl but I did attempt with
these and I did try and sometimes I do
wear a baby weight okay not on camera
but sometimes I do it now when I'm
performing on stage these are very very
streaky I don't feel like they go on
very nicely whatsoever and I don't feel
like the colors really are true true to
the shade so you've had a look at this
and you would think it would be a
beautiful beautiful kind of emerald
green shade you put it on and it's just
kind of like this dark muddy color with
a little bit of shimmer running through
it same goes for this midnight blue
shade and same goes for this smoky gray
color so I didn't think that these were
any good I know the black one which I do
have in a full size it's actually quite
good and if I do want to do a baby wing
I will wear that on stage but these guys
right here we're just really really
patchy and they didn't go on very nicely
I wasn't a fan so yeah completely cover
those up next we have the julep lip oil
I really wanted to love this because I
love lip oils this is called the tinted
lip oil treatment in covet and I like
the overall concept and don't like the
smell this is like the most atrocious
smell I've ever had for some sort of a
lip boil but also it's so thin it
doesn't feel moisturizing on the lips it
gives a little bit of shine in a little
bit of color but it does wear off within
I would say 25 to 30 minutes and for me
personally it's just not worth it it
kind of runs me of like the Lancome
juicy shaker's so not a fan of that guy
right there up next we have our products
here from glossier this is the cloud
paint seamless cheek color in beam I
wanted to love this I kind of knew I
bought it to be completely honest
because I'm not really a cream blush
kind of girl
but this is what it looks like when you
get it out on the hand it's beautiful
very very pigmented but unfortunately
this looks very dry and patchy on my
skin and you would think that it
wouldn't because it's like a true cream
it's a gorgeous color I love this shade
bean but unfortunately it does that
thing where you know how your foundation
starts to look horrible at the end of
the day and it starts to get a little
patchy especially if you do have normal
to dry skin and then you just see like
chunks of the color gone that's
basically what happens with this it also
doesn't stay on my skin very long so if
you do have a more competent oily skin I
think that this would just wear right
off your skin because even for me with
my normal to dry it wears right off so
and not a fan of that guy up next we
have a pram primer here from advance say
this is the mattifying emulsion and
t-shir I used to really really enjoy
this this is more like a product I've
changed my mind about and this used to
be a product that I enjoyed when I did
have combo to oily skin but now it's
just way too mattifying it's not as
mattifying as the Becca ever matte
primer like I said if you need something
that is going to literally glue your
 foundation onto your skin for
the whole entire day go for that but for
this guy it just it's still a little too
dry and it kinda reminds me a little bit
of the back of blurring primer except it
doesn't have like that silicone base
feel the back up luring primers are so
strange because it goes on kind of like
soft and beautiful and then it just
turns to a powder and it's just it's too
much for my skin but I would recommend
this if you do have more calm belief
skin it's just kind of a product I
personally changed my mind about it and
then finally I have two little deluxe
sizes here that I wanted to talk about
as well this is the symphony beauty snow
cream moisturizer I wanted to love
everything about this it's the coolest
 thing ever it literally is like
this like jelly okay I mean this is
goals this is cool if I wear a cream
this is what I would want to be okay it
literally is like a bouncy kind of jelly
and I just think the consistency is so
cool but once you actually start to rub
it in on your face I don't know if you
guys can tell but it starts to pill
I hate when pills on my
face okay because then it takes away
from everything that you're about to put
on your skin so if your moisturizer or
your primer starts to peel you are
royally you are screwed okay it's
the most annoying thing in the world
I've tried putting on a little ass have
tried putting on more it pills no matter
what it feels nice and cooling and it
smells like a orgasm but it's
just not good it's just not good okay
it's just not a good product
I don't like it would not recommend to
you guys and finally we have the Ola
Henrickson uplifting transformation eye
cream I've got an allergic reaction to
this which is very interesting because I
actually really like the I'm shel from
this particular line but this guy was
just too much for me if basically
there's thick cream you kind of get it
on your eyes and then you start to feel
this tingling sensation you're like oh
my god it's working
it's not working you have an allergic
reaction there is the difference between
oh my god it feels like it's working if
a product is starting to make your face
tingle or sting it doesn't mean it's
working and means that your skin doesn't
 like it okay and this was just
one of those products that didn't do so
well and I really really irritated my
eye area so anyway guys that is it happy
Sunday thanks for joining me hope you
enjoyed this video and yeah I guess I'll
see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
