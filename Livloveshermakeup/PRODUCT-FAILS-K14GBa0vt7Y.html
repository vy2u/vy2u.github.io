thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be a product fails
video and I have about 15 minutes to
film this so I'm going to try to get
through this as quickly as possible let
me know down below if you would like to
see swatches on any of the items that I
show you guys and I can go ahead and
post that on either my blog or I will
post it on my Instagram and yeah let's
pretty much get right into it these are
just items that have not been working
out for me recently I do have a whole
entire playlist dedicated to this
subject matter that I will go ahead and
link down below in the description bar
if you would like to check it out
but this today basically we're going
through makeup and also we're going
through a little bit of skincare mostly
makeup the last video I did was all
makeup but yeah let's go ahead and get
into it I feel like I need to say
something else oh yes
it disclaimer I feel like this is just
common knowledge but you would be
surprised how many people go after me if
I don't say this so just because
something doesn't work for me does not
mean that it won't work for you guys
just because I hold up your all-time
favorite blush and I say I think it's a
piece of does not mean that I am
saying I think you are a piece of
okay I know that a lot of people do get
upset over these videos because I think
I get a little worked up I want to
assure you guys me getting worked up
over these products is simply because I
bought them and I feel like I wasted my
money so it has nothing to do with you
guys alright okay so let's go ahead and
get right into it the first item I want
to talk about is the Ute artist pro glow
palette so I was originally going to do
a full review and swatches on this and
then I want you to a lupus flare up and
I didn't have time but I'm going to try
and give you guys a little mini rundown
on this right now so the first thing
that I do not like about this I mean
literally where do we start oh we're
going to start with packaging the first
thing I do not like is the fact that it
does have that NARS packaging is that
rubbered packaging where all your
fingerprints are left all over it I also
don't like that even though it opens up
like this which I do think is cute kind
of like a little closet door it means
that I also opens up like this because
you have that magnetic thing going on so
I was in my car I think the second week
that I had this and I put it in my purse
I went like this in the car for whatever
reason something slipped against it and
I had a freaking pen that went in and
just gouged out the cream contour shade
you guys will see that in a second so if
you do want to travel with this which I
feel like it's kind of meant to be a
travel palette go ahead and put a piece
of tape over it and
last thing that I want to mention as far
as packaging is concerned is the fact
that they do have let's see here five
different powder products in here and
they give you a cream contour down here
right guess what there's no protective
flap
I hate when brands do that I don't know
if they just think we're stupid and we
won't notice but this is supposed to be
a matte cream contour the last thing
that I want is all of this shimmery
powdery highlight right here to go in
there and completely ruin it so you guys
can see it's a little gouged out from
the pen there and then maybe you can see
I don't know if the camera will pick it
up but there is definitely some shimmery
stuff in there and it's just so stupid
because it's like I don't understand
because now you have this stupid
highlight right here mixing in here and
I just wanted a nice cream contour shade
so anyway speaking of that cream contour
shade this has these Strange's undertone
ever it has a little bit of a green
undertone and I don't think it's
flattering on any single any single skin
tone honestly it's not flattering on my
skin tone which for reference I'm
anywhere between an NC 10 and NC 15 at
Mac I do not think it's flattering on
medium skin tones I tried it out of my
mom and I also don't think it's
flattering on super super deep skin
tones my friend has a really beautiful
dark chocolatey complexion it looks
really horrible on her as well so even
if you do have a warm undertone or a
cool undertone this is just a very
strange cream contouring product these
two highlights right here which are
called lit and fire have a lot of
chunkiness to them as you guys can
probably see even just rubbing in there
you guys can probably tell it picks up
way too much product at once and I think
they were trying to go down like that
Anasazi of Beverly Hills route where you
have that really nice like creaminess
and then it goes ahead and it does like
a foiled finish but I think that these
just look chunky on the skin and it may
look pretty and it may look like it's
metallus eyes but once you put it on
your face you get a lot of emphasis on
fine lines wrinkles texture things like
that so those two shades right there are
not that great if you are fair
complected like me and you're hoping
that this is going to be a true
highlight shade on you well guess what
it is going to be but unfortunately this
one does not have the same sort of
finish as the others as this one has
chunks of glitter in it and I'm just
like damn it you know as someone who has
a fair complexion that is the one true
highlight shade in here and it literally
has
visible chunks the glitter in it so that
is kind of a bummer as well the only two
good products in here in my opinion are
these two I'm going to declutter this
but I'm gonna probably depop these two
so I don't know multi pot this but
definitely this this is the gorgeous
gorgeous metallic eyes highlighter this
is what I wish the whole entire palette
was like it's very reminiscent of the
Tarte exposed highlight but none of the
other ones in here are likely tart
exposed so that goes on beautiful really
really nice and metallus ties foiled
gorgeous but ya know the others go on
like that and then the actual bronze are
down here like I said reminds me of the
chocolate Soleil bronzer really nice
creamy soft matte color or matte
consistency and color so yeah I mean I
think that this palette overall for $45
is not worth the money if you do have a
medium to dark complexion I do think
most of these shades would work on you
as an actual highlight you can still use
them to give your skin like a nice glow
if you are fair complected like me but I
would recommend just going ahead and
saving that extra five dollars picking
up an honest hacia Beverly Hills glow
kit because a lot of these do not look
flattering on the actual skin alright
moving on the next item we have here is
from josie maran this is the Nirvana
hydrating treatment mess this is the
suprema skin bolused
it is a beautiful beautiful little lid I
love the sprayer or the nozzle and I do
love the bottle but I have tried to be a
good girl and use this up but I don't
think I can do it anymore you guys I'm
going to go ahead and toss this in the
empties bin for the month it just really
really makes my skin feel itchy and dry
and I get little rashes on my face after
I use this I don't know what it is
it obviously is probably something in
the ingredients list but I'm guessing I
feel like there's a little bit of
alcohol in here because anytime it has
gotten into like my nose area or my eye
area or in my mouth by accident is burns
like it really burns so very strange for
josie maran to have alcohol in her
ingredients like I said I don't know
completely if that is true but I don't
not think that this is a good facial
mist definitely go ahead and check out
the shore leaked rose water balancing
mist if you have more combination to
oily skin and you want a good a facial
best all right the next item that has
not been working out for me recently is
the two-faced peppermint mocha palette
this was from the little holiday
Christmas in New York the Grand Hotel
cafe set now I really like the other two
palettes that came the eggnog latte and
also the gingerbread cookie palettes I
am actually wearing the gingerbread
cookie on my
today really really adore that palette
really adore both of the others but this
one honestly just was not the same kind
of quality these shadows were very very
dry and chalky and not very pigmented I
will show you guys some swatches I'm
sorry if I'm kind of hurting along today
guys I'm already running late for work
but there are some swatches as you guys
can see you definitely can get them to
blend but it just takes a little more
effort I would highly recommend foiling
these so that they're a little more
in-your-face like wham bam in your face
but yeah I don't feel like the
pigmentation is there I feel like they
are a little harder to blend out and
they're definitely not comparable to
like Andy chocolate bar palettes but I
will say that the blush down there is
absolutely stunning I'm very tempted to
do pot that but I've already told a
friend that I'm giving this to her I'm
decluttering it to her and that would be
rude for me to take out the blush and be
like oh here here in the eyeshadow so
anyway that was definitely fail for me
and also this little Tarte palette here
this is from last year's holiday
collection it is magnetic and I thought
it was super super cute really really
weak packaging here guys you guys know
I'm not really that into a tarte holiday
kits I feel like a lot of them are made
cheaply in China so there is no mirror
here but I just fell in love with these
shades look at those shades I feel like
Tarte is one of those brands that just
does neutral colors very very well but
unfortunately these are just very dry
and chalky they do not blend well like
this dark color down here forget at
these like purpley shades they look so
horrible like when you work them into
the crease or even the outer V it just
looks like it I mean it looks like
someone punched you in the eye and you
can't blend it out seriously and then
over here on the other side we have some
more neutrally colors again really
stunning and beautiful to look at but
most of these colors just start to
muddle into one another they don't look
pretty on the eyes and they're very
difficult to blend so that has been a
fail as well I do have some mascara from
skin-food skinfood did send me these
these are just not good quality you guys
I talked about them in my honest PR
reviews video I will link that down
below if you guys would like to check it
out I have another one coming up on
Friday as well but their sheet masks are
just a little too thick I think the
actual texture of the cloth is just too
thick I don't feel like it pushes the
product into my skin I feel like it
starts to fall off my face so I do not
like these this one right here is called
Beauty berry and this one is orange I
did use up let's see here the green tea
one and the tomato one the one thing I
will say that I
is that they do leave your skin nice and
soft but there's definitely better
facemask out there try the Tony moly
ones or The Secret Garden ones alright
moving on this is the Urban Decay Naked
flush palette in the shade in native
this is a little trio of a blush a
bronzer and a highlight I don't know why
I purchased this you guys I feel so
stupid because I have this already in
the Urban Decay Naked on the Run palette
which I love the Urban Decay Naked on
the run is gorgeous you get five
different eyeshadows you get a lip gloss
and eye liner and also a mascara which
I've already used up but you do get
these same exact shades up here you get
that bronzer that highlight and that
blush so why on earth I felt like I
needed to purchase a backup of those
shades I have no idea why so I will be
decluttering this I'm pretty sure I
bought it because it went on sale for
$15 at Sephora and I think that's really
the only time that people were talking
very highly of these was when they went
on sale so I would not pick this up I
think that the bronzer is a little too
warm toned for me I do have a cool
complexion I don't think the highlight
is anything special and the blush is
just kind of pretty but yeah not that
great of quality so definitely
decluttering those these are brand new
to me these are the Shea Moisture super
fruit multi vitamin removal facial wipes
you will see me talk about these
tomorrow in my Ulta follow up haul these
are so shitty these are probably the
worst makeup removing wipes I've ever
used on my face
they are extremely extremely dry you
guys there's just no moisture there and
it really makes me sad because the Shea
Moisture brand is beautiful I love a lot
of their products but yeah I would not
recommend checking out their new facial
whites if you were curious about them I
just think that the actual cloth
although the cloth is nice and it's like
a soft texture I will say they're very
very very thin and you need probably
five or six of these to take off a full
face of makeup because they really do
not have that much moisture there so I
will use them for removing swatches I
also did notice that these leftie very
very strange oily residue on my face so
something to look into definitely let us
know down below if maybe you have tried
out one of the other different scents or
flavors and let us know if they were any
good but these ones are not I also want
to talk about this little guy I used to
love this palette and I think it's
important to update you guys on products
that I used to love that maybe I don't
like anymore these oh these are good not
sleek you guys
is I was going to say these are the eyes
are the window shadow palette in the
body version from steel s so really
beautiful packaging like I said I used
to love this I'm pretty sure I got this
set so for I got it Sephora
this is what it looks like on the inside
and it's really stunning to look at it's
just these gorgeous gorgeous jewel tones
right but the reason why I want to say
that I don't like this anymore is
honestly because when I first got it I
think I was reaching for certain
finishes in here I was reaching for
these guys here which are more of a
shimmery finish or like a foiled finish
this one here this one here when I
started to work my way into some of
these darker shades over here that have
a lot of glitter in them I realize oh
goodness this is not the palette for me
I am NOT someone who likes to spend a
whole lot of time blending my eyeshadow
out working these into my crease these
darker gunmetal really really jewel tone
shades just did not look good they were
not soft and buttery enough it took a
lot of time to blend them so I know that
a lot of people rave about these
particular palettes I don't know if the
other the other three are any better in
quality but I will say there are a whole
lot of glitter shades in that one and if
you don't like to spend a lot of time
blending out your makeup you would not
like that I also have this little guy
right here this is from jumpier
cosmetics this is the micellar cleansing
water you will also see this tomorrow in
my follow up haul instantly hate this
like horrible I am going to try it on my
actual like face makeup but I use this
around my eyes because that's normally
what I do with my seller water I want to
love this because this is the name of my
flute to jump gift but unfortunately
it's just not very good it was three
dollars and 49 cents and it had the best
reviews on the all TOCOM website out of
any other micellar water and i'm
guessing that is because of the price so
i don't even think it's worth it for 349
honestly it just burnt my eyes so bad
and I'm one of those people that's what
I use my seller water for mostly is to
clean up any sort of area around my eyes
that has excess of residual makeup so
this was a fail for me
also another feel is the let's see here
NARS dual intensity blush in the shade
adoration so first of all like I said I
don't like the NARS packaging it just
gets so dirty really quickly and I know
there's an easy way to clean it but I
just don't have time for that
nobody got time for that anyway this is
what it looks like on the inside
I think that I really just picked up the
wrong shade for my skin tone because I
am so fair I talk all the time about
bacon a bechamel baked chalet I love
everything baked she lay formulated you
guys well I don't like it in blush form
I think it's a little too intense and
pigmented and blush form but these go on
beautifully like I'm not even going to
sit here and pretend like they're not
pigmented because they're hella
pigmented they look beautiful on the
skin but I just cannot blend out this
shade right here it's just too much on
my face I am way too fair complected for
this particular shade I should have
gotten like the peachy gold anyone that
one probably would have looked a lot
better but I really just think I'm
obsessed with facial a formulations when
it comes in highlighter form not when it
comes in blush form I just can't handle
it so that is a fail for me mostly
because I feel like I got the wrong
shade and also because although I do
love the baked Soleil formulation I just
can't stand it in blush form it's just
too much it's a little too heavy and too
too much impact on my cheeks guys and
they find all a product that I have not
been liking recently it's from eyelid
organic skin care I find this on
HauteLook and this is a brand that's on
HauteLook
all the time this is called the rose hip
toner this just left my face feeling so
tacky and sticky I hate that with a
toner the one thing that I want to told
her to do is to basically just remove
any residual impurities on my skin I
don't want it to leave my skin sticky
and tacky before I go in with my
emulsion so this was just not something
that I would recommend it also had a
very very strange like fermented kind of
scent it was really weird so anyway guys
those are some products that I have not
been loving recently I just have not
been liking at all I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me guys and I will see you tomorrow for
my Ulta follow-up home bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
