channel in this video I am sharing with
you guys products that I am returning to
Ulta and Sephora the reason I'm not
calling this a product fields video is
because these products weren't
necessarily fail some of this some of
them just weren't the right shade match
for me or some of them just look too
similar to other products that I have so
that is why I'm not calling it a product
sales video but these are items that I
will be returning to Sephora and Ulta I
want to go ahead and put a big
disclaimer on this video because they
know that I'm going to get somebody in
the comment section saying you shouldn't
return all those items or why are you
telling us that you're returning these
items I really try and just be an open
book on my channel and this video is
literally just to help you guys they
hope you don't think I'm trying to bash
a brand or bash a certain product just
because it didn't work for me does not
mean that it won't work for you and also
I just have to say if the product
doesn't work for me you can bet your ass
that I'm taking it back to the store I
have so much makeup I spend thousands
upon thousands thousands of dollars a
year on makeup and yeah if suddenly does
the work for me there's no reason why I
shouldn't take it back so I hope this
video is helpful and let's just get
right into it the first item I will be
returning will be going back to Sephora
this is the origins Maximizer this is a
skin optimizing mask primer this is just
one of those products that would look
too good to be true I believe it was
around $22 but still literally it's like
a bottle of 22 dollars worth of like
alcohol or something like that this just
stung my skin literally it stung my eyes
it's not my skin it felt like it just
did nothing and I used it many many
times even though it doesn't look like
it I did use it quite a bit I used about
that much and that's all I needed to
know that this product wasn't working I
tried it with a few different masks and
I just think it was one of those like
what's it called it's just one of those
products that was like too good to be
true basically it's kind of like a scam
you know what I mean it's like do we
really need a product that will help her
mask to sink even better I like the
concept but I just think this was a very
gimmicky product I did buy it because I
love masking but yeah it does not work I
finally would not recommend for
this product and this one is definitely
going back to Sephora like I said all
right the next two products are blushes
that I recently reviewed on my channel
these are going back to Ulta I bought
the whole collection of the makeup
revolution vivid baked blushes and my
problem with these is that they are so
similar in color there's nothing wrong
with the formulation I love the
pigmentation I think they're priced
right
but they're just so similar in color and
also this one did get smushed but
overall these are beautiful beautiful
blushes I think they're really really
fantastic but the whole line altogether
was just too similar in tone and I don't
need you know three of the same blushes
so I will be returning the two of those
to Ulta the next products I am returning
to Sephora is the Stila correct and
perfect palette if you guys have been
watching my channel for the past two to
three months you know that I have been
crazy about color correcting I picked up
pretty much every single color corrector
that is like high-end on the market and
this was just one of those palettes that
honestly it was just crappy compared to
everything else I just hated the cream
color correctors in here here they are
down here they had a very oily thin
consistency I didn't feel like they
covered very well my issue with this and
the reason I didn't return it right away
was because I'm in love with the two
powder products here that are on the
bottom they are so beautiful you get a
gorgeous kind of lavender powder to set
like your under-eye area you also have a
yellow tone powder they're very silky
very easy to use blendable but I just
don't think it's worth it to hold on to
a product if I'm only going to be using
half of it do you know what I mean I
just don't think it's worth it
especially when I picked up so many
color correctors so this little Stila
correct and perfect palette although I
love the concept of having the cream
colors it even has a little flack to
cover the cream product so that the
powders and the creams don't get mixed
together like I love that I love the
whole concept it's very travel friendly
but unfortunately I don't like half of
the product so I'm going to bring them
this back to Sephora
alright the next item I will be bringing
back to Sephora is the new Too Faced
melted matte liquefied matte long wear
lipstick hated this and it's so funny
because a lot of people that are doing
videos right now like on YouTube about
this product really really love it and
and one of those people I am so happy
like literally if a product does not
work for me but it works for you I could
not be happier literally I think it's
really really fantastic when a product
works for you but it doesn't work for me
I'm happy for you but my issue with this
is that if you go on to the Sephora comm
website all of the reviews are mixed so
you're either getting people that love
it or people that hate it I personally
just don't like the I love the shade I
got this a beautiful color it's called
child star I personally just can't deal
with this formulation a lot of people
were saying maybe it's just the color
you got you know but I felt like it went
on very streaky it was kind of patchy
and it just wasn't like the best
formulation in my opinion you guys have
to understand - I made flutist and I
need a comfortable lip product I
literally can practice my flute when I'm
wearing this Stila stay all day liquid
lipsticks I think my situation is a
little different than other people's
situation I want a product that's going
to be very very comfortable this just
emphasized winkles and dry patches on my
lips it was not comfortable to wear
although it was very very lightweight I
felt like it went on patchy sure it
could have been my color like the actual
color but I also just didn't like the
formulation like you know what I mean
like I just didn't like the way that
it's sunken she might find lines and
like wrinkles on my lips and I'm just
very picky with my lip products and this
one did not work out for me and yeah so
I would not recommend this product
however of course you should do your own
research on the support website like I
said I actually posted a review on there
and support actually took it down I
think I went against their regulations I
said I compared it to another product
but you're not allowed to do which I
feel bad about now I'm like oh I forgot
it wasn't supposed to do that but I
compared it to the Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick and they did take the
review down I probably will post again
and I will try and not compare it to
anything because that is kind of like
their regulations on the website you're
not allowed to compare it to another
product that they sell however I just
think it in my eyes like this just did
not work for my lips if you have lips
that are slightly dry or you just want
something that's not going to emphasize
any texture on your lips I honestly
would not recommend this but again do
your own research a lot of people are
loving this and I think
that's fantastic stuff yeah that's why
so far has such a wonderful return
policy so that you can try something out
and if you don't like it you can always
return it so anyway that is going back
to Sephora the next item I will be
returning will be going back to Ulta
this is the tarte high-performance
Naturals empowered hybrid gel foundation
so this is just a bad color match for me
I'm obsessed with like everything about
it this gorgeous gorgeous frosted glass
it's like a nice heavy container you
can't want to fluid ounce a product in
here which is the standard amount a
gorgeous like shiny lid I think it's
beautiful the presentation I think what
they were going for with this product is
really really wonderful they wanted
something light weights like a gel that
was really gonna hydrate your skin but I
felt like this almost overly hydrated my
skin it just sunk into my fine lines and
pores I didn't like the way it's right
down and on top of that this was the
lightest shade that they offered at the
time I have no idea if they have a new
shade now but as of right now which is
at the end of March of 2016
this was the shade that they had that
was the lightest and it is much too dark
on my skin and I felt like for such a
free foundation to have such a beautiful
sort of finish or like they were
describing that it was going to be a
beautiful finish I didn't want to have
to go and mix this with like a white
mixer foundation because I felt like the
finish was kind of unique and special
but then I realized they didn't actually
like the way that it's settled into you
like my skin at the end of the day but
yeah I tried this with a lot of
different primers I tried it a lot of
different ways and it just didn't work
out for me so I will be returning that
to Ulta the next item I will be
returning to Sephora and I have tried so
hard with this palette you guys I have
tried so hard this is the visoreds cool
math palette I'm gonna go ahead and
return this this is an $80 palette and I
just don't think it's worthwhile to hold
on to it if I have such a difficult time
with it I'm personally not a makeup
artist I don't claim to be amazing or
anything like that at makeup but this is
just very difficult to work with I know
a lot of people love these it may be
because you're just really damn good at
makeup so he goes from me I sit there
I am blending for like 10 to 15 minutes
and that's just too much for me I'm not
interested in sitting there and blending
for 10 to 15 minutes I'm not a makeup
artist I get up in the morning I get
ready for work and I want to be out the
door so this I I think the colors are
gorgeous in here I think they're
extremely pigmented and beautiful don't
get me wrong the color combinations are
beautiful I do think that there is a
little bit of a dupe like color dupes
for this in the meet matte nude palette
so if you have that palette I think you
can kind of get a few like replicas of
the colors of that make sense so I am
going to hold onto that palette because
I feel like I can get a little bit of a
color selection that I do get in this
palettes but for the most part um it's
just very difficult to work with and I'm
not interested in having to spend 10 to
15 minutes blending out my eyeshadow
every day so that is going back to
Sephora and the final product that I
will be returning is the Becca backlight
targeted color corrector in peach I
purchased every single one from the line
I am keeping the other ones this is the
only one that I am you know returning
and by the way these are the only two
color correcting products that I'm
returning I get asked a lot people are
like did you return all those products
no like I kept them I really like them I
will always do these kind of videos so
if you guys are curious as to products
that I will be returning I will make
these every like two or three months but
anyway I really do love the formulation
of these backlight color correctors this
was the first one that I tried and I was
so into it they're very humectant
they're very moisturizing they're very
very beautiful and I liked this one for
hyperpigmentation however I just have
come across better ones now like the
Urban Decay color correcting fluids are
fantastic I prefer that peach shade I
prefer the peach shade in the NYX color
correcting palette there's just a lot
more that I prefer in this color so I
will be returning this one I think these
are around 23 dollars a piece and like I
said I have so many color correctors now
there's just no point in me holding on
to this one so I hope this video was
helpful thank you so much for joining me
guys and I will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
