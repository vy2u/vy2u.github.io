my channel today I'm gonna share with
you guys some products I have changed my
mind about and this is going to be a
volume two or part two because I did a
video probably about a month ago talking
about ten different makeup products that
I've changed my mind about and I promise
you guys that I would make this into a
series and talk about some products that
I have changed my mind about so anyway
today we're gonna talk about some
skincare I also have some makeup as well
as like a brush to share so let's go
ahead and jump right into it the first
one is going to be the Martian and
mattifying melting water gel toner from
Sunday Riley this does not work for me
and you are you guys I just don't have
that really really oily or problematic
skin anymore
I really am more on the dry side and
this is just something that is way too
strong for my skin now it does say here
that it instantly transforms from a
cooling gel to a water toner as it
clarifies removes oil and visibly
tightens support for clear matte skin
and I agree with that a hundred percent
if you were someone who does have very
problematic skin if you have a lot of
breakouts if you are someone who does
have very oily skin and this is
absolutely incredible I don't have a lot
left in here but unfortunately it's just
not working for me anymore I have gone
through three full sizes of this but I
will not be repurchasing alright the
next product we have here is from Too
Faced this is the sugar pop 9 pan
eyeshadow palette now if you've been
watching me for a while you know that I
love the 9 P at palettes from a
two-faced but unfortunately I really
just don't reach for this anymore I
definitely will be going ahead and
decluttering it
I do love quite a few shades in here
like strawberry ice I think bubblegum
and blue raspberry are very very unique
and very very pretty but ever since you
know Too Faced kind of just left a bad
taste in my mouth there are specific
products that I'm just having a hard
time using and I definitely do love a
lot of my 9 pan palettes and I
definitely do love my chocolate bar
palette but there's just something about
this that I don't reach for it often
enough I also do you find that there's
not like that great of a transition
shade in here this guy really pulls a
strange kind of orange color I also feel
like there's just not a lot of shades
that can kind of build up on one another
and it just seems to be one of those
supplementary palettes I have enough
supplementary palettes in my collection
so I just don't need this anymore we'll
be going ahead and letting it go alright
up next we have two different
foundations one of them I do not like
more and one of them I have fallen in
love with this guy is the hourglass
illusion hyaluronic skin tint ooh this
is the new shade of vanilla I have
fallen in love with this product it does
have SPF 15 in here and I would
absolutely repurchase now if you watch
my first impressions on this from about
eight months ago again when I had more
combination oily skin I hated this it
was way too greasy it was way too heavy
I was saying get something at the
drugstore this is ultra expensive but
this has quickly become my go-to
foundation so that is something I am now
in love with and in this guy right here
which is the hard candy glamoflauge
invisible camouflage foundation in the
shade porcelain I used to love this it
left this beautiful satiny sort of
texture not texture buff finish on the
skin it reminds me a lot of the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation which that
one is starting to top really work for
me anymore down your either but it just
looks so cakey on my skin I mean no
matter what I do if I mix it together
with oil if I use it with a really
hydrating primer even tried mixing this
with a like a moisturizer to kind of
make it in tomorrow flike a tinted
moisturizer or a little more hydrating
on the skin it no longer looks pretty on
my skin so yeah that is definitely
something that just no longer works for
me now the next guys that we do have a
magnificent metal of glitter and glow a
liquid eyeshadow here from Stila this is
one of them that I was thinking about
returning back when I got like my whole
kind of steal of glitter and glow a
liquid collection so I have about eight
of these and this is in the shade Sunset
Cove this was one of like those
duochrome are kind of holographic you
know really really pretty shiny shiny
glittery glows and I felt like this one
compared to the shade see siren was
really really on the weak side but I
have to say this has been my go-to you
guys see this I've made quite a dent
when it comes to this particular product
I really like it because it's a little
more on the sheer side there's something
about these two you like glitter and
glows if you're not amazing at makeup
and you start to up with these like
you're kind of screwed like you're just
kind of screwed and I really do I am now
enjoying the fact that this has like a
little bit of Sheerness to it because I
feel like you can build it up now when I
first got the glitter in clothes I would
just like win in
there and you know hand those on and I
had no issue whatsoever they looked a
little sloppy some people were saying oh
the glitters are all over your face this
and that I find that with this one
because you do build it up a little more
and it's not as glittery it's easier to
use so this has now turned into like my
go-to glitter and glow even though I
thought about returning it at one point
I definitely will not be anymore
all right up next guys we have the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
when I was living in Milwaukee again
when I had more oily combination skin
this just slipped and slid all over my
face I felt like it would just wipe my
foundation off like if I would go like
this it would take my foundation off and
the primer with it I love it now I feel
like it's really nice and kind of
hydrating it definitely smooths out the
pores but it leaves a little bit of
something it helps my foundation to go
on a lot more beautifully so big big fan
of the Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer up next we have a brush here from
Tarte cosmetics this was actually in the
Nicole Concilio it was either in last
year's holiday kit or the Nicole
Concilio brush set I hated this brush
for such a long time it's just really
really tiny a little kind of tapered I
mean the like under-eye setting brush
basically well I was kind of using it to
blend out my eye shadow because you know
guys tell me I'm not a professional with
makeup I will use something like this
diplomat goddamn eyeshadow but I was
using at the time to kind of just do
stuff around my face or maybe lightly
contour I think that's what this was
meant for actually was like to contour I
don't like anything too precise like
that when it comes to contour that's
just not my style but this is amazing
absolutely amazing for setting the under
eyes if you like pick up the powder and
really really pack it on and actually
push into the skin instead of swipe it
really really will set your under-eye I
did it today with a powder and I just
love the way it looks I really think it
helps with those little tiny fine lines
and wrinkles and especially with
creasing throughout the day so this is
definitely like my go-to brush right now
as far as setting my under eyes is
concerned I love using it with my
hourglass ambient lighting powders and
finally guys we have a product here from
Murad this used to be a go-to clarifying
cleanser for me it is the sellers that
like acid we'll see here 1.5% cleanser
so it's just called the clarifying
cleanser and you guys can see this thing
as 6.75 fluid ounces I am like almost
done with this baby I
went through I think three of these I
think I picked up about three of them
during the altar 21 days of beauty event
probably about two years ago okay but
anyway this is definitely one of those
products that I just used to love salsa
lacasa to really kind of exfoliates the
skin it takes care of oil control and it
really does helped you clear up a
breakouts but this is just a little too
drying for me now it's kind of like the
Martian mattifying melting water gel
toner my skin just can't handle it so
it's not something that works for me but
if you do have more problematic skin
it's definitely one that I would
recommend you can get something very
similar at the drugstore anything with
salicylic acid 1% 2% is very very good
for your skin but yeah that is something
that no longer works for me so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
down below if you've tried any products
recently that you have changed your mind
about or maybe if you move like I did
and now your skin is completely
different let me know if you've changed
your mind about some of like your old
Holy Grail favorites like the cease to
be a Holy Grail but yeah I would love to
know down below and I guess I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
