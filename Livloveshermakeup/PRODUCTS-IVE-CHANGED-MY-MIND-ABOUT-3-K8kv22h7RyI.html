my channel happy Wednesday today I have
another products I have changed my mind
about number three a video to share with
you guys I can't believe it's already
the third video in this series that I am
doing but my skin has changed my
preferences in makeup have changed and
there are just a lot of products in my
collection and I'm not really enjoying
anymore to be completely honest and then
there are a couple products that I have
enjoyed now that my skin has changed so
anyway I want to say really quickly
before I get into this I did a film the
Kat Von D Saint and sinner eyeshadow
palette 2 review swatches and comparison
video this morning unfortunately I
pulled my SD card out before turning off
my camera and I lost the footage so for
me personally I don't like to read film
videos if there's like a huge mistake
I'd rather film something else so it
doesn't feel as forced and kind of like
edited you know what I mean so I'll go
ahead and refill in that video for you
guys tomorrow but I thought today while
I have a spare at 10 to 15 minutes I go
ahead and refill them something
different so let's go ahead and jump
right into it I want to start with some
skincare products so the first one I
have here is from the marula by John
Paul selects a line this is the pure
marula facial lotion yeah an actual
facial lotion so it's not a really
really runny consistency to it I never
really liked this however I have to say
if I mix in four or five drops of oil
into here like a marula oil or even you
know I don't know I really like my josie
maran argan oil mixed in with this or
even my chart tomorrow Kuja oil and this
is the perfect amount of hydration for
at my skin I'm very surprised because
right now I'm a little more on the dry
side and I didn't think that a facial
lotion would be enough moisturization
for me but I've been very very happy
with this it used to be a product I
wasn't crazy about now I really like it
just for full disclosure here you guys
this was sent to me for PR about a year
and a half ago alright moving on we have
the Ordinaries retinol 1% stable
emulsion now and this is a product that
I originally did like I wasn't like in
love with it but it was good I enjoyed
it it worked I just can't handle the 1%
retinol anymore you guys it's just way
too raw and drying on at my face
unfortunately this does have silicone
mixed in there so it's very hard to mix
in an oil or even get like a barrier of
moisture with a moisturizer so you want
to mix this together with something
especially if you're very very sensitive
to like lactic acid or if you're really
sensitive to retinol it's very nice to
be able to go ahead and mix in an oil or
some sort of moisturizer so that it's
not abrasive on your skin or not as
abrasive on your skin unfortunately even
when I do that I don't feel like it's
actually reaching this product because
it has that silicone on there I find it
very difficult to lay oils on top of
silicone products I find it very
difficult to layer anything on top of
silicone products because it's creating
a barrier on the skin so this is just
not something my skin can handle it
anymore I really do enjoy a lot of
products from the ordinary but this is
not one of them anymore all right guys
let's move on it to some products here
from naval aina that I have in my
collection I obviously purchase these
before going cruelty free I used to
really like these and I do not anymore
so the first one is the dream but wonder
powder and this particular shade right
here is actually called porcelain ivory
I always had a difficult time with this
because it goes really really really
pink tones throughout the day and it
really oxidizes I hate when powders
oxidize I'm like bitch I already have to
deal with my foundation oxidizing I do
not want to deal with a powder oxidizing
but this definitely does oxidize quite a
bit so I feel like it definitely makes
your skin look very finished and very
seamless it doesn't really help that
much with oil control however I feel
like this actually just looks really
horrible on my skin down here it's a
little too dry it doesn't look as nice
so this is not something that I like
anymore and again it that's super super
pink undertone in here is just not going
very well
with myself tan body right now so I'm
going to be going ahead and decluttering
that up next we have the maybelline
superstay better skin skin transforming
foundation this particular shade right
here which is called porcelain it's
actually a great match for me personally
when I am NOT self tan but I have to say
this medium to buildable full coverage
foundation is not looking pretty on my
skin anymore I have tried it with a
buffing brush you know doing downward
stroking motions I tried doing a
circular motions which really really
made all my dry patches I'm like a
freaking it was like a magnifying glass
like you could see everything you see
all the peach fuzz everything and then I
even went ahead and tried applying this
with a DMS budget is still looked a
really really bad so this is just not a
product that's working for me anymore it
definitely does have a nice amount of
coverage for the drugstore and in this
particular shade right here which is
called porcelain is quite nice if you
are a fair complected princess out there
but for me this is just not working
anymore and I'm going to go ahead and
let it go
and then finally we have the dream
brightening creamy concealer when I
first got this I didn't like it then I
started liking it and I don't like it
again I can't wear this underneath the
eyes even though it says that it is
creamy I feel like when it is in stick
form it tends to dry out a little more
it's very much emphasizes fine lines
wrinkles sinks into all those little
areas that you don't want it to sink
into it creases throughout the day and
then I tried using it as a spot
concealer and it really really doesn't
look good either so that's just a
product that has to go alright guys up
next I actually have these sweet peach
aglow kit here from a Too Faced guess
what I'm actually appreciating this a
little more than I used to so this was
that was a product that I wasn't a huge
fan of it's a very neutral and natural
kind of palette it's not like a wham bam
in your face kind of highlight or blush
or bronzer but that's kind of what I'm
liking right now for my facial makeup so
this is something that I'm actually
enjoying right now I definitely do not
appreciate the scent I am NOT into this
super super scented makeup anymore or
skincare I just feel like fragrance in
general is not that great for your skin
but for me I know I always said I didn't
like this I still feel like the bronzer
in here is a little too yellow tone it
looks kind of strange on my skin but I
feel like the highlight as well as the
blush go into the skin beautifully they
kind of sit on top of the skin but not
in a way that it's like oh my gosh I can
see that that highlight is sitting on
top of your skin or it's like a stripe
of color you know what I mean it's in a
beautiful way and it doesn't disrupt
your foundation it doesn't disrupt your
powder doesn't disrupt any sort of
texture a really show anything through
so this is actually a palette that I
have been appreciating a lot so I know I
said I was gonna do clutter this I think
I'm gonna go ahead and hold onto it
alright guys and finally I have some
highlighters here and I just feel like
foundations and highlighters have been
the biggest thing that's just like holy
 that looks bad on me now so the
first two I have here are from the lorac
colorsource no these are the colorsource
those are the colorsource buildable
blushes I still like those I have a
couple of those in my collection these
are the illuminating highlighters they
have the same sort of packaging which is
why I'm confused but anyway this first
one right here is called Twilight - this
other one
here is called starlight I purchased all
four or five with them when they first
released I loved all of them back in
Milwaukee I felt like these were really
really beautiful but this right here
called starlight just looks so ashy and
disgusting on me it's got a little bit
of like a yellow shift to it but I'm
finding that this color highlight right
now it doesn't look good on my skin tone
with my self-tanner I don't know why
same thing goes for Rebecca's moonstone
it's just not a very flattering color
for me personally right now and then
also just the overall formula of these
they're a little too powdery and that's
why I keep saying I love these bakelite
highlighters and I love bakelite
products as I feel like they're sitting
on my skin in a beautiful way right now
and they're not emphasizing texture or
peach fuzz or any sort of dry area
unfortunately these really powdery
highlights are just not doing it for me
anymore so although this shade right
here which is called Twilight is super
super beautiful it just takes up a
little too much of product I feel like
it applies a little too much product at
once and I would rather be able to kind
of build up my highlight so that I can
kind of deal with okay hey is it
starting to settle in to certain areas
it's starting to emphasize texture then
I can kind of slow down and stop but it
although it's a really gorgeous color
couldn't reminds me of dim light from
our glasses just not the formula for me
anymore so I'm gonna be going ahead and
let it go of those lorac colorsource
goddammit they're not called Collard
sorts alone any highlighters okay and
starlight in Twilight all right up next
we do have a 100% pure gemmed Luminizer
here so they did send this to me for PR
I really really like Adafruit pigmented
blush that they sent me but a little
shortly after they sent me like a little
bit after they sent me this it did go
ahead and crack so I'm gonna go ahead
and attempt to repress this and then
also declutter it too but this is one of
the gems Luminizer is in the shade let's
see here rose gold now originally I did
like the way that this one onto my skin
it was more of a blush topper before I
was actually self tan and now this is a
true highlight on me and it's just a
really strange color it just doesn't
work for me it's got a little bit of a
tan undertone a little bit of like a
golden yellow thing going on again like
the Starlight shade or even a Becca's
moonstone and I don't really know what's
going on if it's just the self-tanner
and we're in currently but these shades
are not looking pretty on me right now
they're just really not looking good and
on top of that I do feel like this for
it's just a little - again - powdery
it's just a little too powdery on the
skin and it really does emphasize a lot
of texture and things like that and it
kind of looks similar to the lorac
colorsource in Twilight but it's just
it's just not working for me doesn't
look flattering so I'm gonna be going
ahead and letting go of that and finally
guys I have a vinyl boss highlighting
palette right here I love a lot of
palettes from violet boss but
unfortunately this is kind of not
working anymore
you can see this is a well-loved -
palette they kind of have like a mixture
of like a powder hybrid sort of bakelite
thing going on here but these are just
very chunky and you can tell when you
swatch them you can tell just by looking
at the pants here these are more of a
chunky formula and they go onto the skin
chunky they're just not looking good on
me anymore so I'm gonna go ahead and let
go of that as well so anyway guys that
is number three or four products I have
changed my mind about let me know it
down below if your skin type has changed
if your preferences and makeup have
change like me and if you're going to be
decluttering anything and yeah that's
pretty much it I will see you guys
tomorrow for my review swatches in
comparison on the new Saint and sinner
palette from Kat Von D bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
