happy Saturday whatever the hell this
video is going up and now before we get
into this collaboration video I want to
say really quickly I do have some
updates for you guys some life updates
some updates some stuff okay so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
first update I cut my hair and I know
you cannot tell all right now because
it's been a button I just got back from
the gym before I put my makeup on this
the morning so I yeah it slicked back
because I'm all sweaty
so I will make sure to wear it down
sometime this week's you guys can see if
you would like me to do a video talking
about my favorite hairstyles for the
shorter hair now I'm at which I have had
this style many many times before I can
kind of show you guys what I've been
doing I'm braiding my hair but doing
kind of different stuff fun stuff and I
really like it I love this hair length
so if you want to hear update video in
March I already have all my videos
planned out for February but if you
would like one in a March please let me
know down below now let's get into the
more kind of serious update so the first
one is that I left a family member
earlier this week and I'm not gonna get
too much in depth about it I'm not gonna
be like saying who or anything like that
it's not a super super close family
member they were a little more distant
but this was someone I grew up with that
they did pass away at the very early age
of 23 from health related illnesses now
I happen to have one of these health
related illnesses and I know that this
runs through my family so to see that
they passed away at such an early age
has really kind of opened my eyes up to
spending a little more time a quality
time on my health this month another
update for you guys is that I found out
my hemolytic anemia is still kind of
down in the dirt now I have lupus which
is an autoimmune disease as well as
hemolytic anemia which was developed
from the lupus and I had been going in
for the past two months now for a blood
transfusion every single week as well as
two in different plasma infusions and
that really has taken it out of me I
mean it really takes a lot of my energy
away from me and clearly you guys know
I'm someone who usually has very high
energy levels and I would say I still do
have very high energy levels you know
that's the ADHD and me and that's one
thing about my ADHD that I love I'm able
to do YouTube I'm able to do all sorts
of different social media platforms do
this as a hobby work full-time do gigs I
love that about my ADHD I love that it
gives me a boost of energy so that I can
complete
that I want to complete in my life and
you guys know I'm a big scheduler I love
to schedule my life out I like to plan
my life out I am very much a one of
those people that loves that kind of
stuff so it's hard for me when you know
my health takes a turn for the worst
because you can't really plan around
that and obviously you can't plan around
life you have to just go with it and I'm
not good at that I am definitely a
control freak and I think a lot of
people get this kind of more laid-back
vibe from me but when it comes to my
professional life and even when it comes
to youtube I mean I plan my videos a
month in advance I am very much on top
of everything and when things don't
schedule the way I wanted them to I get
I get really anxiety ridden and I'm not
someone who usually gets anxiety but let
me tell you there there is some anxiety
ridden stuff that happens there so yeah
I want to spend it some time this month
and just focusing on my health so my
hemolytic anemia my numbers my blood
levels are not up yet so they're
thinking another month and a half of
this and you know blood transfusions
every single week and plasma infusions
every single week may sound really easy
but the blood transfusions take a couple
of hours sometimes depending on how many
blood bags they want to give me I
usually can't do anything does I have my
arms like this it's just kind of hard
because I feel like I can't work on my
computer I can't grade papers I can't do
really what I want to so it's been very
much a nuisance to me but I know it's my
health and I have to take care of myself
so I'm going to be focusing on you know
health related things this month the
most now I haven't started to get into
the vibe of pre-filming pre-filming was
never something I liked and for you guys
 ever okay I love love love being
able to jump on camera and being like
hey the day that you're seeing me is the
day that you're seeing me this is the
day I'm filming it but I've really
gotten into pre filming because I'm one
of those people again I like to plan
things and when I get sick or when
something happens like a family member
passes away you can't prepare for that
and you just have to be able to have
stuff to back it up so it's been very
very nice to be able to do some pre
filming I did some pre filming in the
past two weeks when I already had pre
film videos going up so one of the
reasons why I can't commit to YouTube
this month and I can't tell you guys
there will be a video pretty much every
single day is because I already went
ahead and did some pre filming as well
so I'm going to be taking time off from
snapchat as well as Instagram I'm going
to be taking a whole month off from them
just because I other things I need to
focus on and I know usually when I say
that there's stuff going on in my
personal life people jump to in the
conclusion of is anything wrong with
your relationship what's going on with
that you guys know I don't talk about my
boyfriend very often on here he has a
very professional job and at this time
it's just not really appropriate for me
to be mentioning him all that often on
here but no everything is totally fine
with me and Tom if you guys are curious
there's some stuff going on with my
animals I recently found out that
Khaleesi had a botched spade procedure
she's one of my ferrets and they forgot
to take one of her ovaries out so yes we
have to go in and get that fixed as well
so she's got some she's got some health
stuff going on too but we're gonna go in
and take her in next week and she should
be fine she's just gonna put her under
and then obviously take out the other
ovary because she's basically in heat
right now which is horrible you know you
go in you take out one over and then you
forget the other like what the so
that was a little alarming but yes
everything is fine with my relationship
thank you to everybody who was asking I
was getting a lot of questions on
snapchat and things like that everything
is going well with my family I do have
family visiting currently because my dad
did decide to buy another place down
here another question I've been getting
asked a lot yes he has a condo down here
and he decided to also buy a house he
really has fallen in love with Arizona
and he has decided to go ahead and spend
a lot of time down here and now that he
is retired so anyway guys that is pretty
much it so for the update so like I said
gonna be taken a good at least a month
off of snapchat and Instagram I just
don't have the time or energy to invest
in that right now and I love you guys on
Instagram and snapchat and definitely
YouTube is more work than Instagram and
snapchat but I like YouTube more than
snapchat and Instagram and sometimes you
have to line everything up and say
what's more important in your life right
now I still want to have youtube videos
for you guys but snapchat and going on
there and in my free time talking about
what's going on with my day I don't have
time for that right now I don't want to
do that and it's just not something that
appeals to me so I'm going to be taking
that time off from those if you go and
search for me on those social media
handles it's just gonna be pretty much
empty and blank however I will try and
update the ferret's Instagram I do oh
yes
I have an Instagram for my ferrets um
it's honey badger and Khaleesi so I will
go ahead and put some photos up on there
and keep you guys updated on khaleesies
health and all that kind of stuff but
those are my updates now I think we
should actually jump into the goddamn
video let's go ahead and do this Oh
about a month ago I got a comment from a
subscriber named Katie hello Katie and
she asked if I'm ever going to do a Fab
five collab and I was like what the
is a Fab five collab I didn't know what
she was talking about and what she was
referring to is actually a group
collaboration with some of her favorite
youtubers on here which included me
Samantha March and jelica as well as
Kaylee and also Kelly Iguchi and I was
thinking it that's really cute
that's really cute that word you think
we're a little fabulous 5 little group
here you know I think there's a lot of
speculation especially when it comes to
collaborations and things like that like
are these people actually friends and
the truth is yes all five of us actually
do get along and we actually are friends
so I brought up the idea and said hey
you guys do you want to do a
collaboration video and actually Kate
Lee came up a with how about products
that we've do
so basically a product that we have in
our collection that used to be really up
there the Kings the Queen's it used to
be top not okay and then
that new product came in and basically
just took all the glory and that's what
we use now and it's not that we don't
like those products anymore it's just
like hey when you find something better
you find something better right so I'm
gonna go ahead and link Haley as well as
Samantha as well as Kelly as well as
Angelica's channels as well as their
instagrams all their information
all their videos everything that you
need to know and down below in the
description box you guys please go check
them out actually really do enjoy each
other and if you like my kind of content
you are absolutely going to like every
single one of them absolutely no doubt
about it and I really think it's fun
that a lot of you have noticed that the
five of us have been releasing kind of
different content than what you usually
see in the beauty community like I said
if you've never checked them out before
you must so anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it let's talk about some
products that have been a deep brown
right so the first product that has been
dethroned is the Armani luminous silk a
foundation I was wearing this on days
where I wasn't filming
and so I would wear this to work I would
also wear this on stage I purchased this
foundation before going cruelty free and
I just wanted to use it up and then
obviously never repurchase again this is
a beautiful foundation I'm not going to
lie however the Smashbox Studios skin
15-hour we're hydrating foundation beats
this one to a tee okay this is like a
$64 foundation this guy over here is
around $42 it has a better shade range
it's beautiful on the skin it is in my
opinion the more glossy and hydrating
long wearing version of the shorty
Armani luminous silk foundation so if
you're looking for something that's
similar that is cruelty free would
HIGHLY highly recommend you guys check
out the Smashbox especially if you do
have dry skin this has been a lifesaver
for me I love that I can build up the
coverage it looks beautiful I get that
really gorgeous dull skin sort of
appearance if I want to build up two or
three layers of this and pop onstage it
looks great it looks great under
bright light it looks great when you're
filming absolutely love this foundation
so this has dethroned
literally probably five or six different
foundations in my collection including
one of my most expensive foundations the
next product I had been dethroned is the
Luna sleeping a night oil from Sunday Oh
Riley and now the product that has
dethroned it is this guy right here this
is the Ordinaries grand active retinoid
2% emulsion I love this this retails for
what like nine dollars and 80 cents on
the Sephora calm website compared to 90
dollars it is absolutely amazing I use a
whole drawerful every single night I'd
use upward stroke emotions around my
neck area I take it all over my face
around my eye area I never get any sort
of irritation with this and my skin
doesn't really purge when I first start
to use it when it comes to the Sunday
Riley sleeping at night oil
I always purge for a good two weeks when
I first start using that product and I
am someone at my skin gets bored quite
easily so I do like to switch up my
retinols and my acids and things like
that at nighttime so I hate that I have
to go through that skin purging phase
for about two weeks when I first start
that product up but this guy right here
gives me the same sort of effects it is
just as hydrating on the skin and it is
really non irritating if you were
looking for a good retinol product that
is not irritating and it's a
bang for your buck and this guy right
here is incredible the next product that
has been dethroned is the by Tier II
hyaluronic
your powder I recently have to ask by
Terry to take me off their PR list
because unfortunately they are no longer
cruelty free which we don't around
with that on my channel okay get
your together by teria but this guy
right here basically is the same thing
this is the elf HD setting powder and I
feel like if this $56 powder I think
it's $56 this really really caught my
attention at first because it actually
did put some moisture back into my skin
I felt like this was the most beautiful
silica setting powder for the buffing
technique or even to make my under eye
width because it did look kind of moist
like it was a powder that actually
didn't look dry or cakey underneath my
eyes however I notice if I use a damp
sponge in just the tiniest amount of the
elf HD is setting a powder I get the
same exact sort of look so especially if
I'm gonna be baking I mean who
wants to bake with a $54 powder hello $5
I feel like baking I've really gotten
into it recently I'm not trying to batch
baking in any way shape or form but I
hate doing it with my high-end powders
because I feel like I'm just waving
goodbye to all my money okay so this is
a really really a nice powder right here
elf HD of setting powder will not
repurchase this guy probably will not
repurchase the bye-bye pours from it
cosmetics because this guy right here
has really been making me happy and it
basically dethroned every single product
in my collection that has to do with a
silica fiber let's talk about a
concealer that have been dethroned by a
a drugstore concealer in my collection
this is the Too Faced Born This Way
naturally radiant concealer in the shade
very fair I definitely reach for my wet
and wild photo focus a lot more I
recently tried this out and I
love it the shade right here is called
light ivory eight-to-four is zero B it
definitely looks a little dark in the
tube but it goes on so nicely I prefer
the coverage going on here I do prefer
the glossiness that I get from the Too
Faced and naturally a radiant but like I
said I prefer the coverage here so I can
naked this look a little more glossy
especially if I add a little drip of oil
into or a little drop of oil into it
it's really really gorgeous on the under
eye and it's something that doesn't
crease on me the problem with this
concealer is that it does start to
crease especially now that I have a
little more of a creepy under-eye area
that is a little more dry so this is
definitely a concealer that I had
hate relationship with it first this guy
right here has definitely dethroned this
product I mean I really really like this
concealer finally guys we have a
moisturizing lip product here that has
been dethroned from a product from Becca
so these are the two face
la creme lipsticks I used to love these
and I still do love them okay
it's not like they're not good okay you
can still love all the products but I
definitely along with the becca one a
little more the shades that I have here
are taffy which is kind of like a nudey
pink color in this guy right here is
called pink chocolate but these are very
moisturizing they're very very
comfortable on the lips they've got
gorgeous packaging but I feel like the
Becca left lip color balms literally
have the same thing going for them now I
know that sometimes you can get these
for half off which is cheaper than the
Becca's but there's something about the
opacity as well as the way that these
wear on the lips that I just prefer over
the Too Faced I'm very much into
comfortable lip products and I talk
about it all the time so for me to
really do thrown a product especially
something like to face these are
old-school lipsticks that I have loved
for years to be throw them for something
a rather new in my collection is kind of
a big deal this shade right here is
called omens place and it's just
absolutely beautiful it's that true kind
of everyday beautiful lip color I feel
like I can pop it on my lips I can
practice my flute with it it stays on
really really nicely it's glossy it's
pigmented the only problem with the
Abeka a lush lip color balms is darker
shades do look a little more patchy on
the lips but I feel like I have the same
exact problem with the lipsticks right
here from Too Faced the Kratt matte
lipsticks they Left Front lipstick so
for me I do prefer the back now this
definitely has taken the first lead in
my really really pigmented but glossy
sort of lip balms in my collection and I
really do enjoy it so anyway guys that
is it before this video all about
products that have been in dethrones
please let me know if you have any
products down below that you have
dethroned it's your collection make sure
