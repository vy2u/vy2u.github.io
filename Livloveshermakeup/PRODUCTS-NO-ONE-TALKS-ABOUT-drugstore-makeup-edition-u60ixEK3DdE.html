thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic magical wonderful day okay I'm
just in one of those moods again today
it's a good day anyway I'm here to do a
video that I did not plan on doing today
I actually was going to be doing a
review and swatches then also a demo
video on the new Smashbox color
correcting Stix and then I thought you
know what Olivia you've been posting a
lot of reviews lately and this coming
week besides this video every other
video that I'm going to be doing is
probably going to be a review this week
because there are tons of new products
releasing again as this week so I
thought you know what give it a break
you can do that video tomorrow you can
upload those videos tomorrow afternoon
so that is what will be going up
tomorrow afternoon I apologize I did say
on my Instagram I'd be posting the
Smashbox Smashbox the ones today but I'm
just not going to do it I just feel like
um you know it's really really fun to go
and do reviews and things like that but
it's also important to keep like
original content on my channel like
that's a big thing for me I want to keep
you guys entertained by doing different
kind of things so today's video is going
to be products that no one talks about
and then tomorrow all the way through
probably Friday will be review so I hope
you guys are prepared but anyway let's
just get right into it we are going to
be talking about products that no one
talks about drugstore edition so if you
would like to see this on skincare or
haircare or high-end makeup let me know
in the comments down below and I can
make sure that I fill in that video for
you guys so anyway let's just get
started the first thing I want to talk
about that nobody talks about are these
wonderful covergirl blushes these are
the classic color blushes in these
shades 590 soft make and 5:40 rose silk
they are old-school
they smell like your grandma and they
have horrible ugly packaging but you
guys these are so beautiful on the skin
I actually heard about these from Emily
Noelle 83 here I'm YouTube who is like a
goddess and I love her she was talking
about how wonderful these are and I was
like I don't know look at that crappy
package in the what is that
you know like was even clicks and you
push it back like so old-school um but
when she swatch them I was like those
are beautiful so I picked them up and
they're so good they're not super
buttery they're not super pigmented but
the colors are so beautiful they just
have this gorgeous kind of I guess I
would say like silvery Under
to them they just look so beautiful so
this is soft mink hopefully you guys can
see that do you see that Sheen it's just
that beautiful kind of silver sheen all
of them have that and then this one is
rose silk and this is what rose silk
looks like and they just all have this
gorgeous like silvery undertow machine
on them that it's just so different and
absolutely stunning so they're a soft
make and rose silk these are absolutely
fantastic more people need to try these
out and type them off because they
aren't that good I hope that covergirl
goes ahead and kind of like reformulates
or not reformulates know I like the
formulation I want them to repackage
them so that people will start to let go
and purchase them because they're just
old-school they're always at the bottom
of the display and nobody talks about
them alright the next thing I want to
talk about is an eyeshadow palette from
forever 21 the last time I was in store
I did see that they still had this this
was under $10 and it's freaking amazing
this is what it looks like and I just
want to go ahead and swatch a few of
these blue colors for you guys quickly
because those are my favorite in the
palette anything like these look like
color pop eyeshadows to make you see
that look how gorgeous so let me go
ahead and swatch these there is the
shading here that is they do for the NYX
prismatic eyeshadow in the shade mermaid
and it's that one right there but look
at the pigmentation look at the colors
look how gorgeous do these not remind
you of color pop eyeshadows these are
freaking of sorry I keep saying freaking
I think that's such a gross word but
they are amazing they are so beautiful
and amazing and I love that you get a
bunch of neutral shades you get a bunch
of beautiful blue shades some darker
shades that are very very pigmented as
well I mean hello that is a good black
right there and they're just so
beautiful you guys have just loved these
you get a mixture of math statins all
that kind of stuff let me go ahead and
swatch these so you guys can see like
yes yeah yes for over 21 thank you yes
so anyway I cannot find this on the
online website but I did find them in
store last time I was there and I
purchased this palette like a year ago
so they still have the same one there if
you can get your hands on it go ahead
and pick up the 21 eyes shadow palette
from forever 21 alright the next thing I
want to talk about is a foundation this
is what sparked this video this is the
covergirl trublend
would make up I talked about this in one
of my fields in Holy Grails video my
shade is ivory it is a perfect color
match if you want your face to look like
skin just better skin this is what you
need it's an amazing beautiful blendable
foundation you can blend it with your
fingers with a Beauty Blender anything
it looks like this it is liquidy but
when you blend it in it's just
absolutely gorgeous you guys it's just
skin like if you want your skin to look
like skin you should pick this up it
just makes your skin look better if you
have like hyperpigmentation or if you're
just having like a normal I don't know
sometimes like my skin is just kind of
normalized this is what I reach for
because it just makes my skin look like
skin a better skin so that is absolutely
amazing I love the way it blends it
comes in a pump it's beautiful these are
at the bottom of the display again next
to the covergirl blushes but honestly
they're so good you should definitely
check them out if you have not all right
the next thing I want to talk about I
feel like gets hyped once in a while and
then it just dies down right away these
are the L'Oreal True Match super
blendable blushes I have these shades
innocent flush which is a gorgeous kind
of apricot a peachy shade I have a baby
blossom which is a light cool toned pink
and then I have rosy outlook which is a
cool toned rosy shade I'm going to go
ahead and swatch them for you guys
they're not super super pigmented or
anything like that but honestly they
just are so blendable you can work these
colors up to like a full-on beautiful
beautiful color on your cheeks and they
really are so soft I mean like I said
they're not amazingly pigmented but
they're really really creamy and soft
and the blend ability is just amazing so
there are the three of them I have a
rosy outlook baby blossom no yeah baby
oh baby blossom and then innocent plush
they're gorgeous I really really love
them let me show you a close-up of the
product this is innocent flush this is
baby blossom and then this one is rose
yellow okay I love those toasty shades
so those are absolutely fantastic like I
said I feel like sometimes they do get a
little bit of hype somebody will talk
about it like a big youtuber and
everybody will be like all about it and
then suddenly it just dies down again so
I don't know
love them alright the next thing I want
to talk about is a fantastic primer that
will extend the wear of your makeup it
is not going to fill in your pores that
is not going to hydrate your makeup it
is literally just going to extend to
where this is the wet and wild coverall
primer I love it I feel like nowadays
primers have gotten so overdone like
they really fill in your pores but they
don't extend your makeup or they really
really hydrate your skin but they don't
extend your makeup or they make your
skin look really really glowy but they
don't extend the wear of your makeup so
what I love about this is that that is
all it does it is a makeup wear extender
my makeup will last like 24 hours if I
wanted to when I wear this underneath my
foundation it's amazing it's got kind of
like an Elmer's glue sort of consistency
to it it's not super super tacky but it
pretty much looks like Elmer's glue and
literally it will just sink into your
skin really really quickly it will feel
like there is nothing there it's not
going to fill in your pores or do
anything like that but it will extend
the wear of your makeup so if you are
interested in extending the wear of your
makeup go ahead and pick up that
wet-and-wild coverall primer all right
let's talk about a fantastic concealer
super super heavy duty coverage I think
the reason this one doesn't get hype is
because it came out at the same time as
the maybelline instant age rewind
concealer so it's the same sort of
concept this is the Revlon age defying
targeted dark spot concealing treatment
I have this in the lightest shade which
is called pale or light it has the same
sort of tip applicator this one's a
little Messier I don't like it as much
but this is amazing if you want to cover
dark spots if you want to cover your
under eye I love covering my acne
scarring and also any active breakouts
with this it's absolutely amazing super
blendable super super full coverage if
you are looking for a very full coverage
concealer at the drugstore check out
this one from Revlon it's really really
fantastic and nobody talks about it
because it goes like head-to-head in
competition with the maybelline one and
the maybelline one is so hyped up
everybody loves it and everybody has it
that I feel like this one just gets no
glory whatsoever but anyway very very
good the next thing I want to talk about
is a product that has been discontinued
that I'm obsessed with and the reason it
probably got discontinued is because
nobody bought it except for me
this is the covergirl plus ol a CC cream
tone rehab foundation in 105 ivory if
you've been watching my channel for
you probably seen me go through multiple
of these I'm like in my empties videos I
talk about it all the time the best CC
cream in my opinion better than the it
cosmetics one I love it it's gorgeous it
gives great coverage
it definitely color corrects it's so
blendable I just blend it in with my
fingers on days where I don't have time
to like really really get ready in the
morning if I woke up late or something I
always use this I'm so bummed that it's
just continued if you can find it I did
get this one at a discounted price for
like 695 if you can find it at your
Walgreens or wherever I would definitely
recommend picking it up because it's
absolutely fantastic alright and then
the last thing I want to talk about is a
mascara this is the wet and wild max
volume plus mascara I love this mascara
if you like really really nice like
wispy long like natural eyelashes you
would really really enjoy this I feel
like it really defines my lower lashes
really nicely but when I use it on my
upper lashes it just makes them really
flowy and like feathery and butterfly II
it makes them very pretty like I really
love the way it looks um
the wand is really interesting it's kind
of like a hourglass sort of shape or a
pear shape it's like bigger at the
bottom and then skinnier at the top
love it love the formulation it never
like bleeds underneath or Ghassan top of
my eyelid I always I always get mascara
that transfers up here it never does
that great formulation it's like $2.99 I
believe they also have a waterproof
version nobody talks about it you should
get your hands on it
alright guys so those were products that
nobody talks about from the drugstore
let me know if you would like to see
high-end and also if you would like to
see skin care hair care all that stuff
because I have a lot of products that I
feel like nobody talks about so thank
you so much for joining me again
tomorrow's video will be the Smashbox
color correcting Stix review and
swatches and also demo and yeah I will
see you guys in tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
