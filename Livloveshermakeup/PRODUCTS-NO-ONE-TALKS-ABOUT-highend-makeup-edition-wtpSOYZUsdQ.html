thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day in
this video I am continuing my little
products and nobody talks about I guess
it's like it's not even a miniseries I'm
only doing four of them but I have done
a video on products nobody talks about
from the drugstore and today's video is
going to be on products nobody talks
about from like high-end brands like
sold at Sephora and then I will be doing
one on haircare and speaking of hair I
pair in my mouth and I also will be
doing one on skin care so those will be
coming up in the next couple of weeks
but anyway let's just get right into it
let's talk about some high-end products
that I don't feel like people talk about
very often even if they get a mention
once in a while they never get like
hyped up whatsoever and they should so
the first one I want to talk about is
the Tarte couldn't essentially travel
chic five and one eye shadow palette
this is what it looks like
absolutely absolutely beautiful
packaging I was a little worried when I
got this I found it on sale and it was
funny about two weeks ago it popped back
up on the sephora website so keep your
eyes open every time I see this it is on
in the sales section on the support
website I got mine about six months ago
and then it popped up again like earlier
you know so it's kind of strange I don't
know if it's like a discontinued item or
if it's something that keeps coming back
but I see it on the sephora website
quite frequently and at like different
times like a year ago six months ago two
weeks ago things like that so keep your
eyes open this is a fantastic palette I
believe I got this for about $24 which
is a pretty good deal considering you
get some gorgeous eyeshadows in here so
you get five different eyeshadows and
just the color range in here is stunning
I was a little iffy about getting this
because personally I don't like a lot of
the Tarte palettes like the ones that
come out during the holiday season I
really don't like I feel like they feel
like sandpaper they're so neutral I mean
I just can't get a really nice iLook
with them but I also but I personally do
like like the Tarte ledge palettes I
don't have the first one but I have the
in bloom love that formulation love the
formulation of the little round palettes
that they have as well but I wasn't sure
about this one the only reason I got it
was because it was on sale but it's
amazing beautiful beautiful formula I
mean they swatch so nicely they go on
the ice
nicely they blend like a dream and that
green shade oh look at that isn't that
gorgeous and I just love the way that
they put this palette together I feel
like it's so different and it's so
beautiful in like the fall season you
get a nice selection of mattes and
shimmers they're just so pigmented and
beautiful and I don't know why nobody
talks about this literally even when it
released like if it came out and was
brand new I still didn't hear anybody
talk about it I actually think I've
typed this palette name into like the
youtube search bar and there were maybe
one or two videos so yeah if you ever
see this pop up on these sephora.com
website definitely get it it's beautiful
the colors are very very dark and kind
of chocolatey but it's very very pretty
and kind of like an unusual color
selection especially with that green
shade so that is the first high-end
product nobody talks about this thing
that one is from bare minerals and this
is a gorgeous palette and recently I saw
this on the all TOCOM website again and
this is the bare minerals bare minerals
ready eyes shadow palette it doesn't
have like an exact name but it looks
like this you get a bronzer two blushes
and then a bunch of eyeshadows and these
eyes shadows the ready formula from bare
minerals is absolutely amazing they are
the standout in this palette these two
shades right here this one is called
bragging rights and hoopla hoopla look
at those colors absolutely absolutely
stunning a way for like they got stains
from the Tarte palette but let me show
you them swatch they are so pretty
together and this I got the formulation
on these amazing absolutely beautiful
they almost look like they have a foiled
effect to them and I just feel like it's
a gorgeous gorgeous palette um
the blushes are just okay and I feel
like this bronzer right here the
high-dive is quite okay pretty it has
kind of like a Reddy undertone in it so
it will I don't know if it looks amazing
on fair skin tones in my opinion it
feels like a warm undertone maybe I
personally have a cool undertone so I
feel like it looks a little muddy and
red on my skin and the blushes are
pretty I really like this kind of fried
Lady blush but the shadows are just
amazing here's this one right here
called ritzy it's a beautiful like dirty
green color you pull my sleeves up Oh
gorgeous and I just love the way these
go on they blends like a dream
and again I recently saw this on the all
PSICOM website it was not in the sales
section so just look under bareMinerals
and hopefully you can get your hands on
that all right the next thing I want to
talk about is the Sephora brand mascara
and I feel like Sephora the Sephora
brand is actually not that expensive I
wouldn't really consider them completely
high-end maybe some of their products
but this mascara is only 12 dollars
which is pretty much the price of like a
drugstore mascara and nowadays and this
is amazing nobody talks about this I
have mentioned this so many times on my
channel I am wearing it today
I love it I absolutely love it it is
amazing it's got great packaging and the
wand is so itty bitty you can get like
right onto those little tiny lower
lashes you can go like this you can go
like this it makes your upper lashes
look amazing with two coats that's what
I'm wearing today like I said love it
like this is an amazing mascara and I
feel like nobody talks about it if you
have 12 dollars to spend purchase this
instead of a drugstore mascara alright
so the next product I want to talk about
to have on my lips right now and I
remember reviewing this I love these
these are the Lancome sign lover my gosh
I can't read that
they just say shine lover lipsticks
these are basically like a hydrating
foam they're really not like a lipstick
but they are very pigmented this color
that I have right here is in 346 and
it's gorgeous first of all beautiful
beautiful packaging and I don't know I
just feel like nobody talked about these
they came out kind of at the end of like
last summer and all the colors were
really bright and in-your-face and I
ended up picking up two shades and I
have this one and another one which is
like a bright coral color I can't find
it right now but let me go ahead and
swatch it for you guys it's just a
gorgeous color it really matches the
shirt I'm wearing I love it and all of
them look like this they're super super
shiny they pretty they stay pretty darn
shiny on the lips I think that was their
claim was that this is supposed to stay
glossy on your lips at all times I feel
like it does kind of wear down after
some time that it leaves like a stain on
your lips so comfortable to wear like I
don't even feel like I'm wearing
anything on my lips right now and I feel
like it's very very pigmented for like a
balm so really really gorgeous love
these inanc oh I
like the full name below for some reason
it doesn't have it just says shine lover
lipstick on it but I feel like there is
a different name for this so I will of
course link it below in the description
bar but really really fantastic love the
way they look on the lips really really
nice interesting color selection super
super bright colors and they do stay
relatively comfortable and glossy on the
lips and then you guys can see they kind
of have a sustaining effect really cool
alright the next products I want to talk
about I feel like sometimes people talk
about but not as much as they should be
if that makes sense like they should be
talking about them more these are the
Illamasqua powder blushes they come in
pretty crappy packaging for the price
but these are the easiest blushes to
blend ever ever they are so smooth and
creamy this shade right here is called
lover which is a matte absolutely
stunning they all have this kind of like
white base almost that like is mixed
into the colors which is really strange
but it gives you like a full coverage
look on your cheeks it almost covers
like these blushes cover it's a very
very strange but this is the shade lover
really really beautiful kind of peachy
color I just want to show you guys
quickly how easy these blend out do you
see that
well they literally just blend out like
a dream and I feel like more people
should talk about them because they are
so incredibly gorgeous I have another
color here called thrust which is a
beautiful kind of like magenta color
really really stunning beautiful and
then then let me show you the swatch
right there you can really really shear
it out as well if you want to and then
the last one I have to show you guys is
Katie which is one of the most popular
shades like if people were to talk about
these blushes they always talk about
Katy however all of them aren't spore
formulated formulated formatted like the
same they all have that beautiful
beautiful kind of like coverage to them
it's very very strange but I do feel
like people talk about Katy I just
wanted to show this one because it's
probably the most popular it's a very
very cool toned pink with like a milky
undertone it's gorgeous can you see that
really really beautiful but honestly all
of the blushes are like this even the
ones that have a little bit of glitter
and shimmer in them I do have a few of
those as well but look how that's
covering like my veins and things like
that like these
actually have coverage to them so if you
can get your hands on some of the
Illamasqua blushes honestly half of mine
I purchased on Colt look they were half
the price really really good deal and
they just are beautiful you just can't
go wrong with these alright the next
thing I want to talk about is the Marc
Jacobs genius gel supercharged
foundation everybody talks about the
sister product to this little foundation
here which is the remarkable foundation
I personally have not tried that I don't
feel like anybody really talks about
this all that much I know that it was
kind of big when it first released but
then everybody just stopped talking
about it like nobody talked about it
anymore if you have fair skin Marc
Jacobs makes really fantastic
foundations that will most likely match
you this shade right here is number 10
ivory light it's a beautiful beautiful
match for my skin tone this looks like
skin I mean it looks like skin on the
face it's got a gorgeous gorgeous little
pump pretty bottle it's a very pricey
but honestly it's so worth it in my
opinion it really looks like skin I just
love the way this goes on absolutely
absolutely stunning it leaves a little
bit of like a fresh sort of glow to your
skin but you can completely get rid of
that if you want to set it in with
powder so there it is this color is
actually a little light for me right now
which is amazing because normally
foundations are always dark on me so I
tend to reach for this like I don't know
usually in the winter even though right
now it's the winter so I don't know I
feel like it is quite like maybe I need
to get the shade down but honestly
amazing formulation lasts all day it
looks like skin it just makes your skin
look beautiful
and I think I'm sure that the Marc
Jacobs remarkable one is really great
too
I feel like people got really excited
about that one because it is full
coverage this one is not it doesn't
claim to be and it really is not full
coverage but it's absolutely stunning on
the skin so if you have the money to
spend on this guy I would definitely
check it out go ahead and like swatch it
on the back of your hand at Sephora the
beautiful beautiful finish it's just
amazing it's amazing alright the next
thing I want to talk about is this
little guy right here this is the lorac
unzipped cheek palette everybody talks
about the lorac unzipped palette like
the eyeshadow palettes I don't own those
yet which is crazy because they look
amazing but I got this for $25 yes
$25
the alterna-prom website there are some
gorgeous shades in here they are super
pigmented I love the shade range super
travel friendly really sleek little
palette you get a very very bright pink
called unashamed which looks like this
you get underrated which is a beautiful
kind of rosy color and then you get the
shade unapologetic which kind of reminds
me of Max Sun bask it's right there and
then you get the shade on a match
unimaginable which is a gorgeous kind of
coral shade so there they are let me go
ahead and swatch them for you guys
absolutely gorgeous and I feel like the
color selection is really beautiful I'm
sorry if I handled a little stains from
that Tarte palette but really really
gorgeous I like that you get a bronzy
color you get a really bright pink I
feel like anybody would love this
palette and for $25 for blushes like
really really really good deal people
need to talk about this more because
it's amazing I'm sure it's just as good
as the eyeshadow palettes as well
alright and then the last design I
talked about is a foundation from the
Sephora brand this is the Sephora
Thompson fusion or ethereal natural
finished foundation this released last
year there was a lot of fuss about it
when it first came out and then it just
died down nobody talked about it after
about a month so this is basically the
reason I wanted to talk about it today
also is because right now water
foundations serum foundations are so
popular like they're so in right now
every single brand Stila becca tarts
everybody's releasing one and sephora
did it first they released those the
last winter and it's beautiful it's
absolutely gorgeous it comes with a
little dropper and let me show you guys
it looks like this beautiful beautiful
consistency it's watery it's just like
the Stila one just like me becca one
very very watery it's got that kind of
silicone like texture to it which i
guess is a little different from bc
yellow one the Ceylon one definitely
feels more like water whereas this one
has a little bit of a dimethicone feel
to it but I love it because you
literally can blend this with your
fingers like so easily it is absolutely
absolutely gorgeous beautiful beautiful
lightweight foundation and I feel like
nobody talks about it
more I feel like at one point people did
talk about it but nobody talks about it
anymore
and I'm surprised because you know all
of those water and serum foundations
that have released you know Sephora
started it and then on top of that this
is half the price of those foundations
so if you are interested in trying out a
water foundation or a serum foundation
definitely check out these Sephora
ethereal natural finish foundation first
because it is you don't like half the
price and my shade is I braids number
ten alright so those are products that I
feel like nobody talks about from the
high end like Ulta and Sephora I was
going to say high end drugstore no just
from Sephora and also just high-end
makeup products that I feel like don't
get enough hype I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you in tomorrow's bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
