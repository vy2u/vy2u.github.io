today I thought it would be fun to talk
about some products that shook me yes
cooked me they shook me they shocked me
they cooked me okay so I thought it
would be fun to talk about some products
that really shocked me and like it oh my
god kind of way like oh my god was the
best thing I've ever put on my face kind
of way or in a way that was kind of like
oh my god this is very disappointing
kind of way I will continue to do you
know weekly favorites videos I will
continue to do product fails videos but
I just thought this would be fun and
kind of trippy to go back and forth
between products I really like and then
products like I'm not really into so let
me know if you like this style this is
going to be part one so let's go ahead
and jump right into it so the first item
I want to talk about is a product that
shook me in a good way it shocked me it
was really really surprising when I
first used it and it is the lorac
unzipped palette ooh this is the
original edition it is what I have on my
eyes today I'm wearing the shade
unconditional and unreal
I'm unconditionally my crease and then
on my lower lash line and then I have
unreal on my lid it took me about three
minutes to put this eye look together
for both eyes absolutely amazing these
are so buttery and smooth and creamy
very reminiscent of the lorac Pro
formula and the funny thing was I picked
this one up and the lorac unzipped gold
and I tried out the lorac unzipped gold
first it was nothing like this one so
when I tried this one out I really
didn't think I was going to be like oh
my god it's the best thing ever but I
was shocked it was beautiful very very
blendable love the shades in here they
definitely have that more rosy hue to
them however I feel like these shades
have a lot of depth there's something
about them where they just have a lot of
depth like these shades over here
especially you'll be leaning a little
more on like the brown tone side but
then you still get those berries in
there
beautiful beautiful palette would highly
recommend that as one there shocked me
right off the bat all right next we have
two blushes that shocked me in a not so
good way they are the Physicians Formula
Muro Muro butter of blushes now I do
have the first two shades that came out
and want to try the other two shades out
because they look a little more
pigmented they look more like colors I
would like to wear on my cheeks but the
two I have here are plum rose as well as
natural glow pretty darn sure I'm gonna
declutter these you guys I was so
unimpressed with these now I love the
mubaru butter bronzers so when I started
to put these on I was like there's gonna
be the best thing ever and I was shocked
I was very disappointed at how these
looked on my cheeks this one right here
which is called natural glow is
definitely more of like a
I guess peachy sort of highlight it
kinda reminds me of the highlight that
comes in that peach glow palette from
Too Faced it's really really lackluster
does not look very good on my cool tone
skin was not into that and then this guy
right here which is called plum rose is
super super ashy on my skin now a lot of
people seem to like this it does not
look good on me I have a cool tone
complexion I am pretty darn fair but
this just doesn't look good on me so I
started using it as a transition color
for my eyes and I do like it for that
but overall I was really really
unimpressed with these when I first used
them and unfortunately I'm still pretty
much not shocked by them at all they
really gave me kind of a bad taste in my
mouth and I was just like oh that kind
of ruins it for me as far as the
Physicians Formula more more butter
blushes are concerned I will try the
other ones out because I want to give
like a fair opinion on but those two
really shocked me and a not so good way
all right the next product I want to
talk about is the bite Beauty agave lip
masta shocked me the first time I use
this I was absolutely amazed it is the
best lip product I have ever used hands
down and this is coming from a
professional flutist okay I really
really don't have good lips my lips are
always checked they have blisters on
them they have sores on them i overwork
my lips all the freaking time so when I
see that I can use this on stage when I
say I can use this tonight before going
on stage and I have beautiful smooth
glowing lips when I wake up in the
morning I feel like that says a lot if
there is one overnight treatment that I
would recommend to you guys as far as
lips are concerned it is a by Beauty
agave lip mass this is my third or
fourth tube I'm very serious about this
product it is absolutely wonderful would
HIGHLY highly recommend to you guys I
was shocked the first time I used it I
woke up in the morning and I was like
holy this is the real deal so I
love that alright next we have two brow
products from covergirl that shocked me
in a not so good way these are the
covergirl what is this called brow and
liner powder in the shade 815 blonde and
then this guy right here is called the
covergirl easy breezy brow shape and
defined gel in soft blonde these are the
worst brow products I have ever used
hands down I was shocked
anima shocks when I started using these
this little guy right here you can hear
it kind of has like this little ball in
it so basically it's like this little
powder applicator sort of thing it's got
a very very bendy little flexible wand
and it leaves powder obviously in your
eyebrows my problem with this that my
problem with this was that while I was
putting it in I notice
was going on very very clumpy it was
leaving like a little as you guys can
see little dots of like powder all over
my face and then it started to travel
throughout the day even when I would
seal it in with this brow gel right here
I was so unimpressed and this brat right
here it looks like it's gonna be a blond
color look at that what does that look
like to you this is like pure white okay
I am a natural dirty blonde and right
now I haven't colored my hair for a
while so I was expecting this to work it
literally just looked white in my brows
so those were products that really
really shocked me in a bad way alright
next we have the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills to Cole Guerrero goloka to this
shocked me in a great way in a very very
good way is what I have on today if you
guys are curious it is absolutely
beautiful the shade I'm wearing is
called Forever Young which is my
favorite out of all the shades in here
now what shocked me about this was just
the pigmentation level this actually
shocked a lot of people in a bad way
because a lot of you told me every time
I use this I get glitter on my face now
today I used it the way that a lot of
you were saying you used it with which
was with a fan brush and I do notice it
looks a little chunkier on my skin today
what I recommend to you guys I know I've
said it over and over but getting a
small buffing brush and really buffing
this into the skin and then going in
with a fluffy brush to remove that
excess glitter or chunkiness it really
looks gorgeous on the skin I was
absolutely shocked I was shocked by the
amount of pigmentation that this palette
has I mean honest hacia beverly hills
glow kits are very pigmented to begin
with but the amount of pigment on these
particular ones was absolutely insane I
was just I was really really shocked so
those are a few shades right there
absolutely beautiful this was a palette
that shocked me I really loved it it's
something I'm very happy to have in my
collection alright next we have a little
spa to you tool that I got in some sort
of boxy term I think last month this is
supposed to be a face scrubber okay and
I looked it up because I was like this
cannot be a face scrubber it feels so
freakin crispy and horrible to the touch
I tried using it on my face and I was
shocked I was shocked at how much this
actually hurts how much it felt like it
was pulling at the skin if you have this
do not use it on your face
now I thought honestly this must be a
joke like this is probably something to
use on your feet or something like that
I did some research they actually expect
you to use this on your face believe do
not do that it is so scratchy it is so
abrasive please do
use this on your face I now use it on my
heels but I'm going to go ahead and toss
it cuz it's really really weak for the
feet but it's too harsh for the face but
I was shocked when I first use this when
I first unboxed it I was like are people
actually using this on your face please
be careful with your face this is way
too abrasive to be rubbing around on
your face alright next we have two
blushes here or I guess I should say a
whole blush formula that really shocked
me the first time I use it these are the
Illamasqua powder blushes in the matte
formula there is nothing like this on
the market now I used to collect these
when you could get them at Sephora this
particular shade right here is called
tremble beautiful beautiful kind of hot
coral shade and then this one right here
is called Katie I do have Katie on at my
cheeks today which is a beautiful soft
pink color very much cool toned pink has
a little bit of a white base and
gorgeous on the skin
now I'm really sad that you can't pick
these up at Sephora anymore because when
I first use these I was shocked at how
beautiful they looked on the skin these
are so creamy so buttery they're the
softest lips you will ever touch softer
than the Tarte blushes softer than the
two face blushes these are the best they
are just absolutely beautiful I don't
talk about them as much when people ask
for recommendations because I know you
actually have to purchase them from the
illamasqua comm website now and I
believe there is like a special fee for
shipping over to the US like I think it
was like eight or nine dollars last time
I checked it not everybody wants to pay
eight or nine dollars you know
especially when you're buying like a
twenty thirty dollar blush like this but
these are beautiful and when I first use
them I was absolutely shocked I don't
have any blushes in my collection that
go on to this game I like the Matt Elam
Aska blushes deal with alright next we
have a product that really shocked me in
a bad way and I've been trying to use
this a little more a lot of you were
asking me to update you on this this is
the pur cosmetics no filter blurring
photography primer this was sent to me
in exchange for an honest review from
octoly as well as pure cosmetics and I
really didn't like this but the first
time I used it I was shocked because I
basically put it on the back of my hand
and as you guys can see it looks like
it's like a white liquid where you start
rubbing it in and can you guys see that
there is a super super strong gold shift
going on here now I'm someone who does
have a cooler complexion although I love
gold highlight or like a gold prime or
something that gives me a little bit of
a glow this is like yellow gold and it
just makes me look kind of sickly I
don't know what it is I tried using it
as a highlight a lot of you recommended
I should try it that way
tried using it with the damp beauty
blender putting it on top of my
foundation and unfortunately it just
moved my foundation and moved my powder
and moved the makeup that was already
there I don't think it works well as a
primer I just really don't like this I
know I mentioned it in my last product
fails video but this is definitely going
to be decluttered so that shocked me in
not such a good way because I thought it
was going to be this beautiful pearlized
sort of primer then it just heard like
gold on my face and I was not expecting
that alright next we do have two wet and
wild highlights that shocked me in such
a good way my friend actually sent these
to me we are makeup swapping a buddies
I'll go ahead and liquor Instagram down
below her name is Trina she's wonderful
so I have a really hard time finding the
limited-edition collections from wet and
wild so she sent me the sweetest bling
which is their mega glow highlighting
powder which is a beautiful beautiful
pink kind of big Chalet powder and then
here we have lilac to reality and these
are incredible they are very very
intense they are so beautiful the
pigmentation almost reminds me of like
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills glow kit
with uh what's her name Nicole Barrera I
just totally forgot her name but these
are incredibly beautiful um this one
right here lilac to reality does have a
little more chunkiness to it but it's
still beautiful on the skin and then
this pink one right here this has
quickly turned into one of my favorite
beautiful pink highlights on the skin I
would say it's right between like a
baked chalet and kind of powdery sort of
highlight but you can see next to the
Nicole Guerrero ones it is super super
beautiful so I love these I was shocked
when I first put them on my face I tried
putting this lilac to reality like all
over my cheeks and I did not expect that
pigment level so I was very much shocked
and I think that these are absolutely
beautiful and lastly I have another
product that was sent to me in exchange
for an honest review from octel II as
well as graftobian professional makeup I
was talking about this on snapchat
really really tried to get this to work
that I was shocked the first time I used
I actually use it on snapchat for the
first time I tried baking my under eye
with it and it immediately just like
sucked all the oil and moisture from my
face now this is wonderful if you have a
very very oily t-zone
and you need to stay matte in your
t-zone but I don't recommend using this
anywhere else on your face this
particular shade is called coconut cream
it says it's the luxe cashmere HD
setting powder and I really just can't
bake with this and usually with like a
loose powder like this I purchased these
kind of things to bake with but
unfortunately I really
only set my t-zone with this and I am
combo skin so he's um normal skin if you
have sensitive skin or I'm not sensitive
skin but if you look like dry skin or
mature skin this is going to make you
look like a prune it literally just
stuck to the moisture out of my skin I
was absolutely amazed so I feel like it
shocked me in a way like oh my god it
really controls the oil in at my t-zone
but I also shocked me like holy I
cannot bake with this because it sucks
the moisture out of my skin so anyway
guys those are at products that shocked
me let me know down below if you have
tried any products lately that have
shocked you and I guess I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
