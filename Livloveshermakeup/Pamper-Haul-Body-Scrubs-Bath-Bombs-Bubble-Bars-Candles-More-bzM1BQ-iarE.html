channel today I have a pamper haul to
share with you guys I recently placed an
order on the Ulta calm website the lush
calm website the Pacifica website as
well as which city WIC so I wanted to
walk you guys through all the bath and
body post handle products that I picked
up so let's go ahead and start with lush
the first two items I ordered we're the
bright side bubble bar as well as the
blue skies and fluffy white coats bubble
bar so I do have these already in my
collection I have probably two more uses
left from my other little blocks that I
got in my last haul but these are really
really beautiful I love the sense this
one is very citrusy this one kind of
smells perfumey so those are really
wonderful they're about 695 apiece but
you can cut them into five or seven
different sections and then you have
five to seven different advance products
for all different rates so I really
enjoy those I also did take up some
bubble ruins I really like the bubble
rooms because they do get bubbles they
change the color of your water and on
top of that they really do moisturize
the skin I don't find this book the
bubble bars like moisturize as much as a
CO so I did get Rose jam which smells
really really good and then I also did
pick up yuzu and Coco this one smells
like coconut a little bit of like cocoa
powder and also lemon so I'm super
excited to try that one how it's and
then I did pick up one of the items
that's going to be discontinued this is
called a fist banger this is an
apple-cinnamon
bath bomb and it smells incredible and
I'm so sad but they are discontinuing
this so it's a huge bath bomb as you
guys can see apparently lush is
discontinuing a lot of their products
including this next one I'm going to
show you guys as well so that's kind of
sad but I'm super excited to try that
out and then they're also discontinuing
the comforter shower cream so I love the
comforter bubble bar but I have not
tried the shower cream it says wash away
your worries with you reassuring at
blackcurrants sub sir
it's a cuddle in a bottle I really love
the spent on this is kind of like a
blackberry raspberry scent smells
amazing I don't know why they would just
continue this ever so I picked that up
and then finally I did also get candy
and this one is a a bubble bar as well
it smells a little sweeter than the
comforter and it just looks super super
cute with that little like candy thing
in the middle so I'm super excited for
that
all right now let me go ahead and show
you guys what I got from Ulta so the
first item that I got is one of the uLTA
Beauty advanced cleansing silicone sonic
facial cleansing brushes so if this is
kind of like a do before the luna pareo
mini which I do have that is $99 this is
around 30 or 40 so I did try this out
when I was at my friend's house and
honestly I cannot really tell the
difference between this and my luna so
this is what the actual sonic cleansing
device looks like you do put batteries
in at the bottom and then you kind of
have like a little handle here which is
really nice you just massage it all over
your face with different cleansers and
it does help to exfoliate and also it
helps to bring like circulation to your
skin so very very excited to have that
like I said I just tried that out of my
friends house and I honestly could not
tell a difference between this and the
Nefario mini which I have and then I
also did pick up two different products
from hemp so the first one is called the
yuzu and star fruit touch of summer for
fair skin tones daily moisturizing
gradual self-tanning creme I'm so
excited for this because half is a
beacon brand and they are obviously also
cruelty free you have broad-spectrum SPF
30 in here everything from 10 smells
amazing this is used in star fruit which
star fruit is my favorite fruit so very
excited to try this out a lot of people
were saying this is really natural
looking and I love that it does have the
SPS built in there and then this guy is
the white peach Rose a and peony herbal
shave gel the stuff smells amazing
I have purchases before it is a limited
edition so I would highly recommend
jumping on it and get your hands on it
it smells so good it really really helps
to get any nice clean at shave but it
doesn't leave your skin feeling oily
which I love all right and then all the
beauty also has some new a body scrub
that I was very interested in these are
basically like I know they're just
calling them the uLTA Beauty like scrub
so this first one is called moisturizing
seaweed body scrub this is made with sea
salt and jojoba oil and it smells really
really good it kind of has like a little
bit of a perfume Lee scent to it yeah it
has a little bit of a perfume scent to
it
these were I believe $18.50 apiece you
do get eight ounces of product in here
which is nothing for a lot bigger I
thought it said 18 ounces and I was like
that's such a good deal but I did end up
going ahead and doing D by 3 and then
get two free so technically they're
around like nine ten dollars each but
yeah that's the first one so that's emus
rising one and
next we have it the brightening vitamin
C 1 this one is a body scrub with alpha
hydroxy acids so I would recommend going
ahead and using this probably at night
times of age it can make you Sun
sensitive it also does have licorice
root in it and let me give this a whiff
oh my god this smells so good it's not
like grapefruit and this one have a
different consistency to it I feel like
these are going to be really good the
ingredients look amazing if you didn't
know the ultra brand is cruelty free
alright the next one that we have here
is super cool this is energizing coffee
and it literally looks like coffee
grounds I already have to look at this
one because I was like that is so
strange so and this is what the scrub
looks like and it smells like black
sugar as well as coffee so super excited
for that this one has vitamin E sweet
almond oil and coconut oil and caffeine
is really good for kind of helping out
with like cellulite it's going to get
rid of cellulite but it will help to
exfoliate your skin and basically get
the blood flowing so this would be nice
to use before going out like in a bikini
or something like that and then finally
the last one we have here is called the
detoxifying charcoal body scrub and this
one is made with mobil oil sweet almond
oil and sesame oil and this is what it
looks like and let's take a look at this
one I haven't looked at this one oh wow
this one literally looks like Adi bosha
charcoal poor pudding do you see that
kind of smell that literally out of
sight so that looks really interesting
as well so I'm very excited for those
crepes I will keep you guys updated now
let's go ahead and talk about the
candles that I did pick up so I picked
up some up from Pacifica because they
have all natural vegan soy candles so
the first one I got was called Hawaiian
Ruby guava and I will say I have already
burnt this one it does have a little bit
of supposed to build up at the top of
what overall I'm pretty impressed is
have a crazy crazy sense throw to it and
the actual scent is really really
beautiful excuse me the actual scent is
really really beautiful
so yeah Hawaiian Ruby guava smells
really good I also did pick this one up
which we call French
lilac and let's go happen to go with of
the Swan once exactly like lilac if you
like it be lilac scent from Bath and
Body Works this is like identical so
that is what the D French lilac scent
looks like and then the last one that I
picked off is called Tuscan up blood
orange and I'm super excited for this
one
it kind of smells like the Hawaiian Ruby
guava but that's okay here is what it
looks like it's really good I mean they
just smell super super fruity so I don't
know if I would purchase these during
like the wintertime although I'm in like
a warm climate now and technically I
should be burning like you know really
citrusy sort of tables all year long but
they do smell good and then I did also
place an order at which City wick so if
you first a candle that I got is called
SEMA and that is what it looks like I
have place in order with them before
they are all-natural cruelty-free
candles they have lead-free wicks and
they are a little more on the expensive
side but I had like a 30% off figured
we're having 30% off cooking booth store
so this one is from the Curiosity
Collection CMAs and it really does help
good so that's what it looks like has a
little little octopus on the front I
love that and then I also did it pick up
some other bigger candles from which
city wicks this first one is called
let's see here the first one gives 11 of
verbena so this is around the same price
as a smaller one so I don't really know
what that's all about but this one
smells great it's just like a really
really bright citrusy sort of scent
which again I love anything citrus
related and then finally the last leg I
have here to share in this haul is
another which city wicks candle this one
is called Hertz so how you say it horse
I feel like that's how you say it so
this one just smells like a bonfire I
did start to burn it a little bit and I
love how evenly it's burning you guys
are really good smell just like a
bonfire so anyway guys excuse my little
pamper haul and hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'm sorry if I'm hitting the
camera but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know down below if you
tried any new like bath and body sort of
products and what you would recommend I
