have a perfume collection or perfume /
body mist collection video for you guys
today so let's just start over here is
where I have my perfumes and body miss
it is in the corner next to my closet in
my bedroom so above the collection I
have three little quotes i just turned
envelopes inside out and wrote three
little quotes and kind of take them
going this way i don't know i just kind
of thought that was cute i like that so
um here is the collection
and I guess we'll just start over here
so right here I have my DKNY be
delicious golden apple and my DKNY
Golden Delicious or just be delicious
it's a think the blossom scent or
something like that I don't know it's
very very summery it smells very nice I
have two of my burberry Oda toilet
they're just the regular woman's
old-school delicious smelling perfumes I
have two of them here one is almost out
and I already bought it back up over
here I have let's see one two three four
five six seven eight nine nine a trial
or mini sizes of like travel sizes of
the bath and body works what are these
body mists so I have like you know
cranberry twinkle twisted peppermint
vanilla bean oh well things like that so
love those over here I have some roller
balls i have the DKNY again just love
love all that and then right here i have
a trial a trial size why don't keep
saying that trial / travel size of the
pink uh this is the body mist the fresh
and clean and then i have a full-size
right there of the fresh and clean and a
warm and cozy one right there full-size
over here i have a body fantasies what
is this is it's like a it's also body
mess but i got it at walgreens so it's
kind of like i know i'm not quite sure
but it smells really good it's called
sweet son rights fantasy i really like
it and then over here as you can see I
have this mirror that actually broke it
was hanging on the wall and it fell down
and broke off at the end over there as
you can see so there's no like hanging
it back up it is it's ruined so what I
decided to do was just kind of decorate
around the rim of it with um trial sizes
or just like deluxe sample sizes of
perfumes that I get you know from like
sephora or things like that or just in
general that I bought so over here I
have Tory Burch do your lady gaga
another dior burberry viktor and rolf
flowerbomb or berry dior and then I'm
quite sure what that is but i really
like these little sample sizes or
whatever they are I think they're super
super cute I especially love the little
glass bottle so I just don't want to
like you know put them away because I
think they're so so cute so I like to
keep them out like that um in the back
over here i have another body mist this
is the sexy little things from
Victoria's Secret it smells identical to
the paris hilton perfume i like to pair
those two together but i like the way
that looks so as you can see this area
kind of features the pretty i would say
the pretty bottles i guess or the
shorter bottles that would have gotten
muddled up with all of the taller like
body mess and things like that so i have
on the mirror let's see I have the
Jessica Simpson jessica simpson vintage
bloom and then i have one two three four
of the coach perfumes these two smell
very perfumey this one smells like green
tea and ginger and this one smells like
blossoms and fresh flowers is one of my
favorites over here I have fancy by
jessica simpson don't love that
fragrance but the bottle is very pretty
over here i have a little tin filled
with all samples just from you know like
sephora alta things like that that i
need to go through and yeah i like to
just toss some of those in my purse once
in a while and also just sometimes try
out new prefer perfumes during the day
and also they're great for travel um
over here i have a jennifer aniston
perfume and behind that i have the Stila
creme bouquet which i love um over there
i have a la vanilla this is the pure
vanilla scent i have four of these
victoria secret perfumes i have with the
secret charm pure daydream love spell
you know that kind of thing right here
is one of my favorites the paris hilton
perfume just the regular one over here i
have like a knockoff of the clingy
caffeine which is kind of funny um I
like it though I mean it's not bad it's
just whatever over there i also have a
rollerball of the clinic happy but i
don't know it's kind of cute i found it
at walgreens um and then right here is
one of my favorite body mist this is

four five five other body mists from
Bath and Body Works let's see i have
white tea and ginger plumeria a country
apple sheriff raesha pear puree yeah and
then over here I have another one of
those body fantasies body myths just
like that one from walgreens this one is
cotton candy and it smells amazing it is
one of my favorites and then back here i

love body mist from victoria secret love
those two cents and then over here I
have a sweet cinnamon pumpkin body mist
from Bath and Body Works that I got last
year on sale and i only use it really
during the fall and is taking me forever
to go through but that's okay um and
then over here let's see i have a
Elizabeth what is that Elizabeth what

couldn't read that Elizabeth James this
is the Nirvana white and then I have I'm
going through this little I see by chloe
perfume sample and then right there I
have the rollerball it is from bath body
works and it is in forever red and again
there's the clean happy so that is the
whole collection I you know have really
just I don't know I've tried to clear
some things out and whatnot and I'm
really trying to use a lot of this stuff
like you know a lot of the body mist
like I'm getting there with so I tell
myself that when I get through one of
them i can buy a new one but other than
that I really don't need any new
perfumes or body myths so that is the
collection and I hope you guys enjoyed
