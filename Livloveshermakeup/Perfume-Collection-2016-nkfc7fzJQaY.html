channel I am sharing my perfume
collection with you guys today so we're
gonna start here if you watched my
Beauty room tour video slash reveal for
2016 you would know that I have all of
my perfumes down there but I also have a
few little bottles that are here on top
of my Alex 9 series drawer where all my
makeup is so pretty much you just have
it here next to a few mercury glass
things and you guys see that hot pink
thing I'm wearing a hot pink robe right
now but anyway I wanted to show you guys
my organization and of course my
collection of fragrances the only thing
that I don't really store here or down
there are perfume samples I actually
store those in a big bin with all of my
other Beauty samples like haircare
skincare makeup all that kind of stuff
so those are actually in my club that
you made big bin umm but yeah let's just
start in this area so these are really
really small little tiny bottles they're
like hundred-point perk or 250 point
perks from Sephora and basically I think
what had happened was I just ended up
collecting a lot of these and it's funny
because they really don't reach for them
very often I do have them right there
instead of down there because they feel
like they get very cluttered down there
because they are very small so here I
have them on my Alex series 9 drawer
like I said and I have it on a serving
platter that I actually got from Aalto
strangely enough but anyway I'm gonna
show you guys what I have here so this
is flour bomb from Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf I have
Miss Dior right here I have a Burberry I
have been Lady gaga the DKNY I heart New
York the errand water lily Sun the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana white and I
have a tea you are one right there and
right here so one is pink one is purple
they are different in scent a little
Clinique happy I have a Michael Kors I
have the YSL black opium I have the
Dolce and Gabanna light blue I have a
Versace I have no idea what this is let
me look this has no name if you know
what this little pattern is on the top I
don't know is that Marchesa I don't
really don't know and then I have
Burberry here so those are all of my
little tiny ones again just like little
Point perks I probably won't be
collecting any more of those because I
just don't reach for them very often and
then right next to my little Alec series
9 drawer where those little mini ones
you look down and I have this little
table right here this little white table
is from Amazon I will link it below it
is an Ikea side table like a little
white table so it is very very short but
what I like about it is that I have
bird's-eye view on all of my fragrances
here so these are body mists and
perfumes and the way that I like to
organize them I of course like to have
this little candle burning all at the
time it makes this this corner smell
really good but I am wearing a robe
right now and I'm scared that I will set
myself on fire so as I'm reaching for
things to show you guys but I will let
you guys know along the way kind of what
my favourites are I do have them sort of
lined up so that ones that I reach for
quite often are towards the front and
also wants to have really cute little
bottles and then I have most of my like
my fragrance mists and things like that
towards the back but this is just kind
of how I have it set up for now I do
change it all the time you guys have
probably seen pictures on Instagram but
like I said I will link below where you
guys can pick up this little white desk
it's very very cheap I believe 23
dollars on Amazon and I like it because
it's like pure white and it just makes
everything looks super super bright on
top of it so I really love it so let's

favorites as you guys could probably
tell it's just the regular Burberry for
women you can get it on HauteLook

this is a great great scent and then

clean and then the last one is also from
Victoria's Secret this is sexy little
things so those are all of my fragrance
mists my perfumes and everything I'll
have to kind of swish them all back
together I will say sometimes because
they do have them really pushed back
sometimes it's hard to pick something
out and then it kind of makes everything
a little messy so if you have any ideas
on how I should maybe spread these out
or how I should organize it let me know
because I change it oh of the time and I
would love to know what you guys think
but anyway that is my fragrance
collection or my perfume collection for
2016 I hope you guys enjoyed this video
