my channel today I am sharing with you
guys a video all about beauty products
that are incredibly picky that I have in
my collection and these are products
that I absolutely have to use a certain
way I can't get all creative like you
usually can with makeup I can't get all
creative with using different brushes or
using a different technique it has to be
the same thing over and over and over
again or else I do not get the outcome
that I want I really do enjoy these
products though and I'm willing to put
in that extra effort so anyway let's go
ahead and jump right into it if this is
a pixie skin treats a nourishing
cleansing balm I did pick this up a last
week and I've already fallen in love
there are so many people to hate this
cleansing balm because it's a true true
cleansing balm and by that I mean it
does not rinse clean with water you have
to go in with a washcloth or a makeup
eraser or some sort of a towel and
actually take this off the skin no
because I have incredibly dry skin I
actually love this because at least a
little bit of something there and if I
do want to go in and double cleanse I
can get that residual anything off my
skin now plenty balms kind of started
this way and then they turned into this
other sort of contraption where you
literally put it on your skin and you
can rinse it clean with water we're just
such a cool invention I don't know how
they came up with that but a lot of
cleansing bumps are like that which is
why I think a lot of people don't like
this one but it can only be used a
certain way you will not be able to
rinse this off with just some water if
you do you will be sitting there with
slimy hands as well as a slimy face
because the oil will interact with the
water and you will not get it off your
skin so if you are gonna pick this up
just know that it does leave a little
bit of residue behind but it's really
really nice if you do have more mature
or dry skin so that is the first product
up next we have these Tila glitter and
glows I have two different shades right
here we have smoky storm as well as
diamond dust it doesn't really matter
which shade they are some of them have
different formulas however I have to say
these all need to be applied in the same
way so many people go in and they swipe
these on to the lid now and everybody
always ask me how I apply my steely
glitter and glows I stamp them on and if
I need to I would go in with a brush and
I will kind of blend so that it's not
going way up in my crease I'm just kind
of sloppy when I you know toss these
onto my lid but you guys the only way
you will ever get these on full impact
full impact full impact as well as full
color high
my glitter is by stamping this on you
cannot go and swipe it because you are
going to get streaking especially with
the duochrome formula so those are the
steal of glittering glows I love these
as long as these are used the right way
they are absolutely stunning another
product that has to be used a certain
way are definitely these Elora Geller
baked products so this is the baked
gelato swirl illuminator in the shade
and gilded honey and then over here we
have the baked gelato swirl vivid blush
in the shade plumberry
you can only use certain brushes when it
comes to this sort of formula as well as
just a big delay a sort of products in
general you need something very densely
packed you got to pick it up on the
brush tap off the excess and then really
really buff it into the skin if I go in
with a fluffy brush I can't even pick
the product off of the actual surface of
this I mean it's not just the pattern
it's because of how firmly pressed it is
but it's very smooth because it is baked
Soleil is you have to have a sigma after
35 where some sort of a densely packed a
blush brush and you go in you pick it up
tap off the excess then really really
buff it into the skin if you try and do
something a little too fluffy you're not
gonna like the way that this goes on
because guess what
it probably won't even go on moving on
to a mascara primer or a mascara base I
don't wear these very often but this one
right here from Smashbox it's called the
photo finish lash primer I never knew
how to properly use this until I saw a
video from Sephora they have a youtube
channel and they were demonstrating how
to actually use this primer and have a
death wand literally you won't be able
to see it but basically it's got short
bristles over here and then the longest
spiciest creepiest things over here and
I'm someone who loves clumpy lashes and
I can deal with little depth medieval
torture tool death ones like this but
this is so hard like if you put this on
and for some reason this tilts the
slightest way you're gonna poke yourself
in the eye you're gonna hurt yourself
now I was watching a video and actually
explained how to use this properly
you're supposed to swirl it up and let
me tell ya this is the only way that I
can use this last primer is by going
ahead and actually twisting the wand up
a lot of people do that with mascara as
well as lash primers in general but I
never was able to use this because of
the death whan until I actually learned
how to use it even for the lower lashes
you kind of start to with it the bigger
bristles and then you go down like this
so if you're going for the top lashes
you can start on either side and you
just go like this and you
work your way up in circular motions and
it applies mascara on top of it
absolutely beautifully this really does
help with thickness as well as length
and it finally guys we have the cover FX
custom enhancer drops the shade I have
right here is called halo which is a
beautiful beautiful kind of dual
chromatic color very multi-dimensional
is it a duochrome trichrome it's
something it's really moving that's okay
this is beautiful but I have to say I
would never in a million years be able
to apply this as highlight with a brush
the only way that this goes on for me is
with a damp sponge now I feel like
that's kind of obvious I think a lot of
people would apply this with the damp
sponge but my guy for a while there I
tried applying it with my fingers I
tried applying it with a brush and I
could just never do it so I either will
take a full dropper full of this not
necessarily a full dropper full with
this color because this is like a
duochrome kind of color but I'll take
about half a dropper full of this and
mix it together with my foundation and
just apply normally and that goes on
beautifully or I really have to make
sure I'm using a very very damp sponge
and I just kind of tap it on top of my
foundation and then I set in with powder
if you try and go in with this after
powder you're also gonna have a lot of
chunkiness and cakiness so this is one
of those products where I think I've
seen people trying to apply this with a
brush and they say oh my god I hate the
way it looks do not apply with a brush
this is a very picky product I would
only apply it with a damp sponge so
anyway guys that is it for a picky
products is their way or the highway let
me know down below if you have any picky
products in your collection are they
worth it or are they not worth it
alright guys I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
