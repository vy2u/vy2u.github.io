you so much for joining me I hope you
are all having a wonderful day today's
video is going to be all about tiny
little cute pallets we're talking about
pocket pallets or fun sized hits and
misses so these are pallets that can all
fit into the palm of my hand - they're
perfect for travel perfect for things
like that so I thought I would share
with you guys which ones are my
favorites the first one that is a
favorite actually stays in my purse at
all times and it is the torch young wild
and free I was going to say one while
Mac yeah wild and free eyeshadow palette
it's really really cute it's what I
brought on vacation with me comes in
beautiful mirrored gold packaging and
that basically lives in my purse so that
is definitely the first pocket palette
that I really adore it has a bunch of
neutral gorgeous gorgeous colors in it
and it's just perfect for travel the
second one I want to talk about is
actually a color correcting palette this
is probably my second all-time favorite
color correcting item I will be
decluttering some of my color correctors
starting in the fall because honestly I
do not reach for half of them my
favorite are the Urban Decay color
correcting fluids and this palette so
this is from NYX this is the color
correcting palette in 3c p04
this is what it looks like it fits into
the palm of my hand and this is perfect
to carry around in your purse absolutely
perfect you're getting lots of different
color correcting concealers in here
yellow tones kind of cancel out so
lowness the lavender shade in here else
which is kind of like lifts fine lines
and wrinkles and also cancels out
Salinas as well you're getting some
peachy colors for color correcting under
the eyes you get a nice minty green
color for color correcting redness it's
just an awesome little palette and it's
all tiny and adorable so I really enjoy
that and the next ones that I want to
talk about these are I'm just gonna
count them as one these are four these
are from Stila these are the perfect
meet perfect hue or perfect to you
perfect me know perfect to me perfect
cute palettes I got all of them and I
will not be decluttering any of these
these are absolutely amazing they are so
awesome and compact and travel friendly
they fits like right into my hand really
nicely you get a huge mirror and not
only are you getting eyes shadows in
here you're also getting two blushes in
every single palette so they have
and um like shades for different kind of
skin tones so no matter what you will be
able to find one that you like this one
is called fair / light and you are
getting two beautiful kind of cool tones
blushes in there you're getting a nice
eyeliner shade you're getting some
neutral colors a nice lid color as well
this one is light fashion medium and
this is what that one looks like again
getting a little more warm toned over on
this side as you can see but you still
have a nice like cool toned blush over
there the next one as you guys can
probably guess is medium / tan and this
is beautiful oh my God look at this one
talk about perfect fall colors you're
getting some gorgeous berries over here
some nice kind of bronzy colors here and
those two blushes are absolutely
beautiful and then my all-time favorite
one is actually the deepest one and this
is called tan / deep and this is just
like the epitome of fall look at this
palette absolutely beautiful nice orange
e tones you're getting some gorgeous
berry blushes in here just really really
beautiful so compact so travel friendly
and if you have not looked into those I
highly would recommend at least picking
up one of them they're absolutely
perfect for travel perfect to carry in
your purse and they are just the perfect
pocket palette
alright the next little pocket palette I
also do carry around in my purse this is
the Smashbox LA lights blush and
highlighting palette the one that I got
I believe is called
pink I think it's in the pinks so they
have a corals they have a berry and then
the Pink's this one has rich pink true
pink and highlight pink in it it's just
so compact and travel friendly you do
have a mirror here but as you guys can
see you get a nice darker blush you get
kind of like a medium tone and then you
get a nice highlighting shade depending
on your skin tone they're really really
beautiful and this thing is just so
small and compact and sleek so if you
are looking for a blush palette or a
like a highlighting palette to carry
around in your purse this is definitely
a really really good one the next two I
want to talk about should come as no
surprise the Urban Decay Naked basics
one and two palettes they do have but
Urban Decay Naked basics like three
coming out which I probably am going to
pick up but anyway these are awesome for
travel they're perfect little
pocket-sized palettes they're super tiny
and sleek the original Urban Decay Naked
basics has more warm tones so you can
see you get some more like dark Browns
over here I've been using this
particular palette this week using it
with my serpentina eyeshadow palette
from Kat
d it's a really nice little pallet to
grab when you're using a pallet that
maybe doesn't have a lot of transition
colors or doesn't have any brow bone
colors this is just perfect and it's so
tiny and compact you get a nice sized
mirror definitely more on the warmer
side and then the naked 2 basics it's
definitely more on the cooler side I
really like this one as well so here it
is and these are just awesome awesome
little pocket palettes now if you do not
want to pick those up because they are a
little more pricey I would highly
recommend going ahead and checking out
these Physicians Formula little pocket
pocket palettes right here these are
little quads that are awesome and
they're very very comparable to the
urban decay basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 so these are
called the matte collection quad
eyeshadows the first one is called
classic nudes this one reminds me a lot
of the Urban Decay Naked basics 1 it's
got more I guess like warmer tones you
could say you have a nice matte brow
bone color you have a transition and
then some kind of more warm tones there
and then this one is called Canyon
classics and Canyon classics is
definitely more cool toned again you're
not getting a huge mirror up here but
still very very compact and easy for
travel and here is the cooler toned one
again a nice matte all-over color and
you have a transition and then some
deeper kind of liner shades and whatnot
so I really like those as well if you do
not want to purchase the Urban Decay
Naked basics one or two you could
definitely check that one out
the next palette I want to talk about is
from ciaté and I love this it is a
little bigger but it's very long and
sleek this is the CIA Olivia Palermo
collaboration in the smoldering version
beautiful beautiful mirror here and
these are actually pretty darn big pan
sizes for what you're getting here I
love this palette for the fall time I
feel like this is like the perfect fall
palettes because you're getting some
nice dirty kind of greenish colors
you're getting some beautiful berries
you're getting a nice like sapphire blue
you're getting some grey Smokies this is
just a perfect little pocket palette I
love the size of it and it's just so
nice and sleek and compact so I really
enjoyed that one as well
the next one I want to talk about is
sort of like the same shape as this one
it still does fit into the palm of my
hand it's a little smaller than the CIA
is the hourglass modernist eyeshadow
palette in the obscura these are very
very pricey little eyeshadow palettes
but you know what they're fantastic for
travel so this is what it looks like on
the inside this is my favorite one but
this building what I have I actually
love the formulation on these a lot of
people say they do not like the
formulation on these but I really do
they're very very soft and buttery so
they do kick up a little bit of product
but I love this and I'm okay with how
this is laid out I know that sometimes
people were saying that colors were
getting muddled and mixed together as
long as your brush is small enough you
shouldn't have a problem but yeah very
compact makes little mirror in there
really nice little pocket palette as
well and then I do also want to talk
about this one from Tarte so this is the
rainforest of the sea palette super cute
fits into the palm of my hands love this
has a nice huge mirror this is what I'm
actually wearing on my eyes today
because after I pulled it out I was like
I need to wear that on my eyes I love
this it is a beautiful pocket foiled
palette so these eyeshadows are
basically foiled you have tons and tons
of gorgeous colors in here really really
nice quality really enjoyed that a lot
now let's go ahead and get into the
misses the first one we have here is
from the balm cosmetics this is called
the mont balm and this is what it looks
like again pocket little palette really
can't you open it up you do have a nice
little mirror you get four shades in
here and when i first got this little
pocket palette i really really loved it
but the more i used it that I noticed
that the shadow started to dry out more
and more I purchased this on HauteLook
and I know that sometimes hautelook does
have items that are going like out of
stock or out of season so I don't know
if I just got one that's a little older
but they do start to feel really really
dry now and I'm going to go ahead and
declutter this because I just don't
reach for it although the colors are
really beautiful I feel like the shadows
have really dried out the next one that
is a Miss for me is from Sephora this is
part of the Sephora house collection and
this is let's see here the sand
illusions baked eyeshadow palette I saw
one of my favorite youtubers talking
about this particular palette and I
thought it was so cute because again
very very compact easy to travel with
but you know what I'm just not that into
baked eyeshadows I feel like every time
I use the baked eyeshadow I want to foil
it so that I can get more high-impact
out of it basically more color more
vibrancy and I just never reach for that
this particular palette although the
colors are really pretty you have a few
like jewel tones there and although it
is very sleek
has wonderful packaging I just don't
really reach for this so I will be
decluttering that as well I also will be
decluttering this little tart quad right
here this is adorable it is called the
apple of my eye and don't get me wrong
this is so cute you don't have a mirror
here but you have four really gorgeous
shadows this is perfect if you are
someone who really likes warm toned eye
looks and I will be decluttering this to
one of my friends who really does like
those kind of like warmer eye looks it's
just something that I can do out in my
collection in two seconds and although
it is really travel friendly I wish I
had a mirror so that is a kind of Miss
for me and then the final myth is the
bare minerals ready eye shadow 8.0 in
the passion neutrals and I don't
remember if I mentioned this one at the
beginning of the video I really do like
the power neutrals this one has like
nice kind of forest green colors and I
really do like this formulation on the
2.0 and 8.0 formulas from bare minerals
but this one right here are the posh
neutrals although the packaging is
absolutely gorgeous rose gold I just
don't really reach for the colors in
here they're very cool toned and they're
just super pretty to look at but I just
never ever use them so I will be
decluttering this as well so anyway
those are my hits and misses as far as
pocket palettes are concerned I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know down
below if you have any little travel
friendly pallets that you absolutely
adore whether their eyeshadows or
concealer palettes or blush palettes we
would love to know and yeah I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
