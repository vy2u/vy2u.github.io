this video I am unboxing a my cup sugar
must have box for the month up februari
so if you guys are interested in seeing
what is in this month's box then keep on
watching alright let's just open those
bid it up I love the way it looks on the
inside it's a surprise love enjoy and
then you can see it's a little hard to
wrapping paper and a cute little
pamphlet I will of course read through
that he's got little sugar cookies on
the front of it which little hearts
which is so so cute and let's just break
open this wrapping paper and see what we
have in here oh by the way i will link
everything below if you guys are
interested in checking out this box that
is quite a pricey box it's not an
affiliate link by any means or a
referral link the one I'm leaving it's
just so you guys can see the price range
and everything like that it is the
pricier box but I love what I get every
single month so all right the first
thing I see in here is the B beauty
counter ya be I guess it's just be the
beauty counter cleansing balm and it
looks like this it is a cleansing balm
that melts into your skin hydrating epic
cleanses raspberry seed oil and
cranberry seed oil hydrate and
revitalize the skin while vitamin C
brightens the skin tone so that is what
it looks like this looks like it's
really really big size but a full-sized
let's see here beautiful so beauty
counter cleansing balm that is what it
looks like it says every ingredient
selected for safety and every ritual
created for beauty it actively promotes
the appearance of healthy skin by
reducing the signs of aging it says use
nightly massage on to dry skin with
fingertips and remove with warm deep
cleansing cloth so I guess you could use
this to remove your makeup or use it as
a deep cleanser I'll probably use it to
remove my makeup let's read it a little
bit about what it says in the pamphlet
let's see here it says the beauty
counter nourishing cleansing balm a
full-size is fifty dollars and that is a
full-size it says unlike cleansers that
leave you dry this formula uses
carefully sourced ingredients to remove
makeup and impurities while also
moisturizing the skin prepare to feel
pampered as you rinse it off with the
soft muslin cloth included there's a
muslin cloth that is included I don't
see it yet well I guess we will get to
the muslin cloth but anyway I guess it
comes with a little clock that is
included in there and that sounds nice
you could also if you have the makeup
eraser I love them
eraser from sephora i guess you could
probably also use that to get off any
sort of residue so that is very exciting
that is the first item that is
full-sized and that was fifty dollars so
already paid for the Box in itself but
the second thing I see here is the
fringe at home glass tray it looks like
this super super cute packaging let's
open it up so we can see oh it's so cute
it says hello beautiful I will probably
use this in the beauty room and that is
what it looks like it's just a little
tray a little glass tray really really
cute to maybe put some jewelry on I'll
