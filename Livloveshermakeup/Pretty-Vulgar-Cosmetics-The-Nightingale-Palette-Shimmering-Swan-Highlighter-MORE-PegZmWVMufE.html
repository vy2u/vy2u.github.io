to my channel today's video is going to
be for little rapid reviews on some
products from a pretty vulgar cosmetics
if you didn't know pretty vulgar
cosmetics is a new a brand to Sephora a
lot of you were asking you to go ahead
and try some of the items out so and
that is what I did I did pick up four
different items the first one is the
locket in a makeup setting spray which
does retail for $30 I also did pick up
the shimmering Swan highlighter which
does retail for $32 I picked up the
nightingale eyes shadow palette which
retails for $35 and then finally I did
pick up the feathers at mascara which
does retail for $24 so altogether for
four different products the total did
come out to a hundred and twenty-one
dollars which a lot of people are going
to say that's crazy crazy pricey and I
do kind of agree I feel like this is a
little overpriced I feel like the
setting sprays a little overpriced as
well as the highlight but I have to say
I feel like the eyeshadow palettes are
reasonably priced so anyway let's go
ahead and jump into the reviews I want
to start with the two items that I
really don't like the first one is the
feathers mascara and the second one is
the locket setting spray so let's go
ahead and start with the mascara first
of all I want to say I feel like a lot
of people are going to be purchasing
these items for the packaging and I
don't blame you if you are a true
collector like I am you are going to
want something like this in your
collection they are just absolutely
impeccable and beautiful very much
weighted gorgeous like even the settings
right this is glass because I mean this
is not plastic you know you are paying
for a packaging here and I think a lot
of people kind of realize that but
anyway this is what the feathers mascara
looks like you have a little bird or
their kind of logo at the top and then
you do have this gorgeous rose gold kind
of plaited thing here and then the
little pinstripes I mean I've never seen
such a gorgeous mascara tube I'm not the
biggest fan of this mascara you guys but
I am going to go ahead and use it up
because I want to have this in my
collection as like a backdrop and I know
that sounds so silly some people might
call me out in the comments section but
if you are a true collector this is just
something that you want to have like you
want to have it so I'm not going to be
repurchasing I don't think it's the
worst mascara in the world but it's
definitely not something that I would
recommend to you guys so anyway when you
first pull it out as you guys can see it
does have like a little
bits of boo penis at the top there I've
only had this for what like two weeks
now I probably used it eight or nine
times and I feel like the actual formula
is already starting to clump together so
I do feel like it's a mixture between a
very wet mascara and a very dry mascara
which kind of is not that great I
usually go for very very wet mascaras or
very very dry mascaras I feel like when
there's a mixture you just aren't able
to use that formula for as long so the
stopper in there as well really doesn't
pull off too much product when you
probably wand out you can see there are
some areas where the product really has
built up specifically right there kind
of in the spoon so this is a natural
bristle wand as you guys can see it is
kind of like a spoon
so if you do have very short lashes if
you want to curl them I think you would
like this I have I think one layer on
yeah one layer of this mascara on my
eyelashes today and I really really like
the way it looks but it's just not
something that's absolutely amazing I
feel like you can get just as good of a
mascara at the drugstore but the little
wand right here does remind me a lot of
the benefit roller lash although that
one is a rubber bristle this one is more
natural bristle so for the upper lashes
I do use the kind of scoopy side and
then for the lower lashes I flip it
around and then I go in I feel like it's
just not that great of a formula it's
okay I mean the eyelashes are pretty but
I prefer a little more volume I prefer a
little more definition and a lot more
length so this is not something I would
really recommend to you guys it doesn't
necessarily look very natural but I also
isn't very defined it's just kind of a
matte sort of mascara so I'm not quite
sure if I am going to keep it or return
it again I would want to keep it for the
packaging but I will also let you guys
know if I decide to go ahead and get my
24 dollars back alright next we do have
the locket in makeup setting spray so
like I said this is a glass bottle and
it's kind of like a perfume style so
this is where you would kind of like
spray the perfume on so this is actually
not the sprayer if you do lift it off
and this is what the bottle looks like
now I would say this is almost like a
pound like it really really weighs a lot
so the actual mist comes out like this
what I like to do is spray it above my
face and let it trickle down on to my
skin it does not have that sort of
nozzle that allows you to just spray it
directly onto your face like this it is
going to splatter and get all over the
place and actually start to move your
makeup a little bit
which I'm not a fan of now something
about the packaging here is I don't feel
like there was enough protection towards
the neck of the bottle what happens is I
spray it and then it starts to leak
around here and then you get a sticky
kind of like tacky residue here now I
really don't like setting sprays they'll
leave a sticky or tacky residue on my
skin or on the bottle so this is just
something I'm not a huge fan of I feel
like my Smashbox photo finish primer
water is way better than this I don't
notice that this helps with the
longevity of my makeup again a lot of
people are gonna say really you're gonna
hold on to that just for the packaging
what it literally does nothing I mean
this could be water in here and I
couldn't tell a difference I mean I'm
just being honest with you guys so I
don't know I might return this one but I
mean the packaging is super super cute
if you're hoping it's going to extend
the wear of your makeup I notice no
difference I do prefer my ELF setting
sprays my next setting sprays in my wet
and wild photo focus does a better job
than this so anyway those are the two
products I'm not super crazy about now
let me tell you guys about the products
I really do like so the first one is the
shimmering SWANA highlighter again
beautiful packaging it's like a blinding
silver it's almost like a little
portrait on the back you do have a
mirrored finish with the sticker you
open it up there is no mirror which I
wish there was but that's okay and this
is what to the actual highlight looks
like so I don't feel like it's going to
pick up a very true on camera it's very
hard with these bright lights I feel
like everything looks a little lighter
but the actual consistency of this is
very smooth very creamy I would say it
it's almost like a big Chalet so it's
got like a cream to powder sort of
hybrid thing going on but it still is
more powder than uh you know baked
chalet so anyway when I do put my finger
in there it reminds me a lot very
reminiscent of like the original Tarte
exposed formula like that super soft did
metha cone silicone like kind of slip
but when you do pick it up you do get a
little bit of a product that kind of
sticks out if that makes sense it's not
necessarily chunky it's very easy to
blend out on the skin but just a one
swipe swatch that is kind of what you're
getting here so now let me go ahead and
kind of blend it in so you guys can see
and this is just a little too dark for
my skin as a true highlight I'm wearing
this today as a blush topper but I want
to say if you have a medium complexion
if you have a deep complexion I would
recommend scooping this up I know it's a
little on the pricey side but it is
beautiful so it's kind of
a rosy color but with that silvery
iridescence in there at least a little
bit of a grayish tone now I am someone
who does pull a strong cool undertone I
do have two layers of self-tanner on
currently but this is just a little too
obvious it's a little too obvious as a
highlight so what I did today was I put
on my palladium matte blush in peach ice
and then I did go in with my lucky 522
tapered highlighter brush i swirled of
the product in there really really did
you guys see that really tapped off the
excess because you pick up a lot at once
and then I just went ahead and kind of
buffed it in on top of the blush as a
blush topper a lot of people say blush
toppers are not a real thing it works
for me so it's a real thing for me but
as you can see you just get a tiny bit
of Sheen there and you get a little bit
of color because right here even when
you blend it in in a certain lighting
you can see the silver you're add
essence is light but then when I kind of
shade it a little bit hopefully you guys
can see it's just a little too dark for
me now I'm all about working with darker
highlights and still getting a glowing
complexion and by using a darker
highlight but this one's just a little
too dark I'm going to keep it in my
collection because it makes an amazing
beautiful eye shadow and I really think
the formula is nice what I would like to
see them do is release more shades of
this because I think this is probably
one of the best products that you can
get from the line so if there's anything
that I would definitely definitely
recommend if you do have a medium or
deep complexion it is the shimmering
Swan highlight absolutely no issues with
the formula whatsoever it's a beautiful
formula alright and finally let's go
ahead and talk about the eye shadow
palette so this is the nightingale
palette I love this the actual feeling
of this this is like secret garden vibes
I don't even know it's got this weighted
material it is not by any means like
cheap cardboard it feels amazing in my
hands I kind of want to get the other
two eyeshadow palettes now even though I
know that those other two shades like
the pretty birdie and then the other one
I have colors like that in my collection
but the reason why I chose this one you
guys is because of the color selection
so you do lift it open you have a nice
sized mirror which I appreciate look at
the layout it is a birdcage I think that
is absolutely stunning and these colors
in here are giving me very very these
are tor visors cool matte vibes except
you get a lot of different finishes in
here
I am someone who does naturally have a
cool-toned complexion I love cool toned
colors I love anything that I can get a
smoky look with that is a little bit on
the easier side and this palette does
that for me I know a lot of people are
saying they're not a huge fan of the
eyeshadow palettes I haven't heard too
many people talk about this particular
one I've seen a lot of people talk about
the more colorful one and then the
neutral one but this one right here guys
is pretty darn good is it the easiest
palette to blend is that the easiest one
to work with in the world absolutely not
but as a company that literally just
started they've got a pretty good
formula going on here with the majority
of these and I will say there are some
hits and misses there are a few glitter
and few shades in here which I'm not a
huge fan of there are a couple that are
like foiled finishes that go on
beautifully there are a couple mattes
that aren't that great like this one
right here but then there are some
mattes in here that are absolutely
impeccable and beautiful so overall I'm
very happy with this eye shadow palette
and if you guys would like me to
recreate this eye look for you I can go
ahead and do that um before we move to
the new place so I just want to tell you
guys really quickly what I have on my
eyes the first shade is nocturnal which
by the way can we take a moment look how
they spelled nocturnal I know a few of
you were talking to me about this on
snapchat and on Instagram I saw that
immediately and I was like really is
that how you fell nocturnal
I don't know how companies miss stuff
like that like how do you miss that they
spelled it NOC ter nal but anyway that's
just me being picky but yeah so
basically I use it that shade I put it
all over my lid then I did go in with
the shade hide-and-seek which is that
beautiful transition shade right there
work that into my crease with a BH
Cosmetics fluffy brush I also did go
down onto my lid then I took up my
all-time favorite shade which is this
one right here this is a beautiful
chestnut
warm but cool brown I don't even know
how to describe it it is a matte it is
blendable it is beautiful I put it all
over my lid and they've worked it into
my crease with a more defined kind of
smaller brush than I did go in with I
Spy which is one of those more kind of
foiled finish it's got a really nice
Sheen to it that actually works
beautifully into the crease sometimes
you do get these foiled eyeshadows and
they don't work as well in the crease
but that one does and then I did take
the shade after midnight which is this
matte town here work that into the outer
viii and then i took silver spoon which
is that other foiled shade right there
and i work that on the lower lash line
love the look oh and i did go ahead with
one more i went in with this shade right
here which is glitter infused called
clutch but that is the only glitter and
fuchsia shade in here that I'm really a
fan of there are only two one is break
free one is clawed should but that one
is actually quite nice so overall guys I
actually really really do like this the
color selection is what drew of me and
so anyway let's go ahead and swatch this
palette out we are going to start with
the worst shadows in the palette which
are the top ones over here or I should
say the top ones right here so and the
reason why I say these are the worst is
because they're really not that
pigmented but the first one that we have
here is nocturnal so it's just a math
kind of white color and I'm just gonna
go ahead and show you exactly what it
looks like so that is the matte kind of
white color
it just isn't it's just not super super
invisible now this is a nice color for
going ahead and kind of cleaning up any
sort of harsh edges that you need to at
the end so you know when you do like a
really smoky eye look like this each
sometimes gets all over the place or at
least for me I'm bad with makeup so
sometimes it gets all over the place
this is nice for going underneath the
eye cleaning up on the outer edges stuff
like that but for the most part not very
pigmented next we do have a pillow fight
which is a beautiful kind of champagne
shimmer color this one actually is quite
pigmented and is quite beautiful so
there it is I feel like this would make
a beautiful highlight on fair skin as
well which i think would be awesome and
then finally we have break free break
free is a glitter and fuchsia shade it
is completely worthless literally the
worst piece of crap in this palette it
is barely there has lots of glitter
fallout really really it don't like that
so that is probably I would say the
worst row in the palette is the top row
but now let's go ahead and get into the
second row these are my favorites so the
first one is called dark side this is a
beautiful beautiful shimmery sort of
cool toned
taupey color and I don't even know
there's like a purple at your add
essence going on in here but look at
that look at that color is that not
super like amazing and gorgeous and I
will say the actual texture of this one
is not necessarily amazing or beautiful
it definitely does feel a little more
gritty but it goes onto the eyes really
nicely next we
behind and hide and seek shade yeah this
one is the transition that I use today
and this is a beautiful buttery cool
toned matte shade and its really nice to
works on the eyes beautifully really
happy with that next we do have clutch
which is what I have on the inner 1/3 of
my eyelid today and this one is that
glitter in few shade but it is very
pigmented it goes on absolutely
beautifully as you guys can see super
super gorgeous and then the last one is
my favorite shade in the whole entire
palette which is flip-out it does feel a
little crispy to the touch but I just
love the way that this goes on I don't
feel like I can find chestnut-brown
colors like this that just go on with
like a one swipe kind of swatch like
that so anyway that is the second row in
the palette I would say pretty much like
the best row in the palette and the next
row we're going to do is the second best
row so let's go ahead and jump into that
so these are the two kind of foiled
shades in the palette we have I Spy and
then we have silver spoon and these ones
definitely have more of like a shimmery
sort of formula to them and they really
really do go on nicely but like I said
earlier I feel like sometimes with those
more foiled shades sometimes what can
happen is you try and work them into the
crease and they just kind of it won't
budge they just kind of stick and
they're very hard to move around these
are not these actually blend beautifully
into the crease so here is I Spy which
is a gorgeous gorgeous purpley cool
toned Brown shape is a little bit of
golden shimmer and then silver spoon is
a midnight blue sort of color so I got
look at the pigmentation on these you
guys are gonna flip
look at those look at those absolutely
foiled gorgeous I mean these two rows
right here I feel like there are
limitless limitless eye looks that you
could do right here if you are someone
who loves cool tone colors you're gonna
love that alright finally guys let's go
ahead and get into at the bottom row the
bottom row is kind of like the top row
there's got a few mattes in there that
are a little on the scratchy side or I
guess I should say one or two mattes and
then the other one is pretty good but
these are the three that we have so
swoop is definitely a chocolatey Brown
kind of color more cool toned than this
guy right here which is my favorite then
we have that grayish color that's what I
worked into my outer-v that's after
midnight and then all-nighter is a matte
black now
very impressive I am NOT impressed by a
lot of matte-black because I feel like
they're never that great in formulation
but there are better ones that I've come
across so here is the cool tone
chocolate brown here is after midnight
which is that beautiful smoky grey I'm
going to show you guys what they look
like initially and then I'm going to
show you kind of built up because I feel
like I can actually build these quite
nicely so that is what they look like
initially not bad but also not fantastic
as you can probably tell so let me go
ahead and kind of build them up because
the one thing I like about these is that
they do build nicely and what's funny is
I can actually differentiate where the
colors are on my eyes when I use these
you would think that these kind of
shades down here would get muddled
together but I just don't seem to have
that issue so there they are again not
fabulous but they really do go on to the
eyes a little better than they swatch
out and then finally we do have all
nighter which is that matte black and
it's crispy it doesn't feel good to the
touch and it goes on pretty poorly it's
not amazing it's not amazing I'm very
picky with my matte blacks but there it
is let's build it up a little more so
you guys can see again this one is
buildable which is nice maybe has the
smallest amount of like a purpley
undertone so anyway guys that is pretty
much of the palette I would say the top
row is the worst of the worst ever and
then the bottom row is second worse but
then those two middle rows are actually
pretty fantastic you know I
don't say so myself
so anyway I'm definitely going to be
keeping that palette I feel like I can
still work with the rows that aren't
that great what I mean by they're not
that great is they don't swatch out that
great but they can actually work on to
the eyes quite nicely the shade that is
an absolute mess in here that I don't
even like to put on my eyes as this one
right here at that glitter and fuchsia
shade but like this glitter infused one
right here like I said I work that all
over my lid it looks beautiful so I
don't have any issues with that so
anyway guys those are my thoughts I
think that the eyeshadow palettes are
good or at least this particular one is
I think that the highlighter is good
I would definitely steer clear of the
makeup setting spray I don't think it
does much and I would steer clear of the
mascara hopefully they'll come out with
more formulations of the mascara maybe
something with more of like a dry
formula and like a rubber bristle one
that would be awesome but so far so good
I think they're doing pretty good for
literally just coming out of the
Woodworks and starting their company so
anyway thank you so much for joining me
guys and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
