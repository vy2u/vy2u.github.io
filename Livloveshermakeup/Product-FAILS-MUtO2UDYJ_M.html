thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I am
here to share some recent product sales
with you guys also known as products
that just really really sucked for me so
let's just get right into it I have a
mix of haircare skincare toothpaste lots
of random random things so the first
thing I want to talk about are these
little beauty these are from the brand
Beauty Blender these are their little
micro Beauty Blender sponges they look
like this and these are supposed to be
used for under-eye concealer and the
thought is that they're really nice and
small and they can get right into that
under-eye area
well I did not like these at all I think
first of all the size is still too small
even when you get this damp it still
only blows up like a little bit more
than this side and it just is not usable
like I literally feel like I have to be
like so like precise and hold on to it
like really really tight or also just
flies out of my hand
and second of all it sucks up so much
moisture like it's like literally wet
when you put it on and I have tried like
squeezing it out I've tried giving the
excess water off like on a watch them
washcloth on a paper towel it just does
not work for me so I did not like these
whatsoever definitely don't waste your
money on these I think it was like
literally $19 for the two of these it
just works better to go ahead and use
your Beauty Blender underneath there so
do not waste your money on those the
second product I want to talk about in
the haircare product this is from
Garnier Fructis this is the daily Kara
silky secret Leoben it has grapefruit
antioxidant natural hair protein
bah-bah-bah it's for a normal hair so
right away I probably should have gotten
it because it said it was for normal
hair I don't have normal hair I'm used
to you when I got virgin hair but now I
bleached my hair so it's pretty much dry
however it says it conditions and
detangles from spore silky softness from
root to tip it did not do any of that I
am very very tingly hair and when
someone when something says that it's
going to detangle I expect it to be able
to detangle it did not do any of that it
literally felt like I was just spritzing
water onto my head so big-time fail from
Garnier you guys can see I really tried
to use like a lot of this product I used
like that much and it just it was it was
it was a fail it wasn't was it was well
it was a fail alright the next thing I
want to talk about is a body scrub this
is
the honest company this is the sea salt
and sugar body scrub in the lavender
vanilla scent it's supposed to be ultra
hydrating exfoliating and softening it
was nice it's found nothing like vanilla
I just smelled like lavender and I don't
like the scent of lavender just on its
own I really like like lavender and
vanilla mixed together so I was hoping
it would smell really good it's felt
very kind of weird and natural and um
you guys know what I mean when I say
natural like it just smelled very like
herbs mixed with lavender and I just
really wasn't into it I'm a big scent
person so that was not up my alley but
anyway it's not that it was a bad scrub
by any means it actually exfoliated
really really nicely but it left such a
greasy film on my skin and I hate that
when it comes to body scrubs I really
like body scrubs like the tree hot ones
that just don't leave any residue on the
skin and this left so much oily residue
so this was definitely a fail for me the
next thing I want to talk about our two
foundations I did review both of these
separately so I will link the videos
below if you would like to see more
in-depth review on them the first one I
am returning to Sephora this is the
clinic chubby in the new foundation
stick this made my combination skin look
completely like whacked out like
literally I was so oily in my t-zone my
dry areas like on my cheeks were super
super dry with this it just was not good
for me at all the shape was also a
little too dark but that was my fault on
the shade I had a zero to abundant
alabaster it was just way too dark had
like a very much like orange a pinky
undertone on my skin it definitely
definitely as the day progressed got
darker and darker on my skin and it just
looked really horrible on my skin so
that was definitely a fail for me like I
said I'll link the video below if you
would like to see a more in depth review
and the other one that did not work for
me that I'll just be tossing out is the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
foundation my shade was n2 and even my
boyfriend said you know like what are
you wearing on your skin today it
doesn't look very good you know when
your boyfriend says that your skin does
not look good a ruler doesn't look good
because normally guys can't really tell
but anyway so that was like a whole
nother thing I was
never wearing that again but anyway it
just wasn't good I liked the whole
concept of it I liked the thought of
using like a cushion to push the
foundation in but this just had really
really sheer oily coverage and it just
made my combination skin look very
strange stuff that was a feel for me as
well the next two makeup items I want to
talk about are from the brand pure
minerals these are the lip gloss sticks
I have two different shades here the
first one is called it doesn't actually
have a name so it's just this really
really pretty like hot pink sort of
color and I just thought these would be
nice because they are like a beautiful
beautiful like lip gloss stick and
they're like an ice creeeeam they have a
nice amount of product in there the
other shade is kind of like a deep red
color and I just thought these would be
really really fantastic I was like oh
lip gloss stick they'll be really easy
to put on they'll probably be
moisturizing I thought they would be
somewhat similar to my Neutrogena like
moisture one of those called moisture
sticks which are really really
comfortable to wear on the lips they're
lovely they give a nice amount of color
these were so dry and cakey they were
not glossy whatsoever they had a very
matte finish on the lips which I'm not
saying that's a bad thing whatsoever I
think that's wonderful but this is not
what they claimed to be they say they
are a lip gloss stick and I just thought
it was gonna be glossy something really
easy to wear on the lips and on top of
that I got these last year oh my
goodness they are so so so needing to be
thrown out because they have obviously
expired I think any time you have a lip
product that starts to smell like
straight-up plastic it has expired and
these have already expired so I would
definitely not purchase any more of
these lip gloss sticks they were just so
cakey and made my lips look so dry and
gross oh no all right the next two
things I want to talk about our mascaras
the first one is from josie maran this
is the Argan black oil mascara and I
thought I was really gonna like this
because the wand is like right up my
alley and it looks like I had a really
nice wet formula and I really really
like stuff like that however this just
did absolutely nothing for my lashes I
noticed that it transferred up to my
eyebrow also transferred underneath my
eye which drives me crazy and it just
honestly I thought with a wand like that
it was going to give me great volume
great um like not text
I don't know how to explain it but you
know like definition I thought I was
going to give my lashes a lot of
definition
lots of lengths lots of volume and it
did really nothing so this was
definitely a fail for me and then the
other one is from YSL and this is their
mascara volume it comes in this gold
packaging like this again um I didn't
think I was gonna like this honestly
because I don't like natural bristle
brushes this is a natural bristle brush
and this did absolutely nothing for my
lashes like I have three dollar mascaras
that work away better than this it also
started to get really dry throughout the
day and start to flake off on my face so
yeah that was also fail to mascara fails
for that one the next thing I want to
talk about our toothpaste you probably
have seen these on the sephora.com
website these are the Marvis toothpastes
and they're supposed to be like these
high-end toothpastes like come on and he
time you see something like that on the
sephora website you're obviously
intrigued i was very intrigued i ended
up picking up a set of these for the
holiday season I think they had six
different ones in them and I did like
two of them I am one of those people I
love smells
I love taste like really really good
taste and really really good smells and
there were two in here that I did like I
love anything cinnamon so I did like the
cinnamon one and then there was one that
was Jasmine and I love anything jasmine
so I did like those two however the
small tubes of these are six dollars and
fifty cents apiece and the big ones are
ten fifty like what okay I understand
that they're sold at Sephora but that is
very very expensive and pricey for
toothpaste and then the other ones that
came in this kit were so strong like so
minty to the point where my eyes were
watering every single time I use that
now they are toothpaste so I'm going to
make myself go ahead and use them up
because it's just one of those things
it's like get over it all of you it's
just two-faced you can use it up a lot
of these products that will be tossing
after this because I just don't even
want to use them but I feel like with
these and their toothpaste I will use
them up as you can see I did use this
one up this is the ginger mint it was
just okay but again it made my eyes
water like crazy I like really really
good tasting toothpaste that was not
very tasty this one is horrible this is
the honor le licorice who wants licorice
flavored toothpaste that is disgusting
so this is what it looks like I'm so
I'm excited to use this little tuba but
I will anyway the third one is the
whitening mint one this is the one I'm
working on right now I don't even notice
that it does absolutely any whitening
for my teeth now to be fair a lot of
toothpastes I just don't think whiten
your teeth at all uh I prefer to just
use my plus white 5-minute whitening
system but I mean it's just so minty I'm
literally crying every single night when
I'm brushing my teeth okay that is what
these are doing to me and then the last
one is the aquatic mint and this is
probably like the most like minty out of
all of them it's so minty it's just oh
my god my eyes just start watering like
when I smell it
honestly oh yeah and I'm just one of
those people like I love mint I love
like peppermint mint and aquatic mint I
love all this kind of stuff but this is
too strong and I just feel like for the
price they are just so so so not worth
it so if you are intrigued by those on
the sephora.com website don't purchase
them the only ones that are good are the
cinnamon one which you can get cinnamon
flavored toothpaste at the drugstore you
don't need to buy that one I would say
the one out of the whole batch that is
kind of unique and special is the
Jasmine one alright the next thing I
want to talk about are these little
replacement brush heads for the
Clarisonic I shouldn't have done this
and I knew when I was ordering these on
Amazon how they know about these these
are the sana marked a deep pore
cleansing replacement brushes if you
have a Clarisonic you know that it is
very very expensive to replace your
brushes you're supposed to replace the
brush heads every three months and
honestly I will go like 6 months the
power glassing mine which i know is not
good but they're just so pricey and you
can get them at so far you can get them
online but I saw on Amazon at these
little son of art that are basically
supposed to be the compareto or the
knockoff of the Clarisonic brushes and I
was very very like intrigued and I was
like wow because these were half the
price I think they were about $10 for
this pack and you get two in here so the
two different kind of Clarisonic brush
heads that I really enjoy are the luxe
one and then the deep pore cleansing so
I picked up this one in the deep pore
cleansing and I pop these on my
Clarisonic and I
these are going straight in the garbage
you buy fees are I actually actually
actually thought that I was bleeding
after like when I got out of the shower
I was like I'm sure my skin is bleeding
right now it literally felt like I was
rubbing like a pumice or something like
pum you know those little things that
you bleep rub on your heel to get dead
skin off that's what I felt like I was
using on my face
they were so stiff the breath of
bristles were like so stiff and hard I
actually like I said thought like my
face would be bleeding after I got out
of the shower they just have like
they're very very stiff as you can
probably see they're not soft whatsoever
they feel nothing like the deep pore
cleansing brush heads and it was so
annoying because all of the reviews I
don't know if maybe they were like
sponsored reviews or whatnot but all of
the reviews on the Amazon website we're
like really good for this like oh my
gosh it's just like the ones from
Clarisonic no no no no no no these
really really are horrible and I think
that they did more damage to my skin and
then you know anything else so I would
not repurchase these do not get these go
ahead and just spend the money on
getting the Clarisonic ones because
these are not worth it alright the next
thing I want to talk about is a liquid
lipstick so I normally can wear these
like it during the summer time when I'm
a little more oily I have combination
skin so I definitely get like very oily
in my t-zone during the summer time and
my skin just gets overall a little more
oily including my lip area everything
just gets more moister whatever so I
tried using these last week and in the
middle of winter I realized I could not
use this formulation and I just thought
you know what why have lip products in
my collection that I can't reach for
anytime that I want to you know that's
just stupid so these are all going to go
I think I've about six of them I need to
dig through my collection pull the other
ones out and just toss them these are
the wet wild Meg laughs these are the
liquid lip colors they are beautiful
beautiful colors this particular one is
called nine to eight a pocketful of
roses it's a gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
color don't get me wrong like I think
it's absolutely beautiful but these
start to just break up on your lips
within I would say an hour hour to like
an hour and a half they just start to
fall off your lips they start to crumble
and it just looks so unattractive
especially if your lips are already
it is just not cute whatsoever and I
really I think that I've actually
mentioned these in like weekly favorites
videos before like during this summer
and I was like they're great and they
last all day and they really did when I
had more moisture in my skin but I don't
want to hold on to a product that I
can't reach for whenever I want to
so these are gonna go they just they
just do not wear well especially if your
lips are dry so I don't like those and
the last product I want to talk about is
from dr. Dennis gross these are the dr.
Dennis gross peels alpha-beta peel
original formula they are a patented
two-step anti-aging treatment oh my god
they made my skin look so horrible and I
actually have a subscriber that
mentioned commented on these as well
this made my skin break out like crazy I
don't know what it was because normally
my skin tolerates a chaise and like
glycolic acid very very well like I can
use the Peter Thomas Roth and wrinkle
pads I can use the ones from first day
Beauty I can use a lot of different kind
of cleansing like facial pads not that
these are cleansing facial pads are
basically appeal but I can use stuff
like that on my skin without getting
sensitive I have those little bumps that
are underneath the skin like the next
day those little bumps bumps that are
underneath the skin that like they're
not pimples you can't pop them you can't
really do anything with them they're
just underneath the skin all over my jaw
line all around my hairline totally
disgusting and I went through there were
three different little like segments in
here so there's step one and step two
and you got three step ones and three
step two
so I guess is for three days like
consecutively each day my skin looked
shittier and shittier like it was
horrible like really really bad so I
would definitely not recommend these I
don't know if there's just a really
really strong amount of like alpha beta
like acid in here or what is going on
but it says it's supposed to give you
firmer and smoother skin smaller tighter
pores and a radiance more even
complexion I did not think so whatsoever
if you want that definitely go and try
out the Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkled
pads those are way better plus you wash
them off this one you do not wash off so
maybe that was the problem it's just my
skin didn't handle or tolerate the
alpha-beta very well but
yeah this was definitely a fail for me
and I'm not the only person like I said
I have a subscriber that told me oh my
broke up so badly from those so if you
ever see these as like a hundred or two
hundred point perk on the Sephora
website I would pass on them so anyway
those were some of my recent product
fails I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I plan on doing these every like month
or two because I do accumulate products
that just end up not working for me so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
