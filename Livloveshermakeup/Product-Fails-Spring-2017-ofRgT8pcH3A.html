to my channel thank you so much for
joining me today we are talking about
product sales for spring 2017 I was
going to say spring 2016
no spraying that 2017 the next one I
will do will be for summer 2017 and that
will be towards the end of the summer or
maybe in the middle of the summer
whenever but I have been gathering
together a bunch of beauty products that
recently have not been working out for
me I actually have about 15 16 17 here
to share with you guys this is the way
that I prefer to do these videos if you
would rather watch someone who does like
three or four each month and that's fine
this is just how I personally like to do
them every time the season changes I go
and I just kind of tell you about a
bunch of that I haven't been liking
so as always you guys obviously this is
just my opinion you need to go and look
at multiple opinions on products okay I
never want you to think that just
because I say it sucks it means it sucks
you need to look at multiple different
people multiple different skin tones
skin types all that kind of stuff please
don't just take my advice and be like
that's it that's finalized so I always
go and do your research and of course
just because something doesn't work for
me doesn't mean it won't work for you
okay just because I hold up your
all-time favorite eyeshadow palette and
I say I don't like it doesn't mean I'm
saying I don't like you I will have a
moderator in this comment section
because these videos seem to always get
out of control but I still want to post
them because I like these videos I find
them helpful I know you guys find them
helpful so anybody that's going to try
and start down below please know
you will be deleted by my best friend
Rochelle who's going to be ma during
moderating everything but yeah let's go
ahead and talk about some products that
personally did not work for me so the
first one is something that I promised a
full review for you guys on and this is
actually something that I will not be
doing a full review on this is the Too
Faced natural love of palette now the
reason why I will not be doing a full
review is because I truly believe I got
it done I truly believe it I just
personally think that I got a dud I have
seen so many people that I trust and I
know that are honest that I've
absolutely adored this palette and it
just seems like I got something
different as always the packaging is
absolutely beautiful on this you can see
it has like a little bit of like a
raised velvet texture here really really
gorgeous I feel like ever since Estee
Lauder bought out to face the packaging
has been on fleek but some of the stuff
like inside has been complete and
for me this was not good I will go ahead
and link down below in the description
bar will be like the first thing you see
some of the videos of swatches I did
with primer
on my Instagram and I showed you guys
some of my favorite shades which
includes some of these pink shades here
like kitten bunny nose cutie patootie
really beautiful nice shimmers over here
and then I did swatch some of the okay
shades which I think are these little
rows of mattes over here we have heaven
lace Teddy pink cheeks spotlights poodle
and then also I went ahead and i
swatched my least favorites which are
these guys over here which are the
darker shadows these are very much
glitter infused glitter pact they go on
horribly on to my eyes they swatch
horribly even with an eye primer so I'm
going to go ahead and link those down
below but yeah like I said the reason
why I don't want to do a full review on
this is because I truly believe people
are getting different palettes than I
got and I think that's absolutely
horrible of Too Faced to do that like
what the get your together
don't be sending people out different
sorts of palettes I don't know if
they're just manufactured in a different
place it seems like everywhere like
every palette does seem to be made in
the same place but for some reason I'm
just having like flashbacks of the
nikkietutorials palette where people got
really good ones or people got really
bad ones people that I know and love and
trust did swatches of that palette and
it looked amazing and then i swatched it
I was like what the hell is this so
unfortunately this is just a no-go for
me but always do your research it is
available I believe at Sephora now I
personally purchase mine from Too Faced
I don't know if I'll be able to return
it but what I would really recommend
guys is going in stores watching them
making sure that you have a good one
because I think it's either a hit or a
miss and I think that's so disappointing
when Too Faced releases stuff like this
but you can visibly see even when I
swatch it with primer these are absolute
 my palette is so I just wanted
to go ahead and put that out there I
know that a lot of these shades are
overlapping with the natural matte
palette as well as the natural eye
palette and the natural at night I own
all three of those I love those this is
not the same kind of quality in my
opinion so anyway I just wanted to go
ahead and put that out there like I said
I will not be doing a full review
because there's really not too much to
say it seems like a lot of people are
loving this
I personally don't but I think it's
because I got it done alright moving on
the next item I want to talk about is
from skin-food this is the volcanic and
egg egg white pore cool meringue pack so
this is something that was actually sent
to me for PR I love skin food skin food
has never kicked me off their PR list I
talked about a little bit briefly on
snapchat I've been kicked off a lot of
PR lists because people just don't want
you talking about their products oh
but I feel like an associate product you
should be able to
 about it so this was something that
I did not like but skinfood just keeps
coming back and sending me all their
items every single time they release new
stuff so thank you so much to skin-food
for actually believing in me and
allowing me to give it my honest opinion
on products but yeah this is a cool
Moran pack is basically a mask that you
put onto your pores or areas where you
have enlarged pores or you can put it
all over your face like I did and it
comes out in a two but like this you
guys can see a lot of like water and
condensation gets trapped right here
which is super gross it actually comes
out like a shaving cream and a smells
like shaving cream which is kind of
strange so you put it on your face it
kind of turns into like this elastic
material almost like the glam glow
gravity mud where you can like peel it
off your face you can't actually peel
this but basically what happens is it's
supposed to like shrink your pores I
didn't notice any sort of cooling
benefits on this thing is like 18
dollars which is quite expensive for
skin food already and I just didn't
notice any sort of like pore you know
diminished pores like the the my pore
size was the same before ads it was
after so basically this did nothing for
Mia says blackhead out but I would
recommend the warming one the warming
one has a little bit of like exfoliating
particles I think that one's around $14
which again still very expensive for
skin food one of the reasons why I
really like skin food is because they
have lower prices on products but this
one for some reason decide there and it
didn't do anything for me the warming
one is nice I do feel like it kind of
gets the blackheads out of this area but
yeah I would say that one stay away from
alright the next two products I have
here are already boxed up and ready to
go back because I am returning them they
are from Too Faced again Too Faced has
just been so inconsistent
this is the Lovelight prismatic
highlighter and blinded by the light
which looks like this and it is a nice
kind of like silvery color and as you
guys can see I've hit some hard pan on
that which is normal with the baked
Soleil highlight but basically from me I
find this one to be very very glittery
and it's just not a wham bam in your
face kind of highlight and I understand
that not everybody wants that but that
is something that I want so I'm going to
go ahead and turn that and then here we
have ray of light and this one I'm going
to go ahead and give it to my friend and
this one just had more of a peachy
iridescent to it
again if you're someone who really
enjoys a really really really natural
subtle highlight and you're willing to
spend $30 and sure go ahead and pick it
up but there are much better products at
the drugstore in my opinion
for me these just were not like blinded
they were not blinding the light you
know what I mean I feel like with names
like that their names from songs
actually I do feel like they should be
actually a little more like a vibrant on
the face and they're just fun alright
moving on I do have two products here
from pur cosmetics these were sent to me
at for PR and they are just not good at
all the first one is the no filter
blurring photography primer now I have
not tried out the new foundation that
they recently released but this is just
so strange first of all this homeless
packaging is really really yucky so this
little thing got stuck and it basically
jammed itself and as you guys can see
the actual primer and liquid has started
to crust around the top I have a
literally for like three weeks so that's
kind of gross it does come out a dropper
form like this and it's a very strange
product so you look at it you're like oh
it's kind of like a pearly color and
then you actually kind of blend it in
and you can see there's a really strong
gold shift going on here and now I do
want to try this out like layering it on
my skin as an actual highlight it did
try it out the other day it actually
disturbed the foundation that I had on
which I hate when cream and powder I'm
sorry when cream and liquid a highlight
to do that but it did kind of disturb it
it kind of took off my foundation took
off my powder so I'm thinking of
applying my foundation putting this on
as a highlight and then powdering my
face but yeah just not really impressed
with this I actually feel like it makes
my skin feel a little more dry it
doesn't give a lot of hydration and then
it starts to settle into pores so it
doesn't have any sort of silicone
feeling to it but it's not hydrating at
all whatsoever it's basically just like
a makeup extender however I don't really
notice that extends the wear of my
makeup so for me this is definitely a
fail and I have not been enjoying that
at all and then here we have a powder
that came to meet broken and this is the
foreign one pressed mineral makeup with
broad-spectrum SPF 15 and as you can see
my ferret mr. badger got into here a lot
of you were saying he wanted to save you
from the brick bad product so as you can
see this is a shade porcelain it is so
incredibly yellow toned and
unfortunately this is just very very
chalky and cakey on the skin that is
over the primer as you guys can see very
very yellow toned very very chalky very
very cakey I even have self tanner on
right now and that is still darker than
my complexion so this was not something
that worked out for me I felt like
you're really enlarged my pores that
made it like texture all over my face
look a lot more apparent and
I tried it without wearing foundation
and just kind of buffing it into the
skin with a buffing brush it did not
look good and then I also tried it
setting in my foundation and I kind of
stamped it on also didn't look good so I
know this works out for a lot of you for
me it personally didn't work out and I'm
kind of disappointed and I'll so like I
said it came broken which kind of sucks
alright moving on I do have a skincare
products here from dr. Brandt so this is
the microdermabrasion age defying
exfoliator this is just one of those
products where yes it does exfoliate
your face however it is so not worth it
for the price you literally can make
your own sugar scrub your salt scrub at
home and get a better like exfoliated
face than this so it does have those
almost little feeling like a pumice
pumice stones and they're almost it
really does kind of microderm your face
but at the same time it smells weird it
stings your eyeball like crazy if you
get it in your I don't know how I got in
my eye but it wait am i I okay and um
yeah it's got like this weird toxic like
lemon scent almost like toxic lemon
waste or something it's just really
horrible um but I just I just don't
understand like the price of this the
price of this is ridiculous for what
you're actually getting like I said
there are much better scrubs at the
drugstore and also ones that you can
actually make it home with your own
products that are already in your
kitchen
alright the next item here that I will
be returning is from Too Faced it is the
peanut butter and honey palette I need
to use this for one more video that I'm
going to be filming then I will be going
back to the store but this is what it
looks like I did do a first impressions
and a final review on this so I'll go
ahead and throw both of those up in the
cards above for you guys in the first
impressions I really tried to make this
work
Too Faced is my all-time favorite brand
they're really going down like on my
 list right now like they're really
no they're high on my list they're
not on my hit list they're really low
down on my hit list so basically they're
just not something that I'm super
attracted to anymore I'm not super
attracted to the Too Faced brand anymore
because things are so consider
consistent or super super unreliable and
I'm just not into it so this
unfortunately I really tried to make it
work these guys right here
very very chalky this shade right here
which is called sweetest honey has like
glitter infused in it really really
strange I don't understand there wasn't
really a huge color selection here like
a definitive color difference between
these three shades right here the only
two shades I really was into were honey
brittle and also bee's knees I did feel
like honey buns even though that's the
one that everybody wanted to be crazy
about I felt like this mixed together
with this shade down here which is more
like
Leigha actually made it look like you
have like a bruise on your eye and for
some reason this shade was just not
flattering on me at all so for me the
student workout I don't think this would
work out for a lot of different
complexions and again I don't know if
some people got good palates some people
got bad palates but for the majority of
people and the majority of reviews I saw
it seems like people really didn't like
this and I am one of them I just think
this is a piece of
so yeah did not like that the next item
is already boxed up as well I'm going to
be going ahead and giving this to my
friend Rochelle this is the pink peony
overnight water pack I want to see if
this will work for her she wants to try
it out this is an overnight mask from
SKT Lauder or the SA edit line and I
have gone through two little deluxe
sized samples of this this is like
extremely expensive this is like a
twenty-eight thirty dollars and it does
nothing absolutely nothing it has the
sort of buoyancy and the consistency of
the what does it call to the Neutrogena
water gel and I got really excited cuz I
like oh my god I love that and I also
love peonies penes are my favorite
flower I mean look at the banner for my
channel like those are my favorite
flowers so I thought I would really like
the scent of this it doesn't smell like
penis it doesn't nothing for your skin
even for me
I have combo skin this does not even
hydrate like my dry cheeks okay it
doesn't even hydrate that so this is one
of those products that I just feel like
is so stupid the Estee edit line I find
kind of strange and weird like I know
that they're trying to reach out to a
younger audience but at the same time it
seems like a lot of their products are
not so good I know that the gritty and
glow palettes are supposed to be amazing
but most of the products that they've
been releasing from this new line are
just not that great in my opinion all
right next we have the Nally face
defender I'm going to be doing a video
soon where I talk about like a beauty
cult favorites like called favorite
beauty products like what do I think of
them this is just one of those very
strange products I did buy it during the
Ulta 21 days of beauty last year this is
what it looks like and this is one of
those things that you can take with a
big sponge and you can tap on your pores
throughout the day to help kind of
balance out the oil as well as kind of
hide your pores a little more you can
also just use it as a regular face
primer this does not work for me
okay you guys every time I put this on
my face it removes my foundation no
matter what I do and even if I'm just
wearing a BB cream with absolutely no
powder I cannot put this on my face now
you don't go you like swipe it you
actually press it into the skin and it
just does not work for me I heard it
works for a lot of different people but
if you have any other options on how I
should really try and use it
please let me know because it is way
past due date I cannot actually return
this anymore but it's just one of those
problems like products that I was super
attracted to because it looks so weird
and it feels so weird and it's so cool
and I want it to work but I just cannot
get it to work so please let me know if
you have any uh you know I wasn't saying
opportunities let me know if you have
any suggestions down below
alright the next item is the Brio geo
don't despair repair deep conditioning
mask this is for your hair I talked
about this yesterday in my empties video
this is so horrible if you are someone
who has a sensitive scalp I do have
lupus i SLE lupus and I have a very bad
scalp currently I had scalp surgery a
couple of weeks ago and this just really
really irritates and in flames my scalp
personally I do take up my deep
conditioners around my scalp area
because they do want that extra moisture
but I feel like the smell is very
strange on this you do get a nice amount
in here it is eight ounces but at the
same time you go through it very quickly
because it's one of those things that
you scoop out in the shower there are so
many better mass at Sephora yet alone
the drugstore for your hair I would not
recommend picking this up I've gone
through two full sizes now and I like I
wanted to make it work but it does
nothing for detangling my hair it does
nothing for my ends does nothing for
hydration and I am somebody who does
have very fine flat hair I don't style
it or anything like that just very very
fine thin flat hair and this didn't even
give me moisture so I can't imagine
people with like thick like coarse hair
I feel like this would do absolutely
nothing for you as well maybe if you
want to put it in and then go in the
shower and kind of help with detangling
but this truly did nothing for me so I
really don't like that here I do have a
nail polish from Ella + Mila this is the
bonbon pistach nail polish this is the
biggest piece of shit' nail polish I
have ever used in my life I believe I
got this in a PopSugar must have you
literally have to do I I want to say
about 16 to 18 coats of this for it to
actually be opaque on your fingernails I
do not have time for that I barely paint
my nails and when I go in with a nail
polish I want it to be done in like one
coat that's just me personally if you
have time to go ahead and paint your
nails over 18 different times and that's
awesome but for me personally this did
not work out it was so streaky and the
color just did not look like this at all
unless you really really went ahead and
built it up so that was just a huge fail
in my opinion I do have a perfume here
this is the Gwen Stefani Harajuku lovers
baby perfume I love this bottle I love
everything about this
I smell it out of the bottle when I just
go like this I'm like God yeah it smells
amazing and then I put it on my body and
I feel like I'm going to puke okay I
literally feel sick to my stomach
it is extremely overpowering extremely
extremely like baby powder kind of
smelling and for some reason those kind
of sense just give me a huge head a so
if you saw this and you think it's
adorable but you really can't stand
those overpowering kind of like baby
powder scents do not buy it
I know it's adorable I'm sure there are
different perfumes from this line you
can get but don't get this one alright
next I do have a powder from Oprah this
is the pressed powder in the oil control
version this is so horrible this is the
worst thing ever so it's supposed to um
control oil like in your t-zone and
things like that well first of all it
has tiny little baby shimmers in it
second of all I've already hit hard pan
on it which is very strange and this is
like the chalky Asst chunky assisting
powder I've ever used in my life I just
can't use it anymore I honestly can't
use it so there it is there's that pure
one and then there is the oil control
pressed powder and like you rub it in
and it leaves this strange like white
cast it's just a strangest thing I feel
like unless you are the fairest of the
fair you cannot use this because it will
leave a white cast on your skin and
second about when you press it into your
skin even looks chalky and it starts to
actually UM make what is that what is it
called like it when it pills up on the
skin it will make your foundation do
that so this was just such a strange
powder did not like that whatsoever even
worse than the pure powder okay guys
next I do have some body butters I want
to talk about these are the Laura
Mercier um creme de pistach and also
creme brulee body butter so I got these
in a set of six during the Sephora sale
in the fall and I recently just started
to crack into them I only have two left
and this was from the lip petite souffle
body creme collection I can't return
them any more so I'm just gonna use them
up but you know what
you know why when you're gonna charge
like 56 dollars for six little tiny tubs
of body butter like this they better be
good they better actually moisturize
your body that is not the case with
these I feel like they're just one of
those products that are very very pretty
to look at and they smell incredible
because they really do smell good but
these do not hydrate my body at all I'm
somebody who does have like combo kind
of oily skin even on my body like I get
breakouts you know on my back and on my
stuff like that this does not even
hydrate my chest area it doesn't hydrate
my arm area my hands forget about it the
only thing that's good about these is
the scent so if you are going to
purchase something from the laura
mercier like bath collection i would
recommend the creme brulee honey bath
they have like this bubble bath that's
absolutely incredible and amazing but
for the most part if you're actually
looking for body butters that will
actually do something go ahead and get
yourself like a tub of Cetaphil or
something okay because these do nothing
and if you do have open cuts or anything
like that or if you get dry to the point
where you do have broken skin these will
just sting because they are so heavily
fragrance but it's very disappointed
when you buy literally six little tubs
of this for like 56 dollars and they
actually don't hydrate the skin that was
just very very disappointing to me all
right the next two products are boxed up
as well because they are being returned
this is for all you people think that I
don't return I return all the
time I have no shame I'm like take this
back I'm not I'm not going to be
spending $20 apiece on these little
pieces of and then not get my money
back these are the Urban Decay Naked
skin highlighting fluids illuminating
optical blurring a waitlist um at
whatever highlighting fluid so this is
in the shade aura I did do a full review
on these I'll go ahead and throw it up
in the cards these are some knockout you
guys they don't strobe your face they
don't highlight your face they move your
foundation this one has glitter
particles in it this particular shade is
called luminous unless you have
absolutely impeccable a beautiful
perfect skin these are not going to work
for you if you want something extremely
subtle I mean
subtle to the point where you can barely
tell that you're wearing highlight you
might like these but for me they are a
no-go alright and next we do have let's
see here a elite facial serum this is
from adore this is just one of those
things where I don't understand what
they were thinking so this is supposed
to be a facial serum and normally facial
serums you know have a very very liquidy
kind of slimy consistency to them
because they are like the powerhouse of
your skincare routine they're going to
go in they're going to combat your
wrinkles they're going to take care of
hyperpigmentation this actually has
silicone in it how stupid you guys know
when you use a product that has silicone
in it anything that you put on top of
that is not going to sink in if this is
your actual facial serum the moisturizer
you put on top of it it's just going to
slip and slide around nothing's actually
going to sink in I don't understand the
point of that I don't understand the
point it also is very heavily
very very happily fragrance and it
really is truly like a face primer this
feels exactly like the maybelline baby
skin how silly to call it a facial serum
you should just call it a primer or a
moisturizer or a final step because
anything you put on top of this is not
actually going to sink in because the
silicone is creating a barrier between
that and the skin which is just it's
stupid so that's just a stupid product
and then finally I have three products
here that I have talked about you know
previous at product fields video is
probably about six to eight months ago
that I got so many people saying to try
it again try it again you might like it
you might like it you might like it and
I still don't like them and I thought I
would share again so the first one is
from origins it is the masca miser skin
optimizing mask primer I talked about
this in a video of products I'm gonna
return so many of you were saying tried
again it really is amazing I don't
notice any difference when I spray this
on my face and then I go in with a mask
there is no difference in my skin when I
remove the mask so I'm sorry I just feel
like this is such a gimmicky product
it's so is not worth the money and of
course now I can't return it anymore but
that's okay I will try and find a friend
who wants to get their hands on it but
yeah for me guys it really didn't work
another one is the Too Faced mascara
melt off so many of you were saying try
it again try it again my issue with this
you guys is the fact that here you have
the little wand and you go in to take
your mascara off and then you dip back
in you're literally taking pieces of
your godamn mascara and putting it back
in your tube I think that's unsanitary
it stinks it smells like ass I don't
like it and I still just can't I can't
wrap my head around this people were
saying you just wipe off the wand in
between what a waste of product I just
can't wrap my head around it you guys so
I'm gonna go ahead and give that to my
mom see if she wants it like I said I
did try it out again because so many of
you were saying try it out again and I
like to listen to you guys if you tell
me hey that product actually does work
try it out again and I'm going to try it
out again and finally we have the goats
oxygen what's what's a oxygen facial
tonic it says that tones balances and
calms oily skin a lot of you were saying
this is a really good product I got it
from Amazon I had some issues with the
person who had sent it to me for PR they
were very strange and saying like if you
don't give us a good review you know
like we're gonna sue you and I was like
 you oh okay you but yeah this
is what it looks like and it is a
all-natural toner so if you are someone
who has extremely oily
breakout prong scanner and you don't
mind the smell of ass on your face and
you don't mind the fact that this will
kind of burn your face at first I think
it might work for you but it just makes
my face really red and raw and I don't
think a natural product should be doing
that and I know some people say oh if it
gets all red and stuff like that you
know it's working but it's like no
that's just your skin showing you that
it's irritated and it wants you to stop
so for me this did not work out and like
I said I had a bad experience with the
person who sent it to me so yeah anyway
guys that is it said those are my
product fails for spring 2017 I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
