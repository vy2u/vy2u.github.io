today's review is going to be a rave
review I mean this is definitely one of
my favorite products right now probably
just favorite body scrub in general that
I've ever tried I have tried a lot of
body scrubs sometimes they're too oily
sometimes they're too sticky sometimes
you pay a lot of money for them and you
go through it way too quickly I'm
talking to you lush ocean salt uh-huh
but finally I went ahead and picked up
the tree hot shake sugar scrub I picked
mine up at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and let me
just say this is my second container
that I've gone through now I really
wanted to make sure that I liked this
product before I made just a video just
for this product and I the first type i
got was the coconut lime scent which was
amazing and that's when i really
discovered that i love the formula and i
went ahead and purchased a second one
when i ran out and this time the scent I
got is tropical mango so this is the
shea sugar scrub from Tree Hunt and it
is tropical mango and it's certified
organic shea butter with natural mango
puree and you get 18 US bounces so this
is a big you know jar or container I
guess you could say you get a lot of
product in here it will last you
probably you know I exfoliate my body
with this once a week so I would say
this will last me for weeks this will
ask me a month which is awesome because
you get 18 ounces for under $10 so I
really love this this is just awesome I
really think mine was about six or seven
dollars which is great so um this is
what the formula kind of looks like as
you can see I'm almost halfway done with
this one I really wanted to make sure
that I loved the product so you can see
that it kind of moves around in the
actual jar it is more of a liquidy
texture than you know ocean salt or
things like that you know it really does
kind of move around in there but it has
these nice little exfoliating particles
and when I say exfoliating particles I'm
not talking about those little orange
things you see everything is actually
grainy and an actual exfoliating
particle the little orange things in
there I think just have to do whoops
drop the cap just have to do with the
actual
mango you know puree in there but
everything else is literally sugar it's
a sugar scrub so this is what I think
I've tried a lot of sugar scrubs and
some of them are not exfoliating enough
either they're not completely made out
of sugar they have some other like you
know plastic exfoliating beads in them
which people probably think that those
little orange ones are but they are not
um or you know you go and you do a salt
scrub which is like hardcore and
sometimes it's to over exfoliating and
it leaves your skin red and raw and you
don't like that this is the perfect
in-between product and it's just amazing
I sense have picked up a few of their
body butters which I absolutely love
they also have you know the body butters
that match along with the scents of the
actual body scrubs so if you want to be
really luxurious you can scrub your body
with one of these and then go and use
the matching buddy body butter when you
get out of the shower or the bath and
like I said they just have great sense
they have coconut lime they have this
which is the tropical mango they have I
believe acai acai berry they have like
you know almond honey
Brazilian not just pure shea scrub which
is just you know shea scented it smells
great too so I am just really really
happy with this body scrub I totally
recommend this I think this is better
than luscious ocean salt and I was a
longtime user of that I used to buy a
new tub of that probably every two weeks
which really really emptied out my
wallet so I am so glad I found an
alternative to that absolutely love this
and I highly recommend it thanks so much
for watching guys I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
