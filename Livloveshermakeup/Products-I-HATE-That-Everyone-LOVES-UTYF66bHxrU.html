channel today I have part two you in my
little miniseries collab with my friend
Kayleigh bout last Monday we talked to
all about products that we personally
really liked is that it seems like other
people do not like and today we're gonna
flip that around so I'm going to be
talking about products I hate and that
it seems like a lot of people enjoy so I
am going to go ahead and link Kaylee's
channel as well as her Instagram and her
video down below I would love if you
guys went over and showed her some love
but without further ado let's go ahead
and talk about some products that I hate
and that a lot of people love the first
one is a blush formula from Physicians
Formula if this is the more more butter
blush formula and on the shade I have
right here is called natural glow and
then this one right here is called plum
rose plum rose is a really really great
kind of cool toned color and I have a
cool tone undertone but I mean this is
way too way way way too gray toned on me
it seems like it looks really really
nice if you do have more of a medium
complexion but for me and this looks
like a straight-up contour it has a nice
scent it smells very very coconutty very
similar to the Moreau butter bronzers
however I find these don't wear very
well throughout the day so I don't like
these because of the wear time and I
also just don't like the shade selection
and this other shade right here which is
called natural glow is actually
technically a highlight on me so I don't
feel like they did very well with the
shade selection but then again a
physician's formula has always been a
little troublesome when it comes to
their shade selection so I can't say I'm
really surprised but natural glow is
definitely a highlight on me it's kind
of like a peachy color and it definitely
has some gold at your a defen to kind of
flex running through it so not really a
fan of this like I said I feel like my
face just kind of eats up the product
throughout the day they definitely don't
last as long as the bronzer formula on
me personally although they are soft and
buttery I also just don't really like
the shade selection so that is the first
product next up I want to talk about
this little guy right here I picked up a
little sample of the bare minerals bare
Pro Foundation I'm really happy that I
picked up a sample because I do not like
this foundation now I should have known
when they were saying that it gets like
a demi matte sort of appearance on the
skin right now my skin is definitely
more on the dry side and I have to say I
cannot powder my face if I put this on
it really really just sucks the moisture
out of my skin it's definitely not dead
me mad I feel like this is straight-up
matte although it does have a really
really nice aware time and it does you
know have a longevity kind of thing
going on and you know your makeup will
last throughout the day I feel like it's
just a little too drying on my skin
personally so if you do have more normal
my skin I would avoid this one maybe
look into the bareMinerals
serum foundation they make a lot of like
lighter coverage foundations which i
think would be better for my skin but
the bare minerals Barrett Pro was not
for me if you guys are curious they did
pick up the shade golden ivory and when
I am self tan this does max me quite
nicely they do also have you learn sheet
selection so that's really great but for
me this does not look good on my skin up
next we have the Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation this shade right here is
called 1n 1 I've renewed I've also tried
one W 1 and one C one none of them
matched me so I never felt like I was
able to get a really good shape match
when it comes to this foundation which
is kind of funny considering this is
like a cult favorite and I feel like if
you've won multiple awards when it comes
to a certain foundation you should be
able to go ahead and cater to everybody
and I've heard a lot of people say that
they can't find their shade and the
Estee Lauder Double Wear if you can't
find your shade you're gonna love this
as far as longevity is concerned it
definitely does wear throughout the day
however it's super heavy and I mean even
when I did have more oily combo skin I
mean I never really made a lot of
progress on this because I didn't really
understand the hype it's totally a
youtube maybe buy it sort of product but
it felt healthy on my skin it doesn't
smell very good and it definitely
oxidizes and goes very very yellow
throughout the day on me personally so
I'm not a fan of that stay latter double
where I've tried adding an oil trying to
make it a little more hydrating as well
as more wearable and skin like but it
just doesn't look good on my skin it
honestly just doesn't look good on my
skin so the Estee Lauder Double Wear
stay in place makeup is not for me a ton
of people love this they swear by it but
for me I don't like it and then finally
the last foundation I want to talk about
is from L'Oreal it's the infallible Pro
glow foundation I feel like my skin eats
this stuff so throughout the day I feel
like this just dissipates within 3 to 4
hours no matter what primer I wear
whether it is like a pro longing sort of
primer like a makeup extender or a
hydrating primer or a mattifying sort of
primer this just goes away and like 2 to
3 hours the shade I have is 2:01 classic
I agree it oxidizes incredibly pink
throughout the day and even though it
says the gives a radiant finish I feel
like it really doesn't I definitely get
very shiny in my t-zone but again I feel
like it's just very very patchy on my
skin so no matter if I
hide this with a damp sponge or my
favors or a brush this just doesn't look
good on my skin and I know so many
people love this but I have to say I
definitely prefer the pro matte over the
pro glow alright guys and finally I have
two primers here that were sent to me
for PR the first one will come as no
surprise I really have been roasting
milk makeup lately but this is just a
brand that I feel like it's a little
funky um I don't like any of their
little stick formulas right here because
I feel like they're very unsanitary but
the milk makeup luring stick I find that
there is absolutely no difference when I
use this it doesn't prolong the wear of
your makeup I feel like the point of a
primer is to prolong the wear of your
makeup this doesn't even really blur my
pores it really just kind of dries out
my skin and it really makes me wonder
what some of these beauty bloggers are
thinking when they're said this word PR
and they review it and everybody's
saying it's the best thing in the world
because it makes me not trust them
because I don't see any difference when
I wear this with foundation or without
foundation I've worn it just on my skin
like throughout the day while I've been
cleaning around the house and things
like that to see if it could help with
like oil control while I'm sweating and
all those kind of stuff it literally
does nothing so I'm very surprised that
so many people do enjoy it you milk a
makeup bowler stick and then finally we
have me Becca AB alluring a primer now I
have been on and off when it comes to
backup primers I don't like the
backlight priming filter I feel like it
gives if you're a very artificial sort
of looking plastered shiny face or at a
plastic look on the face and then I feel
like the first light priming filter is
really nice if you do have more combo to
oily skin but it doesn't really prolong
it my makeup throughout the day now at
the becca velvet blurring primer i feel
like it's really meant for those of you
with more combo to lately skin it
definitely is it likely becca ever matte
primer where you put it on it's like
sticky and tacky and like your makeup
won't go anywhere throughout the day i
don't feel like it really prolongs the
wear of my makeup again they have the
same sort of consistencies the milk
makeup blur stick and this and this one
is in stick form this one is in liquid
form and basically you put it on and you
start to rub it in and it kind of dries
down to a powder finish now again if you
have extremely oily skin that's going to
be really great for you throughout the
day but i don't notice that this really
blurs on my pores it definitely doesn't
prolong the wear of my makeup and
overall i'm just not impressed with
these primers whatsoever even though a
lot of people like them so
and that is it for today's video let me
know down below if you have any products
that you really don't like that it seems
like other people do thank you so much
for joining me make sure to check out
Kelly's video and I will see you guys on
Wednesday
