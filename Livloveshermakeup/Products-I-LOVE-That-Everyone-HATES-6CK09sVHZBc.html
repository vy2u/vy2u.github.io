welcome back to my channel this Monday
and next Monday I will have a
collaboration with my friend Kaylee bout
on at my channel as well as her Channel
today we're gonna be talking about
products that we love that everyone else
hates and then next week we're gonna be
talking about products that we hate that
everybody loves now I'm surprised that
Kaylee and I have not collapse yet she
is a cruelty free beauty vlogger who was
incredibly well-spoken she really really
comes off very very genuine in her
videos what you guys know I like she
does not do YouTube for a living so I
feel like she's a little more chilled
with her channel kind of like me and on
top of that she has some of the best
palate comparisons on YouTube in my
opinion so I would love if you guys went
over and checked out her channel like I
said we're gonna be doing this kind of
two-part series I'm really surprised we
haven't collapsed yet because we've
known each other for I feel like well
over a year on YouTube I believe we
started our channels around the same
time and I'm just so happy that I really
enjoy her content and that she enjoys
mine we definitely are different as far
as personalities are concerned she is
really calm cool and collected and very
sophisticated and very professional in
my opinion and I'm well but I really
like that we kind of bounce off each
other and I just really enjoy her
content so I'm gonna go ahead and link
her Instagram as well as her video as
well as her channel down below I would
highly recommend you guys go over and
take a look at her channel I think
you're really gonna enjoy it but yeah
without further ado let's go ahead and
talk about some products that I really
love that everybody hates so the first
product that I want to talk about is the
Too Faced of white chocolate chip
challenge is this got really really poor
ratings and there are very few people
that I think love this as much as I do
now I thought that they released a white
chocolate bar palette um I did not pick
that one up and because I feel like the
color selection is slightly strange a
lot of people were saying it's identical
to this one live how can you not like it
but I disagree there were some shades in
there that I just thought was plain
strange okay there were some Purple's
there was like a bright green a bright
orange it just didn't really look like
my style and I'm just not really into it
so I really do like this little white
chocolate chip palette that way I also
picked up the matte chocolate chip
Halliday ended up decluttering that one
I found those very hard to blend
although that was great for those of you
with more of like a medium to deep
complexion this one is definitely kind
of geared towards those of you who do
have like a fair to light complexion
these will not show up on you if you do
have a medium skin tone or deeper
unfortunately but for me
especially when I'm super super pasty
and that soft handed this is a great
palette it's everyday friendly is super
super quick there are a few in here that
are definitely misses I don't really
like the glitter and few shades like the
pink one right here or black sugar but
the rest of them I like I like carrying
this around in my purse it's something
that's always sitting in one of my bags
and I do enjoy it I know a lot of people
don't but I do
are you moving on we have another little
pallet here this is from our glass I
have always loved this formula and I can
understand what people don't I think
it's more so the layout in here that
kind of irks people but for me I love
the modernist eyeshadow palettes from
our glasses called obscura I believe
this was around $65 you don't get a lot
of product in here just like all other
our glass products but it's very much a
luxury product I get some of the most
beautiful a beautiful muted dark smoky
eyes with this palette you get the same
look every single time but at the same
time it just blends so beautifully if
you want that really really neutral
brown eye I feel like this is just a
really nice way to do it a lot of people
don't like this because unfortunately as
you can see the colors do start to merge
into one another
I like the artistic approach I can see
what they were going for it didn't
exactly go the way that they had planned
a lot of people gave this a bad review
but the formula the pigmentation and the
wear time on this is definitely very
good so and this is the obscura
modernist eyeshadow palette from
hourglass
I love it a lot of people do not alright
up next here we do have yet another
palette this one is also from Too Faced
this is actually one of the old school
Holy Grail palettes I'm currently the
holy grail for me this is the return of
sexy palettes I want to do a video all
about like my favorite OG palettes but
this is what it looks like on the inside
you're getting little quints is it quits
one two three four five yes you're
getting little Quinn so you have a smoky
one and then you have a purple tone one
and then a neutral one or like an
everyday friendly kind of one so back in
the day this was like a great formula
everybody seemed to love it but you can
notice in here that a lot of these are
kind of glitter infused however this was
a completely different formula for Too
Faced at the time and still they have
never released a palette that has this
formula it's err light it's buttery it's
incredibly easy to blend yes you do have
to layer up the colors if you want a lot
of definition but
nowadays a lot of people don't talk
about this and a lot of people say it's
a shitty formula in my opinion this was
a great formula the two-phase came out
with and I would love to see them go
ahead and reappear with this kind of
formula because I think the to base the
return of sexy palette is incredible but
a lot of people don't like it moving on
I have a lip product here that was
recently sent to me for PR from Catrice
cosmetics this is their lip cushion in
the shade a little soul fruit
zero-five-zero
and this is probably one of the
prettiest kind of lip glosses ever do
you guys see that beautiful magenta kind
of shiny color you can see the actual
application my Turk some people it is
one of those little sponge tip
applicator --zz but it goes on so nicely
and I can see why a lot of people don't
like this it's pretty sticky not like
sticky sticky but it's got avvocato
infused in there so you can feel it on
the lips it's pretty darn heavy but I
feel like these we're an incredibly long
time it's not as precise of an
application as I would like but I love
to layer this on top of a drying at
liquid lipstick so currently this has
like a 2 to 3 star rating on the
ulta.com website but it's honestly
something I would recommend checking out
of you like a very very shiny gloss so I
love the Catrice cosmetics lip cushions
I know a lot of people don't but I do
all right up next to you guys I have an
illuminator or a highlighter that a lot
of people do not like I remember seeing
a YouTube reviews of this and people
being like what the is this but
this is from Josie Maran it's called
their Argan enlightenment illuminating
veil and I swear to you right now if
this is one of the most beautiful
ethereal sort of powders ever it reminds
me a lot of the hourglass ambient
lighting stroke powder in the shade
brilliant it's a slightly kind of golden
wheat color and it does have a little
bit of a flecks of glitter in here which
is why I think some people didn't like
it but you can brush those away with a
fluffy brush this looks amazing on the
skin it really has that sort of blurring
filter sort of look kind of like the
hourglass ambient lighting powders and I
was just so surprised and when I saw
that so many people just like this when
I first came out about two years ago it
is one of my go-to that when I want a
highlight but not anything too blinding
it's right up there with the hour
ambient lighting powder so I personally
really love the Josie Maran Argan
enlightenment luminizing veil but a lot
of people don't alright moving on we
have the Maybelline master Prime long
lasting eyeshadow base I really should
light a shade which I believe is called
like 510 or 515 and now this is not a
cruelty-free product but it is my
all-time favorite eye primer so for me
personally I like an eye primer that has
a little bit of slip to it to the
stickier the worst in my opinion because
I feel like that I have to take forever
to blend out my eyeshadows I would
rather have a shadow that starts to look
a little more mundane increases
throughout the day that eyeshadows that
are hard to blend and I know that's a
weird thing to say but it's just for me
personally I don't mind a little bit of
fading as long as it doesn't take too
long to blend in the morning so I really
love this formula right here but this
got really really poor ratings and on
top of that it does have a very very
kind of shimmery formula to it which a
lot of people are not into I normally
don't like my eye primers to have
shimmer in them if this was just
completely matte it would literally be
it's straight up the best eye primer
ever in my opinion obviously would not
repurchase I'm looking for something
simpler but yeah I really do enjoy it
the Maybelline master prime an eyeshadow
base moving on we have the pretty vulgar
cosmetics the feathers of mascara I mean
look how gorgeous this packaging is when
I did my review on pretty vulgar
cosmetics which I'll go ahead and throw
up in the review I didn't like this I
would give this about a 2 star rating
and now after its dried out a bit so
this is like a five-star rated mascara
you guys it's amazing I feel like this
formula really needs to dry out a little
bit I want to do a video for you guys
all about two mascaras that work better
once they dry out let me know if you're
interested in seeing that but I do have
a few mascaras in my collection that
sometimes I will literally leave a
little bit like this so that they dry
out quicker because they're just too wet
of a formula and this was just one of
those formulas it just didn't do very
well at first but about two months later
it's going great I really really enjoy
it and I know this has really really
poor reviews on the Sephora comm website
I feel like pretty vulgar in general it
didn't get the highest height as a
rating on Sephora I feel like you know
was really really hyped up and then
after a while it just kind of phased out
but I really do enjoy the sputters eye
mascara after it has dried out so that
is definitely a product that I love that
everybody else hates
and finally guys we have an eyeliner
here from laura geller I never hear
anybody talk about this and I think it
has a two star rating on the ulta.com
website it is the eyecare waterproof
eyeliner in the shade of banana or eye
brightener and this is just the most
beautiful neutral kind of banana shade
to put onto in the waterline it has a
hint of yellow to it but it's still kind
of like a white base this is the perfect
color for me and my complexion some
people if you do have like a deeper
complexion it looks good to put sort of
like a salmony eyeliner on to make your
eyes look a little bigger and more awake
and that is too dark for me but then
when I do a stark white eyeliner it just
looks too like harsh so I really like
this color right here I know a lot of
people don't like the formula because it
is quite dry and you do have to build it
up on your waterline but I have never
been able to find another eyepencil that
has or can mimic this exact shade so
it's like that like banana color with a
little bit of a white base so I love
this but I know a lot of people do not
so anyway guys and that is it for
products that I love that everyone else
hates I hope you guys are excited for
next Monday make sure to go check out
Kaylee's channel and I will see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
