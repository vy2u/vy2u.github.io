to my channel i really hope you are all
having a fantastic weekend i am here to
share with you guys products that i have
repurchased i thought it'd be fun to
share with you guys products that i have
repurchased because i feel like those
are like of my ultimate favorites you
know those are products that i have
repurchased and you know that I love
them so anyway let's just get right into
it I'm the person I'm gonna start with
are three different powders that I have
definitely repurchase multiple multiple
times the first one is the Rimmel stay
matte long-lasting press powder in the
shade 001 transparent this is just a
completely translucent powder does have
a little bit of a yellow undertone but I
personally really like this as you can
see I have hit pan on this one I've gone
through probably six or seven of these
powders really really enjoy them they
are absolutely fantastic i also have
gone through probably nine or ten of the
essence all about match-fixing compact
powders I repurchase these all the time
they are one of my all-time favorite
setting powders I have hit pan on this
one as well really really enjoy these
they keep me very very mad and then the
last powder that I definitely repurchase
like on a consistent basis is the Revlon
nearly naked powder in 010 fair and I
really really like this one as well
again I have hit some major pan on this
I have purchased probably three or four
these I really do enjoy it has a little
bit of a pink color to it it's not
completely transparent or translucent
but I still enjoy setting in my like
foundation if it's a little too late for
my skin I enjoy setting it in with this
to kind of darken the color up a bit
alright moving on I have a couple
mascaras or three master is here that I
definitely repurchase the first one
being the um i was gonna say maybelline
know who is this by whose Club crusher
by again covergirl covergirl this is the
covergirl clump crusher by lash blast
really enjoy this I have purchased many
many many of these I like the Mindy
waterproof version I like the brown
version I like the black version they're
really really nice and I especially like
them on my lower lash line during the
summertime because I feel like my
mascara really does transfer in the
warmer months all right another one that
I have repurchase I think this is my
third little tube this is the benefit
they are real this is one of my all-time
favorite mascaras it's really really
fantastic it's got an amazing amazing
wand and I really like what it does for
my lashes and then the last one that I
have repurchased I think this is my
second tube this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara really really enjoy
this I'm thinking of purchasing the
better than sex waterproof after i am
done with this one just so i can try out
the new formula and see if I enjoy it as
far as concealer goes I repurchase this
instant age rewind dark circle treatment
in the brightener shade from Maybelline
all the time I love this underneath my
eyes it really really brightens things
up it looks beautiful really really
adore of this particular product I also
repurchase um this foundation quite
often I don't talk about it nearly
enough on mine so funny it's called
nearly naked I don't talk about it
nearly enough on my channel but this is
the Revlon nearly naked nearly naked
nearly naked foundation in the shade 110
ivory this is probably my six bottle of
this I'm not even kidding i purchased
this all the time it is so beautiful on
the skin it really just looks like skin
it's an absolutely gorgeous product and
I have repurchased this quite a bit I
feel like I don't talk about it enough
but I plan on wearing this next week so
you guys can see what it looks like on
my face because I think it's absolutely
stunning another product that I have
repurchased many many times is the elf
makeup mist and set this is probably one
of my all-time favorite setting sprays
it really does work this was the first
setting spray I ever purchased in my
life and I still really absolutely adore
it a powder that I repurchase all the
time is the it cosmetics bye bye pores
this is the translucent poreless finish
HD micro powder I only like this one I
do not like the pressed version this one
is so messy and I feel like you inhale a
bunch of powder every
you put it on but this is my all-time
favorite finishing powder I have
repurchased this I think six times this
year or like within the past late
probably within the past 10 months
probably about six times which is crazy
so I really really enjoyed that um a
foundation / CC cream that I have
repurchased a lot that is now
unfortunately not available like you
can't buy it anymore is the cover girl
Plusle a CC cream tone rehab foundation
in 105 ivory this is my third little
tube or my third little pump um and I'm
really depressed that I can't get this
anymore it is completely like off the
market now they do have a new foundation
that is very very similar but this
without definitely like my favorite CC
cream of all times I prefer this over
the it cosmetics one it's just beautiful
I really really enjoyed it and this was
my third at little container like I said
as far as brown products I have
repurchased this Revlon brow fantasy by
color stay in the shade excuse me in the
shade dark blonde I think three or four
times I really enjoy this I do not like
the gel on the other side but I love the
pencil it's really really an amazing
pencil it's a gorgeous gorgeous color
really matches um like my hair color and
all that kind of stuff it pulls a little
more of a warm tone but I actually
really really enjoy it so I love that
and then the last two things I want to
talk about our eyeliners I repurchase
this NYC Kohl eyeliner pencil in the
shade 926 white all the time I love this
on my waterline and I'm just not really
picky even though it is a little sharp
and kind of harsh I'm not to get all
this is the only white eyeliner that is
repurchase all the time and then as far
as like a banana shade or like a
brightening eye liner I repurchase the
Laura Geller icare waterproof eyeliner
in the eye brightener shade all the time
I think this is my sixth one so let me
