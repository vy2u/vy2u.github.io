channel today we're going to be
discussing some products now I have
talked myself out of purchasing and this
is not an anti haul because these are
actually products I was very interested
in interested in to the point where I
actually added them to my Sephora love
list but I have taken them out and I'm
gonna let you guys know why so the first
one I want to start with is the Marc
Jacobs Beauty dewdrops coconut gel
highlighter so I think that there's a
lot of hype around this product and I
really only wanted it because it smells
like coconuts apparently and also
because there was a lot of hype
I usually don't fall into hype but I
couldn't help myself with this one the
packaging is gorgeous like I said it
descends you know it's supposed to be
really spectacular but I looked at it
and I realized number one it's a liquid
illuminator
I really don't like to wear those I
definitely prefer baekchul a powder you
know finishes as far as highlights are
concerned and second of all the color is
very basic in my opinion I looked at
swatches and it just seems like it was a
really nice champagne for a color with a
little bit of a yellow undertone and I
feel like I can do that out in my
collection so I don't feel like I need
that Marc Jacobs beauty is cruelty free
which is great all the products I'm
mentioning here obviously cruelty free
but yeah I don't know I feel like I was
super super into it when I first saw it
and I'm just like it I can probably live
without that alright next we have the
Becca liquid crystal glow losses so you
guys were actually recommending I picked
these up after I did on my light chaser
highlighter reviews which were all six
of the highlights from Becca I'll go
ahead and start that up in the cards if
you would like to check it out I love
those highlighters and I really felt
like becca was on fire this past month
like in June and I really wanted to get
these because a lot of you were saying
they're not sticky they're really
holographic dual chromatic beautiful on
the lips but then I realized okay when
do I ever wear lip gloss literally never
I did a declutter about six months ago
which again I'll throw up in the cards
where I declutter like 88 lip glosses
because I never use them these would
just sit there and go bad in my
collection I'm sure they're pretty I'm
sure I take pictures of them I probably
swatch them but I can guarantee you I
probably would never wear them so that
is just a good excuse to not get them
alright next we have the Smashbox
spotlight palette in Pearl I believe
this is a collaboration with Casey
Holmes a lot of you are recommending I
check out some of her first impressions
as far as foundations are concerned so
I'm definitely going to be doing that
soon I'm not currently subscribed
actually haven't really watched any of
her videos I've seen a few before but
we'll be going ahead and checking out
her channel what is happening and what's
there so chaps I was practicing this
afternoon just to excuse them okay
anyway the spotlight talent in Perl when
I first saw that this release a lot of
people were typing it up and then I was
like I really don't need it and then I
saw it on the sephora.com website I saw
some swatches on Instagram and I was
like okay I don't need it but I really
want it now the reason why I changed my
mind was because recently I saw my
friend hey we do a video where she
actually duped out all three colors and
they're they're very similar to like
that does mum stone and two other
drugstore highlighters and I just
thought I don't need those I don't need
those in my life they are a typical
powder of formula I do prefer facial a
again so yeah definitely don't need that
all right next we have me melt and make
up the Larsa talked about super super
hyped up now it was funny because when
this first started like getting hype and
like people started really talking about
it I was not trusting any of the reviews
that I saw about this product it seemed
like they were all sponsored they were
all sent the product but then I started
seeing some people that I really trust
and they were saying it's really
fantastic and I just come to the point
where I don't feel like I need it I feel
like it's similar to a silicon based
primer I have gone in store and actually
swatch it and it gives you sort of that
smooth feeling on the actual skin but
when I look at side-by-side comparisons
of what someone's face looks like at the
beginning of the day of versus the end I
really can't notice that much of a
difference I feel like just use a nice
silicon based primer kind of fill in
your pores your fine lines you know your
wrinkles all that kind of stuff and it
does the same sort of thing so I'm going
to go ahead and pass on that also I did
see is that on a logical harmony she put
milk makeup recently into the pending
area which is kind of sad so I will keep
you guys updated on that if we can find
more information on their cruelty free
of status all right next we have the
charts typed and bright play multi at
Mac's so yes I am interested in some
Target products I would say with heart I
really really vent about like some of
their palettes you know their eyeshadow
palettes are blush palette but you know
their foundations are fantastic and you
know what they have always had really
good skincare products I love the clean
Queen vegan deodorant I really love them
are crucial oil they have some great
skincare items so when I saw this I was
like I need that she has really bright
packaging it looks super cute I saw some
people multi-masking with it on so you
have something that kind of high
around the outer perimeters and then you
have another part of the map that goes
around the t-zone to kind of purify but
then I realize if you have more than one
mask in your collection you can multi
mask anyway I'll weave multi masks I
will take a clay mask in my t-zone if
I'm oily and there's something a little
more hydrating all around the rest of my
face or sometimes I even do it with four
mask at the same time so I feel like I
don't need this I did look at the
ingredients and make things pretty good
but I have masks to have better
ingredients so I'm gonna go ahead and
pass on that all right next we have like
an oldie but I know it's a goodie I just
don't need it it is the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills contour kit so reasonably
I've gotten more into contouring and
have a little more Sun or I've gotten a
little more Sun while I've been down
here and I just thought you know what I
really should get the contour kit
because I love the glow kits I've never
tried the contour kit everybody raves
about it but then I went into the my
collection I saw that I have the Tarkus
contouring palette I saw I have the Too
Faced one I saw that I have a fantastic
one from a cosmetics and I realized I
have enough contour to literally
probably last the rest of my life so
that is not something I'm going to be
purchasing I'm sure it's fabulous but I
have other contour kit so you know I
don't need another one and if I only
guys we have the pharmacy honey drop
lightweight moisturizer with echinacea
green envy or Green Envy redundant this
is basically a moisturizer that has
honey enriched in it and it was very
very intriguing to me now it says it is
a lightweight moisturizer and I was in
my Sephora lovelace I saw this product
ounce like oh yeah I'm super excited
about that and I went wait wait a minute
actually do not like any of the
moisturizers that I have tried from the
pharmacy brand they have great lip balms
they have great mass but unfortunately I
do not like any of their moisturizers
they all tend to be a little on the
slimy side I do like their night
treatment which is more of like a gel to
oil but their daytime moisturizers are
very very slimy so even though it does
say here honey drop a lightweight
moisturizer I just honestly don't want
to deal with if it is slimy I don't want
to deal with that I hate slimy
moisturizers I know that's such a little
nitpicky sort of thing but I just
realized you know yes it has great
ingredients but if I don't like the
consistency I'm not going to use it and
then it's going to end up you know at
the bottom like hub or covered hub organ
is going to end up in the bottom of my
cupboard
never going to reach for it so what is
the point of that no point so anyway
guys those are some products I've
recently talked myself out of purchasing
it let me know down below if you have
recently taken any products off yours
before I love lists and that is pretty
much it I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
