welcome back to my channel I know this
is not the video that you were expecting
today the video you were expecting tour
today is gonna be up tomorrow I've been
having some issues this week with this
little guy right here this is what I
plug my SD card into and then I plugged
into my computer well my favorites went
ahead and took a little choo-choo on
this so some of my videos that I wanted
to get up this week I've had to refill
them and all this kind of stuff so I'm
sorry that I've had to move some video
ideas around but tomorrow will be the
video all about the LEAs professional
beauty brands of 2017
already pre film fails and holy grails
for you guys on Sunday so that's the
last video that I have to film before I
take my week off here but yeah this is
what we're doing tonight okay
so anyway I have been talking to you
guys lately about some products that
kind of aged me and I've mentioned in
videos hey sometimes I put this
foundation on or sometimes I put this
concealer on and I feel like I look 20
30 40 years older it just so happens
that sometimes products don't sit as
beautifully on your skin as you would
like obviously so a lot of people were
requesting that I actually film a video
talking about the products that don't
sit on my skin as beautifully kind of
aged me a little bit and then let you
guys know how I fix them and why I still
have them in my collection so we're
gonna start with two at different
lippies the first one I have here is
from Too Faced it's the melted chocolate
liquefy the long-wear lipstick I don't
talk about these all that often because
they really don't look pretty on my lips
and then this guy right here is from
colour-pop this is one of their Ultra
metallic lips in the shade of zebra I
get a ton of compliments every time I
wear this but if I don't pair it
together with a gloss it looks like shed
I am one of those people that already
has a dry lips and I definitely have
little bits of like fine lines on my
lips as well and I noticed that when I
wear both of these products without
topping them with a gloss I get those
little lines and it just gets all
crumbly looking kind of disgusting so
although I love these two colors I
cannot wear them on their own I do have
to go in with either a lip oil on top a
little bit of vaseline or aquaphor or I
use something called um petroleum jelly
from Alba Botanica or I go in it with a
clear gloss on top that's the only way
that I can wear these two lip products
or else they look incredibly aging
around my mouth area so
the first two little products I wanted
to mention up next we have something
here from amazing cosmetics I've
recently talked about this in a video
all about PR products I would not
purchase with my own money and this was
sent over it's one of their illuminating
primers and I feel like the second you
get this onto your skin if you have
texture if you have acne if you have
anything this is going to obviously
illuminate it it's a very illuminating
product I will go ahead and put a little
bit onto the back of my hand here so you
guys can see what I'm talking about
it's a very thick sort of liquid and
once you start to rub it in you will see
all the little pores and things like
that on at my hand because obviously
it's kind of like a liquid illuminator I
don't recommend using this as a primer
unless you have absolutely perfect skin
to be completely honest and nobody has
perfect skin so what would I recommend
this far honestly I think this is great
if you want to use it as a liquid
highlighter go ahead and dampen up your
sponge put a little bit onto your sponge
and then tap over your foundation even
if you have set it with a powder it
actually looks very beautiful as long as
you're wearing very light foundation and
very light powder now another way that
you can use this is actually mix it
together with your foundation it may be
a drop of oil and it just looks a lot
more skin like and it doesn't look like
such a plaster to kind of look on the
skin and it really doesn't emphasize all
those lines and textures and bumps and
all that so I just wanted to go
ahead and talk about that quickly up
next we have the NARS radiant creamy
concealer unfortunately this is
something that still doesn't work for me
and I don't have any tips on how to make
this work it is just really ugly
underneath my eye area it tends to
really really emphasize all the lines
underneath there and the creepiness and
it's kind of funny because this crease
is like crazy on me I want to do a video
for you guys too and talking about
makeup products that crease like a
 on me okay because there
are some products out there but this is
the shade Shantanu and it's beautiful
and I really like the shade match if I
you know don't have any self-tanner on
it's a nice shade match but I don't like
it for spot concealing I don't like it
underneath my eyes it is just absolutely
horrible and gritty does age my
under-eye area so that is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer all right guys
the moving on Urban Decay all nighter a
foundation I love this foundation it's a
beautiful it's got great coverage a nice
sort of liquidy feel to it but if you
don't use this the right way when you do
have normal to dry skin this is gonna
age your face so what I recommend doing
is going in with a drop of jojoba oil or
going in with a drop of some sort of oil
you can use whatever you want
I wouldn't recommend
using things like avocado oil markussi
oil or anything that's too thick so
definitely not coconut avocado or
maracuja oil but what I would recommend
is something a little lighter sweet
almond oil jojoba oil those kind of
things is it even rosehip sweet oil
really really makes this work nicely so
I will take a couple pumps on this onto
the back of my hand I warm it up and
then I add a drop of oil I warm it up
and then I Pat it onto my skin and apply
with a damp sponge and it works for me
because if I don't do that this really
it really ages me I mean it sinks into
every little fine line and wrinkle all
the creases I made it it doesn't look so
good okay so that was the Urban Decay
all nighter foundation up next we have
the charts of BB tinted a primer if you
do have combo oily skin this is gonna be
a product that you absolutely love and
it probably won't eat you in any way
shape or form but for me with my dry
skin now what happens is this is
actually a cream to powder sort of
product so it's very dangerous with
those cream to powder products when you
do have normal to dry skin because very
quickly and that can turn into a very
cakey look on the skin and this really
really can emphasize a lot of peach fuzz
as well as any sort of dry patches that
you may have on your skin which in
return can make you look older we all
know that with dry skin you tend to look
older because you know you're just not
as moisturized and when you smile you
can see more crevices and more creases
you know I've had combo skin and I've
had dry skin now and let me tell you
both of them Sokka I really wish that I
just have no skin problems whatsoever
but I mean it's really hard being oily
skin because and everything slips and
slides off your face but it's also very
hard having dry skin because nothing
really sits beautifully on the skin and
this is one of those foundations you
have to be very careful with it is a BB
tinted a primer treatment it does have
SPF 30 so it's nice when you go out
during the daytime but I have to use a
very small amount to this less is more
with this I'm talking like a tiny tiny
little dollop if I use even a quarter
sized amount to this it looks very bad
on the skin so with this guy if you do
have normal to dry skin this is more up
next guys we have a couple of powders
here and again powders can go into that
dangerous territory when you do have
normal to dry skin the big question is
do I set my foundation or do I not set
my foundation I've always noticed
whether it be i have combo skin or dry
skin my skin looks more perfected and
airbrushed when i do set it in with a
powder but if i go over
bored or especially if I go overboard
with these powders it looks bad real
quickly so the first one is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte powder and this is
actually in the shade porcelain it is
incredibly dark it matches me great
right now when I have two layers of
self-tanner on but let me tell you if I
don't have self tan this is way too dark
now this is nice but it really doesn't
matter fine your skin this actually has
a little bit of like a sheen to it it
kind of reminds me of the Kat Von D
locket translucent powder and more of
like a pressed form so this is actually
pretty nice for setting the under-eye
area
it definitely when I had combo oily skin
did not keep me completely oiled for you
throughout the day
but what I will say is that if I apply
too much of this underneath my eye area
it starts to just sink into the skin the
same thing goes for the Maybelline Dream
wonder at powder of course these are
both products I wouldn't repurchase I
purchased these before going cruelty
free but this is in the shade ten
porcelain ivory again way way way too
dark I don't know what it is with
drugstore powders like come on guys but
this one is very very actually and very
pink toned and again these are such thin
little powders that if you apply too
much they just sink into the skin and
then you start to see those little areas
around to your pores as well where you
see the pore and then you see a little
pocket where it has like almost like
color in it and it's basically your
powder setting in into the little
pockets in your skin aka setting into
your pores so you want to be very very
careful with these two powders if you
apply too much of them you definitely it
will eat your skin very very quickly for
me when I did have more combo oily skin
I felt like my skin would just eat these
powders up not necessarily aged me but
with normal to dry skin they do start to
age me and then finally guys a little
last a little formula I have here are
the Urban Decay afterglow 8 hour powder
highlighters these are a fan favorite a
lot of people like these I have three
full sizes I have aura which is a
beautiful cool toned pink shade I also
do have you shade sin which is one of
the fan favorites which is a beautiful
mid-tone kind of champagne color and
then I do have fireball this one it will
be a blush topper for you if you do have
a fair complexion for me right now it is
a highlight it is a peachy color with a
little bit of a lavender undertone
running through it very very beautiful
on the skin however these are a true
powder formula they almost have a little
bit of grip to them I don't want to say
rich cuz they're not like they're not
like that but they almost have a little
bit of grip almost like they're sticky
now what you have to do with these is
really blend them into your skin if you
are gonna go in go in with the densely
packed brush I'm talking about something
really really nicely densely packed like
maybe the blend else blending brush
which is like a it's almost like a
contouring brush should be completely
honest and you're gonna take this powder
and you're really gonna buff it into
your skin and go in circular motions or
even these Sigma at 35 not f-35 yes it
is at 35 if the tapered highlighter
brush you really want to blend it in
circular motions as well it leaves a
gorgeous sheen on the skin but another
thing I want to recommend to you guys is
going ahead and spray and your brush
down and foiling it so pick up the
product with your brush and then spray
it down then apply to the skin you're
gonna get a lot more of a glossy feel
and it's not going to emphasize pores
and texture and make you look ten years
older so anyway guys those are some
products that definitely age me unless
I'm very careful I hope this video was
helpful please let us know down below
what products you have that kind of age
your skin but also let me know down
below if you have any sort of tips and
tricks on how to fix it alright guys I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
