my channel thank you so much for joining
me today I am finally doing at the
long-awaited products that have replaced
others in my collection video now if you
guys follow me on Instagram and you know
that this has been on my list for about
two to three months but I want to see
really quickly I recently saw my friend
Kaylee do a video that was very very
similar so I feel like if you enjoyed
this video you're definitely going to
enjoy the one that she did so I'm gonna
go ahead and leave her a video as well
as her channel down below in the
description bar I know I've been linking
a lot of her videos recently but I feel
like if you guys really enjoy my channel
you're very much going to enjoy her
channel so that's why I've been linking
her but anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into it I feel like these are
products that I have definitely replaced
others in my collection I just don't
feel the need to go out and purchase
that other product anymore because these
ones are better and they do the same
thing usually for cheaper so let's go
ahead and jump right into it the first
thing I might want to talk about is this
Estee Lauder a little quench right here
I feel like my Sonia Kashuk ion neutral
palette has completely replace this
little baby right here and now I have
kept this around in my collection
because once in a while I do like to
reach for it especially for travel it is
a very very small it's got a nice mirror
here it is quite nice for travel
now this particular point is called
provocative pedal this is one of the
pure color and via quints but I do feel
like my Sonia Kashuk ion neutral palette
gives me these same exact sort of kind
looks and I really feel like these are
just as blendable just as smooth just as
creamy and Sonia Kashuk is a cruelty
free of brands so I definitely don't
think that I'll be holding on to this
for a much longer just because this
gives me these same exactly looks the
only thing that this palette doesn't
have that this one has is a little bit
of a shimmery kind of grayish color now
that shimmery gray color really isn't
that pigmented oh go ahead and swatch it
for you guys just so you can see it
honestly is quite shocking it's kind of
glittery and it just really has
absolutely no pigment to it so I really
reach for that one but yeah I feel like
my so when you catch the guy on neutral
palette gives me the same exact look so
that is a product that has been replaced
in my collection up next I do have my
ELF HD setting powder and sheer now I
feel like this has really replaced my
need for a high-end
these silica setting powders I do have
quite a few in my collection so I do
have B Tarte Amazonian clay smooth
operator Amazonian clay finishing powder
I also do have quite a few of the it
cosmetics bye bye pores
I do enjoy these because they have a
little bit of a yellow tint to them so
they're easy to do the buffing technique
with and not have any sort of flashback
so would recommend that one if you need
something for flashback and also I do
have the by Terry hyaluronic hydra
powder this is probably the only one
that I would repurchase that is high-end
because it does have a hyaluronic acid
infused in there and I notice a
difference it definitely doesn't get too
choppy on my skin it has a little more
moisture but I feel like this one right
here is so similar to so many on the
market including the Make Up For Ever
one which is what like $42 so and this
is a great deal it's only five to seven
dollars you get a huge amount of product
in here would highly recommend you guys
check this out I will be starting a new
series on my channel called hacks that
are not whack and I'm going to be going
ahead and demoing with this baby right
here as the buffing technique and I just
think it's absolutely fantastic so if
you're looking for a good finishing
powder and you don't need to go out and
spend more than $30 you don't even need
to spend more than $10 what's highly
recommend the mix HD I'm sorry the elf
HD setting powder NYX also has one but
it's a little more crazy so I would
recommend going with this one alright up
next I have these guys right here so
this is the tushy Club this is the YSL
blurring a primer and I've had this in
my collection for a while you get a lot
of product in here but I have to say I
feel like all my silicone based primers
are basically the same thing the
Smashbox photo finish primer gives you
the same exact look it will give you the
same exact thing basically it will make
your makeup last just as long throughout
the day and it is cruelty free so this
is something I would definitely not
repurchase in my collection the only
difference here is that it does have a
little bit of a fragrance it kind of
smells like a high-end perfume and some
people would say hey no that's a big
turn-off for me I don't want fragrance
on my skin so I can understand why some
people would want to go for the Smashbox
or even the maybelline baby skin this
one is also basically just all the same
thing okay
all these did met the cone in silicone
base primers to me are very very similar
so that is definitely a product that has
replaced others in my collection would
not repurchase the Maybelline since I'm
obviously going cruelty free would not
repurchase ey I sell but the Smashbox
for sure really really good product
right here alright
so moving on I have this Elora Keller
Beach map baked hydrating bronzer in the
shade of sunrise Farah now when I first
got this this was my go-to bronzer I
still wear it once in a while if you
guys open up the description bar in any
of my videos you might see this once in
a while feature down there however I
will say that the more Moreau butter
bronzer from Physicians Formula in the
shade bronzer has completely replaced
this I just don't need this anymore I'm
going to hold on to it cuz I don't have
a ton of bronzers in my collection but
once I am through with this bronzer
there is no way in hell I'm going to
repurchase it because this baby right
here is just as good I love these
Physicians Formula more Remora butter
bronzers I really wish they would make a
wider shade selection so that everybody
could go ahead and experience the
amazingness that is this bronzer but
this is just a fabulous fabulous bronzer
it does the same exact thing it gives
you the same exact look so I really
really do prefer this one right here
alright guys and finally I'm going to
talk about makeup revolution now what
makeup revolution really pisses you off
and you feel like they just do knockoffs
with different products I'm sorry to say
but you know what this guy right here is
way better than the Too Faced
candlelight glow a double-sided
highlighter this is from Too Faced you
get two different colors in here you get
a pinky side as well as the golden side
and this guy right here from makeup
revolution the vivid baked eyelid or in
the shade golden lights is better
quality it is cheaper this is about
$4.99 this is what about $30 25
something like that and this is even
better quality it's more pigmented it
just looks better on the skin I like the
way that it wears throughout the day so
you may not like makeup revolution but
this right here is a better product than
this one so this is definitely something
that has replaced this guy in my
collection I'll be going ahead and
decluttering this to one of my friends
at Britney when we do a little makeup
swap next month but yeah I would highly
recommend the makeup revolution vivid
baked highlighter if you shade and
golden of light so but those are
products that have replaced others in my
collection I want to know down below if
you have any products that have replaced
others in your collection and I guess
that is it for today's video I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
