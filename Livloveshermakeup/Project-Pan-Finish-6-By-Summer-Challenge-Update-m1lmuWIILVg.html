thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day so
far in today's video I have my finished
6 by summer foot finish 6 by summer
challenge update for you guys so I will
leave the original challenge video down
below in the description bar if you
would like to check it out I am now
calling this a project pan video because
it technically is a project pan video I
did not call it a project hand video in
the original video because I honestly
thought there were rules and regulations
for project pan videos turns out there
is not you can do whatever you want and
kind of just make it your own so yes
this is a project pan video this is my
first and only update for this challenge
and it will be back on June 1st to give
you guys the finale and we'll see if I
used up all of the products and just so
you guys know I will be doing a project
pan video every three months on my
channel so after this one is done I will
be starting out finish seven by fall and
I will do that one from June first all
the way through September first and then
I'll just keep adding a new product so
that I'll have finished 8 by winter
finish 9 by spring finish 10 by summer
stuff like that so I'm just gonna keep
stepping it up every three months and
I'm really excited to make this a series
on my channel because although I do have
tons and tons and tons of makeup and
products and things like that I think it
is important to use up what you do have
especially when you do buy as much as I
do so anyway let's go ahead and get
right into the updates so the first item
I have here is the essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder I have
completely used this up I'm going to
show you guys first the items I have
used up then the items that I'm very
close to using up and then the final
item which I'm not really close to using
up but anyway I have completely used
this up as you guys can see I put a
little smiley face on there in nail
polish so I have completely hit pan on
this and used this product up I really
really enjoyed it and when I started
this was completely full and it was
untouched so I haven't I hadn't even
used it yet so I am happy that I got
through that completely the second item
is completely used up as well hence the
little smiley face at the bottom and
this is the bath and Bodyworks
aromatherapy energy lemon zest body wash
and foam bath so I started right there
which was right um I would say right
below that little green line right here
that says lemon zest and as you guys can
see I have completely used this product
up alright to the third item that is
completely empty is the wet and wild
photo focus setting spray I started
right about there as you guys can see it
was kind of sort of towards the top I
thought the whole thing was completely
full but it wasn't so I started about
right there which is a little more than
half and I have completely used it up so
really really happy about that this is
an amazing setting spray I love it
alright now let's get into the two items
that I am very very close to finishing
so the first is the bosha revitalizing
black hydration gel this is what it
looks like and I started right here and
I am down to here so I have probably one
or two more uses with this product and
then it will be empty and then the next
item is the Vichy I Delia skin asleep
and I started right here so right sort
of towards the top it wasn't completely
full but it was pretty much full and I
have about one more use with this
product and I can actually show you guys
so as you can see there's just the
tiniest little bit of products left at
the bottom there so I would say probably
one more use of using that at night time
and that will be up completely and then
the final item that I had in this
challenge was the Garnier five-second
blur skin renew instant smoother I used
this as a primer and I thought this was
going to be the item that I got through
so quickly like you guys have no idea I
really thought this was gonna be the
item that like I emptied out completely
but honestly I started right about there
which is about halfway through the
bottle a little more than halfway
through the bottle and I am only here so
I probably have a week's worth of
product to left in here so I need to use
this remind me to use this in my shop my
stash next week so that I can get
through this before June 1st so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick little
video I know it's kind of short but it's
just an update on how I did so far for
the finish 6 by summer challenge if you
guys did this challenge along with me I
would love to know how you are doing on
all of the products and I will be back
on June 1st to give you guys the finale
and then like
I said on June 2nd I will be doing the
introduction for the finish 7 by fall
challenge alright guys see you tomorrow
