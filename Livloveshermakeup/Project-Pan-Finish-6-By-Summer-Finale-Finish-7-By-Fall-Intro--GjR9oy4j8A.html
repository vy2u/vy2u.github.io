thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day we
have a little more natural lighting
going on today I have my ring leg turned
out all the way I want you guys to be
able to see my tan so I used the Jerkins
which is a natural glow like the
building who moisturiser tanner thing
last night in the light of shade and I
actually think I look a little darker
let me know down below what you think
anyway in today's video I have my finish
6 by summer finale plus of my finished 7
my fault intro for you guys so this is a
project pan video and yeah let's go
ahead and just get right into it shall
we
so why did they finish sixth by summer
challenge and I will link on my intro
video and also my update video down
below the description bar if you guys
would like to check that out but I am
here to share with you guys if I made it
through everything so I didn't use up 5
out of these 6 items if you guys watch
the update video you probably know which
item I did not make it through but let's
go ahead and I will share with you guys
the ones I did get through so I did use
up the wet and wild photo focus setting
spray I really enjoyed this a lot it's a
really great product and I top that in
my empties I also used up the bozhe
revitalizing black hydration gel this
was another item that I really enjoyed a
lot and I'm glad I got through it
because there is an exploration on their
expiration date that was very very soon
to be you know it was approaching the
next item I used up it was the essence
all about Matt fixing complex powder
completely use that up and hit pan on
that baby and the next item I used up it
was the back of Body Works at Roma
Therapy energy lemon zest body wash and
foam bath another item that I really
enjoyed using up and then I also used up
with the Vichy ID alia idea yeah skin
sleep but this was a nice little
nighttime gel moisturizer and then the
item that I did not completely use up is
the garden a five-second blur skipper
new instant smoother if you guys saw in
the update video I made it to about
there and I have not made it any further
so this will be going into my next
project pan video which let's go ahead
and do the intro for so we are doing a
finish 7 by fall and I'm gonna share
with you guys the 7 items I chose out
and then
this is going to be kind of technically
the eighth item this is what I'm going
to be doing if I don't make it through
an item for a project pan I'm just gonna
carry it on to the next project pan
video but I'm not gonna count it as an
item because this is kind of like my
punishment my partner's maybe you guys
know what I mean I'm carrying it through
but I'm not gonna count it as an item
because they don't want to be too easy
on myself I wear makeup pretty much
every day and I know I definitely can
get through this so that is going to be
the first item so technically my bonus
item for the finish 7 by fall and then
the first item I would like to get
through is this Garnier clean plus a
blackhead eliminating scrub and for this
project pan I will be doing this let's
see here I'm tailed September 1st so
June 1st to September 1st so I have
three months to use up all seven or
eight of these items so yeah this is the
Garnier clean plus blackhead eliminating
scrub I used to love this one it has 35%
more product which means just more to
get through I used to love this for my
combo oily skin I no longer do it does
have cells so like acid 2% in it however
I find it very very abrasive on my skin
I don't know what happened my skin just
changed a little bit and I'm not a huge
fan but I do think it's a nice product
and I don't want to toss it so I am
starting and I think I'm about right
here next time you guys see my video my
update video I'll have the markings
exactly right and with everything but I
believe it's about right there so that
is the first item I am trying to use up
they second item I'm going to use that
or try and use up is the Becca backlight
priming filter now I have two of these
Becca was kind enough to send one of
these after I did a review on their
foundation it was a little too dark on
my skin tone so they ended up sending a
lot of like the beauty girls who did a
review on the particular shade they sent
them like the new lights like porcelain
or fair shade and then they also sent a
few extra items with like a little
handwritten note it was all very cute I
enjoyed it a lot um I won't be reviewing
that lightest shade of the foundation if
you guys are curious I'm gonna be
passing that along to a friends because
not only did I not like the actual shade
I actually do like the formulation
either so there's no point in me
reviewing it but they did give me
another one of these so I thought I
should try and get through this one so
this one is open this is the back light
priming filter it's just a primer it's a
very very beautiful product but now that
I
- I would like to get through one of
them and I am about right here with this
product so I have pretty much the whole
thing to go through and honestly this is
like a primer that I would use during
the summer time I really wouldn't use
this during the winter time because it
makes your skin really glowy and I only
really like to be super super glowy
during the summer time not so much the
winter so that if the second item I am
going to use up the third is this OG xed
sunkissed blonde lemon highlights
shampoo I have about this much left so
not too much I just had this sitting and
I really wanted to get through it so if
that is the next item and then I also
want to get through this benefits
dandelion shy beam I have no idea
there's a decoration bit on the bottom
of here and it needs to be used up in
December so I am going to be using this
it has kind of like you know a that
sounded so weird I think I said like a
Elsa I really used to get sort of as
like an under eye brightener slash
concealer it's a beautiful product it
just has this light pink sort of hue to
it and I do like it for underneath the
eyes but it's crazy I mean I got this
like literally I don't even know maybe
four or five months ago and the
expiration date is almost like it's
almost done so I don't know it's crazy
but anyway it's just a beautiful peachy
pink matte highlights and I will be
using that underneath my eye area so
that's the next item I also want to use
up this booty parlor this is the flirty
little secrets pheromone luminizing body
butter with pheromones so I got this
Navajo look I just really wanted it
because these fence sounded super super
tempting let's see if I can open it okay
there we go the scent sounded so nice
and it really does smell good this is in
blackberry honey and I was like oh my
god that sounds amazing for a body
butter but honestly it has little flecks
of glitter in it and I'm not really the
kind of girl who likes to put glitter
all over my body so I would really only
use this during the summer time it's
been sitting for about a year now so I
do want to get through it so this is
what it looks like and I pretty much
have the whole container of that to go
through and then the elastic products I
want to get through are also makeup so
the first one is the L'Oreal visible
lifted blur concealer my shade is 301
fair and this is such a beautiful
concealer I probably only have about
this much left like I am so close to
being done with this concealer it's
absolutely stunning I love it during the
summertime it's a very hydrating on the
skin very very beautiful and like
kind of like a satiny glowy finish I
just think it's a stunning product so I
would like to get through this iPad this
for a year and a half and it's been
opened so it needs to get new stuff and
then the final item I am going to try
and use up in this project pan is the
bare minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream
this has broad-spectrum SPF 30 in it and
my shade is opal 0-1 I think this is
beautiful but this is really only
something that I would wear on its own
during the summer time so again I feel
like it's kind of like the primer these
are products that I would really like to
use during this time our time and hello
it's summertime so let's go ahead and
try and get through those so those are
the seven items that I am going to try
and use up for this coming project Han I
hope you guys will join me let me know
down below in the comments section if
you are going to and I will be back
about halfway through for an update for
you guys on how I'm doing with those
products and yeah let's go ahead and
just see what we can do with these
products let's hope I can get through
them I think I did relatively well with
the finish 6 by summer I'm not
disappointed in myself with the primer
because I really just didn't reach for
it enough but I'm going to just carry
this on into the next one and we'll see
if I can get through it so thank you so
much for joining me guys and I will see
you in my next video should be up soon
after this it will be a review and
swatches on the new lorac pro 3
eyeshadow palette which is gorgeous
