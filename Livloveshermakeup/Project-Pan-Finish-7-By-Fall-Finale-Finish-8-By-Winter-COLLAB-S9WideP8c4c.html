today's video is going to be my project
pans finished seven by fall finale plus
might finish eight by winter collab so
this is actually a collab with my friend
Rochelle here on YouTube in real life
she is my best friend but she's also on
YouTube so you guys can definitely go
check her out
we started collapsing about three or
four months ago and since then our
friendship has really really blossomed
so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and leave
Rachelle's video down below her channel
her Instagram and also she just opened
up an Etsy shop I think you guys would
really really like some of the stuff
that she makes so I'm gonna leave that
down below as well I would love if you
went over and checked out her channel I
absolutely adore her to pieces she's
become such a vital and important part
of my life Wow it just got real serious
there but seriously she's a really
really wonderful person I would really
love the guys went over and checked her
out so anyway let me share with you guys
how I did on my finished 7 by fall I
pretty much used up 6 out of the 7 items
so I'm super excited so the first item
that I used up completely was from OGX
this is the Sunkist blonde lemon high
light shampoo this has a lemon citrus
oil it also has coconut oil and key lime
extract after using this for 3 months
like consistently I would say that I
would not repurchase this product I
definitely definitely think that it is
very very drying on the hair so I used
that up and I'm very happy I will not
repurchase alright the next item that I
used up is from bareMinerals this is the
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream this has broad-spectrum SPF 30 and
the shade that I used was opal 0-1 so
that is where I started and then at my
update video I was right there and as
you can see from the blue checkmark I
have completely used this up this is
also another item that although I
remember reviewing it like a year ago
and it being great for my skin
unfortunately this time of year when I'm
super oily this is just not good for me
at all the sunscreen in here is very
oily and I do notice I breakout from
this product so I would not repurchase
and the next item that I used up is the
garden a clean plus blackhead
eliminating scrub and this is a solace
lilyc acid acne treatment for oily skin
I found this very abrasive on my skin
and I would not repurchase this but you
guys were saying go ahead and use it on
different parts of your body so thank
you so much to everyone who said that in
the last update video because that's
what I ended up do
I used it on my feet I used it on my
chest my de classe wherever and I really
got through this quickly so thank you so
much the next item that I used up
completely is from benefit and this is
the dandelion shy beam it is a nude pink
matte radiance highlighter I started
right there at the update I was down
here and as you guys can see from the
check mark I have completely used this
up it's a very very beautiful product
but I feel like it's kind of like a
color corrector and I have plenty of
those so this is not an item that I
would repurchase an item that I would
repurchase is the l'oreal visible lift
Miller concealer the shade I have is
three zero one fair as you can see from
the blue checkmark I completely use this
up I was sad to see this go but honestly
it's because this was starting to go bad
so I really wanted to use it up
beautiful product and it just made me
feel really good about purchasing
another one because the honnestly like I
know project Panzers is that you can
focus on using items up but I also I
feel like you find out if you truly like
an item and I love this so used that up
and then the next item I used up was
from booty parlor this is the flirty
little secrets luminizing body butter
with pheromones so when I did at my
update video I have barely touched this
but after using it for a week and a half
in the morning and at night as you guys
can see I completely used it up it's not
something I would repurchase it smelled
really good the scent was blackberry
honey but yeah I don't know it wasn't
special so I I think I got that from
hautelook would not repurchase and the
final item that I did not make it
through of my number seven is the Becca
backlight priming filter so I started
right there and right now I'm kind of
there maybe a little higher so that is
where I'm at so far and I will be
passing this on into my finished eight
by winter so this is just a product that
I really noticed I wasn't reaching for
and I feel like that says a lot about
something if you don't naturally want to
reach for it you probably don't like it
so I won't be repurchasing this after I
use it up so anyway let's move on to the
finish H by winter this is the first
item the second item I'm going to try
and use up by December first is the Shea
Moisture raw shea butter moisture
retention shampoo
this has seek help and argan oil it's
for dry damaged hair and the reason I
want to use this up is because I noticed
this particular shampoo because it is so
natural it goes bad very very quickly so
what I'm going to start to do I'm right
here by the way so about halfway through
what I'm going to start to do is go
ahead and
mix this in with my regular shampoo
every single time I shampoo my hair I
noticed if I just use this as my shampoo
it does start to kind of build up and
leave residue in my hair so I'm gonna
mix it together with another shampoo
every single time I shower and hopefully
I can get through it
alright the next item I would like to
use up by December 1st is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara this has been
open for about a month and a half and I
have so many open mascaras that I really
just want to get through this this is
one of my all-time favorite mascaras and
I don't want it to dry out before I have
time to use it so that is what it looks
like and I will hopefully get through
that by December first
alright the next item is actually a body
butter so this is really funny this is
an item that I recently picked up from
Sephora all of the 2015 not all of them
but a lot of 2015 holiday like palettes
and things like that were on sale on the
Sephora sale section about three weeks
ago I think there's still some stuff on
there but anyway this was something
where I was like so excited to get it
and I flipped it over the expiration
date is in December so it's one of those
products like you know sometimes when
you see holiday stuff or things that are
on sale from last year it's good to kind
of remember especially when you're
picking up something as natural as like
the Josie Maran brand definitely check
that expiration date so I think this
smells amazing it's the be comforted
whipped argan oil ultra hydrating body
butter in the sheet out shaded and they
send apple crisp it smells absolutely
fantastic I'm gonna have a great time
using this out but yea it was just kind
of funny that I flipped it over and I
was like dang it's December 2016 I gotta
use that now so it's a beautiful
beautiful scent I'm gonna have a great
time using this so that is the next item
and then I also will be trying to get
through my Too Faced hangover RX
replenishing face primer I have had this
open for a year and a half and that's
just a little too long for something
that is like a liquid like this it still
smells good like coconuts so it doesn't
have like a beard scent yet but I am
about right there right there and I'm
gonna see if I can get through this I'm
sure that I can because honestly this
primer is everything like I would
repurchase this I would not repurchase
this one alright moving on I will be
trying to get through this Victoria's
Secret hydrating body lotion in the
coconut milk scent it it has a cotton
moisture complex in it and as you guys
can see I'm starting right there like
right up the tippy top
so this smells amazing it really reminds
me of like fall and winter
so I thought it would be a good time to
try and get through it it does have an
expiration date and it is in January so
I thought I might as well go ahead and
try and use this up I got this in my pop
sugar must-have box and it's like a full
size so we will see if I can get through
that and then also I have this covergirl
plus Olay CC cream this is a tone rehab
foundation in the shade 1:05 ivory if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you know this is my all-time
favorite CC cream and it's discontinued
so I have been holding on to this
because I'm like oh well use it for
special occasions which i think is so
silly it's like if you like a product
you should just use it so I'm gonna go
ahead and use it and I'm gonna love
every second of it this is where I am at
currently and I only have a little bit
left but you know what there's no point
in me holding on to this forever and
using it for special occasions every day
is a special occasion alright and then
the last product that I'm going to try
and use up by December 2016 is the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer in
the hydrate version so I'm gonna try and
get through this currently I have about
this much left so not a lot but I did
notice that this is starting to dry out
a little bit I love this concealer it's
beautiful but if you do want to get your
hands on it just know that it does dry
out a little quicker than other
concealers so anyway those are the eight
products that I am going to try and use
up by December 2016 definitely go check
out Michele's video check out her
channel her Etsy shop all that kind of
stuff the links will be down below and
yeah that is it I will see you guys
tomorrow for some holiday reviews bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
