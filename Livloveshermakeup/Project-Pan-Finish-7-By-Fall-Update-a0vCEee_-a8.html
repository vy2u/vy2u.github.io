video is going to be a update on my
finish seven by fall challenge so if you
guys are interested in seeing how I have
been doing then please keep watching
alright since the first item I have
completely used up and you guys know I
like to mark things with nail polish
because it doesn't chip off I tried to
do a smiley face it looks so creepy so
creepy
anyway I completely use this up it is
the Sun kids blonde lemon highlights
shampoo it has lemon citrus oil coconut
oil and key lime extract in it I used to
think that I really loved this shampoo
but honestly after completely using it
up I don't think it's something I would
repurchase I actually noticed that my
hair dries out quite a bit when I'm
using this although it does help to keep
my roots nice and bright I mean right
now it doesn't matter because I haven't
really been coloring my hair but it does
keep my roots really bright when I am
coloring my hair but I just noticed that
it does dry my hair out so that was kind
of nice to notice that this is not
something that I would repurchase
alright to the second item is the
L'Oreal visible lifted blur concealer
with optimal air technology the shade is
3:01 fair again my creepy little smiley
face I completely used this up so I'm
very very happy with that I actually
love this concealer it's something that
I would repurchase but this was sitting
in my collection for probably two years
open and it started to smell a little
rancid and I was like it wasn't
completely horrible yet but it started
to smell a little off and I really
wanted to use it off because I was like
halfway through and yeah I've used it up
completely so I'm really happy about
that still love this concealer is
absolutely beautiful on the skin if you
want something that looks like skin look
into that line alright the next item is
the garden a clean class blackhead
eliminating scrub the more I use this
the more I hate it like I used to love
this product and I got this big 6.8
fluid ounce container at Target and now
I just feel like it's too gritty on my
skin but I have been using it in the
morning and at nighttime and I started
right up here and now I am completely
down to there so I definitely think that
I will finish this up before September
1st I also have the benefits of
dandelion shy beam this is a nude pink
matte radiance highlighter I started
right there at the top and I am almost
completely empty I'm guesstimating it's
right there because when I actually want
to use this product I can't use the wand
anymore like it doesn't pick up enough
product actually to dump it into my hand
and it comes out really slowly so I'm
guessing that I will be done with that
any day now the bareMinerals complexion
rescue tinted hydrating gel cream with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 I used to love
this product I hate it now it just makes
me so early it has no staying power and
I started right there and I am like
almost completely finished with it so
this is my primer for the week and my
shot my stash a video so I'm hoping that
I can get through this week so yeah wait
for me Oh seriously like that product I
just like it's horrible if you have
combat lately skin is just going to
break up on your face and I really want
to use it up now I'm very very
determined alright and the last two
products I'm not doing very well on the
first is the booty parlor flirty little
secrets look see luminizing body butter
with pheromones this scent is blackberry
and honey which smells great I barely
touched this but I know that if I use a
day and night all the way in tell
September first I probably can use it up
so I'm going to really try to do that
and then the last item is just something
that I'm gonna have to bring into my
next project pan video it is the Becca
backlight priming filter and I didn't
even mark this I barely touched this so
I was there and I'm only about right
there now so this will have to go into
the next project pan which is a bummer
because this was gonna be great for the
summer time but I didn't reach for it
and I feel like that just goes to show
you that you know this is a product that
I don't naturally want to reach for I
would not repurchase so anyway I think
that I will probably finish four out of
the six possibly five out of the six if
I can get through that body butter and
yeah I will be back to update you guys
probably the second week of September
and then I will be doing finish eight by
winter collab with my friend Rochelle so
we're going to be trying to use up eight
products and I probably will put the
becca one in there as well but anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this thank you for
joining me and I'll see you later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
