happy Thursday I hope you were all
having a wonderful week so far excuse me
my throat is all Scratchy
anyway this particular video is going to
be an update on my project pan video
it's a current project pan that I am
working on it's finished 8 by winter and
I am considering December 1st as being
winter even though technically it isn't
but that's how I like to do my project
pans in little like three months
segments so anyway and this is a collab
with my best friend if you don't know
who my best friend is her name is
Rochelle and she does have a YouTube
channel I want to specify really quickly
because I think I might have confused
some of you guys when I did the intro
video
Rochelle does not have a beauty channel
she is actually more of a DIY slash
lifestyle channel so just know that
before you go over and check her out I
think some of you were expecting her to
have a beauty channel she does not have
a beauty channel but she does have quite
a nice-sized makeup collection so what
she is doing with me
is kind of working through some of her
makeup products and also just some of
her skin care products and things like
that as well so that she can completely
use them up she is definitely doing the
more minimalistic approach towards
things which i think is kind of the
standard project pan thing where you use
something up and you don't plan on
repurchasing for me I'm a makeup
collector I love makeup but I still
believe that you should be making your
way through the makeup that you have and
one of the reasons why I do shop my
stash and things like that is so that I
am circulating through and actually
getting through so I do want to
purchase some of the items that I used
up but I'm still happy that I've used
some stuff up does that like that so
anyway I will leave Michelle's Instagram
and also her channel down below as well
as her video if you would like to check
her out
tell her I say hello and yeah let's go
ahead and get right into it
so I eight different products here most
of them were makeup and I did mostly get
through the makeup items since I do wear
makeup pretty much every single day
there are a few back like back items I
guess you could say you have bath items
that I didn't completely get through yet
a but I do have tell December 1st so I
made it through five out of the eight
items let's hope that I can get through
all eight of them by December 1st
alright so the first item that I did you
stuff completely is the covergirl plus
ol a CC cream tone to rehab foundation
in the shade 1:05 ivory this is my
all-time favorite CC cream it is no
longer sold on the market but I guess
that they do have a different kind of
replacement for it a new foundation that
we
release so maybe I will have to check
that out but I started right there and
it is completely empty so I used that
baby up I also used up the two-faced
hangover RX replenishing a face primer
this is an item that I would repurchase
um the reason why I wanted to get
through this one was because this scent
started to change a little bit if you
have tried this before you know that the
scent is a little bit like coconut milky
and it just started smelling kind of
sour so I did kind of start right there
and I use this up really really quickly
and this is a beautiful beautiful primer
I highly recommend for any of those any
of those of you any of you who do have
dry skin it's beautiful also if you do
have a combo to oily skin like I do it
also works really well so I used that
one up I also did completely use up the
amazing cosmetics hydrating concealer
kind of matches my sweatshirt today I
loved this this was beautiful I had
probably about that much left I want to
say and I actually completely dumped
this out with a chopstick you know you
are a doing it like a project pan when
you are taking out with the
chopstick but anyway yes I dug in there
this was the shade ivory it was a
beautiful concealer not something that I
would repurchase I think it's definitely
more oriented towards those of you who
do have dry or more mature skin but it
was still a beautiful and I did enjoy
using it up I also did use up the Too
Faced better than sex mascara I tried
putting in a saline drops and also just
regular eye drops into this to kind of
like a revamp it but it was just
completely completely dried out so I'm
happy I got through that and this is
also an item that I would repurchase and
then I did go through the entire josie
maran be comforted whipped argan oil
ultra hydrating body butter in apple
crisp I'm not going to open it because
there is literally oil all over it
but this was a beautiful the scent was
amazing it smells exactly like tis the
season the three wood candle or the
scent from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works during the
wintertime so I love this I do think
this is more like it's definitely more
for those of you who do have mature or
very very dry skin for me with my combo
to oily skin I don't think that I would
personally repurchase this or any more
of the josie maran body butters because
I think they're a little too thick and
heavy on my skin so this is the first
time that I have made my way through a
whole entire container and I can
actually say hey you
what I don't think I should repurchase
this anymore every single year I buy her
little trio that comes out and I always
thought I loved these body butters I
love them but honestly I think they're a
little too oily for me I can't use them
on my chest area because I break out
sure as hell can't use them on my face
or my back anywhere like that I really
only use this on my feet and on my
elbows and on my knees so I think it's
good that I kind of understand that now
so that I'm not prone to buying these
when obviously they don't really work
that well for my skin type but beautiful
smelled amazing and then the last three
products that I have not completely
gotten through and honestly I haven't
made that much progress on are the Shea
Moisture raw shea butter moisture
retention shampoo the Victoria's Secret
hydrating body lotion and the Becca
backlight priming filter so we'll start
with that Becca because this has been in
I think the past two project Pam videos
I've been trying to get through this
forever
I did it get sent one of these by from
Becca and then also I purchased this one
myself so I'm taking the one that was
sent to me I really just am NOT into
this particular um in this particular
primer I don't know what it is at first
I really liked it I like the scent I
kind of like what it does for my skin
but it's something that I just don't
reach for very often and I don't really
think that it does prolong the wear of
your makeup so I've been trying to get
through this forever I am right there
and I really haven't made progress in
fact it looks like more product has gone
up like how is that possible anyway so
that is the Becca priming backlight
priming filter gonna try and use that up
I think what I will do is starting next
week for every single shot my stash
video I will use this I will only use
this so yeah going to do that and then
here is the Shea Moisture raw shea
butter moisture retention shampoo
started or right there and I just tipped
it so it looks like it's up here but I'm
at about the same place and this is
something that I do like to use in my
hair I mix it together with other
shampoos which is why is it it is taking
me so long to get through if I use it
just by itself it does weigh my hair
down so what I'm going to do with this
is probably start washing my makeup
brushes with it what do you guys think
do you think it will kind of mess up the
bristles I don't think it will if I
think if I mix it together with a little
bit of regular like baby shampoo I think
it would be good so I'm going to try and
use that up and then we have the
Victoria's Secret hydrating body lotion
the smells amazing
you know I think it's better for my skin
that something really heavy like this so
I hope to get through this maybe if I
use it in the morning and at night for
the next month I can make it through but
yeah I've started right there and I'm
pretty much in the exact same place so
anyway guys that is my update I still
have another month so I definitely let's
hope that I can get through everything
that would be very exciting and yeah I
hope you enjoyed it this video thank you
so much for joining me guys and I will
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
