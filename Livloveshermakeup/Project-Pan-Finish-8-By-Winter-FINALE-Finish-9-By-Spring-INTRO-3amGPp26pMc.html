my channel this video is going to be my
finale on my finish 8 by winter
challenge or project pan and also my
finish 9 by spring intro so I tried to
use up 8 different products in the past
3 months I'm going to share with you
guys my results I did get through six
out of the eight items and then I do
have nine new items that I'm going to
try and use by I believe in March first
so anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it
and the first item is that I did use up
it was the Too Faced hangover RX
replenishing a face primer this is what
it looks like I also did use up the
covergirl plus ol a CC cream tone rehab
foundation in the shade 1:05 ivory that
is completely empty
I did use up the better than sex mascara
from Too Faced this is what it looks
like this is a full sized and I also did
use up the amazing cosmetics hydrating a
concealer I dug this out with a
chopstick I showed you guys that last
time really really dug in there and got
everything out another item that I did
use up was the Josie Maran be comforted
whipped argan oil ultra hydrating body
butter in the scent apple crisp but this
is completely empty and the sixth and
final item that I did finish in the past
three months is the Shea Moisture raw
shea butter moisture retention shampoo
with seek help and argan oil so that is
completely empty the two items that I
did not completely finish are the
Victoria's Secret hydrating body lotion
in the coconut milk scent I started
about right there and currently I'm
right there so I really didn't do very
well with this I think what happened was
I really focused in on that body butter
and then after like my last check-in I
was saying I'm gonna use this everyday
I'm sure I can get it done at but then I
went ahead and I really got into my
Trader Joe's pumpkin body butter so I
kind of was obsessed with this and I
didn't really reach for this particular
body lotion but this is definitely going
to be moving into my finished 9 by
spring so I did not finish that up and I
also did not finish up the Becca
backlight priming filter so the first
update I was here then here and now I am
here you guys this is like the product
from hell for me I do like this primer
it's not that it's a bad primer in any
way shape or form but for my combo to
oily skin it's just not the most
appropriate primer even during the
winter time when I do get a little more
dry you do have a full fluid ounce of
product in here which is the standard
amount for
a foundation so there's a lot in here
and it is taking forever to get through
so I did finish six out of the eight
items these two items will be going into
the finish nine by Springs so those are
the first two items I will be using I do
have quite a few face primers that I
want to get through by March first so
we're gonna have the Becca backlight
priming filter also this little guy
right here this is the Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer this has been open for
probably over a year and a half in my
collection which i think is just a
little too long I do not have much left
of whatsoever I only have about that
much left so really just a tiny amount
here and I definitely think I can get
through this guy and then I also want to
go ahead and try and get through the
time bomb face primer again this has
been open for over a year and a half in
my collection it has started to separate
a little bit so I want to see if I can
get through that I am starting right
there as you guys can see the little
line so definitely more than half of the
product left in this guy and then also
more than half the products left in this
this is the wet and wild coverall primer
this has also been open up for over a
year and a half in my collection I am
starting right there another item that I
would like to completely use up that has
been open for a little too long in my
collection is the covergirl CG smoothers
hydrating makeup this does have a full
fluid ounce of product in the in it even
though it doesn't look like it does the
shade that I wear is 7:05 ivory and this
is beautiful it's just a really nice
hydrating kind of CC BB cream foundation
whatever and it's beautiful I want to
use it up I think it's a wonderful
wonderful product so I don't want it to
go bad on me so that is completely full
as of right now I do have a concealer
here that is almost completely empty I
would say four or five more uses and I
should be done with this guy and this is
the Maybelline master conceal by say
studio camouflaging concealer in the
shade and number ten fair or Clair so
that is what that is where I am starting
so really only about five more uses I
know it sounds silly to put this into a
project pan but honestly you guys if I
don't I know I'm gonna forget about it
and it's gonna go bad so this isn't open
for I believe over a year now and that's
a little long for a concealer so I'm
gonna try and use that up I don't think
that will be an issue also the Urban
Decay subversions thicker longer
stronger lash primer look how like
abused and used this packaging is it
doesn't even have like the top on it
more this is my all-time favorite lash
primer and I have had this open for over
two years now that's a very very way too
long of a time for a lash primer it
still works very well it hasn't even
dried out but I need to use it up and
just purchase a new one
so I'm about halfway done with this and
then the final item that I would like to
use up by emerge first is the Laura
Mercier extra lash sculpting in mascara
in the shade black onyx this is one of
my all-time favorite mascaras it is
beautiful I don't know if I would
repurchase it because of the Maybelline
oops
maybe Maybelline the falsies push-up
drama mascara from the drugstore is
pretty much an exact dupe for this it's
very nice and sculpting and just like
lengthening the lashes kind of like a
three in one it's like a triple threat
so I really enjoy this mascara but I
don't want it to dry up I did spend over
$30 on this so yeah I'm gonna use that
one up so those are the items the nine
items that I'm going to be trying to use
up by March right yeah December January
February yes so March 1st I will check
in with you guys and give you guys my
final thoughts I will do an update video
for you guys halfway through to let you
know how I'm doing with the products but
yeah those are my 9 new products and
that's kind of the closing of my finish
8 by winter so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
