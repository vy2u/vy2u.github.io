I am doing a review for you guys on the
new pure minerals secret crush I shadow
palette the box looks like this and then
you get the actual palette which is
beautiful it's like rose gold it's a tin
and you open it up and inside you get
eight gorgeous gorgeous eyeshadows so in
here you get let's see here three baths
you get four shimmers in the one glitter
but I have to tell you I'm so impressed
with this eye shadow palette because all
of them no matter what the consistency
is feel the same they have that really
nice gorgeous creamy texture even the
glitter one and it's just like it's
gorgeous pigmentation gorgeous texture
they all just feel buttery buttery it's
smooth I'm so so impressed I think that
pure minerals would really did good with
this palette especially because um you
also get those really nice colors that
are very in right now I am wearing this
palette today for eyeshadow I have that
kind of burgundy reddish pink color all
over my lid and then I have that in the
crease and then I have the dark matte
color on the outer V and it's just like
those are the colors that are very in
right now pinky Mavi colors and they
just did really well with this palette
so again here are the shades absolutely
gorgeous as you can see the four right
there are the shimmers to Matt's right
there one matte and then that's the
glitter um you get some nice
highlighting shades this is nice as a
transition color also if it's getting a
little muddy you can take like a really
precise brush and hit it over the crease
in case it is getting a little bubble
together because these are darker colors
it also comes with this little flat um
like brush like this and I like this for
going right underneath the brow for a
highlight but also packing on eyeshadow
it's really nice so I'm gonna keep that
brush I do like it and yeah I purchased
this for $32 on the alte website and I'm
gonna read for you guys a little bit
about what it says on the elta website
so it says um NYX the tried neutrals and
adult indulge in Lux hues that complim
and never compete with your natural
beauty this ultra chic shadow collection
gives you eight crush-worthy earth tones
and velvety satins like you've never
seen before
Houston a trendy go anywhere case secret
crush brings an undeniable element of
intrigue to your everyday look
so go ahead its want the newest objects
of your affection with refined natural
beauty from pure minerals and it says
the shades are whisper lust passion muse
infatuation admirer rendezvous and rumor
so I am a little disappointed that they
don't have the names on the actual
palette they do have them listed on the
website and it is on the back of the box
that you get it in but like I'm not
gonna keep this I'm tossing this so any
time I'm doing a tutorial or something
and I'm using this that's gonna be kind
of annoying I guess I'll just have to
point to you guys which one or I'll have
to pull it up on the website but besides
out I really think that this is a good
palette it's priced right it's only $32
you can get it at Ulta um it's got a mix
of glitter matte and shimmer shades and
they all are so pigmented so creamy and
so smooth so I'm really really happy
with this palette I will link for you
guys below where you can pick it up and
yeah that's my review I definitely give
it like a 9 out of a 10 or a 10 out of a
10 I'm really really happy with it
and yeah see you guys in my next video
