channel in this video I am answering
your questions that you asked me this is
going to be my Q&amp;amp;A part one there's
probably gonna be like three or four
parts to this throughout the next week
or two just because I got asked to over
70 questions so I want to make sure I
get to everyone and yeah I don't want
the videos to be too long so I'll
probably answer like 10 questions each
so anyway the first question I have here
I'm just gonna start right at the top
this is from Sarah George and I
apologize if I butcher anybody's
username please forgive me
she asked who are your favorite
youtubers currently my favorite
youtubers are definitely emily noel 83
here on youtube and crispy and then she
said do you have any budgeting tips
slash how do you afford your makeup
collection so I don't really have
budgeting tips I will tell you what I do
personally is when I get my paycheck I
take fifty percent of it and put it into
my savings and then I take the other
half of it and I put it into my checking
account and I try and only pull from my
checking account when it comes to makeup
and I really try and make sure that I
don't like spend anything like I don't
spend any of the money until I have
completely taken out my rent for the
month until I've done all my grocery
shopping for the month like all I kind
of stop and I try and be really
realistic so that I don't have to dig
into my savings account because
obviously I want to have my savings
account for you know big purchases like
if I need to buy a new instrument or
things like that so that's personally
what I do also I highly recommend
returning things if they don't work out
for you I'm just one of those people I'm
like yes if something doesn't work I'm
definitely going to return it so I guess
those are my budgeting tips and she said
what inspired you to start your channel
so it was actually a youtuber here
another favorite youtuber her name is
Kristen or mama loves mascara I love her
she was the one who inspired me to start
my channel the next question is from
Amber Dewar she said what is your
monthly makeup budget so my monthly
makeup budget is I try and spend only
about 300 to 400 dollars on makeup and I
know it that sounds ridiculous and crazy
and it's a really a lot of money but I
am one of those people I literally could
a thousand dollars on makeup every
single month easily no problem like the
addiction is real so yes I try and not
go over three hundred to four hundred
dollars a month all right the next
question is from Ellis for living she
said okay several questions number one
where were you born and raised I was
born and raised in Minneapolis Minnesota
she said what are your favorite foods
anything with cheese in it grilled
cheese macaroni and cheese anything with
cheese and she said will you ever visit
Arizona and yes I will and when I'm
there I will let you know so that we can
get together alright the next question
comes from kitten paws super cute
username love that she said which non
beauty related channels do you often
watch on YouTube so I often watch
classical music channels because well
I'm a classical musician and also I like
to watch Fitness channels I'm trying to
get more into like working out because I
don't work out and it's really bad and I
also try and watch like health channels
because I also just eat very poorly so
I'm trying to become a healthier person
overall so yeah I like to watch Fitness
channels health channels and also music
channels alright the next question comes
from Haleh Gabrielle Gabrielle holla hey
it says is there any other person who is
there any one person who inspired you to
start a channel and like I said yes
Kristin from mama loves mascara the next
question comes from Jules she said how
did you and your boyfriend meet how long
have you been together we met on a car
mini-com and we have been together for
over two years and then she asked you
have any siblings I do I have an older
brother who is 26 years old his name is
Alexander and then she asked Holy Grail
makeup product from high-end and
drugstore so from the drugstore I would
say my maybelline instant age rewind
dark correcting circle treatment things
in the brightener shade which is the
pink one and then from high-end I have
been just obsessed with my new - you're
glowing gardens glowing pink highlighter
it's amazing it's like the best thing
I've ever put on my face so that all
right the next questions come from Vika
Menna
and she says what do you use to get rid
of dark spots / acne spots so as far as
acne spots I use
personnel 10 and as far as like getting
rid of like discoloration because you
guys know I do have acne scarring along
my jawline from hormonal acne I really
have been into the Korres vitamin C
brightening oil that one has been doing
wonders for my skin so definitely those
two she said how do you see yourself in
the future YouTube career right now
definitely no YouTube career this is
definitely just a hobby but maybe in the
future after I'm kind of done with my
performing career the next question
comes from hello this is cam how tall
are you I am 5-2 the next one comes from
Kelly's spot ladies spotlight I think
that's right do you have any pets
currently I do not do you see a really
big difference between drugstore and
high-end skincare or do you think that
the drugstore has some good products as
well I personally do not see that big of
a difference between the two I like some
of my holy grail skincare products come
from the drugstore so yeah there is
definitely not that big of a difference
and then she also asked do you enjoy
thrift store shopping and yes once in a
while I deal alright the next question
is from Princess Peach XO how does your
boyfriend and family feel about you
having a youtube channel by this I mean
are they supportive or just or does your
family not know I tried starting a
YouTube channel and I don't have the
courage to tell my family first of all
you should definitely tell them they're
gonna find out anyway honestly when you
put yourself out there like on the
Internet people are gonna find out and
you know they'll be supportive if it's
something that you really love or a
hobby of yours they'll be supportive
they're your family you know
so um yes I would say if my family feels
really good about it I guess the only
person who's a little suspicious is
probably my dad he's just kind of like
you do what on the internet you put
makeup on on camera that's weird but
like my brother doesn't really care my
mom's very supportive she thinks it's
great and my boyfriend is super
supportive he's the one who bought me
all this wonderful lighting for my video
so yeah he is very supportive he also
bought me my camera he's he's amazing so
yes they are very supportive the next
question comes from Samantha Bannerman
she said hey Olivia what is your
favorite foundation of all time I love
watching your videos thank you so much
my favorite foundation of all time is
from the drugstore it is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte foundation
the next question comes from Christine
Kay she said what are your favorite TV
shows there are so many but currently
how to get away with murder scandal
I love grim shows like that just a bunch
of them I still love watching Grey's
Anatomy my boyfriend hates when I
watched it because he's a doctor and he
says like half the stuff that they talk
about on the show is like not even real
but I don't care I still follow it and
also Law &amp;amp; Order SVU that show just
keeps getting better and better over the
years alright the next question is from
Jenna Dotson she said hey girl I'm an
x-ray tech and I remember you saying
your boyfriend is a radiologist
that's amazing does he ever tell you any
of the crazy stuff that he sees at work
I see some pretty gnarly stuff and
sometimes I forget that too much is I
forget what is too much for regular
people to hear LOL congrats on 6,000
thank you so much and yes he does tell
me some pretty disturbing things i find
it disturbing he thinks it's really cool
because of course when he gets like a
new case that's really really different
he's like oh of course he wants to tell
me about it and honestly I just
sometimes find it too descriptive and
disgusting and gory but I still listen
to it because you know he's very excited
and that's very cute alright moving on
the next question is from jewels of
wisdom where were you born and raised
and like I said Minneapolis Minnesota
the next questions are from Tiffany dawn
she said what is your best childhood
memory my best childhood memory was
probably me winning my first flute
competition that's actually when I
realized and it kind of clicked in my
head that I wanted to be a professional
musician so definitely that was my best
childhood memory she also asked do you
think he will move back to New York it's
possible I mean you never know and then
she also asked you have any siblings
like I said my brother my older brother
Alexander who was 26 and then she said
do you want a large wedding or an
intimate wedding definitely a large
wedding I am I'm a performer I like
being up in front of a crowd so yes
definitely a large wedding the next
question is from Rochelle Sprinter she
said hey being the animal lover that I
am it do you have any pets currently I
do not do you want any yes we do or I do
my boyfriend's a little like he only had
Turtles
growing up and he made them after the
Ninja Turtles isn't that cute probably
wouldn't want me to tell you guys that
but I think it's super cute so he only
ever has like fish and reptiles whereas
I have literally like every single
animal I had a bunny I had a dog attic
cat everything so I personally want us
to get a dog and he's like a little um I
don't know he's like a little not afraid
of dogs but just because he didn't grow
up with them I think he's nervous about
getting a dog but we're probably gonna
get a dog and then she said any other
hobbies you have other than makeup
definitely just um anything a beauty
related I love skin care probably even
more than makeup honestly if I were to
work at like Sephora or something like
that I would want to work in the
skincare section not the makeup section
I love skin care so much so definitely
skin care I like hair care even though I
don't do much with my hair definitely
hobbies include collecting hair care and
also like fashion I'm really into that
as well and then as she said where do
you live I live in Milwaukee Wisconsin
and she said congratulations on 6,000
I'm so glad I found your channel last
week thank you so much alright the next
question comes from Missy a question
number one if you had to choose one
makeup product to use for the rest of
your life what would it be
definitely my L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte foundation because I feel like if
your skin looks flawless everything else
is okay and then she said number two
what's your favorite makeup brand um
from the drugstore I would have to say
probably hmm
well she just said in general in general
its two-faced but if I had to pick one
from the drugstore as well it might be
L'Oreal which kind of pains me to say
because I know that they animal tests
like crazy and I really really don't
like that but probably L'Oreal from the
drugstore and high-end would be
two-faced
alright and number three and not a
question but I just want to say I love
your bubbly personality and positivity
thank you so much alright the next
question and the last question I'm going
to do because we're already going on 11
minutes here is from Mary Ellen after 60
she said good morning Olivia how do you
envision your life in ten years
blessings and love
Ellen so I envisioned my life hopefully
in the next 10 years I want to have kids
I would like to have three kids and I
would like to be happily married I hope
to have had a really promising career in
music and be a performer and teaching
and doing all of that kind of stuff and
also um you know maybe after I'm done
with my music career maybe I will start
going hard at the YouTube game and maybe
YouTube will become my career so yeah
