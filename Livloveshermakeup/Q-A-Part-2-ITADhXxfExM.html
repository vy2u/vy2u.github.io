in this video I am continuing my Q&amp;amp;A and
we are moving on to part two of my Q&amp;amp;A I
want to say really quickly my eyes
watering today like I don't know why I
think it's because I have the windows
open I don't know why I started watering
so like if you see this eye makeup all
over that messed up and it's like
leaking that's why my eye is leaking all
right let's just get right into it I am
going to start where I left off the
other day so I left off at Mary Ellen's
question so now we are moving on to Kim
montia mantilla okay you guys again if i
butchered your usernames I so apologize
okay I love you guys I apologize she
says do you have any brothers or sisters
do you want to get married and have
children if so how many thanks well
thank you for asking a question yeah so
I do have a brother an older brother
named Alexander who is 26 I stated that
in the other Q&amp;amp;A video and do I want to
get married and have children I do and
Tom and I have talked about that and we
want to have three children alright
moving on to a Dorian esquivel esquivel
escriba I don't know how to pronounce
your last name I apologize she says I
know you played the flute what kind of
job do you have that you play for what
do you do for fun in Milwaukee so I do
have a job here and yes I have a job
alright so i am a solute instructor or a
flute teacher music teacher and I teach
classical flute two amateur musicians
and also two young children and then i
also have a private studio through my
own home and I teach soprano alto tenor
and brick some soprano alto tenor and
bass recorders as well as baroque flute
piccolo base fleet and fodder include
and then also I am a musician so I do
pick up gigs once in a while because you
can get really good easy money like a
thousand or two thousand dollars a night
just doing that kind of stuff so once in
a while if I feel like cash is a little
lower I've spent a lot of money on
makeup I will go ahead and do gigs and
in the future um I am really trying to
start my career as a solo artist so
hopefully within the next two years i
will be starting out as a flute solo
artist and i'll be signed with a flute
company but for the most part right now
i am teaching and doing gigs and
that I make a nice amount of money doing
that so it's not like I'm in an
uncomfortable position but i really
really do want to be a solo artist all
right so and then she said what do you
do for fun in Milwaukee so we have a
beautiful art museum here that I love to
go to so I like to do that personally
I'll usually go by myself tom is not
super into art I mean he kind of
understands it but he's not super into
it you know he's more like a brain sort
of guy very like technical so he likes
to just um we love to go out to eat
there's some wonderful wonderful
restaurants here in Milwaukee so for the
two of us we like to go out to eat and
then go to the movies and then for me
personally I like to visit the art
museums here so yeah all right moving on
to the question is from Charisse 1676
Charisse I think that's how you
pronounce it she said whisper challenge

on camera yes and she said your first
and current job so my first job was I
was a receptionist and a hair salon and
i love that i was like amazing i used to
like mix up the colors downstairs and
that was in high school and I also got
to like cut hair before so that was
really fun and my current job like I

flute performance and went to
conservatory so I have my bachelor of
music degree in flute performance

radiologist that's a doctor who looks at
scams so yeah and then she said plans on
getting a major haircut not anytime soon

that I rocked it every sort of hair
length but right now I'm very happy with
my long hair I like it I do need to get
a trim dis gained a little getting a
little frizz for and frizzled and
frazzled at the ends but um ya know I'm
really happy with my haircut right now
and then she said do you do any sports
in school or did i do any sports in
school so yes when I was in high school
I was a varsity cheerleader I was also a
varsity lacrosse player varsity a soccer
player
and varsity track star so yeah I did a
lot of sports I unfortunately now do not
work out what so ever but I'm trying to
get back into it and then she said ok I
think that's plenty haha love you love
you too alright moving on to Ashley see
she said I have a few question what is
your job like I said I'm a teacher who
is your favorite Disney Princess that
girl right there by the hood she's like
put on more makeup girl yes Cinderella

collect anything other than a make up
anything beauty-related jewelry I love
perfumes I love back care body care skin
care all that kind of stuff and then she
said um and what is your birthday my
birthday is august first 1992 and that
she said thanks i'm sorry if you've
answered these questions before but i'm
new to your channel though welcome to my
channel thank you for joining the next
question is from Catherine Vanderslice
she said do you have any pets and like I
saved it in the first video I do not
currently and she said after putting
down your baby I'm so sorry you know
yeah so yeah I did put down my cat Lily
about six months ago I have her ashes
right there I know some people think
that's really strange but you know what
I love that cat so yeah her ashes are on
my jewelry table I loved her so much we
don't have plans on getting another cat
but we're looking into another dog and a
lot of you are so sweet and left a lot
of wonderful comments in the first Q&amp;amp;A
video I'm talking about what breeds we
should look into so thank you so much I
really appreciate that and then the next
question is from Heidi Ania she said why
don't you have facebook um I did have
facebook when I was younger but I felt
like I just got so sucked into it it was
so time-consuming like all I did was
watch what other people were doing with
their life and I was like what am I
doing with my life so that's why I'm
just not huge with like lots and lots of
social media accounts like you guys know
I don't have like a periscope or like a
snapchat or anything like that a lot of
you are asking me to get a snapchat I
think I eventually well but for the most
part right now I'm really just happy
with my Instagram account alright the
next question is from XOXO hey Morello
hey girls
I love her she says what's your favorite
makeup brand so from the drugstore
L'Oreal from high-end to face the next
question is from Monica gordillo she
said how long have you and your
boyfriend been together we've been
together for over two years how did you
know he was the one I actually knew he
was the one on our first date and I know
it sounds so cheesy but I literally it
was like love at first sight the minute
I saw him my heart started racing I
started actually sweating profusely I
got so nervous and I was I've always
been one of those girls that's kind of
like really really cool and casual when
I go out on dates I'm never nervous I'm
never like my heart never beats fast but
when I saw him like I just felt like my
heart like dropped like I through my
body like I I don't even know it was
literally love at first sight and I was
so nervous on our first date and he was
so like calm and collected and I was
freaking the hell out all right moving
on to said can you do a makeup or can
you make a video with your boyfriend
like boyfriend does my makeup um yeah
I'm going to try and get him to do that
but you guys have to understand like I
can't push him to do something he
doesn't want to do obviously but
hopefully relatively soon he will I told
him I was like if I ever make it to like
50,000 subscribers will you and he's
like okay maybe and I like yes you will
all right moving on what is your dream
place to travel to you oh we really want
to go to Bora Bora and actually I think
we're planning a trip to borrow for a
next year for Christmas so hopefully
we'll make that trip but yes our dream
trip is to go to Bora Bora Tom and I
love to travel I hate flying on planes
there's a whole story why but I love to
travel so yeah we're plenty of going to
Bora Bora all right she said what is
your dream okay did you always know you
wanted to be a music teacher as in flute
instructor so yeah ever since a young
age I've been just so into music I
started out on violin when I was really
really young and then I switched to
flute and i just love flu-like flute is
my life i have named my flute he's like
the man of my dreams literally besides
tom
jean-pierre like I love him I've always
just been in love with music and
especially in love with the sound of a
flute not to mention it's beautiful and
shiny that is the reason I actually
picked flute when I was younger my mom
was like why do you want to play flute
and I was like well it's shiny so you
know like literally it's just such a
beautiful instrument I love the sound so
yeah I always knew that I wanted to be a
flutist I do want to be more of a
performer than a teacher and right now
are those really crucial years where you
can work to become a performer but
that's really hard literally I just
graduated college a year ago so you kind
of have to work your way up to becoming
like a you know hardcore solo artist so
hopefully within the next 20 years that
next two or three years that will happen
but for the most part I'm very happy
with teaching right now teaching is one
of those really solid jobs if you are a
musician you can get paid very very well
depending on where you are like living
and if you have your degree in music you
can get paid very very well so it's
definitely kind of a safety net but for
the most part yet they've always known I
wanted to be a flute player and a
flutist and it's just my dream job
alright moving on how do you afford to
buy so much makeup and non make up
things since you always are posting
halls so like I said I do have my degree
in music and a lot of people don't know
this but when you are a musician and you
do have your degree like an actual
bachelor's degree or master's degree in
music you actually get paid a lot
depending on where you teach so I make a
pretty darn good income for my age and
where I am in my life so that is how all
right also I saved a lot of money I'm
very good with my savings all right
moving on pixie pie lives she said if
you could only use one makeup brand hair
care brand and skincare brand which
would they be so for makeup brand it
would definitely be two-faced for hair
care brand it would probably be organics
I like the OGX brand you know what it's
like I feel like with that brand it's
either it really works for you or it
really doesn't it really works for me so
I love it and skincare brand I would
probably say neutrogena I've tried a lot
over really really good and neutrogena
products that I really adore so yes and
then she said if your youtube ever got
big enough would you stop doing your job
no I would not
doing my job like I said I love music
it's like my life so no I would not ever
quit my job but there is a certain
amount of time that you have when you
are a performer in the classical music
industry now there are definitely people
that are outside of that category that
have gone on and on and on and performed
all the way through age like 75 but for
the most part you're pretty much done by
the time you hit 30 so i hope to have a
really nice performing career all the
way through until I'm about 30 and then
i would like to settle down and have
kids and then maybe you know YouTube
would be a career then but for now no
and I would not quit my job all right
what is your favorite song at the moment
I'm favorite song at the moment huh I
don't know you know what it is i think
it's the flo rida what is it my house I
really love that song and then let's see
if you could visit any place in the
world where would it be Bora Bora
because yeah and sorry for all the
questions haha love you XOXO love you
too girly alright the next question
comes from amber to wear and she said
how old are you and how did you become a
flutist so I am 23 years old I will be
24 on august first and i became a
flutist because i just really wanted it
and i started basically preparing myself
for becoming a flutist when I was quite
young when I was in high school I had to
decide if I wanted to do pre-college and
I did end up graduating high school a
year early and moving to Manhattan to do
my basically pre-college which was
senior year so I actually started
college my senior year of high school
and then I basically did five years of
training in Manhattan so I guess I kind
of decided and became a flutist when I
moved out to manhattan and decided i
really wanted to do this and get my
degree alright the next question is from
darlene my name she says where and when
did you meet your boyfriend and if it's
possible what's his first name so his
first name is Tom and we met about two
and a half years ago and she said where
did we meet so we met when I was living
in Manhattan oh we went out for a date
and he lived in Queens at the time so we
went out for a date in Queens and yeah
it was love at first sight all right how
long have you been in milwaukee and in
the place you're living in now so like i
said i graduate
waited about a year ago from college so
Tom and I were actually doing long
distance for a year because it was very
important to me that I get my education
and that I did get a degree he did move
out here a year before me and I told him
I said no I really need my you know I
want my degree I want everything he
didn't ask me to move out he's not that
kind of guy he really just was like what
do you want to do and i said i love you
i will come to you when I'm ready and
when I'm done with school and I did so I
moved out here six months ago and we
have been in this place for six months
alright and then the last question I'm
going to answer for today is from
Brianna hi Bri she says what's your
favorite acne spot treatment it's
definitely the clean and clear personnel
10 so I hope you guys enjoyed this
