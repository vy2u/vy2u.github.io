in this video I am continuing my Q&amp;amp;A and
we are moving on to part two of my Q&amp;amp;A I
want to say really quickly my eyes
watering today like I don't know why I
think it's because I have the windows
open I don't know my eyes started
watering so like if you see this eye
makeup Ballmer that messed up and it's
like leaking that's wrong my I am
leaking alright let's let's get right
into it I am going to start where I left
off the other day so I left off at Mary
Ellen's question so now we are moving on
to Kim Montillo Montillo okay you guys
again if I butchered your usernames I so
apologize okay I love you guys I
apologize she says do you have any
brothers or sisters do you want to get
married and have children if so how many
thanks well thank you for asking a
question yeah so I do have a brother an
older brother named Alexander who is 26
I stated that in the other Q&amp;amp;A video and
do I want to get married and have
children I do and Tom and I have talked
about that and we want to have three
children alright moving on to a Dorian
Esquivel Esquivel Escrima I don't know
how to pronounce your last name I
apologize she says I know you played the
flute what kind of job do you have that
you play for what do you do for fun in
Milwaukee so I do have a job here and
yes so I am a flute instructor or a
flute teacher and music teacher and I
teach classical flute to two amateur
musicians and also to young children and
then I also have a private studio
through my own home and I teach soprano
alto tenor and Brickman soprano alto
tenor and bass recorders as well as
baroque flute piccolo bass flute and
fodder in flute and then also I am a
musician so I to pickup gigs once in
awhile because you can get really good
easy money like a thousand or two
thousand dollars a night just doing that
kind of stuff so once in a while if I
feel like cash is a little low or I've
spent a lot of money on makeup I will go
ahead and do gigs and in the future I am
really trying to start my career as a
solo artist so hopefully within the next
two years I will be starting out as a
flute solo artist and I'll be signed
with a flute company but for the most
part right now I am teaching and doing
gigs and
that I make a nice amount of money doing
that so it's not like I'm in an
uncomfortable position but I really
really do want to be a solo artist
all right so and then she said what do
you do for fun in Milwaukee so we have a
beautiful Art Museum here that I love to
go to so I'd like to do that personally
I'll usually go by myself tom is not
super into art I mean he kind of
understands it but he's not super into
it you know he's more like a brain sort
of guy who's very like technical so he
likes to just um we love to go out to
eat there's some wonderful wonderful
restaurants here in Milwaukee so for the
two of us we like to go out to eat and
then go to the movies and then for me
personally I like to visit the art
museums here so yes all right moving on
to the question is from Charisse 1676
Charisse I think that's how you
pronounce it she said whisper challenge
with your boyfriend yes if I can get him
on camera yes and she said your first
and current job so my first job was I
was a receptionist at a hair salon and I
loved that I was like amazing I used to
like mix up the colors downstairs and
that was in high school and I also got
to like cut hair before so that was
really fun and my current job and like I
said I am a music teacher at a music
institution or a music school I'm a
flute teacher all right and then she
said did you go to college I did and she
said it's so what for so I went to
college for flute performance and went
to conservatory so I have my Bachelor of
Music degree in flute performance all
right the next thing she asked is what
does your boyfriend do for work he is a
radiologist that's a doctor who looks at
scans so yes and then she said plans on
getting a major haircut not anytime soon
I have rocked every sort of well I hope
that I've rocked it every sort of hair
length but right now I'm very happy with
my long hair I like it I do need to get
it trimmed that's getting a little
getting a little frizz free frizzled and
draggled at the ends but um ya know I'm
really happy with my haircut right now
and then she said do you do any sports
in school or did I do any sports in
school so yes when I was in high school
I was a varsity cheerleader I was also a
varsity lacrosse player varsity a soccer
player and varsity truck star so yeah I
did
sports I unfortunately now do not work
out whatsoever but I'm trying to get
back into it and then she said okay I
think that's plenty haha love you of
love you too
all right moving on to Ashleigh see she
said I have a few question what is your
job like I said I'm a sweet teacher who
is your favorite Disney Princess that
girl right there unless she's like put
on more makeup girl yes Cinderella is my
favorite and then she said do you
collect anything other than a make up
anything beauty related jewelry I love
perfumes I love back hair body care skin
care all that kind of stuff
and then she said and what is your
birthday my birthday is August 1st in
1992 and then she said thanks I'm sorry
if you've answered these questions
before but I'm new to your channel
though welcome to my channel thank you
for joining the next question is from
Catherine Vanderslice she said do you
have any pets and like I saved it in the
first video I do not currently and she
said after putting down your baby I'm so
sorry
you know yeah so yeah I did put down at
my cat Lily about 6 months ago I have
her ashes right there I know some people
think that's really strange but you know
what I love that cat so yeah her ashes
are on my jewelry table I loved her so
much we don't have plans on getting
another cat but we're looking into
another dog and a lot of you are so
sweet and left a lot of wonderful
comments in the first Q&amp;amp;A video I'm
talking about what breeds we should look
into so thank you so much I really
appreciate that
and then the next question is from Heidi
Ania she said why don't you have
facebook I did have facebook when I was
younger but I felt like I just got so
sucked into it it was so time consuming
like all I did was watch what other
people were doing with their life and I
was like what am i doing with my life so
that's why I'm just not huge with like
lots and lots of social media accounts
like you guys know I don't have like a
periscope or like a snapchat or anything
like that a lot of you are asking me to
get a snapchat I think I eventually will
but for the most part right now I'm
really just happy with my Instagram
account alright the next question is
from xoxo hate email hey girls
I love her she says what's your favorite
makeup brand so from the drugstore
L'Oreal from high-end to face the next
question is from Monika Gordillo she
said how long have you and your
boyfriend been together we've been
together for over two years how did you
know he was the one I actually knew he
was the one on our first date and I know
it sounds so cheesy but I literally it
was like love at first sight the minute
I saw him my heart started racing I
started actually sweating profusely I
got so nervous and I was I've always
been one of those girls that's kind of
like really really cool and casual when
I go out on dates I'm never nervous I'm
never like my heart never beats fast but
when I saw him it like I just felt like
my heart like dropped like I threw my
body like I I don't even know it was
literally love at first sight and I was
so nervous on our first date and he was
so like calm and collected and I was
freaking the hell out all right moving
on she said can you do a makeup or can
you make a video with your boyfriend
like boyfriend does my makeup yeah I'm
going to try and get him to do that but
you guys have to understand like I can't
push him to do something he doesn't want
to do obviously but hopefully relatively
soon he will I told him I was like if I
ever make it like 50,000 subscribers
will you and he's like oh okay maybe and
I'm like yes you well alright moving on
what is your dream place to travel to oh
we really want to go to Bora Bora and
actually I think we're planning a trip
to Bora Bora next year for Christmas so
hopefully we'll make that trip but yes
our dream trip is to go to Bora Bora Tom
and I love to travel I hate flying on
planes there's a whole story why but I
love to travel so yeah we're plenty of
going to Bora Bora
alright she said what is your dream okay
did you always know you wanted to be a
music teacher as in a flute instructor
so yeah ever since a young age I've been
just so into music I started out on
violin when I was really really young
and then I switched to flute and I just
love flute like flute is my life I have
named my flute he's like the man of my
dreams literally besides Tom well his
name is John Pierre like I love
I've always just been in love with music
and especially in love with the sound of
a flute not to mention it's beautiful
and shiny that is the reason I actually
picked flute when I was younger I'm
almost like why do you want to play
flute and everything Miami so you know
like literally it's just such a
beautiful instrument I love the sound so
yeah I always knew that I wanted to be a
flutist I do want to be more of a
performer than a teacher and right now
are those really crucial years where you
can work to become a performer but
that's really hard literally I've just
graduated college a year ago so you kind
of have to work your way up to becoming
like a you know hardcore solo artist so
hopefully within the next two readers
that next two or three years that will
happen but for the most part I'm very
happy with teaching right now teaching
is one of those really solid jobs if you
are a musician you can get paid very
very well depending on where you are
like living and if you have your degree
in music you can get paid very very well
so it's definitely kind of a safety net
but for the most part yes they've always
known I wanted to be a flute player and
a flutist and it's just my dream job all
right moving on how do you afford to buy
so much makeup and non makeup things
since you always are posting halls so
like I said I do have my degree in music
and a lot of people don't know this but
when you are a musician and you do have
your degree like an actual bachelor's
degree or master's degree in music you
actually get paid a lot depending on
where you teach so I make a pretty darn
good income for my age and where I am in
my life so that is how all right oh I've
saved a lot of money I'm very good with
my savings all right moving on pixie
pile if she said if you could only use
one makeup brand haircare brand and
skincare brand which would they be so
for makeup brand it would definitely be
to face for haircare brand it would
probably be organics I like the OGX
brand you know what it's like I feel
like with that brand it's either it
really works for you or it really
doesn't it really works for me so I love
it and skincare brand I would probably
say Neutrogena I've tried a lot over
really really good and Neutrogena
products that I really adore so yes and
then she said if your YouTube ever got
big enough would you stop doing their
job no I would not stop doing my job
like I said I love music it's like my
life so no I would not ever quit my job
but there is a certain amount of time
that you have when you are a performer
in the classical music industry now
there are definitely people that are
outside of that category that have gone
on and on and on and performed all the
way through age like 75 but for the most
part you're pretty much done by the time
you hit 30 so I hope to have a really
nice performing career all the way
through until I'm about 30 and then I
would like to settle down and have kids
and then maybe you know YouTube would be
a career then but for now no and I would
not quit my job
all right what is your favorite song at
the moment I'm favorite song at the
moment no you know what it is I think
it's the Flo Rida what is it my house I
really love that song and then let's see
if you could visit any place in the
world where would it be Bora Bora
because yeah and sorry for all the
questions haha love you xoxo love you
too girly
alright the next question comes from
amber to you Erin she said how old are
you and how did you become a flutist so
I am 23 years old I will be 24 on August
1st and I became a flutist because I
just really wanted it and I started
basically preparing myself for becoming
a flutist when I was quite young when I
was in high school I had to decide if I
wanted to do pre-college and I did end
up graduating high school a year early
and moving to Manhattan to do of my
basically pre-college which was senior
year so I actually started college my
senior year of high school and then I
basically did 5 years of training in
Manhattan so I guess I kind of decided
and became a flutist when I moved out to
Manhattan and decided I really wanted to
do this and get my degree alright the
next question is from darlene hyundai
and she says where and when did you meet
your boyfriend and if it's possible
what's his first name so his first name
is Tom and we met about two and a half
years ago and she said where did we meet
so we met when I was living in Manhattan
of we went out for a date and he lived
in Queens at the time so we went out for
a date in Queens and yeah it was love at
first sight all right how long have you
been in Milwaukee and in the place
you're living in now so like I said I
graduated about a year ago from college
so Tom and I were actually doing
long-distance for a year
it was very important to me that I get
my education and that I did get a degree
he did move out here a year before me
and I told him I said no I really need
my you know I want my degree I want
everything he didn't ask me to move out
he's not that kind of guy he really just
was like what do you want to do and I
said I love you I will come to you when
I'm ready and when I'm done with school
and I did so I moved out here six months
ago and we have been in this place for
six months all right and then the last
question I'm going to answer for today
is from Brianna hi she says what's your
favorite acne spot treatment it's
definitely the clean and clear personnel
ten so I hope you guys enjoyed this
second installment in my Q&amp;amp;A I will be
back with part 3 probably in the next
couple of days or week and yeah I will
see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
