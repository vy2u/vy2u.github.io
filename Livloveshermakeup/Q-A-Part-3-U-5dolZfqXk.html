this video I'm doing part 3 of my Q&amp;amp;A so
I'm just like basically going from where
I left off last time I was like who is
that naked woman on my screen this is it
a little commercial that up
before the video but the last person
that I answered questions from was
brianna so I'm moving on to alessandra
her first question is did you ever
suffer from bad acne as a teenager I did
I suffered for a really bad hormonal
acne along my jawline sorry if my lips
are chapped by the way I've been doing a
lot of practicing this week anyway I had
um hormonal acne along my jawline down
my neck my chest everywhere and I still
get that during at that time of the
month all right she said when did you
start doing makeup when I was in eighth
grade like I started cake in that face
if you think I wear a lot of foundation
now you should have seen me in eighth
grade she said how come you don't edit
your videos I don't want to you and I
just don't have time to and she said if
you were to have one wish come true what
would it be definitely just to be a
professional music I mean I'm already a
professional musician but to be like a
big like in the spotlight sort of solo
artists yes that was my biggest biggest
wish that would come true that make
sense that's what I want alright moving
on biggest fear definitely flying um I
was actually almost in sort of like a
plane crash I could make a whole video
on it if you guys want me to I was like
debating doing a story time video on it
but I really don't like story time
videos and on top of that I feel like
those are supposed to be funny but yes I
had a very very scary experience um
about four years ago on a plane where
our plane basically got hit by lightning
and we were just we were just plummeting
so yeah that was very very serious and I
am really really scared to fly on planes
but I love to travel so I still do it
luckily I'm dating a doctor now so he
can give me medication before I get on
the point all right she said if you had
the chance to change your career would
you and what would you do no I would not
change it um but if I were to change it
even though I don't want to i guess i
would go ahead and choose something else
in the performing arts like maybe acting
or something like that alright moving on
she said if you okay do you have oh do
you plan on being a musician for the
rest of your life absolutely I feel like
once you're a musician you're always
musician although you know if you really
want to do like solo artist stuff you
only have probably till like your 30s or
40s well some people are different
obviously like yo-yo MA and all those
people but for the most part ii do that
and then you liked each after but i feel
like you're always a musician once you
start playing an instrument she said any
foundations that break you out i'm
actually going to be doing a whole video
on this topic foundations that break me
out so I can talk a little more about
how certain ones break me out of what i
do to come back to the breakouts with
the foundation and then she said let's
see here do you like getting fake nails
/ long nails why or why not no
definitely not it was actually frowned
upon when I was in conservatory you
weren't really allowed to paint your
nails would do anything like that it
takes away from the planing plane and it
also distracts people and their heavy so
you can't move your fingers as fast so
yeah no I like my short little stubby
gross nails and then she said favorite
songs tons of classical music pieces but
for the most part right now probably I
said this last time to flo rida what's
his song my house I love that song right
now like I don't know what the deal is
she said sorry so many questions XOXO
love your channel thank you for the
questions the next question is from the
SAT she said hi Olivia how was your
experience living in New York and would
you ever move back my experience living
in New York was fantastic I lived by
myself and again i did move my senior
year of high school so it was really
kind of culture shock moving at such a
young age and living there for five
years but i grew up so much as a person
and it was just it was a fantastic
experience and would i ever moved back
absolutely she said what are your
favorite books TV shows or movies past
or present right now i am reading the
mitford series which i love absolutely
love that series and then she end this
by jan karon by the way and let's see
here TV shows movies oh my god anything
on like ABC Grey's Anatomy how to get
away with murder scandal everything like
that and as far as movies go I'm more of
a TV girls so not really any favorite
movies right now she said if you could
have one superpower that would help you
and others what would it be and why I
guess flying because I could help all
the people that don't like to get on
planes like me and I could put them on
my back and fly them to their dust
nation alright what places have you
traveled and would you love to return I
traveled to a lot of places I've been
lucky enough to travel a lot to Europe
and just places like that so yes I've
done a lot of traveling and I guess my
next trip would have to be Bora Bora
that is what Tom and I plan on doing for
the holiday season coming up so we're
really really excited for that and then
she said this will be some so much fun
to hear your responses XOXOXO love you
girlie alright moving on to make up with
nessa what made you start a YouTube
channel so mama loves mascara or Kristen
maybe I mean she didn't make me but like
she inspired me to start a channel i
will leave her um channel in the
description bar not up down i'll leave
her channel in the description bar i
love her how long have you been with
your boyfriend and how did you meet like
i said i'm in my past video we met on
eharmony and we have been together for
over two and a half years what advice
would you give to someone who wants to
start their own youtube channel so i
just did a whole video on this the other
night but i talked about just posting
relevant content being yourself and not
getting to like you know into the whole
like editing and doing all this kind of
stuff just be yourself have fun and make
the videos you want to make alright the
next question is from sarah she said
would you consider not posting as
regularly and spend the extra time
editing your videos no I would not I'm
just not interested in editing and on
top of that I think that my subscribers
prefer me putting out videos every day
instead of just having one video a week
and she said did you consider staying in
New York after school I absolutely did
but of course they wanted to be with my
boyfriend so I moved out here and then
she said what did you do what you do for
work now in Milwaukee so I'm a teacher a
music teacher and I also do like you
know gigs and things like that I'll all
the whole like a musician stuff but yes
I teach at a music school here alright
the next question is from a leaf I
believe what is your most favorite item
who have oh ok I don't think she meant
to type it like that was your best item
that you have ever purchased probably my
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation
I love that stuff you guys always think
that in my top five series when I do my
foundations the next question is from
take a 23 you should make a spring
makeup video I absolutely will the next
from Haley she said how do you afford
all the beauty products you buy so I
talked about this a little bit but I try
and just you know only use money that's
in my like checking account rather than
my savings account but I guess like I
mean I'm just gonna be real with you
guys I make a nice decent amount of
money so I guess that's how I can afford
my makeup um let's see moving on kara
she said what states have you lived in
flash visited and how long I've been to
a lot of states but for the most part I
have lived in Minneapolis which is where
I grew up I have lived in Manhattan and
then now I'm living in Milwaukee and she
said have you ever done or thought about
pageantry no I have never done that but
um the thought has crossed my mind I
always thought oh well I could do that
and do my own makeup and then maybe play
flute for like the talent portion I
don't know and then she said how often
do you do at home facials so I basically
mask every other day or even every day
depending on the mass so that's what i
consider it at home facial alright so
the next question is from nirali she
said hi my question is as a musician
what is the best experience you have
ever had and what are some of these
struggles you have had or have okay
thank you so thank you i'm afraid i'm
asking a question so as a musician i
guess the biggest thing that i have done
it that has been like one of the best
experiences was performing my first time
at carnegie hall now I perform their
multiple multiple times like 10 plus
time even 15 plus but definitely um I
perform there for the first time when I
was a senior in high school and that was
such a big experience and what are some
of the struggles just um having like a
nice steady paid job is really difficult
as a musician again I did go to
conservatory so it's a little easier
when you do have your degree in music
but I guess it's just you know you put
so much work in in the arts and you
never get paid I mean I'm getting paid a
really nice decent amount right now but
you never get paid what you should get
paid because like musicians and things
like that we spend hours upon hours
practicing doing all this kind of stuff
and I just feel like the biggest
struggle is just getting yourself out
there and also the fact that we never
really get paid super super well
for all the work that we do all right
and then the last question I'm going to
answer today is from cassia she said
okay my questions are what is your dream
job or what would it be it is what I'm
doing right now being a musician and
what made you start a YouTube channel in
which youtuber do you watch the most so
what we may start a YouTube channel was
like I said in mama loves mascara her
link will be in the description bar I
love her she's just so sweet i've been
watching her for like two years now and
she inspired me to start a channel and
which youtuber do you watch the most so
currently right now probably I would
have to say my friend Tiffany I'm gonna
link her channel down below to I don't
know why I keep doing this I need to
learn how to throw it up in the cards
for you guys but yes probably tiffany
tiffany john i love her i watch every
single one of her videos and right now
she is my favorite youtuber so i'll link
her down below and then she said also i
know you play music or do you have plans
to join a band and do tours so I'm
classical musician so no no band but as
far as like touring goes if I become a
solo artist and sign with a flu company
than yes I will be touring and putting
on professional performances oh she said
is it more of a hobby no definitely not
a hobby this is a hobby youtube and then
she said did you live all of your life
here or have you lived in other states
or countries so like I said I grew up in
Minneapolis Minnesota I went to school
in Manhattan and then now I live in
Wisconsin alright guys those are the
questions I'm going to answer for today
don't want this video to be too long I
will do my Q&amp;amp;A part 4 soon I don't know
when it will pop up it will pop up and
like the next week or two so I hope you
