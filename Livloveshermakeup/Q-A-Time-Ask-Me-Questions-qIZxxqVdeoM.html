wanted to come on here really quickly
and do kind of a different sort of video
I lately have seen a few of my gift to
friends on here and also just bigger
youtubers like Sarah Rihanna and also on
Katya I've seen them do these kind of
question and answer videos that seemed
really really cool so basically I make a
video and I say hey guys and I ask you
that you would like to ask me any sort
of questions so exactly a week from
today next friday i will come on and i
will answer any of the questions that
you guys have left in the comments
section so i encourage you if you would
like to of course you don't have to but
if you do have a question you would like
to ask me about my life what I do my
boyfriend my work anything like that
beauty related questions I would love
for you to go ahead and ask them in the
comments section below and I will come
back in exactly a week and I will do a
Q&amp;amp;A video and I will answer your guys's
questions about anything you're curious
about so that is what I plan on doing go
ahead and leave a question below if you
would like to like i said and i do want
to say i did do a Q&amp;amp;A video like in the
summertime and i didn't just leaving
that video so you guys can react any
sort of questions in that video i think
i addressed like what my boyfriend does
what I do where I graduated from did I
go to college like all that kind of
stuff you guys can re ask those
questions because I did delete that
video it was literally in the basement
of my family's cabin and it was 5 45 in
the morning nobody was awake so I was
kind of whispering and on top of that it
was kind of when I had first like gotten
into YouTube and honestly I was still a
kind of camera shy so I felt like I
wasn't completely myself and I didn't
give like my exact like answers like I
gave a little bit but not like the full
extent so if you guys have asked a
question before and I have answered it
in that particular video if you've been
with me for that long you can react it
and I will go ahead and go more into
deck this time so anyway that's what
this little video is basically just an
announcement that I would love for you
to go ahead and leave me a question down
below if you would like and I will come
back in a week and i will answer and i
will have a cuban
so thanks so much for joining you guys
and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
