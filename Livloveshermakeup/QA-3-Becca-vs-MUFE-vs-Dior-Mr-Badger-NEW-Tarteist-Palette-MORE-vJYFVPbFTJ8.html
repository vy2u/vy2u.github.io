welcome back to another weekly Q&amp;amp;A I
still haven't decided if these are gonna
be weekly or every other week but as of
right now they are weekly as you can see
from the title of the video we are also
answering personal questions today
anytime there are more than six personal
questions I will just call it a Q&amp;amp;A
instead of a beauty Q&amp;amp;A so anyway I
pulled ten questions from Instagram
snapchat and also YouTube but so let's
go ahead and get started
the first questions are from autumn 7 on
Instagram she asked how do you get rid
of hardpan
how many dates did you go on before
finding Tom and how did you decide on
online dating so first question how do
you get rid of hardpan if it's a really
like mild case of hard panic it sounds
like I'm a doctor if it's a very mild
case of hardpan I use duct tape and I
will take just a little pizza bitch I
will press it down on to the area where
it has hardpan I will leave it on for
about a minute or two and then I like to
peel it off if it's a really bad case a
hard pan unfortunately you do need to go
in with like a knife or a spatula and
kind of scrape off that layer which is
really hard because sometimes you know
there will be dips and crevices in the
makeup after you do that but you can put
it back together with a little bit of
alcohol if you want like a smooth
surface but I do find that anytime I put
back together an item with alcohol it
never really turns out the same the
finish is different or just the
consistency it feels a little more rough
to the touch so I would recommend trying
a duct tape but if you can't get rid of
it then you might need to slice off a
little bit at least those are the ways
that I like to do hard piano I'm pretty
sure there are probably other ways so if
you know of any other ways let us know
down below I will be doing a video soon
on hard pan it's still on my list I'm
sorry guys there have just been so many
video ideas that I want to get through
so I haven't gotten to that one yet but
I will be doing a video soon alright the
second question was how many dates did
you go on before finding tom tom was the
first guy on he are a harmony that I
went ahead and went on a date with so if
you didn't know Tom and I met on
eHarmony and he went on lots of dates
before me because you know he's a cute
guy but I really just met him like a
week and a half after being on the
online website so for me personally he
was the first guy that I met on there
and I feel like I should be in the
infomercial you know like the little
commercial for a harmony where they're
like oh we found true love I literally
could just be like here's Tom the love
of my life and he was the first guy I
found to any harm
so yeah he was the first one so only one
date and then how did you decide on
online dating so I decided on online
dating because I was really sick of
dating other artists it's gonna sound
bad but I feel like when you date people
that are in the same field as you
sometimes that can get a little
repetitive and I was getting very bored
with the guys that I was dating
throughout college and things like that
so I will say I just wanted to date
someone someone completely different and
tom is completely different from me he
the doctor he's very tight Bay I'm very
like artistic and like whoohoo and he's
just very different so it was a lot of
fun to a and yes that's kind of how I
decided I was just sick of dating the
same sort of people all right number two
if the question is from Sonja Alan man
or madman
I don't know this is on Instagram and
she said I'd love to know more about how
you became a musician and the kinds of
gigs that you do also how do you balance
a forty and makeup habit on an artist
salary so I guess I'll start with that
last part first I got really really
lucky honestly so I don't really have an
artist salary because the limo just put
it out there the reason why I don't is
because I actually am teaching two
different things at the school that I
teach at I don't teach at like a public
school or anything like that I teach at
a conservatory for music where people
pay to have their kids go there it's a
private institution if that makes sense
so I don't teach academic classes they
only teach music so that's the first
thing private conservatories tend to be
a little more in cost when you actually
send your children there and that means
more pay for me and then second of all I
don't just teach flute I teach fleet and
also my secondary instrument which is
recorders so I actually get double the
salary which is how I afford it buying
makeup and things like that because I
have basically a double salary going on
and as far as getting into music I got
into music because my mom was a stage
mom and I feel like I can say that with
no problem she does she's really proud
of the fact that she was the stage mom
because I did get so far with music and
things like that but she pushed me into
music she did she pushed she pushed me
into music when I was about four or five
years old on violin I hated violin but I
loved music so when I was 12 years old I
switched over to flute and she got very
lucky that I loved flute as much as she
loved viola so basically I got my
Bachelor of Music degree my mom also got
her
music degree in the arts actually in
viola performance and then she went on
to become a professional ballerina which
is crazy so she's very very hard to keep
up with she's very multifaceted and also
just very um talented in a lot of
different fields so growing up I felt
like I needed to impress her and because
she was such a stage mom I constantly
felt like I had to be doing violin and
finally I was like I don't want to do
violin anymore I said I do love music
though you're lucky I do love music so
yeah I ended up doing flute and that's
kind of how I got started was because I
had a stage mom and as far as the kind
of gigs that idea will right now because
my salary is so fantastic at the
conservatory that I'm teaching at I
don't actually feel the need to do as
many gigs but I did tons and tons of
gigs off of Broadway and stuff like that
when I was in New York just you can do
weddings you can do whatever you want to
get hired for and a lot of the time a
lot of the times gigs are like under the
table kind of money's that was easy to
get like cash from one night of just
doing like some sort of a gig so they
pay really well and they're great but I
don't feel the need to do as many
anymore but I definitely do weddings
I'll do private events things like that
and yeah alright so the next question is
from Nikki this was on snapchat and she
asked what are your favorite makeup
remover wipes they are definitely the
Sephora rose cleansing wipes these are
beautiful these are ultra moisturizing
and brightening and I just absolutely
adore these I did try out all of the
different flavors or scents from these
Sephora cleansing wipe line and these
are the ones I fell in love with I also
really like the UC ones but these ones
are fantastic alright question number
four is from a meg and this was on
snapchat
what dark fall lipstick or stain can I
still practice my flute with everyday
this is a really hard question because
we're talking about dark and vampy lips
here I did find about three different
products that I would recommend I do not
know what kind of flute you play on if
you plan a silver platinum gold-plated
head joint I'm not quite sure but no
matter what you are going to get a
little bit of transfer onto your head
joints
my favorite thing to wear is just like
bombs that's why I'm really into
comfortable lip products is because I
like bombs tinted lip balms they're very
easy to practice with but I do have
three fall vampy lips here to share with
you that do work and don't transfer as
much so the first one is from Oprah this
is a long-lasting liquid
take this is one of the only liquid
lipstick formulations that I personally
really really enjoy the shade right here
is called hypno this was from the nanny
and you a collaboration it's a nice dark
kind of vampy fall lipstick color here
we have the shade 2 2 from colour-pop I
do find that these particular ones this
one is a matte I do find that these stay
on quite nicely so here is the shade a 2
2 and actually let me go ahead and
swatch that hypno shade for you so you
can see I do find if you are wearing
more of the math Olympia they tend to
stay on a little better when you're
practicing but this one goes on kind of
glossy it does have a little more of a
whipped consistency and then it does dry
down mass so there is two two there is
hypno and then as far as glosses are
concerned tart makes them really nice
like Noir and energy Noir glosses this
particular one is one that you put it on
and then it actually adheres to like the
pH in your skin so it's not going to
completely change color yet but it does
darken up to a nice berry hue so I would
recommend those three as far as
formulation is concerned I really wish I
had more to show you but I don't I find
that no matter what I do get some kind
of transfer on to my flute adjoint
unfortunately and I do play on a
14-carat fold head joint or sorry 19.5
karat gold I have two different eyes all
right Boyan alright the next question is
from Laurie par Lenski on youtube and
she said which do you prefer the new
makeup forever highlight or the Becca
rose quartz so this is a really good
question so the new makeup forever
highlight is in the shade of golden pink
this is what it looks like if you are
curious it's a very very beautiful nice
base gel a short a formulation sorry I
like weird stuff on the side of my lips
anyway it is a beautiful big delay sort
of formulation and a lot of you are
asking which I prefer over this one or
the rose quartz so here is Becca's rose
quartz here is the makeup forever
I do prefer the makeup forever you guys
know I'm a sucker an absolute sucker for
baked Chalet formulations so I'm gonna
say this and then I also got a few
questions asking how this compares to
the you're glowing gardens highlight so
what I'm gonna do is swatch four of them
on my arm right now the first one will
be the Becca rose quartz so here is
Becca's rose quartz right there next
we're gonna swatch the do are glowing
gardens and this one definitely has more
of a white base alright so there is the
Dior glowing gardens next we will swatch
the makeup forever the new one be golden
pink which is right there very very
similar to be Torico glowing gardens you
guys seriously there are the two of them
there's Dior and then here is the makeup
forever if you are looking for something
very close I would recommend that one
and finally I thought I would also
swatch these you a rose quartz
highlighter just for the hell of it so
here are all for them if you are curious
we have the Becca rose quartz up here
and then this one right here is the Dior
glowing gardens and then we have makeup
forever and then we have G way so all a
pretty darn similar I would say G way
and Becca rose quartz are the most
similar and then these two in the middle
aren't the most similar so if you are
looking for something that was similar
to the limited edition glowing Gardens
highlight from Dior I would say this new
makeup for everyone is very very similar
not only in formulation because it is a
big shell a formulation but also in
color so no I would not say it is very
similar to the back of rose quartz and I
would still prefer this one over this
because this is a powder this is the
facial a and I do like that this has
more of a boy's face in it alright
moving on the next question is from
Darlene and this is on Instagram and
this is all about mr. badger and I have
not introduced mr. badger on my channel
yet but mr. badger is my beloved ferrets
that I got about three weeks ago so she
asks will you do a video on mr. badger
absolutely I plan on doing an
introduction video on him and then also
a Q&amp;amp;A on ferrets in general she asked
why is he so blind and what is the
average lifespan of a ferret so the
reason why he's still blind is just
because all ferrets are ferrets are
actually very it's either nearsighted or
farsighted I can't remember but they
have very very bad eyesight but they
have impeccable really really good
hearing so all ferrets are like that
it's very funny because I'll show videos
on Instagram of him trying to chase
things and if it doesn't have a bell on
it he can't see it like literally he is
blind at the back but what is the
average lifespan if you do pick one up
from a shelter or if you pick one up
from Petco like I did then the average
lifespan is about 7 to 8 years in the
wilds the black-footed ferrets they can
live up to 20 years but always animals
tend to live longer in the wild all
right how excuse me how often do they
need baths so if you guys didn't know
ferrets are in the same kind
category a skunk so they do have a
little bit of a musky odor to them I
personally bathe mr. badger about every
two weeks I just gave him his first bath
about a week ago and he's already
starting to stink up just a little bit
it's not like a crazy crazy overwhelming
scent as long as they are dissented and
also neutered and they've had their anal
glands like removed I guess you could
say they definitely don't stink as much
but I would say every two and a half
weeks now the thing that you need to
know is that you really shouldn't do it
every two and a half weeks I'm very
picky because I'm always holding him and
smelling him and I want to cuddle with
him so I don't want him to stink but it
is better to the less you fade them the
better basically because when you are
bathing them you are removing the oils
that are on their body and that does
actually cause them to produce more
which will make you stink even more or
will make them stick even more so it's
kind of like washing your face too often
you'll produce even more oils that's
basically what happens let's see here
where did you buy him I bought him at
Petco I did not want to buy him I don't
like shopping for animals I really like
adopting but we did stop at the he means
I'm sorry my hair started me crazy today
we did stop at the Humane Society and
they did not have any ferret available
so I did buy him
um can they have companion pets they
kind of have companion pets as long as
it is a dog or a cat ferrets do get
along very well with dogs and cats but
they do not get along with rodents
spirits are not rodents they are
actually in the same obligate carnivore
family as cats dogs bears otters and
skunks so they cannot be around rodents
because they will kill rodents they are
actually used for hunting rabbits to
hunting hamsters and not hamsters
they're used for hunting rabbits and
other small rodents like actually
outside like people will take their
ferrets out and hunt down rabbits so
they can not be with any animals like
that no chinchillas anything like that
but besides that dogs and cats they can
be around with I would be very careful
if you do have a bird though I'm a
meeting time I have absolutely no idea
and how many do they carry I don't know
but I know that they can carry up to six
litters a year which is ridiculous
alright moving on it the next question
is from Kristen go on and this was on
YouTube they said there's a new tart Pro
palette coming out what are your opinion
so the new tart odd tortoise like paint
palette or something like it's not the
paint palette it's something else it
released today so it looked really
really
cool and a first I was like uh oh I
don't know you guys because you know
that I don't like these China babe
palettes now I found out that this is
made in the USA it does have some of the
turn pink eye shadows and then someone
like they're regular formulation I don't
know if they'll be similar to like the
tartlet in bloom or the tartlet palettes
I have no idea this is going to be a
permanent item and usually when it does
have the TARDIS name usually they are
made in the u.s. there have been a few
items that have been made in China from
the Turkish line but for the most part
they're usually made here in the US so
this one is made in the US I was gonna
jump on it after I found out it was made
in the US but then I saw different
photos on Instagram so the one on tour
calm cosmetics makes it look very warm
toned and then the one like that I saw
people just taking photos of it it
looked very cool toned and I felt like I
already had those colors so I'm going to
skip on that I wanted to answer that
question because I knew people would ask
and then second of all what else did I
want to say they are releasing like a
highlighting and contouring palette
which I will be picking up though that
looks very interesting to me alright
moving on the next question is from
Carrie is happy on Instagram and it says
would you like to know I would like to
know more about your morning skincare
routine so basically I change up my
morning skincare routine weekly but let
me tell you the stuff that I do so I
usually use a scrub in the morning and
then I'd like to go in with a toner and
then I go in with an emulsion and then I
go in with an essence and then my serum
and then my moisturizer and then I go in
with my eye cream and then a facial
setting spray I basically do the Asian
skin care thing where I do seven or
eight steps in the morning I will go
ahead and record like a video of me
doing the seven step process but I do
change it weekly so I can't go like too
in-depth about that number nine is from
Sarah Kay squared and this was on
Instagram they asked have you tried to
yours nude Erin Luminizer and how does
it compare to Becca's moonstone so I
have not tried it I do have it on my
love's list and it looks absolutely
beautiful and I would say it definitely
is not similar to Becca's moonstone this
particular one is more of a nude color
Becca's moonstone is definitely more
yellow tone so that would be the biggest
like difference between them and also
the Dior one is more of a baked Chalet
formulation where is Becca's mineral
pressed what I think she's called
uh you know what I'm trying to say
guys these are shimmering skin perfecter
press I'm just not a brain fart
those are more of like a powder
formulation so biggest differences are
definitely color and then also
formulation wise and then the last
question is from TC Hannah banana this
was on Instagram and she said I have a
15 year old daughter with slightly oily
t-zone and occasional whiteheads and
blackheads but no serious breakouts what
would you recommend for a teenager with
these problems so I would definitely
just get her some drugstore skincare
because she's probably not gonna care
that much about skincare yet the first
item I would recommend is the simple
micellar cleansing water for removing
eye makeup and also face makeup I would
also recommend looking into the acne
stress control line from Neutrogena this
is nice it just has a 2% salicylic acid
in it they do have cleansing pads they
have a toner they have this particular
cream wash in the acid you have a gel
wash and for a mask I would highly
recommend checking out the Neutrogena
clear pore cleanser / mask this has a
3.5% benzoyl peroxide because she is not
super super oily I would not use this as
a cleanser before a mask that would be
great and also as they scrub I would
highly recommend it the st. Ives
blackhead clearing green tea scrub this
does have 1% salicylic acid in it which
will help with the blackheads and the
occasional whiteheads so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this week's Q&amp;amp;A thank
you so much for joining me and I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
