my channel I am here to do a Q&amp;amp;A for you
guys today this is part of my Beauty Q&amp;amp;A
series obviously this one is just titled
Q&amp;amp;A because there are some non Beauty
related questions as you can probably
tell from the title but yeah I was going
to do look at the week for you guys
today however I realized that I have
been just wearing very very minimal
makeup coz I haven't been feeling very
well all week I literally just been
throwing on some CC cream putting on two
coats of mascara and pretty much calling
it a day so I didn't think it would be
worthwhile to do that but we were just
gonna do another Q&amp;amp;A video so I asked
some questions on alright I got some
questions on snapchat on Instagram and
also YouTube so let's go ahead and start
number one is from Kayla Landry this is
on snapchat and she asks who are you
voting for so election date is in the
three days as you guys know you're in
the United States
Trump is running against Clinton and
obviously we have Green Party and all
that kind of stuff so I normally don't
like to get too much into this because I
feel like politics and also religion are
a little difficult to talk about
especially when you do run like a
lifestyle and beauty channel is just
kind of out of out of the blue you know
or I guess outside of the comfort zone
I'm totally fine with talking about
politics but again here on YouTube is
just a little more controversial so I'm
not gonna go in depth but I will let you
guys know I am a Democrat I come from a
very very liberal background very
liberal home and I will be voting for
Hillary Clinton I don't think that she
is the perfect candidate but she is who
you know my my views on things line up
with her in the Democratic Party so yes
I will be voting for Hillary Clinton
number two is from Samantha Altman this
was also on snapchat and she asked why
don't you edit your videos so there are
two reasons for this and number one is
because I don't want to and number two
is because I honestly don't have time to
you guys I have a very very very busy
schedule and it may not look like it by
the way that I can post so many videos
but you have to understand you know if
I'm hosting a 15 minute video it
literally just took me 15 minutes to
film and then maybe 20 minutes to upload
so altogether it's very easy for me to
push out videos I know it's a lot harder
when you do edit videos I have friends
that literally spend
hours upon hours editing videos which is
probably why they only put out one to
three videos a week so I think if you're
able to push out more than two or three
videos a week and you edit like I think
that's absolutely amazing but yeah I
really don't have time to if I did start
editing my videos you guys would
probably only see one or two videos from
me a week there's just not enough time
in the day and I do think that you guys
have gotten used to seeing me more often
I do like coming on here and just not
being edited I think it's kind of
different and fun and yeah also I just
don't want to because I feel like that's
a whole other thing I have to learn I'm
not great with electronics so that is my
answer
number three is from a and KP this is on
snapchat and they said why didn't you
cut your hair so I've been getting so
many questions about this and I just
want to tell you guys I still am cutting
my hair I am still doing exactly what I
told you guys I was going to do with my
hair I will be cutting it to my
shoulders and I will be going platinum I
am doing exactly what I said I was going
to do and there have been a few things
that have basically gone wrong so let's
get ready for a little story time rant
here so first of all my hair stylist her
father got sick he was in the hospital
for about a month and a half and
unfortunately he did pass away so my
actual hair stylist could not get me in
for two months this was like at the
beginning of the summer when I decided I
wanted to do this and she couldn't get
me in for two months finally when I did
go in to see her the reason why I
haven't been doing much with my hair
it's not so much because of my hair it's
because of my scalp guys the past three
lupus flare ups that I have been in have
really really severely um I have some
bad scars I have some bad scars on my
scalp not so much like around here with
my hairline a few weeks ago on snapchat
I showed you guys some hair loss I have
been having around my hairline and ow so
just some like my old scarring but I
have some very very bad scarring in the
back of my head right now and I went in
to see her and she said there's no way
in God's like green aura that I am
putting bleach on your scalp like it
would just be so irritating it would not
be good so she did give me a trim my
hair was down to my bellybutton when I
went in to see her yes I know I've been
wearing my hair up in a bun for so many
months now but yes I do have very long
hair it's almost down to my bellybutton
like I said so she actually cut it up to
like right below of my lip bosom area so
I did get a trim but she didn't want to
chop it all off because that would
require her like she am pulling my hair
and doing
all this stuff and she was very very
very worried about like touching my
scalp and I don't know if it was because
she was kind of grossed out or if it was
just because um you know she was worried
that she could by accident injure me and
I would do something about it and be
like I'm gonna sue you cuz like she
broke open a scab or something on the
back of my scalp I know this is so TMI
but you guys have been asking so I'm
gonna tell you but yeah so basically
what happened was I just have some scars
remaining and the reason why I couldn't
get in before like I started scarring up
was because her father had passed away
and she took like two months off would
you totally make sense and I feel so bad
about so that's basically what is going
on I have not changed my mind whatsoever
I'm actually a very decisive person so
when I decide something's gonna happen
it's gonna happen it's just a matter of
I guess time so I'm still letting my
scalp heal up completely if you're
wondering why I wear my hair up in a bun
every single video and on a day-to-day
basis I'm always wearing it up it is
because I haven't been able to retouch
my roots so I probably have about six
inches of new growth so right here I'm
tell like down here it goes pretty much
completely all like just my normal hair
color and then all the way down past my
bosom's it is basically blonde and it
looks so strange I know people will talk
about it like in the comments section
and just be rude about it so that is why
I've been tossing my hair up in a messy
bun it
so basically no I did not change my mind
for cutting my hair I still will be
doing it it's just kind of a long story
so I thought I would go ahead and let
you guys know one here alright moving on
the next question is let's see here
number four and it is from Aaron odd 15
on Instagram they said what is your
favorite hidden gem product that people
may not talk about so it's definitely
from the drugstore
it is these covergirl I think these are
called what are they call color silk
classic color blushes these are amazing
these are so good they have really
really weird packaging and actually they
smell really bad they don't really
they're not very appealing this is what
they look like
yeah they smell really bad but these are
beautiful beautiful blushes this
particular shade is called 590 soft mink
and then I also have this one right here
which is called rose silk these are
gorgeous absolutely gorgeous on the
actual skin they have a little bit of a
sheen to them and when you actually put
them on and blend them and they look
amazing so that is the kiddin product
that I wanted to talk about the next
question is number five this is from
every camera carry Ola carry Ola this
was on Instagram and they said did you
grow up in France
why is your first language French and do
you speak any other languages so no I
did not grow up in France I grew up in
Minneapolis Minnesota why of my first
language is French um is because my
parents sent me to French immersion
school before I even started school so I
grew up speaking French basically as my
first language my father is not from the
US he was not born here he is from
Sweden and my mom has a lot of Italian
roots but she did grow up here she
actually grew up in Wisconsin so
although she you know basically like her
MA everybody is Italian on her side of
the family she did grow up here in the
US but yeah so I do speak a little bit
of Italian I speak some a Swedish I do
speak a bit pretty much fluently French
and then I am learning a little bit of
Mandarin or Chinese so that I can
communicate with Tom's parents because
they don't actually speak English so
yeah that's pretty much the languages
I'm learning and why my first language
was French was because I was sent to a
French immersion school as my first
language my parents really wanted me to
have a different language background and
I really appreciate that I think French
is just the most amazing language ever
so alright number 6 is from - baby 2012
this was on Instagram and she asked what
made you start doing videos so I think
I've talked about this a little bit but
honestly I was just watching a lot of
Beauty vloggers and beauty gurus and
people on you know the internet talking
about makeup I basically when I was in
college was going to school with a lot
of people that focus a lot on music
obviously because I was at conservatory
not a lot of musicians we're a whole lot
of makeup and kind of like though I mean
you get a group of people that I really
like to kind of perform and be out there
and be like oh yeah makeup and
everything on stage and then you get
other people that are just a little more
reserved in especially in the classical
music genre or just you know the field I
meant basically so I never really had
tons of friends in Manhattan that were
really really into makeup I mean they
may dabble in it here and there but they
were never really into it so I thought
it would be a great place to come on to
YouTube to be able to start talking to
more people that are really interested
in makeup and things like that alright
moving on at number seven is from Coco
Ortiz this was on YouTube they said what
are your thoughts on Julius place I know
you've said you do not like china-made
products but will you be getting any
pilot
from them Thanks so I have no idea that
Julia's place I thought they were made
here in the US as a here or is it in
China
someone let us know down below but my
thoughts on them are kind of mixed I
think that their shadows of amazing
beautiful love that they are a
black-owned makeup brand however I will
say I've heard some really horrible
things about their customer care so I'm
going to look a little more into them
like a little more into the little more
into them a little more into the brand
and I will keep you guys updated but I
would love to try a pallet or two from
them so I will definitely look into that
number eight is from a Fendi Girls this
is also on YouTube and she asked are the
Sephora bikes suitable for me with
rosacea and sensitive skin do you think
the rose scent would irritate my skin so
what she's talking about
are these Sephora cleansing white I've
been raving about these for quite some
time now I feel like two or three months
I've really been into these so she is
talking specifically about these guys
these are these Sephora rose cleansing
wipes they are ultra moisturizing and
brightening these are my favorite
cleansing wipes currently so I think if
you do have rosacea and you do have very
very sensitive skin the actual fragrance
in here might irritate to your skin
these are pretty good around the eye
area they don't make my eye area burn
like crazy but I do prefer them for
removing face makeup um but yeah I would
say that these probably scent wise may
irritate your skin I don't think the UC
ones would be any better because they
are lemon scented and then these ones
are exfoliating the charcoal ones so
stay away from those but I will say the
coconut water wipes would be your best
bet so definitely check those ones out
alright so the next question is from
Tanya two to three on YouTube she asked
why do you sit so close to the camera so
if you guys have noticed lately I have
been sitting a little closer to the
camera it is because I get so many
complaints about audio when I am sitting
back here people are like oh my god the
audios off I hate this please sit a
little closer so that is why I have been
sitting closer to the camera lately
I did recently pick up three different
microphones to try out and I hate all of
them I hate all of them there's
something about having a little Clippy
microphone thing clipped to your shirt
that makes your voice sound extremely
nasally I already in my opinion I hate
listening to my videos back I can't
stand my own voice that sounds horrible
but I'm just not into that whole kind of
hyper
even know how to describe my voice this
is just how I talk but I it's not my
favorite thing to listen to you so I
think the fact that the microphone was
making me sound even more nasally it was
really bad and I was like I don't think
people are gonna want to listen to that
and I'm huge on auditory things you know
I'm a musician so I'm like I don't know
about that so I've tried out three that
I'm really not interested in I will be
returning them to Best Buy so what I
think if any to you is keep looking for
a good microphone and then of course I
can sit a little further back and show
you guys swatches and everything like
that some people were complaining that
when I sit a little closer up you can't
see everything I thought it would be
better because you can literally see
everything up close and personal I do
think it's better to have swatches
closer but yeah I will be sitting a
little further back at once I do go
ahead and figure out the whole
microphone is situation so basically why
sit so close is just a for audio alright
and the last question is from Evelyn a 2
for 164 on YouTube and this was on
YouTube obviously like I said just that
her question is I'm considering buying
the Anastacio Beverly Hills moonchild
palette or the makeup geek
kathleenlights one which one would you
recommend Mars so here's the Moon child
here as kathleenlights palette hands
down I would recommend the moon child I
love this I think it's very very unique
if you want something that's very very
different and a little more out there
obviously the moon travel kit is special
to have it's very unusual and it's kind
of like a collector's item whereas the
makeup geek palette is a little more
everyday friendly you have some more
bronze tombs in here some more pearly
tone things like that so I'm sorry this
one's a little more pearly this one's a
little more Bronte this is the beautiful
palette and I did keep it through my
declutter series because I think it's
great for those days where you want a
very natural highlights but it is not
within like the top five of my favorite
highlighting palettes I hope to do a top
5 series on my favorite highlighting
palettes for you guys but yeah this
definitely doesn't fall into that
category when I reviewed this you know I
basically gave it a good review but I
don't think it's the best thing ever so
I think these are a little more neutral
and subtle but the anasazi of Beverly
Hills mo Chou glow kit is a little more
out there and unusual and any of the UH
Nastasia Beverly ho cloak Beverly Hills
glow kits in my opinion definitely have
a little more impact in like wham-bam
thing going on so
I would recommend the Anastacio if you
wanted more in-your-face kind of
highlight if you want something subtle
go with the makeup geek so anyway that
is it guys that is this Q&amp;amp;A I hope
you've enjoyed this video and I will see
you guys tomorrow for my fails in Holly
Grylls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
