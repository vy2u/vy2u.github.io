my channel happy Friday today we are
doing a quick little rundown of the
viola Foss ride-or-die palette I'm going
to show you guys some of my favorite
shades in here there are 42 different
shades so if you would like me to swatch
them all out on my Instagram definitely
let me know down below originally I was
going to do an in-depth review for you
guys on this but things got busy times
got busy we went to Hawaii I didn't have
time so I still wanted to go ahead and
let you guys know my thoughts on this as
well as give you some alternatives for
the palette if that makes sense now
I have not been able to find a palette
that completely like dupes out this
palette this palette has 42 different
eyeshadows in it ranging from like a duo
chromatic finishes the Tula matte
finishes it has like satin finishes you
have some glitter shades you have cool
tone shades warm tone shade transitions
math everything and I just can't find a
specific palette that's like oh my god
it's exactly like that but when I am
showing this palette like on my
Instagram or snapchat people are usually
saying I love that side of the palette
or I love this side of the palette so I
thought I could show you some products
that are permanent from different brands
that may give you the same sort of look
on your eyes so yeah that's pretty much
it let's go ahead and jump right into it
so this is the viola pause pro right or
diet palette I hate the outer packaging
you guys I don't know what it is I love
leopard print but this like rainbow
effect or like transcendence kind of
thang transcendence you guys know what I
mean it's like the the glowy kind of
thing I don't like it I feel like it
looks really cheap but the actual
packaging if you guys were curious is
very very sturdy a lot of the other
violet box eyeshadow palettes are like
this then they're very very thin this is
nice and weighted I feel like the
cardboard is very sturdy and if you are
curious my lip loss easy cruelty free
brand you do have a big mirror here
which I really appreciate and here they
are here are all 42 different shades so
starting from the top you guys can see
you definitely have some transition
shades as well as brow bone shades you
just have kind of like different rows
going on here over here we got some nice
cool wine colors with wine tone colors
and berry tone colors here we have a
really interesting row of like yellows
and then over here we have some cool
tone shades I really think they did a
nice job with a color selection here but
these are definitely colors that you
could do back in your collection the
only road that I think is very specific
and like special to this particular
palette is this little yellow row right
here
I feel like I cannot really find a lot
of dupes for that in my collection but
the other ones are very very similar to
the other pallets that they have
released if you have the holy grail
palette you pretty much have all the
shades over here if you have the dredge
metal palette you have quite a few of
the shades over here and if you have the
lauralee you do have some of these
warmer tone shades and transition shades
as well so anyway let me show you guys
some of my favorite swatches I do
already have them swiped right here on
my hand I have no primer on here and
these were once wiped swatches so the
first one I want to show you guys is
this one right here this particular
shade is called pala and this is a
really nice dual chromatic shade I like
that they did put some duo Chrome's in
here I think it's really cool now I will
say they're not as pigmented as some of
the other lustre or shimmer shades but
they're still beautiful so that one is a
favorite and then this one right here is
called Alison this is also a dual
chromatic shade it's peachy but it has a
little bit of a blue iridescent and then
this particular shade right here is
called Jane and that's a pure a pure
like yellow honey kind of color so
that's very very beautiful over here we
do have the shade destiny which is a
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous Sheen kind of
like I don't even know how to describe
this it's like the smoothest softest
buttery acai shadow ever it's very very
beautiful almost has a little bit of
like a big delay formulation like when
you actually swipe it out on your hand
so that is what it looks like it's a
gorgeous champagne taupey color right
here we do have these shades Stephanie
which is a little more of a glittery
shade it's identical to the shade Biddy
in the Laura Lee palette so if you were
looking for something similar that is
literally the same exact shadow and then
we do have these shade is this Scarlett
yeah this one is Scarlett this one's a
little more dual chromatic actually has
a little bit of a brown shift to it and
then this one down here is also a
favorite this one is called Rachael
which is a really really slate gray
color which it doesn't look like it but
it has a purple iridescent so I really
really love these particular shades here
another one that I love is the shade
jasmine which is like a pure slate gray
color with a little bit of like a white
shift it's gorgeous and as you guys can
see goes on really really nicely so
those are some of my favorite shades
like I said if you want them all
swatched out definitely let me know and
I can pop that up on my Instagram my
Instagram is open to the public so you
should be able to click on the photo I
will link them down in the description
bar if you want to see them but yeah I
think overall the palette is really well
put together is it worth $75 not
in my opinion I got it when it was on
presale for around $60 which I think $60
for this is great the pan size is
exactly what you get in the other
palette and you know $75 for all of this
I'm like okay like that's just these
seems like a little bit of a stretch I
feel like we're getting into like these
our territory so I wouldn't say that
it's worth 75 but I would say if you can
get a 10% discount code or something
like that I've seen that trend mood has
one if you can get some sort of a
discount code I think it is worth
picking up if you were really really
interested in these colors so now let me
go ahead and show you guys some pallets
that I do think are kind of similar the
first one I want to talk about is the
Too Faced natural matte palette and you
may be like what this have like nine
shades how is this similar if you really
really really are attracted to the
transition shades in here this is very
very similar if you want those cool tone
transition shades those warm tone
transition shades those perfect kind of
like Milky brow bone colors this is a
really nice palette to have and you guys
know how I feel about the 9 pan
formulation from Too Faced I think
they're fantastic a little guy right
here that is literally like $2.99 at
Ulta is the runway glamour berry bloom
palette this is actually from profusion
as this has like those more pinky tone
shades in there and then two different
kind of like transition matte shades and
this reminds me a lot of this kind of
like pinkier territory right here in the
palette so if you're looking at that and
you're like I like those slate gray kind
of berry tones you would probably enjoy
this quite a lot another one that is
very very similar is the lorac Pro
palette so you open this baby up and you
can see you are getting a lot of nice
darker shades over here and then you're
getting those nice brow bone shades over
here and then some of these darker
shades as well kind of line up this one
kind of reminds me of the shade jasmine
as well as well as Rachael in the
palette so here is the viola boss and
here is the lorac you guys can just kind
of see right I hope you guys can see
there are definitely some some cool tone
colors and warm tone colors that match
up with this like I said the only thing
that I really can think of that super
super special in this palette is this
row right here with like the yellow so
if you love those yellows then I guess
maybe it would be worth it but
definitely use a discount code you guys
alright and then here we have the it
cosmetics naturally pretty palette if
you like
talk about this at all on my channel but
I really do like this so here is what it
looks like on the inside and I do feel
like some of the cooler tone shades
match up with some of the cooler tone
shades in it the ride-or-die and then
some of the warmer tone shades are
actually very similar as well so I just
wanted to show you guys like side by
side kind of comparisons I can also
swatch these out on my Instagram if you
want to see but just so you guys can see
you know when you actually get them on
the eye it's going to look very very
similar so if you already have these
palettes in your collection you probably
don't need to get the Ryder diet and
then finally of course they have to talk
about the anastacio Beverly Hills Modern
Renaissance palette if you love those
berry tones over here you got pretty
much the same exact thing going on over
here you even have that nice real dark
shade in here which is that beautiful
beautiful orange and that lines up with
some of the shades right here so anyway
I just wanted to show you guys some
cheaper alternatives if you do like a
specific part of the palette overall
like I said I think it's really good
quality they've really done a good job
with their mats as well in this palette
you guys let me swatch a few the shade
Amy in here reminds me a lot of wine and
dine this one is from or the wine and
dine shade is from the Holy Grail
palette this one is the only one that
feels slightly crispy to the touch but
this shade right here reminds me a lot
of realgar from the Anasazi on modern
red a renaissance palette the shade is
called Riley Kaitlyn like Matt's just
feel super super buttery and nice and
here are one swipe swatches for you guys
I really think that they have stepped up
the game as far as their mats are
concerned so anyway yeah definitely not
worth $75 in my opinion but if you can
get a coupon code if you really really
feel like you need all of these shades
definitely go ahead and purchase it but
I wouldn't say it's a necessity so I
hope you enjoyed this quick little
review thanks so much for joining me
guys and I will see you tomorrow for my
first impressions on the peanut butter
and honey palette from Too Faced I'm
very excited I hope you guys are as well
