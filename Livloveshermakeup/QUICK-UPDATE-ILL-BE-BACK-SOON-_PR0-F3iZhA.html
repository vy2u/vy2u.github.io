really quickly and let you guys know
where I have been the past couple of
days this is kind of a lupus or health
update i am filming this on my laptop it
was just the easiest for me to film so
yeah I have been very very sick from
this last shot if you guys didn't know I
was in an experimental trial for lupus
and I got my last shot about a week ago
some say a month ago know about a week
ago and it has been really really rough
i went into a pretty darn bad flare up
so much like physical symptoms not
physical senses but like rashes and
things like that it was more just like
being extremely exhausted and i have
basically been home from work for four
days in a row now so i have not been
feeling good whatsoever i will be coming
back and need to put me back on youtube
i decided on monday so i hope you guys
are ready for a new a video event but i
just need to do we kind of just chill
out and relax a little bit unfortunately
i went to the doctors the other day and
not only issue i have to deal with the
symptoms of this lupus i also have
pneumonia which was one thing i have
never gotten before I've never had
pneumonia I've never had issues with
breathing or anything like that and I
had a really scary side effect about
three days ago where I just couldn't
breathe then I actually thought I was
going into like cardiac arrest or
something like that it feels grazie
because I i I've never had issues with
breathing lung stuff on hurt stuff and
I've been very lucky not to have any
kind of symptoms like that so I started
getting a very tight constricted chest
and I didn't know how to differentiate
between it being heart problems or it
being breathing problems like lung
problems and it turns out it was lung
problems I have a ton of fluid buildup
of my lungs currently so anyway yeah it
has been a pretty rough couple of days I
just want to let you guys know I just
want to let you guys know where I've
been because I know a lot of you have
been asking i am ok as of right now i
hope to get out of the house for the
first time in like five days tomorrow
and then me to take care of a few things
need to run to the post office to do
some stuff like that and yeah that's
pretty much it I am Alive and I'm okay I
just really have not been feeling but
this week's I hope you guys are okay
with me not posting for the rest of the
week but like i said i will be back on
Monday videos to look forward to i'm
going to be doing it
marina while 83 it made me buy a video I
am going to be doing an antenna call for
you guys i am going to be doing I didn't
know if any video ideas that I need to
get done and I always feel like I get so
behind when I'm not feeling good but a
lot a lot of video ideas coming up my
30,000 subscriber giveaway which I
believe we're almost at 36,000 or thirty
seven thousand or something like that
