to jump on here really really quickly
I'm literally filming this on my iPhone
a lot of you are wondering if you could
see the apartment tour after we moved
out obviously they need to pull up the
carpets and repaint and all that kind of
stuff we've been living here for two
years
but I thought it'd be fun to just walk
you guys through really quickly so if
this was our living room we do live in
Milwaukee Wisconsin we're now moving to
Arizona which will be a lot of fun and
over here we used to have like these
little paintings that we hung and I
could not get this off I was like oh my
god I hope they don't charge us for that
we shall see but yeah this was our view
and this was kind of where our dining
room table was which was really really
nice it has kind of an interesting
layout in this particular building and
then here we do have the kitchen area
with a nice dark cabinets which I really
really enjoyed there's my dad hello dad
hey hey hello to my friends everybody he
is here to help me drive with mr. B I'm
packing man he's the packing man and
then here was obviously our refrigerator
a few little dents there there's mr.
badger hey B and then obviously we had
like the nice dark wood here which I
really liked we're leaving a pot here
some bread but we did clean out the oven
and everything really nicely though
thank goodness and yeah all the
appliances were sort of like stainless
steel which was nice and there is
jean-pierre my flute and then here we
have some cleaning supplies that we
thought we would just leave for the
people who come in to deep clean the
apartment but yeah anyway this is mostly
the area that was the most beautiful it
was the living room obviously the
carpets like stayed we'd live here for
two years but we have the couch there
which was really nice and then in here
was our bedroom so we had like our bed
here with our lights and everything and
then we did have a little bit of like a
walk-in closet for me and then from a
boyfriend and then the bathroom it was
really really nice as well love at the
granite and all that kind of stuff so
yeah we have that over here I did not
take this shower curtain off oops
whatever that's okay
so really really nice view this way um
as you guys can see they are building
some sort of like a sports center here
so this wasn't the greatest view from
the bedroom but obviously the living
room made up for it and then when we
walk over here we have our little
balcony which was kind of interesting
it's made out of like cement so it kind
of has this like weird surface where it
looks slightly dirty I guess you could
say that is what it looks like and then
here was the view from our balcony
obviously probably should have cleaned
those again we're like never out here
because the majority of the time it's
really cold in Milwaukee it's cold in
the Midwest right dad only only in your
vine only in my mind I see I see so
there's the hallway here we had a washer
and dryer which was super super nice and
loved that and then here is a my
boyfriend's office or it was his office
he took this room with no windows so
that I could take the one with the
windows and this was a Maya Beauty room
if you guys didn't know
so anyway obviously nothing in here
really anymore hey baby hi magic you say
hi to everyone
um but yeah this was where the beauty
room was I'll go ahead and throw up in
the cards in my original beauty room
tour I'm going to completely redo the
new Beauty room which I'm really excited
about I don't want to do so much white
but more like silver and Gray's and then
here we did have our guest bathroom so
we really liked this yes I'm wearing
leggings as pants don't judge me but
yeah basically this is where mr. badger
lived and again he had some nice
cabinets there and that is where we put
him Co stained the carpet is down but
that is where we put him because he's
kind of like a free to roam ferret he
has potty-trained so we didn't mind but
yeah that's pretty much it guys so the
two bedrooms we ended up using as
offices and then obviously this is like
the area that you want to be super
gorgeous so I hope you guys enjoyed this
quick little tour I will have another
video going out for you tonight but yeah
that is pretty much it I'll talk to you
guys later
bye say bye dad bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
