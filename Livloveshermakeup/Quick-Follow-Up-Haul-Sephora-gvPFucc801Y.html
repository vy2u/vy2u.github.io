video is going to be a quick little
update on the Sephora haul that I did
exactly a week ago I will link that
video down below and even eat down below
down below in the description bar if you
would like to check it out i'm sorry if
i sound really stuffed up i'm a horrible
horrible head cold so i'm doing a lot of
this because i don't want to blow my
nose because you know it's just gonna
take all my makeup off does anybody else
do you got I really don't like listening
to people sniffle but I'm sorry I just
don't want to ruin my makeup anyway
let's just get right on to it a like i
said i'll link the original video down
below and yeah so the first thing that i
had picked up was the tony moly tea tree
face masks so there was a little pack of
2 i only used wanna gave one of them to
my mom i left it with her when I was
visiting in Minneapolis and these were
wonderful i would definitely definitely
repurchase I personally did not like the
coconut ones that I had tried from tony
moly but these were really nice these
are fiber or a sheet mask I felt like
they fit my face really really well
which is a huge thing because I feel
like a lot of these masks from different
brands don't really fit your face
properly this fit really really well and
I really really like the tea tree in
there it didn't smell too overwhelming
or too overpowering but I definitely
helped with inflammation and it just was
kind of soothing my skin and it felt
kind of tingly so I really really
enjoyed that and I would repurchase
alright the next thing I did not try out
yet I am doing a first impressions on
this this is the clinic beyond
perfecting foundation + concealer that
will be coming up soon I haven't even
gotten into that yet um the next product
I gotten forgotten the next problem the
next product I got goodness gracious
guys been a long day already and the
next product I got was a shiseido ibuki
multi solution gel this is a Stella
cilic acid acne treatment that helps
with roughness and visible pores like on
your skin this is what it looks like
it's actually a cheap little like
container it's plastic but this stuff is
awesome I've been using it all week at
nighttime and I put it all over my face
after I have toned it and then I put my
moisturizer on top it sinks in
immediately it's this really cool gel so
when you actually take it out like if
you put your finger in there watch this
it just kind of molds back into what it
was so it's one of those products that
literally
we'll just like that you dig the
products out and then it will mold
itself back together really really cool
I absolutely love the consistency of
this my goodness i'm just like spelling
them all over the place but i absolutely
love the consistency of it it's really
really lightweight it smells really nice
and I feel like the salicylic acid in
there is a really nice percentage
because it definitely helps with active
breakouts and also just like
decongesting my pores so and this is
definitely a winna winna chicken all
right another winner winner chicken
dinner is the lovely their mineral skin
longevity vital power infusion I got a
full size of this I keep saying that but
it's because i only have tried it a
little deluxe I samples of this this is
amazing this is one of the best serums I
have ever used in my life you get a huge
amount in here with a nice pump it's a
beautiful milky um silky texture and if
you have oily or combination skin you
would love this it sinks in immediately
it's not leave your skin feeling greasy
it's just one of the best series i've
ever used so I'm loving that our product
i'm unsure about is the origins maska
miser this is a skin optimizing mask
primer I don't know if this is doing
anything i have been using it all week
you guys can see i've used quite a
little bit at the top there i have been
using it before i put my mask on and i
tried it with a few different masks now
i'm not quite sure if it's doing
anything I think there may actually be a
little bit of alcohol in here because
when I keep my eyes open if I'm spraying
it it really stings my eyes so I don't
really see that coming i'm not making
sure if i love it or i hate it and i
don't know i need a little more time
with it i might end up returning this
will see I just can't really see a
noticeable difference using that product
or not using it with a mask if that
makes sense and then the last thing in
that I had picked up was a kat von d
metal crush eyeshadow in the shade doce
or dojo che dio siiii i think it was
called copper on the website that's what
i'm going to call it this is what it
looks like it's beautiful ultra
pigmented one of these softest shadows I
have ever put my finger in
I mean it's amazing it looks beautiful
on the eyes I was wearing this in my
crease the other day I also wore it on
my lid it's just a gorgeous gorgeous
color it's almost it has the appearance
of almost like a foiled eyeshadow and
it's just beautiful so really really
happy with a lot of the products that I
picked up again I haven't tried out the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
yet I'm going to do that on camera with
you guys and i'm just unsure about this
origins Maximizer but I will keep you
guys updated if I do end up returning
that product but everything else I
really really loved so thank you so much
for joining me for this little follow-up
hull and I will see you guys tomorrow
