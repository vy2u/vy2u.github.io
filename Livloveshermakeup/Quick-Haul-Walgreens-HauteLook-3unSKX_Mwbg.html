going to be doing a quick call for you
guys it'll be really really quick
writing another video to film after this
one um but basically I just went to the
drugstore and i also got to keep things
from hot looks so let's just get started
now the first thing I picked up was this
boots botanics micellar cleansing
solution three-in-one Albright it
dissolves makeup unclogs pores and
removes impurities in one easy step for
all skin types of brightening hibiscus I
like this and I like micellar water for
using on the days where I am running out
of the apartment and I do not have time
to do my normal skin care routine in the
morning I don't even have time to wash
my face that's what i use micellar water
for so I've never tried this one from
boots but I'm excited to see how it
works next I picked up a new dry shampoo
I'm all about dry shampoos I have lots
of dry shampoo my hair right now um it's
very dirty um but basically I thought
I'd try a new one my favorite formula is
the batiste one but I thought why not go
and try new one so i got the suave
professionals refresh and revive salon
proven dry shampoo it looks like that i
really love the suave professionals line
in general so i thought i would
definitely like this I picked up some
scrunchies because I have been all about
these big fat soft scrunchies lately I
have no idea why um I think it's because
I just don't want it like I've been
wearing the hair up a lot and I just
don't want to put in a really tight hair
band that just hurts these just feels so
good they're so soft so I got those in
black and i also got beige white and
black next I got to this new new from
Neutrogena at least I saw that they have
this new hydro boost line so i picked up
the hydro boost water gel um with
hyaluronic acid this is basically for
your face it's like a water gel cream
for your face it looks like that i think
the packaging was so cute i love the
little blue
and when you open it up it's just like a
thick blue very very watery it like
moves around when you go like that so I
thought this would be perfect for the
spring and summer months I do have
combination skin so I cannot deal with a
heavy heavy thick moisturizer around
that time of year so I thought this
would be fun to try out and along with
that I got the hydro boost gel cream for
I so this is an eye cream by the way
they also had a gel cream in this form
but I thought the water gel looked
better and honestly got better reviews
spend the gel cream so this is what the
eye cream looks like and it also has
tyler annika acid in it really really
excited to try those out they were
building $21 oh and what is happening to
drugstore like brands everything is
keeping so ridiculously expensive you
guys agree with me it's crazy anyway
next I got the dub intensive repair deep
treatment mask her hair I was just out
of hair masks and I use hair mask
instead of conditioners every time I
shower because I started coloring my
hair and I'm gonna keep going blonder
blonder so it's just got to be in good
condition so this one looks good smells
really good fresh and kind of coconutty
and the last thing I got at the
drugstore at walgreens was the boots
number 7 beautiful skin hydration mask
for dry or very dry skin it's as a gift
skin and intensive moisture boost I do
not have dry skin I have combination
skin but sometimes the gifts really
really dry irritated so I thought this
would be a nice mask for them looks kind
of cool looks like pasta or something
like all right next this is stuff I got
from hautelook it's really really fast
this is from crown cosmetics I got three
brushes this one super super soft
reminds me of my Sigma oh now i can't
remember add something and then app
something brushed and it's just really
really soft synthetic i've got one of
these i like these for blending my
foundation into my hairline and then i
got just a flat top one or don't don't
shaped one I
and my brush this is AC 330 pro blending
crease brush it looks nice I have still
got the sea 469 precision concealer
brush and I got two of the crown studio
glam shadow sticks one is in a copper
crayon really really beautiful color see
that kind of looks like a ski lift kit
in very very similar in my opinion so I
got that one and then I also got the one
in wicked witch is like this gorgeous
blue color with gold undertones I'm so
excited to use that so really really
happy about those hopefully they don't
crease on my eye and the last thing i
got was this crown lush of lip gloss in
diablo it's just plain bright red
gorgeous a little on doesn't smell like
anything feels nice and lips so i'm
excited to use that a little more super
sheer but it is a lip gloss so anyway
that was it that's with my little haul i
hope you guys enjoyed this video i will
be posting another video tonight i'm on
the becca ultimate coverage concealer so
if you're interested in that check it
out it will be right next to this video
and i'll see you guys in my next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
