time for a little hautelook hall um I do
have other stuff that's coming in from
hautelook but I hate having like boxes
just laying around in my apartment and
this one is no exception like it's just
waiting to be opened up and I just want
to do it so I'm gonna do this with a hot
look all the first thing i got was from
a booty parlor which is like a cute
little sexy brand that you can order oh
my god fun hot look and it is um flirty
little secrets this is the luminizing
body butter with pheromones now I'm not
kidding this because it has pheromones I
mostly got it because the scent um the
way they describe the center really
appeal to me oh my god oh my god yes oh
this is so good you guys it's like grape
it's like a great fonta or something
it's like this beautiful body butter and
you guys know I'm obsessed with body
butters so this was right up my alley
and it says it's lumen I think so maybe
have a little shimmer in there i'm not
quite sure but i love body butters and i
know i'm gonna love this so that is from
dirty little secrets i also got the
flirty little secrets pink caviar scrub
with pheromones i'm also a big um scrub
girl so I thought this was right up my
alley and smell that oh yes oh my
goodness my gosh this smells so good it
smells like pink lemonade and it looks
like pink lemonade but um I thought that
was great and again these are both like
under ten dollars so no complaints there
really really keep packaging also so
can't wait to use those maybe I'll keep
them for special occasions I don't know
what do you fear moms do exactly huh Oh
doubt anyway um okay no you stay down
there my kitties looking up at me like I
jump up on you no no yes together next I
got some things from top beauty I got
this little eye palette
comes as a little tool and did brush
like this which doesn't actually look
too flimsy I think I'll keep that
certainly I'll powdery all over um I did
swatch a few the colors I like this it
seems very like earthy tones just really
really neutral and I thought it was
pretty and I collect eyeshadow palette
so why not um the next thing I got was
this pop beauty buzzing beauty buffer so
this is like you know this makes me
think of my little beauty blender okay
um but this is like I don't know if hi
are you doing my cat is interrupting
she's marking the box wonderful um this
is what it looks like it's like this
little black case with like a sponge
thing on the top and I guess you just
blend it in like this and I don't know
what's what's going on with this but
this is like the lids you can like close
it off if you want to i guess i'm not
quite sure but i thought i'd try this
out and see i like to try different
things that are similar to the Beauty
Blender although this is like pricier
than the Beauty Blender so it's not even
like a knockoff that was like $32 hi nah
he's so pretty are you a pretty girl huh
okay um next I got this pop beauty BD
lip balm looks like this and the shade
is roseberry I have never tried a BB lip
balm it smells minty very pretty color
that will just go right into my tinted
lip balm stash and i'm sure i'll like it
i mean you can't really go wrong with
tinted lip balm especially if they have
baby in them which means it have like
fun frame segment and the last thing i
got was this little smashbox smoking
mirrors smoke and diamonds i can like
that set it comes like this and you get
like a palette and then you get some
goodies up here and in the pouch on the
top you get a Smashbox Oh gloss in gold
and it's an intuitive lip gloss looks
like that
it kind of keep cool love concept and
then you get to this Smashbox waterproof
shadow liner and it's in this nice like
a brown color yeah very pretty okay no
no kitty you just landed on all of my
things okay you think very disruptive um
I sorry I if I edited my videos I cut it
off I don't edit so anyway um yeah it's
like that nice color and then it has a
smudging stick on the other end so
that's nice you can use that as a base
or whatever you want an eyeliner and
then this is kind of what I ordered for
so this is the photo op eyeshadow
palette smoke box that's what it's
called smoke box um and it's the smoke
box number two and you open it up and it
does come with this level ah brush that
looks semi decent I'll keep that and you
get six shades in here that are very
smoky and dark and this is what they
look like I did dip my fingers in a few
of them they're really creamy they're
great and this is just like four really
like true on smokey you know like I'm
going out smokey kind of looks so I
thought it was pretty though and again
it was a great price cuz it was on
hautelook and you know you really can't
go wrong oh this little brush has dual
ended thing actually so it's cool anyway
um that is what i got from hautelook so
far I have more stuff coming in that I
will go ahead and haul once um you know
everything starts to stack up I just
don't like keeping boxes around in my
apartment and waiting and I just like to
haul them right away when i get them so
