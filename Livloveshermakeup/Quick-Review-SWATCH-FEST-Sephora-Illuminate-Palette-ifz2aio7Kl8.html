you a my channel today's video is going
to be in reviews and comparison on the
new so for a collection and aluminates
palette this is obviously new and
exclusive to Sephora sin cities their
house brand this is the palette it does
have 16 different Pro universally
flattering powder highlighters and you
are getting six different pan sizes with
zero points 12 ounces of product or 3.4
8 grams of product in each so this is to
give you a satin or radiant look to the
skin which I don't agree with this is
the coverage of sheer to medium which I
also don't agree with but I will say
that this is a really a nice shade
selection and you do get warm and cool
tones in here so the reason why I don't
really agree with what they say about
the actual pigmentation or the coverage
because I find it to be insanely
insanely pigmented I would say they're
about the same sort of pigmentation
level as like aa Nastasia Beverly Hills
glow kiss but they are definitely a
little more pigmented than say like the
Becca shimmering skin perfecter press so
I don't think there's your two medium
don't be fooled by that on the website
and they say that this gives a radiance
or satin finish to the skin I don't
really think that either because anytime
I think of radiant or satin I think it's
going to go on really spoils looking
they do have a little more chunkiness
and grittiness to them but they do still
look pretty darn good on the skin what I
mean by that is that they do have some
glitter particles in there normally I
hate that but I feel like they go onto
the skin nicely enough that it actually
looks okay so here are all six shades if
you guys can see they do label these as
a one two three or four or five six so
number one is this kind of pinky come
down here reminds me a lot of the Dior
glowing Guardians highlight in glowing
pink I will swatch that at the end for
you guys number two is this shade right
here which looks a lot like a better
champagne pot number three looks a lot
like a Becca's pearl
number four looks a lot like Becca's
moonstone highlights then you have
number five which kind of looks like
blush copper and then you have a number
six which is very comparable to one of
the shades and the kathleenlights
palette which again I will swap it at
the end so I think formulation wise this
is pretty darn good for $28 I think it
is quite strong it's not as good of a
formulation in my opinion as the Becca
or the Anasazi of Beverly Hills glow
kiss but you are getting such a nice
shade selection in here that I do think
is going to work for all sorts of
different skin tones and no matter if
you have a cool undertone or a warm
undertone there is something in here for
you so if you are just beginning in
makeup or you don't
go and pick up a full-size highlighter
in all these different colors I think
this is actually a really really nice
option to have like I said they are
ultra ultra pigmented and I do feel like
they wear a nice amount of time I would
say probably up to eight hours
especially if you do set them in with a
setting sprayer wearing kind of like a
khaki foundation but I do need to tell
you guys that throughout the day they
start to wear a little inconsistently so
I noticed that I don't like to take
these particular highlights all the way
down to like the apples of my cheeks
which I normally do because they do
start to emphasize my pores and things
like that if you are someone who does
have a lot of texture in your skin you
may not like this they don't go on
completely foiled or super super smooth
or like give that natural radiance sort
of look they are they when BAM in your
face kind of they're kind of highlighter
so they will start to emphasize that
area I'm just a little bit fine lines
wrinkles you know large pores but for
the most part I think they actually are
really really good so I'm going to go
ahead and do a few swatches for you guys
side-by-side comparison the first one I
want to do is defeat in number one like
I said this is very similar to be Dior
glowing gardens pink highlight again not
so much as far as consistency or
formulation is concerned at this one
it's definitely definitely a powdery
kind of highlight where is this guy
right here as north of that link-based
Chalet formulation so here is a seed
number one from the Sephora illuminate
palette and here is the Dior glowing
gardens in the shade glowing pink this
was limited edition and I know a lot of
people wanted to get their hands on this
so I wanted to show you what they look
like side by side so this is what they
look like side by side I think you can
tell right away the pigmentation with
the eliminate palette is a lot stronger
than a BB or which is surprising but the
Dior looks beautiful on the skin when I
really really go in up close I think you
guys can see there is definitely some
chunks of glitter there now I feel like
when you do go in with a good brush
something that you really can kind of
tap off that excess with something
that's a little more fluffy eat like a
sigma tapered highlighting brush or even
in the lux e tapered highlighting 522
brush it doesn't go that crazy on the
skin but you definitely can see little
areas where it will maybe got a little
bit of glitter there or always kind of
emphasizing my fine lines and wrinkles
whereas what that makes you a
formulation they're just going to glide
on absolutely beautiful but if you do
want a highlighter that is sort of
similar in color I do think that this
palette is going to give you something
kind of similar to the key or
when I want to swatches sheet at number
two which is this one right here this is
very similar to champagne top Rebecca in
my opinion so let me show you guys what
I mean by that so on top I will do at
number two and then I will do champagne
pop on the bottom so here is the sheet
number two from the illuminate palette
there it is if you guys can see and then
here is the Becca champagne pop I feel
like such a champagne pop definitely has
a little less pigmentation but it's a
lot more silky this one has a lot more
of a powdery pick up a but still they're
pretty close in color so on top we have
the illuminates talent in shade number
two and on the bottom we have a Becca's
champagne pop alright so the third one I
want to swatch for you guys is very very
similar to Becca
pearl highlights which I think it's
awesome because pearl is great if you do
have a very very fair complexion like I
said one of the things that I love about
this palette is that it is going to work
for all sorts of different skin tones so
here is B seed number three and then we
will swatch it next to pearl so here is
number three let's watch that one on top
and then we'll do pearl on the bottom I
don't feel like this has a cool
undertone or warm undertone is very very
neutral so it's not going to darken up
on your skin if you do have a fair
complexion so on top oh we have shade at
number three from the illuminate palette
and then we have Becca's pearl on the
bottom and then the next one that I do
want to swatch is number four from the
illuminate palette this is very very
similar to Becca's moonstone as you guys
can see I feel like shade selection wise
it's very very very similar to the back
of the highlights now I think if you own
more of the globus I only own two of
them two Suites located and the Anasazi
Beverly Hills moonchile is located I
think if you own it like the Sun dips
glow kit or if you do own it the
ultimate glow kit there will be more
shades that also match up with this but
for the most part I feel like there are
a lot of shades that are similar to be
Becca shimmering skin perfecter prep so
here we have on top number four from the
illuminate palette and then on the
bottom we have a moonstone from Becca
so there they are side by side this will
maybe have a little more of like a
boyish kind of creamy undertone this is
a little more yellow to a base that's
still really really comparable and
creepy and then the next one just has
really look at that similar to blush
copper if you guys are curious here is
blush copper from Becca I definitely
have more of a reddish undertone you see
that number five
in this particular palette has more of a
golden undertone but of course I still
I'm going to go ahead and swatch it for
you guys so here is I think this would
make it gorgeous highlight on a very
very deep complexion so there is number
five swatched and then finally the last
thing that I want to talk about is a
beautiful pinky kind of purplish shade
it's sort of similar to the sweets cloak
it's the shade grape in there so the one
that I think it is the most comparable
to you is definitely this guy from the
casting light highlighting palette from
makeup geek this is B shade called
starlight so it's a beautiful beautiful
pinky purple kind of shade again they
don't have the same sort of formulation
but I think the colors are quite similar
so there is the makeup geek and then we
will do it number six from the
illuminate palette right beneath it so
there is number five here is the makeup
geek quizzical makeup geek this book
book book starlight and then right
beneath it we have number six from the
illuminate palette so hopefully you guys
can see that definitely there are some
similar shades going on here I feel like
they really were going after that Becca
kind of thing but I feel like the format
of it looks very similar to an Anasazi a
Beverly Hills glow kit so I think the
formulation is nice enough for $28
you're just getting such a great shade
selection in here is it the greatest
like highlighting palette I've ever
bought in my life absolutely not is it
worse absolutely not I think it's just
good I did recently purchase another one
of these for my giveaway because I don't
know who's going to win a giveaway if
they have a dark complexion a light
complexion I just feel like it's a
really really overall sturdy good
palette and yeah I really would
recommend it so if we were to line
things up I would say formulation wise
this is my least favorite out of the
becca and also the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills I don't think it's similar to
either of those I would put the Becca in
the middle and then Anasazi on the top I
just love their formulation and as far
as colors are concerned I feel like it's
more similar to like a Becca shimmering
skin perfecter press so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this quick little
review and swatches thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
