thank you so much for joining me today I
am doing a Sephora haul for you guys yes
it is a lot of stuff I have beauty stuff
skincare and makeup I've been spending a
lot of time on the Sephora calm website
we have become besties because I've been
purchasing all these holiday palettes
and while I'm like looking at that stuff
I get like carried away and I start
adding stuff into my basket and we all
know that Sephora keeps everything in
your basket for like a year so I have
literally like hundreds of dollars of
products just sitting in there and I
removed a lot of them but I still
probably have like half you know that's
so bad especially with all these
palettes to like it literally is just
adding up but I just can't help myself
I'm just spoiling myself anyway I hope
the lighting is OK in this video it is
finally a sunny day here we were having
overcast weather the past three days and
I was looking back at my videos and I
thought the lighting looked so weird
like one day it was really pink
yesterday was really yellow so hopefully
now that the it is like a clear sky the
lighting is OK
yeah Conseco eyes know I don't know how
to edit my video so I don't know how to
like fix lighting and all that kind of
stuff so I felt really bad when it was
like super pink the other day but anyway
let's just fit into this house shall we
so um like I said lots of skincare
beauty I think I have some hair care no
wait the hair care hasn't shipped yet
well I should have waited for that to
ship before I did this but it's okay I
purchased the chlorine I think it's
called chlorine klo
ra and ii mango butter shampoo that was
another thing so i guess i won't show
that in here but i did purchase that so
the first thing i got was the naked
urban decay flushed palette this was on
sale for $15 this was the only shade
that was on sale it's a native and it's
funny because when these first released
i wanted this color like this was the
one I would have picked so go figure
they're normally like 30 or 35 dollars
and it was 15 so it's basically just a
highlighter a bronze
and a plush and I know I have a lot of
stuff like this like I have a lot of
products very similar to this but for
$15 you just can't begin like for
high-end stuff you know any time it's
like markdown to 15 you just have to get
it that's almost like drugstore prices
so I got that the second thing I got was
the Tony moly
tangerine brightening hand cream you
guys know I love the peach hand cream
and Apple one I love all the hand creams
but I just love the brand and I love
their hand creams they come this
adorable little packaging so whatever
scent you get and you get the actual
little fruit super cute but these are
amazing they just smell so good and this
one has like a little bit of like
shimmer in it it's supposed to be a
little brightening and it smells amazing
if you like citrus definitely definitely
look into this it smells similar to the
body shops Satsuma scent so if you like
that you probably like this I really
really like citrus sense during the fall
I feel like it's such a pick-me-up so
got that I also purchased two Tony moly
lip balms these are always sold out on
the website
always always always sold out you guys
so I finally got my hands on them I got
the mini cherry lip balm I'm like going
like this it's hard like you look in the
viewfinder and then you're like ah do I
point to the viewfinder or do I point it
at the lens I think most people would
know to point at the lens but I'm just
like whatever
really bad has electronics guys alright
so this is the cherry lip balm look how
cute and it's got this little like a
rubber thing I just love the packaging
it's too cute so let's smell it because
I know it's
because from Tony moly yes it smells
amazing so I'm really really excited to
use that not that I need more lip balms
but you guys I've been wanting to get my
hands on that one and it's always sold
out on the website this is us
also I always sold out on the website
it's the Tony moly mini peach lip balm
you guys know I did a rave review on the
peach hand cream it's like amazing so I
know I'm gonna love this scent and I'm
so happy I finally got my hands on so
it's like a little peach oh my gosh I'm
cracking off my nail polishes I pull
these things off so it looks like this
super super cute and let's smell it to
you
YUM it smells so good you guys this
peach scent from Tony moly it's amazing
like literally so good so so so so good
alright moving on I picked up a palette
from Laura Mercier this was also in the
sales section it was originally 58 and I
think it went down to 29 or $30 so I
thought it was a really great deal it's
the artist palette for eyes and cheeks
super super cute packaging and the
inside has even prettier packaging it's
like very very sleek it's got like tiger
print and it's a magnetic closure and
inside you get some gorgeous you get
four let's see here format one two three
yep formats and it looks like for like
metallics I can't tell because I haven't
watched them yet and then you get eight
gorgeous gorgeous blush so I just
thought that these were amazing like on
the website I knew that they would be
great for fall especially this like
little area over here with like the kind
of rosy pink purpley tones and grave I
just love that and that blush looks
amazing so a really really great deal
and I just couldn't pass it up guys this
is like way marked down all right I
picked up another Jurlique rose water
balancing mist this is a refreshing mist
to hydrate and soften I don't use this
to set my makeup because it's literally
super expensive and I run out of it
really quickly I use it
sir in the morning after I have you put
on all my skincare I missed it over my
face and it's just very refreshing it
smells amazing it gives a lot of
moisture to the skin
definitely a slurred product like you go
through it pretty quickly and I think
it's close to $40 but it's honestly
amazing don't use it to set your makeup
you can if you want to but it's quite
pricey so I would recommend just using
it as a um like skincare mist alright
another skincare item the first aid
beauty triple brightening complex facial
radiance serum it illuminates helps with
texture and reduces discoloration and a
safe for sensitive skin
this was also 50% off in the sales
section you guys have to shop the sales
section of Sephora literally there are
so many good things that pop up on there
like everyday alright so it looks like
this it's got a little dropper and
hopefully this will help with like
brightening up my ready complexion
housing estate connection my ready
complexion I have a lot of like acne
scarring and it would be nice to use you
know something that could really really
help you know brighten those areas up
and I only use this in the morning I
only use serum in the morning all right
I got a bozhe makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil this is the smaller size I
love these I swear by it this product
it's amazing it removes your makeup so
well this is the little small size you
can get a big size too it's just it's
the best literally all right I got the
tarte high-performance Naturals limited
edition Amazonian clay dual liner this
was also in the sale section it's in
black and bronze super cute packaging
it's got like a little snake on it and
look at the packaging I love that
it's not pretty and you open it up and
you get this beautiful kind of inky what
is wrong with me why am I like so
sideways today
sorry guys having issues with my camera
so you get like a bronze color and a
black and it just looks really really
promising and it was a great price that
literally was like $15 all right oh my
gosh okay nobody alright moving on
before I picked up the hourglass ambient
lighting edit palette I had purchased
this it's literally been sitting in this
box you guys like I've been waiting to
get through this but I really wanted to
put up reviews on all of the holiday
palettes but this is the ambient
lighting power from powder from
hourglass and this is the new travel
size which is like money friendly sort
of it depends on how you see it because
this is the packaging it's really really
small this is $22 but it is a really
really beautiful peachy color and yeah
now I have that little one and I have
the one in the palette so that is
exciting alright and I think the rest is
all samples and point perks you guys I
really cashed in my points so let's just
get started um what is this savage from
Dior I don't know is this for men and
women who knows I'm sure I can use it on
my boyfriend can use it the Atelier
cologne again I'm getting a bunch of
clothes in here I think I probably think
those ones for my boyfriend
two of the Viktor and Rolf if you love
these amazing the bumble and bumble surf
some wash shampoo and creme rinse
conditioner these are really nice I like
to use them when I am going to be
braiding my hair overnight cuz they just
kind of gives a little texture and makes
it hold
I have very naturally fine this is just
it air dries this way it's just very
flat and straight and I like it
and that kind of gives some texture I
like that product all right
a hundred point perk or this was maybe
one of their little like specials like
weekly specials was the Ren clean
skincare wake wonderful nighttime facial
looks like that
I also got two hundred point perks of
the Versace a bright crystal I just need
to buy this perfume you guys I mean I
really don't because I have too many
Barbie ups but I love this perfume so I
got two of the little roller balls and
then I got a hundred point perk this was
the philosophy ultimate miracle worker
multi rejuvenating cream with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sighs that is like
the boxes are so deceiving looks like
that so I'm excited to try that I also
picked up at the Bobby Brown extra face
oil this was also eight hundred point
perk and I just love face oils I love
mixing them with foundations I like
wearing them as moisturizers so I
thought I would try out Bobby Brown's
let's see here another hundred point
perk the perricone MD face finishing
moisturizer I could not read that for a
second
face finishing moisturizer it hydrates
and imparts a glow on the skin again I
feel like the box is very deceiving it
looks so big
yes this is the actual size so I think
you can just wear this during the day
right recommend applying to entire face
over treatment morning and evening yeah
so it doesn't have SPF in it self self
alright sample of the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation I hate this
foundation so I will be passing that
along to a friend the fresh black tea
age delay I concentrate I love this it
has noni fruit juice and it firms and
eliminates it's amazing it smells really
good and it's just so like thick it has
an amazing amazing texture la vie a bell
from Lancome this is a great smelling
perfume but it's like 194 dollars full
size another fresh black tea age delay
icons
I love those the belief the true cream
aqua bomb my mom uses this and we found
that for her at Sephora I know it's
really really good the nude Omega
treatment milk I've tried this I do like
it it just smells a little funky but
that's because it's natural the fresh
black tea age delay cream so this is the
one you put on your face not the eye
concentrate this one's really really
greasy but honestly notice the
difference in my skin the next day so I
don't know
wait is that one for daytime no alright
and then two little perfume samples
tomforde moirÃ© yes and they were having
like a weekly special thing where you
could get a little either a perfume
sampler bag or a skincare bag so I chose
a skincare bag and let's see what's in
here
again the nude Omega treatment milk this
was just one of those things like you
type in the code um it always says on
like the left hand side of the Sephora
website you'll see like weekly specials
and then you just like type in the code
at checkout and you can get free stuff
these Sephora express eye makeup remover
wipes I've never tried these so that's
nice um let's see here the Bobbi Brown
extra repair moisture cream I thought
this was the eye cream I have the eye
cream but I'm excited to try that
because I have not tried the face cream
the Perricone md photo plasma
broad-spectrum SPF 30 it looks like it's
a sunscreen the origins ginseng ginseng
ginseng ginseng ginseng
refreshing I bring to brighten and deep
up I've heard great things about that
and yeah wait there's one more one my
little thingie bozo make up break up
cool cleansing oil a little sample love
it alright guys so that was my haul like
I said I do have it's probably
downstairs like right now like it
probably was already delivered but I had
another box that I was going to add like
stuff in it was just the phyto hair
supplements and the chlorine mango
butter shampoo so that is what you guys
missed I am NOT going to wait to haul
those in my next one because I want to
use them right away so anyway I hope you
