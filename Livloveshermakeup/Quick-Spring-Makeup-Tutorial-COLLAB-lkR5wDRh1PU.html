channel thank you so much for joining me
i hope you are all having a fantastic
day so far in this video i'm creating a
kind of light spring tutorial for you
guys this is a collab video with my
friend Katya here on YouTube and I
believe this is the first collab video
that I have done that is like a get
ready with me or a tutorial sort of
style and I'm really excited because it
has been a hot minute since i posted a
makeup look on my channel i'm not even
like comfortably i don't even know how
to do this anymore i'm on camera um
anyway we thought that we would put
together a look for you guys kind of
associated with springtime I have been
obsessed with putting a pop of color I
mean lower lashline lately so I wanted
to show you guys how I would recreate
that look with the Urban Decay vice ltd
reloaded palette and also the forever 21
21 eyeshadow palette which looks like
this so you can do this with any sort of
palette whether it be like 799 or like I
don't know how much this was probably
like $58 you can do this as Eddie sort
of palette as long as it has like a
bright color in it and then also using
like a bright um like eyeliner on your
water wine wow I cannot speak a bright
colored eyeliner on your waterline so
anyway like I said this is a collab with
my friend Katya I'm going to leave her
channel her video and also her
instagrams down below in the description
bar I would love if you guys went over
and checked her out she's going to be
showing you guys how to do like a bright
lip so I'm doing the I she's doing the
lip we thought yes this is great you
guys can put the lip and the I together
or you could just do the eye or just the
lip but every time I think of spring or
summer I think of like a bold like lower
lashline color and for her she kind of
fix up a bright lips so I really really
adore Katya she is one of those people I
just love the sound of her voice and i
know it students before about other
people you may be like your weirdo
Olivia but I really adore the sound of
her voice she's very like calm and you
guys know me I'm like hanging off the
ceiling all the time I'm constantly
really really hyper and for me to watch
someone on youtube I need them to have a
really nice like calm demeanor I need
them to be pretty much like the exact
opposite of me and she's just a very
very calm and collected and very classy
I like that about her so
anyway I would love with you guys went
over and checked out her channel she
pulls a lot of similar videos to me as
well so she does a lot of halls get
ready with me tutorials and reviews I
think you guys would really like her so
make sure you go over and check her out
and tell her I say hello and yeah
without further ado let's get into this
quick little spring look so let me walk
you guys through what I have on my face
are ready so it's my base I am wearing
just a BB cream I have been obsessed
with just wearing like a BB cream or a
tinted moisturizer this actually is a
tinted moisturizer it's a BB tinted
moisturizer whatever that means but yeah
this is the Tarte Amazonian clay BB
tinted moisturizer in the shade ivory
and I applied this all over my face with
a damp a real techniques sponge and you
can still see spots through it like I
have quite a few little break outs on my
forehead right now I'm going to show you
guys and my fails and holy grails which
product has been doing that to me this
week but it's you can still see like
your pores and your acne scars and stuff
like that through this particular um
foundation or base but I feel like
during the spring and summertime I
really like something to be very nice
and lightweight on my skin I don't want
something too heavy especially because
they do have combo skin and i know it
will melt off at the end of the day
anyway so i have that on and then in the
areas where i did need to touch up i
went in with my hard candy glamour flage
heavy duty concealer I actually only
went underneath my eyes and then all my
eyelids with this because it did have a
little bit of dark circles but I didn't
cover anything else because this is kind
of a heavier concealer then I did their
head and set in my face completely with
my it cosmetics bye bye pores loose
powder and then I went in with my Urban
Decay afterglow highlighter and II shade
fireball and I used this as basically a
light blush on the apples of my cheeks
and then I went in with my Laura Mercier
Matt radiance baked powder highlight in
01 and I touched lino the area that's on
my face like the high points of my face
with a really fluffy brush I went down
the bridge of my nose on my cheeks and
then all my cheekbones as well so let's
go ahead and just get started out by the
way what I have on my lips is this this
is the YSL voluptate in oil in the shade
Chadli my Chevy
alright moving on let's go ahead and
just get started the first thing I'm
going to do is put some color on my
watch online so i will be using this
little hello kitty um so cute hello
kitty I'm Kohl eyeliner I got this in a
set at sephora for like twenty five
dollars there's like seven different I
Liars in there if you want something
very close to this color Urban Decay's
24-7 glide on eye pencil in the shade
gonzo or any sort of bright color that
you want will work so I'm just going to
take this and I'm going to put this on
my waterline and it's just going to put
a little bit of color down and as you
guys can see I'm kind of going for like
an aqua or greenish pop of color on my
lower lash line alright next we are
going to go ahead and go into the Urban
Decay remoted pellet which looks like
this and I'm going to be taking the
shade anonymous with my BH Cosmetics
fluffy crease brush and anam anonymous
anonymous anonymous is this kind of
cream matte shade right here I'm going
to be taking that and putting it all
over my lid and also below my eye as
well and this is just going to create a
nice quick base for our shadows so that
when we put other shadows on top of them
they blend really really quickly and
easily next I'm going to be taking that
same brush and I'm going into the shade
laced which is kind of like a beautiful
transition color tap off the excess I'm
going to work that into my crease really
really kind of messily we're not doing
tons of color on our lids we're doing
most of the color on our lower lash line
all right next with the same brush I'm
going to go into the shade right here
which is called I can't even read these
upside down Rome strip which is a
beautiful kind of leg duochrome I don't
even know how to describe this it looks
like it's white but it actually has like
a blue and purple e iridescent to it
it's actually a really pretty color
putting that underneath my brow and also
on the inner corner of my eyes and that
is it for the lid so next we are going
to go in with a list
pencil brush i will be using my morphe
and 431 brush i will list everything
below by the way and i'm going to go
into this shade right here called acid
rain it's a very like light green sort
of color I'm going to pick that product
up on my brush and I'm going to run this
underneath my lower lash line and this
is going to act as the base for the
color that we will be going in with from
the forever 21 palette I'm just kind of
just swiping it on there and this color
is really pretty you could use pretty
much any of these colors in here to do
like a bright pop of color you could use
UVB or you could use gold mine but i'm
just using acid rain as kind of a base
so that the color that i'm going in with
is more blue but i want things to look a
little more turquoise so i'm just
putting that on my lower lashline it
looks like I'm gouging my eye out I
promise I am NOT all right and then it
would be C brush we are going into the
forever 21 college we're going to open
this bag it up come on please open
please open there we go I'm going to be
taking this color right here which is
like a beautiful kind of foil even know
this color is amazing and then I'm going
to put this on top of acid rain and you
can see this is going to create this
sort of color that kind of matches what
we have going on on our actual water
line which I love so it's kind of like
that turquoise II bluish greenish color
like I'm all about that life so now it
just looks like we have a big smack you
know smack full of color well it looks
like we basically just plastered color
onto our lower lash line so we're going
to go in and kind of blend that out
quickly with a sonia kashuk number 116
brush it's nice and dense and I am just
going to be using really really light
little motions and kind of buffing this
color out to make sure that there are no
harsh lines and at this time you might
want to go in with something like a
really really fluffy brush to pick up
any sort of fallout because for me I
personally get a lot of fallout with the
Urban Decay voice reloaded palette I
don't know what that's all about but I
do so anyway it doesn't look that bad
this time but anyway that is what it
should look like so far looks a little
messy
okay we are going to fix it and now we
are going to go ahead and put our
mascara on some really really fast and
easy I did curl my lashes before I
started this video I used my Revlon lash
curler and held it for 10 seconds and
are we are going to go in with the miss
manga rock mascara from l'oreal which
looks like this i'm going to put one
coat of this on my lashes and then we're
going to go in with the Lancome Hypnose
drama mascara and put one coat of that
on as well on top so this is the l'oreal
miss manga i love this mascara because
it's very very like how would I describe
it it kind of makes your lashes look
very defined it can live a little clumpy
so if you hate something mascaras I
would stay away from this one but we are
going to top it with the Lancome Hypnose
drama and this one's lovely it's really
really nice like slick sort of wet
formula I personally love this mascara
I've been obsessed lately and I'm just
putting one even coat of that all my
lashes as well making sure not to mess
up on the bottom we always get mascara
on my lower lash line so that is it guys
so that is pretty much it I mean it's
literally like a very very quick easy
sort of pop of color on the lower lash
line but I really really like the way it
looks again you can recreate this look
with anything I mean this love and
beauty 21 eyeshadow palette was like 6
99 or 799 at forever 21 or you can use
your urban decay advice reloaded it's
just a really quick way to get some
color on your lower lashline and not
have it looks super super extravagant I
mean if you can do like winged eyeliner
you could do color on you know your lid
I can't do winged eyeliner for I've
said that so many times but its true
like I just can't do it um so I prefer
to do a nice pop of color on my lower
lashline and yeah I really like the way
this looks please please please go over
and check out crotches channel I hope
you guys enjoyed this quick little
spring tutorial thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for my face and home rails bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
