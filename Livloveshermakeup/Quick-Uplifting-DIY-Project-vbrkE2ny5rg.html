you a really quick
uplifting DIY project you can do with
just a piece of paper a pen and scissors
and you can do it at home really quickly
it takes like five minutes and this is
meant to be stored somewhere where you
look every single day so bathroom mirror
frigerator a freezer whatever anyway it
is a take what you need little piece of
paper and you can cut it however you
want to I just did some weird artsy
fartsy thing I'm left-handed so I just
don't do good scissor work even with my
lefty scissors it's pretty bad anyway so
it is a take what you need and what you
do is at the bottom you cut so that you
have enough room that you can actually
rip off one of these little things and
you write in things that interest you
that you might need throughout the day
so I have things like love courage
understanding beasts passion healing
strength beauty kindness and forgiveness
and I think it's just the thought of
having something like this ripping it
off putting your pocket or your purse
that really can change the way you think
about your day so I hope you guys
enjoyed this quick little DIY and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
