at my channel today's video is going to
be the TMI tag I was tagged by a seat my
friend Meg it was so long ago I cannot
remember but I will link her channel
down below quite a while ago she did a
bunch of tag videos she tagged me and
all of them and this was the first one
I'm getting around to now today
originally I was going to be doing a
viewer-requested video I am definitely
still doing this I'm going to do it
tomorrow instead the reason for that is
because well first of all if you guys
are curious it's going to be about
foundations to oxidize like crazy which
i think is an amazing idea but the
reason why I'm doing it tomorrow instead
of today is just because I get my final
lupus shot tomorrow I'm just doing some
pre filming kind of right now today's
you guys didn't know I have SLE lupus
and I am in a clinical trial right now
and tomorrow's my last day so I am
nervous and I'm sure I'm going to be
sick accurate they give you a huge
whopping dose of whatever the hell
they're going to give me so I wanted to
do some pre filming and I listed some of
my past videos for like the week
everything was like a review or first
impression so I thought we would do
something a little more offbeat and then
tomorrow we will get back into more like
beauty related stuff so anyway p.m. I
had questions I feel like I'm super TMI
all the time so it will still go out and
answer all right number one Oh what are
you wearing so I am wearing it this I'm
literally sweating I'm sure you guys
going to be able to see under my armpit
it's all wet please don't just mean this
is this little table here this is from
Under Armour it's basically just a
workout top I don't work out but I like
to wear this because it's super comfy I
liked it it's like skin tight I mean not
on the days where I feel bloated but I
like it and I like to have these little
holes here so guys just the turtle that
kind of thing and I really like this
color it makes me very very happy
alright number two have you ever been in
love yes I have I fell in love the first
time I was 14 I was an early bloomer
alright let's see here number three ever
had a terrible breakup yes I actually
impeded a man in college who was
physically abusive to me and yeah that
was a bad breakup that was a bad one
yeah not going to go into details now
but maybe eventually I will make a video
on that number for how tall are you I am
5 to like on a good day I went to the
doctors on video
three and she was like okay I see you
like your highness Oobleck you're about
five one out of you means I do five one
and a half so I would say five one two
five Pew how much do you weigh so my
weight fluctuates like most normal
people I never really like under ninety
five pounds but I'm never over like 115
I think right now I'm at like 110 I
don't know if you guys can tell because
I actually I'm like apple shape so I
carry all of my weight unless my boobs
and my upper arm area and then the rest
of my body is marked like little chicken
legs you know chicken legs I don't like
it I rather be the other way around to
have like a nice hourglass body or pear
shape but it is what it is so yeah
anywhere between 105 and 110 I guess
let's see here any tattoos now I'm a
decision not to have had shoes because I
have to be on stage and I would have to
cover those up and you piercings I guess
I have my bellybutton pierced I actually
first it myself when I was 13 years old
and I was a kid I actually pierced my
cartilage on both sides all the way up
as well does that in fact it has taken
out but I still have is this hole right
here or these holes right here somewhere
and then my bellybutton so I've heard
that I'm amorous like how I did it but
my friend and I here since we there's
like a potato involved in a sterilized
needle or hopefully it was sterilized
it's just it seems to be fine it got a
little infected at first do not hears
anything by yourself at you know at home
don't do it guys but yes I still do have
my belly ring all right
OTP this is one true pairing and I had
to look that up stuff with a house OTP
so and I have to say mr. badger and
future mrs. badger it's good to know I'm
seriously contemplating getting a female
Farris and they're going to be amazing
together I already can feel it
all right favorite show definitely True
Blood I love so many shows HBO I love
all their shows Westeros amazing Game of
Thrones all about that life let's
because the Walking Dead is really good
it's very depressing for season but
mostly good I like a lot of TV I love
Family Guy Don it's like my all-time
favorite show anything with crew humor
the Simpson I'm all about that life
anything with Seth MacFarlane basically
all right favorite fan so I don't want
to listen to band and I'm
I mean I listen to classical music but
it's you know I play classical music so
the last thing I want to do when I get
my car is put classical music on I
really love rap music you guys anything
that can be into like I'm down for it so
I don't really listen to bands but I
just listened to a whole lot of rap I
was like Drake in little wine and people
like that which I said little wing
whatever okay number 11 is something
that you missed lilypad I have her ashes
behind youtubers didn't know I had a cat
I adopted her when she was older and she
had kidney disease and she was just like
the love of my life
I say that about every animal and I mean
that excel you can have multiple soul
animals but she was just so sweet we
needed each other and you know it's
really hard when I had to let her go and
get all emotional it's really hard when
I had to let her go but she was ready
she was ready so uh okay would be your
favorite song can we just say like
Shostakovich symphony and number 10

I am 24 years old I will be 25 on August
1st all right zodiac sign with you guys

I see Leo I actually get told a lot that
I seem like a Leo I don't know why I
guess a lot of people that are
performers are Leos or something like
that my brother's also a Leo his
birthday is a day before mine three
years apart so yeah my mom had two
little Leo's and we were handled all
right number 15 quality you look for in
a partner someone who is reliable
somebody who is honest because I am very
brutally honest I need somebody who can
handle that and also you know it's the
truth at me as well and somebody would
calm because I am Harper all the
time
all right let's see here a favorite
quote mm okay oh wait uh I forgot
it no no no oh yes your mind is a garden
your thoughts are the seeds you can grow
flowers or you can grow weeds grow
flowers good okay all right moving on
let's see here mm-hmm like my voice is
all scratchy today did you do oh I just
skipped away I wanted in a way to work
okay
favorite actor Kevin Spacey I'm in love
with them in love with him I
I'm extremely sexy I told Tom I would
like he's so happy I seem to be kind of
into older men that's going to sound
really bad like I'm you know I don't
know I don't know what I was going to
sound like like I've doubted yours or
something but I like older men
Tom starting to get some gray hair don't
do not tell him that I told you oh and I
like them too dear plus those you read
those they look sexy
alright so yeah definitely ham let's see

it's pink but it actually is red and
that it's a time-saver color and his
monster your color alright let's see
here why are you keep losing my place oh
why can't I do this okay loud music or
soft so you would think I do have very
sensitive ears I love loud music like
loud rap music so I like blow through
those little elicits a little Apple
earbuds all the time it's not that I
don't know why I don't know why I don't
know why I do that it's not good
sorry it's got a hate comment that came
through on my phone
thank you right alright let's be here
where do you go when you're sad I come
into the beauty room because I have
music on this side and makeup on this
side I prefer the music side doesn't
makeup it's pretty damn good so yes I
come easier let's see here how long does
it take you to shower probably about 10
minutes I'm super fast how long does it
take you to get ready in the morning so
if you see my look of the week videos
usually about 20 minutes 15 to 20
minutes for it and makeup now well
that's what I'm talking but usually
about 10 to 15 minutes for makeup and
probably 10 minutes - sorry I've done it
minutes to like put my clothes on and
drink my coffee and all that kind of
stuff - probably about 30 30 minutes and
my friend Michelle is calling me I'll
call you back I'll come back alright

fight

number 24 turn on whoo I don't know that
is a little TMI even I'm shook come on I
guess somebody was very honest I like
honesty a lot you guys even if it's
brutal I feel like honesty is everything
so that's a turn-on to me turn off I
don't know I tend to stay away from
people who like you know
exhibit to turn off in my opinion
so I'm going out the reason I joined
YouTube to make friends everybody says
that I really do mean it to make friends
I was in conservatory I was in college
and nobody else likes makeup nobody wore
makeup at my conservatory and I would
just be sitting there practicing for
hours and hours every single day and I
would come home and I wanted to make
friends so yes that is why I started
YouTube and that is one of the most
important things to me as far as YouTube
is concerned alright number 27 are we
are done 2700 fears flying if you guys
didn't know I was almost in a what could
have been a plane crash I was thinking
of doing a story time video on that I
don't love story time videos but I think
that that is one that might be worth
telling so yes I hate flying

need them I freaked out alright I think
that's really the only thing that I'm
scared of though I'm not sterile excite

kind of person um I do have a little bit
of dyslexia as they have eyes that kind
