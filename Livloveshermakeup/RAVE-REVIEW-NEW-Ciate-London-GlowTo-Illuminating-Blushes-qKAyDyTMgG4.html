today I have a quick little rave review
for you guys this is going to be a
review on three out of the five new
Ciotti London glow 2 illuminating
blushes there should be a real quick
little review with some swatches because
I'm loving these so I did purchase three
out of the five they were $26 a piece
you do get four grams of product in here
which is kind of surprising because when
you look at these they look really
really small just for a little bit of
size comparison or reference the Milani
baked blush is this particular shade is
called coralina
number zero eight and this has 3.5 grams
of product so you actually are getting
quite a decent amount of product in
these little guys right here again for
another little size comparison we have
the Clinique cheek pops which are
similar in formulation these are again
it's three point five here we have four
so you are getting a nice amount of
product in here up for $26 a piece there
are five different shades to choose from
but one of them is called into the deep
which is a lavender pink you also have
the shade matchmaker which is a burnt
pink you have date night which is an
Amber pink you have baby doll which is a
rose pink and then summer love which is
an apricot pink so here is the shaded
baby doll it is so so so beautiful
really really enjoyed the shade and then
here we do have summer love I'm actually
returning this one but it has nothing to
do with the formula or anything like
that I'll talk about it in a second and
then we have date night which has to
quickly become my all-time favorite so
very quickly let me tell you guys how
I'm wearing these on my face today I
have date night on my eyes smoked it on
a lower lash line put it all over the
lid blended it up into the crease one
shadow look one and done I have the
shade baby doll on my cheeks and then I
did mix in just a little bit of this
with my lipstick today I'm not really
quite sure if it's showing anything but
like I said this is the one that I am
returning so oh we're all very excited
and happy about these you guys they are
paraben free sulfate free of satelite
free and they are cruelty free they are
supposed to be a long wearing a
brightening blush I wouldn't say that
they're necessarily super super long
wearing they do have a little bit of
like a DeMatha cone or silicone formula
to them because they are a big shell a
blush now I have said before on my
channel that I'm not the biggest fan of
baked Soleil blushes and the reason for
that is because sometimes I feel like
they are overly pigmented and I'm
talking about like the NARS dual
intensity blushes I remember getting
quite a few of those and really not
enjoying them but I have to say I really
am enjoying this little formula right
here they definitely are
is firmly press is say the clinic cheek
pops this particular one is called zero
tooth beach bar cheek by beach pop and
this one is definitely a big Chalet
formula you know when you rub in there
you can really feel it's kind of like a
hybrid between a cream and a powder
super super smooth no kick up really
really pigmented as you can see now when
I rub my finger into one of the cia's it
feels softer it does not feel um as
firmly press it kind of feels almost
mousse like and as you can see there's
definitely pigment there but it's a
little more forgiving I love that they
have that really really beautiful Sheen
running through them because I think
they look so beautiful and brightening
on the cheek so although they aren't the
most long-wearing thing I will say that
they definitely are skin brightening um
it does say it will leave any complexion
with a healthy-looking flush of color
Avett is fused with a skin enhancing
highlight each shade can be applied
subtly for a barely-there look which I
definitely agree with or it can be
layered for more intense color so the
way that I kind of got it to be on my
cheeks today and on my eyes as I really
did kind of layer and build them up if
you are not a fan of having to build
your blush up you're not going to like
this now if you are very fair complected
you know what it's like to use a blush
that's way too pigmented it just goes on
and then you're like oh shit what do I
do now it's really nice with these
because you can build them up on the
skin this particular shade right here
which is called date night today I did
apply this with a really really dense I
brush and just kind of work that all
over my eyes I did have to build it up a
little bit but I really like that it can
double as an eye shadow I think that's
awesome really enjoy that and then the
summer love shade and like I said just
put a little bit of on my lips today I
don't know if it's really that
noticeable this is the shade that I'm
not the biggest fan of but still really
really beautiful good formula and then
baby doll I just went in with my what
was it BH Cosmetics go haired angled
blush or you know contouring brush and I
feel like it picks it up really nicely
you do need something that's a little
more densely packed with these you just
kind of go in there you can kind of tap
off the excess there won't be too much
fallout since it is a big shell a
product and then you just kind of
stipple it onto your cheeks it looks
amazing I just love how luminous and
flushed I look when I am wearing these
so let me show you guys the packaging
really quickly as well because the
packaging is super super cute so here is
the outer packaging you can see there is
a little bit of like a rubber thing
going on here kind of like the Becca
Jacqueline Hale and Chrissy Teigen
palettes on top so it's a little rubbery
but maybe a little more firm they do
have some stars a little bow it says
siete
and then on the back you can see it is a
mirrored finish and you do have a
sticker with the name one of my favorite
things about these is the fact that you
can open it up and there is a damn
mirror in here I love that I am a huge
fan of mirrors being in absolutely
everything one of the things that I
don't like about the cheek pops is that
they come in this huge outrageous like I
don't even know acrylic kind of
packaging there is no mirror and it's
just really clunky and big I've always
thought that these were packaged really
stupidly but I really enjoy that there's
a mirror here it does stand upright on
its own so if you were to pack this and
you wanted it to be your cheek um your
cheek look and also your eye look for
like a trip you literally can put your
makeup on like this and I love that so
overall guys really really impressed I
literally have nothing bad to say about
these except for the fact that I'm a
little worried that they might like pop
out of the packaging at some point
although the packaging does feel nice
and sturdy I just feel like they aren't
sealed in there completely because you
can kind of see it a little break right
here but who knows maybe they are I
don't really know I have had a few
products from CIT before that have
popped out of the pan which I really
don't enjoy but if that happens I'll
probably just go ahead and pop it into
you know some sort of a palette that I
have like a Z palette or will maybe not
a Z fella but something shape up popping
into my own palette and you know kind of
create my own palette using them but
yeah I definitely think I will pick up a
few more shades maybe one or two it like
I said a lot of them look very very
similar I'm not quite sure that every
single shade would be flattering for
everyone the reason why I am returning
the summer love shade is mostly just
because it's honestly not dark enough to
be a blush but it's also too dark to be
a highlight on me so it's just not good
for me but I feel like if you did have
like a deep or medium complexion this
would be a stunning stunning highlight
on you and when I looked at the photos
online like on trend moods Instagram it
did look a little darker this is what it
looks like when you do finger swatch it
and then I'll go ahead and also blend it
together so you guys can see a little
bit of a blended swatch it definitely is
super super pretty but right now with my
self-tanner
it's just not the color for me like I
said a little too dark is a highlight
but I really really have to build it up
as a blush and I just don't want to have
to do five layers of a blush I'm okay
with going ahead and building it up you
know what are two coats but five layers
is too much so this is going back and I
will probably trade it out for that
lavender pink shade but still really
good formula formula seems to be the
same across all three which is great
here is the shade babydoll like I told
you guys this one's really really
beautiful if you are fair complected I
think you're going to like this a
if you do have a cool undertone you're
definitely gonna like this a lot so
there is the finger swatch as you guys
can see really really nice Sheen going
on here but I do not notice any sort of
like glitter particles so if you're
worried about them being a little
glittery sometimes when I take pictures
of them with the flash on it appears
that there's like a little bit of
glitter infused in there but I swear to
you it's nothing that you can see on the
skin it looks undetectable it goes on
like a second skin because it is that
baked chalet formula and it's just
really really glossy and pretty looking
so those are the first two shades here
we have summer love and then here is a
baby doll and then the final one that we
have is date night like I said this one
is my all-time favorite I just really
really enjoy it this color and I feel
like this would be great on like a
medium complexion so there it is super
super gorgeous I don't feel like I have
a lot of colors like this in my
collection to be completely honest so
there is the actual finger swatch again
really nice Sheen going on there and
then I will show you a blended swatch as
well so there is the blended swatch so
yeah you guys I have to say very very
impressed I do hope that they release
some more shades shades that are a
little different from one another maybe
a really really deep kind of reddish
color something a little more cool tone
something with our nice peachy
iridescent I would really enjoy that but
I am loving these highly highly would
recommend you do get a nice amount of
product in here even though it doesn't
look like it you are getting four grams
of product which is kind of the standard
amount for a blush I would say 4 to 6
grams is usually standard but yeah
really really enjoyed these so thank you
so much for joining me for this quick
little rave review I appreciate it and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
