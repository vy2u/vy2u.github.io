hope you guys are having a really good
day today I am doing a rave review
so basically I've only done I think like
one or two of these on my channel but
sometimes they come across a product and
it doesn't necessarily have to be new
I just come across a product and I try
it out and I'm like wow like where has
this been my whole life so um this
particular product this is the Tony moly
on peach hand cream that so I'm going to
be talking about today this particular
product actually um is somewhat new Tony
moly is like a I believe is a Korean
brand that has recently launched at
Sephora they have some really great lip
balms they have some um just like a
skincare related things like sheet masks
and things like that and it's gotten
really really popular and I saw on the
support website they had little hand
creams and these were $12 apiece and I
was like I don't know it looks like it's
pretty small and they are pretty small
but they had tangerine they had Apple
and they had peach and so tangerine one
looks like a tangerine the Apple one
looks like a little apple and the peach
one of course looks like a little peach
so cute it looks like a little bit kind
of anyway so yes this is the Tony moly
peach hand cream and you guys oh my god
I've tried a lot of hand creams have a
lot of young creams I am currently using
a lot of hand creams um this is like
probably one of the best hand creams
I've ever used I use hand cream every
single night before I go to bed just
because I know I'm a musician I like to
keep my hands really nice and moisturize
and just in good shape so um it's kind
of a big deal for me to like moisturize
my hands and body lotion just doesn't
like give enough if that makes sense
like enough moisture so I do turn to
hand creams
and I have to say you guys I mean I
tried everything like right now I have
um a Mario Badescu one that's opened
I love the what does that call from oh
my gosh
hand food from soap &amp;amp; Glory amazing
scent really really good but there's
something about the texture of this
product I don't know if it's just the
peach one because this is the only one I
ordered or if it also is just the
texture of all the hand creams
it is well I have to check it out now
I'm gonna have to go get the Apple one
and a tangerine one but oh my god the
scent of this is like life it smells so
good if you are a lover a peach
this is like sweet candied peach it's
just amazing an actual hand cream itself
kind of has like this pinky undertone to
it and it just is oh my god so luxurious
you guys it's like very very creamy and
it's not one of those hand creams where
you rub it in and like you know you're
gonna get all oily watch this and maybe
the first two seconds you know you look
a little oily but then it's just
completely absorbs and it's amazing
I hate oily hand creams oily body
lotions oily Supremes oh my God my hands
must over um but this literally it's so
thick like it's like this like paste
almost and you would think that this
would be like I don't know you would
think it would be kind of greasy and I
was kind of expecting than it wouldn't I
was like it's okay because it smells so
good it's not like it absorbs probably
within I take 20 seconds and it's
amazing
I just leaves your hands smelling like
peach took like two hours it's amazing
oh my gosh I just I love it so um I'm
definitely gonna check out the Apple one
and the tangerine one I think recently
they came out with like blueberry lip
balms and all this kind of stuff what if
they made a blueberry hand cream I would
love that too that would be amazing
so just keep your eye out for these
little Tony moly hand creams they are
really I mean this one in particular
amazing the scent the texture they
really help keep my hands nice and
moisturized I never wake up feeling
greasy and I never wake up with dry
hands after I use this so I'm absolutely
loving this I will say you know for $12
it's kind of a small little pot but it's
so cute
and oh my god guys you like peaches
you're gonna love this so anyway that's
my little raver views had to dedicate a
video to this because I'm just obsessed
with it
only like hand cream that I've been
touching the past couple of days and I
usually alternate hand creams because
like I said I have so many that are open
however I've just been using this one
and I'm obsessed
so I'm definitely going to go on just
for right now in order the Apple one and
the tangerine one oh so good anyway I
will link below where you guys can pick
this up in those of our website if
you're interested but if you're looking
for a good hand cream awesome see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
