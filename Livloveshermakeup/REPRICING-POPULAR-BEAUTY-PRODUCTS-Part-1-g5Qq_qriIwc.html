my channel happy Monday today I thought
it would be fun to go ahead and reprice
some popular beauty products that are on
the market now I got this idea after
filming my who do they think they are
brands whose prices are way too inflated
video if you would like to check that
out I'll go ahead and throw it up in the
car it's a bite tide yeah I thought
today I'd go through eight different
beauty products that I would like to
personally reprice and what I mean by
reprice is actually lower the price and
what prices I think and they should
actually be at so in this video I will
be talking about high-end makeup and a
few at luxury skincare products and then
at part two and also part 3 will be
drugstore as well as let's see here
high-end and also luxury skincare so the
first product I want to talk about are
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
press and these retail for $38 and in my
opinion and they should be 28 or $30
there's just absolutely no reason why
these highlighters should be so
incredibly expensive now I'm not saying
that they're bad highlighters and then I
wouldn't purchase them
I literally just bought another one the
other day I have a huge collection of
these I absolutely love these shimmering
skin Perfector press but I really
personally feel like there is no reason
why they should be $38 $38 is very very
high for a highlighter in my opinion
what are you thinking Becca you know
that really kind of reminds me of like a
luxury or super super super high-end
price for a highlighter so in my opinion
I think the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector should be 28 or $30 even just
eight dollars less really can make a big
difference alright guys up next we these
steal the glitter and glows these retail
for $24 a piece and I would personally
lower that price tag to 18 I think 18
would be perfect for these Stila glitter
and glows and the reason why I say that
is because I find that go through mine
pretty damn quickly
now I'll go ahead and insert a photo
here so you guys can see what the
majority of my Seelig litter and glows
look like as you can see or at least one
of them I really use these up I get
through them kind of quickly I have
already purchased two because I've
already emptied out two of them but the
one that I'm showing you guys is one of
the duo crumbs and I don't reach for it
that often but you can see I've made
quite a dent in it there's not a lot of
product in here and I feel like Stila
has never really been like a luxury
price tag sort of deal and they
definitely have like lower-cost high-end
products in my opinion and $24 for one
Shelagh glitter and glow shadow in my
opinion does a lot so I think $80 would
be the perfect price for the Stila
glittery glows well if you know what you
guys think below about that I heard
somebody tell me once that they think
they should be $12 $12 feels a little
low these are absolutely fantastic
litters and I think $18 would be the
perfect price point
all right guys moving on to tart shaped
ape concealer now if you didn't know
this price tag has actually crept up
ever since they became a very very
popular concealer let me know if you
would like me to do a video all about
brands that have raised the prices on
certain products after they became
really really hyped up at kind of famous
so the heart-shaped take concealer now
retails for $27 I would like to lower
that down to 22 I think 22 is the
perfect amount for the shape tape
concealer $27 for $10 more you can
actually get a Tarte foundation so for
me I just don't really understand the
concept I also have to say I love the
charts rainforest of the sea aqua sealer
and that one of my opinion should be $21
I believe it's $26 tart concealers are
incredibly incredibly pricey like I said
for $10 more you can actually get a 10
I'm sorry
pretend dollars where you can actually
get a Tarte foundation so I definitely
think heart-shaped tape should be $22
and at the aqua sealer should be $21 all
right guys moving on to the milk makeup
sticks so if these range anywhere
between 20 to 36 and dollars and if I
was milk makeup I would just make all
your goddamn sticks the same price you
know what I'm saying I think all of them
should be $20 I could not believe that
they're charging 36 for the milk makeup
blur stick a few people were telling me
that that price actually went up so
again I would mention that if I did that
video all about price tags that have
gone up with certain products once they
became kind of hyped up originally I
think the blur stick was around $22 so
I'm sorry $32 so now that it's 36 I just
think that's kind of funny because
obviously so many people hype up the
blur stick I personally hated mine I
didn't think it did he really didn't
feel like it did anything you know it
was sent to me for PR it really didn't
prolonged aware of my makeup it didn't
really blur my pores I don't really
understand the concept of that but you
know if you're gonna have all of these
sticks I think they should all be the
same price honestly milk makeup if you
are watching this video I think all of
your sticks should be $20 because girl I
don't need to be mean or anything but
your your your blur sticks are not worth
or just your sticks in general are not
worth fucking there
seven dollars $34 fucking $30 okay
alright moving on let's talk about the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mess this is
kind of like a luxury skincare product I
remember trying this out when I had a
combo oily skin and I hated it it made
me so fucking greasy on the skin and
this is $48 for 1.35 fluid ounces of
product tatcha if you want to sell more
of these honestly I think you should
lower that price to $30 and then you
would be competing with the other
setting sprays on the market because
most of the setting sprays on the market
are about thirty to thirty two dollars
maybe even thirty five dollars I just
think it would be better a lot of people
seem to love to touch with luminous dewy
skin miss I would like to try it out
again now that I do have more dry skin
but I don't want to spend 48 dollars
that's almost $50 for that skin care
products most people seem to use it to
set in their makeup even though that's
not technically what the product is
supposed to be for but that's what
people have thought of now that's what
they like to do they like to set in
their foundation with this particular
oily kind of mist okay so I think it
should be about thirty dollars in my
opinion touch-up products don't have the
best ingredients if you were to compare
the ingredients let's just say Sunday
Riley or drunk elephant you would notice
a big big difference and they really
really charge in an arm and a leg for
some of their products so I gotta say I
think the tatcha luminous dewy skin
measure should be $30 not 48 alright
moving on to the hourglass ambient
lighting powder as you guys know I'm a
huge fan of these one full-size is $46
I've lowered these down to 32 you would
sell so many more if you could lower
this price to thirty two dollars you
already get a huge amount of you know
grams per pan and they're just
absolutely beautiful and there's so many
people I talk about the hourglass
ambient lighting powder all the time and
there are so many people and I see all
these different comments of people you
know basically saying I can't afford
that I don't want to spend forty six
dollars on one fucking powder that's
almost fifty dollars on a powder
honestly our glass I know that you're
like a luxury you know basically on the
brink of luxury you know makeup brand
but in my opinion you could sell a lot
more of these powders and they would be
a lot more hyped up if you could lower
that down to a nicer range I would say
thirty to thirty two dollars you guys
would sell so many more in my opinion
guys up next let's talk about
Beautyblender $20 for a sponge no thank
you a Beautyblender should be $10 in my
opinion I had nothing else to say about
that
it's got damn sponge ten dollars all
right and finally guys we have the touch
of the water cream again it would touch
I just feel like there's skin care
products really don't have the greatest
ingredients in them they still work and
they do have good ingredients but
compared to like Sunday Riley and again
drunk elephant they're just not there
the ingredients list so the water cream
retails for $68 it's almost $70 for one
fluid ounces of a new barber cream which
is basically a light weight sort of
Gillette moisturizer I would lower that
to $45 that cream is not worth in my
opinion $68 I know my boyfriend loves
that cream but for me it's not worth 68
dollars it doesn't hydrate that well I
think $45 is the perfect price tag for
that so anyway guys those are some
popular beauty products that I wanted to
reprice let me know down below what you
think of this little video if you would
like to see more of these and let me
know down below if you have any popular
makeup Beauty skincare products that you
