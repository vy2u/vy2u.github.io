to my channel today I have part two in
my repricing popular beauty product
series if you would like to see part 1
I'll go ahead and throw that up in
the cards as well as the video I did
where I talked all about makeup that I
would gladly purchase for a higher price
which I don't say very often so I'll go
ahead and throw that up in the cards but
I yeah and these are some beauty
products that I personally have tried
and some of them I've tried over and
over and over again and I just feel like
the price is not right now I understand
these beauty brands and need to make
money I get it
but if I were to reprice these items and
this is the price that I would give them
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
let's start with these Sunday Riley is
sleeping at night oil so I have gone
through I believe four or five full
sizes of these Sunday Riley retinol oil
and I have to say at first I thought it
was absolutely amazing but the more I
went through it the more I realized it
definitely helped a little bit with
firming up my skin it helped a little
bit with hyperpigmentation things like
that honestly it was just expecting
continuous results and I did not see
them now this normally retails for a
hundred and five dollars and in my
opinion this should be sixty five or
seventy dollars I really do not think
that this oil needs to be over the
hundred dollar mark and same goes for
the travel size so travel size is what
55 I think it should be 25 especially
for the amount that you get now the oil
does go a like a little go through very
long way don't get me wrong and while a
lot of people do see a lot of good at
beneficial results with this particular
oil you can absolutely get cheaper
alternatives or dupes for this product
in my opinion so like I said I would say
that it should be 65 or 70 dollars maybe
even 60 for the full size and definitely
25 for the travel size a lot of people
were excited when they saw oh my god
they have a travel size but then it's
like a fifty five dollar travel size but
it's just like like why the would I
buy that why would I let's go ahead and
move on to the Fenty beauty body lava I
have the shade who needs clothes now I
got this during the div sale so I did
not pay full price which is $59 and
although you do get a large amount of
product in here it is still absolutely
ridiculous for this price there is no
reason why this product right here
should not be a $30 it really is worth
$30 that is not worth fifty nine this is
not something I would repurchase if you
have a problem with a really really
strong sense this is going to be a
little over the top for you
it smells amazing it kind of smells like
a suntan lotion mixed together with like
a cupcake but you can get body breakouts
like I do I have more pimples on my back
than I do on my face okay I'm definitely
one of those people that gets a body
breakouts on my shoulders and things
like that this does cause irritation I
tried wearing it on my face I've got
great guts on my face it basically is an
oil bound together with glitter in here
and while the shade is gorgeous this
particular shade is very very pretty
like a true rose gold if you don't have
a little bit of a base tan this is going
to leave a little bit of an artificial
color to your skin I noticed that when
I'm not self tan and when I met my
paleis and I put this on my legs or
something it almost makes it look like I
have rose gold colored legs which
obviously doesn't look particularly
natural so this is not something I would
repurchase like I said I got it during
the vib sale I will continue to use it
this summer on my legs it doesn't look
nice on the legs but I really don't put
it anywhere else let's talk about one of
my favorite lipstick formulas this is
the bite to beauty of Musa Bush lipstick
my favorite shade is called honeycomb
this is my go-to perfect nude
these are $26 and I personally think
they should be 19 nobody wants to
purchase these at $26 if you've tried
the formula before you really get into
it and you're like yeah I'll buy
multiples are all good like the little
deluxe sizes but most people would not
want to go and spend $26 on just a
bullet lipstick like this so wow I am a
huge fan of buy beauty I really do think
they could make a lot more sales and be
much more of a popular brand if they did
lower some of their prices so I do love
this formula I would continue to
purchase but I wish these were $19 a
piece instead of twenty six up next I
want to talk about one of my all-time
favorite mascaras this is a Marc Jacobs
the Velvet noir mascara the full size
actually retails for $26 and again I
feel like this should be nineteen in
fact I feel like a lot of high-end
mascaras Too Faced better than sex steal
a huge extreme mascara all of those
should it be in the 15 to $19 range
and I know some people would disagree
with me because you can go to the
drugstore now and literally find
mascaras for 13 14 15 dollars but 19
would be perfect for this this is almost
$30 and I feel like a lot of people
don't want to try this mascara because
of the price I mean even Urban Decay
perversion that's all the way up there
in the 20s as well so I per
we would reprice this I think a lot of
people would not - but for me I'm gonna
go ahead and say I will give this a
negative finally guys I know you have
heard me talk about violet vaathiyar
overpriced right here we have to be ride
or die pallet you get a lot of different
finishes and colors and shades in here
but unfortunately this is a $75
eyeshadow palette that is really really
up there in price especially considering
this is not a luxury brand in any way
shape or form well like do you really
enjoy this palette I will say all of
I'll applause eyeshadow palettes in my
opinion who go down at least I would say
a good ten dollars so normally there I
shadow palettes are at forty five I
would put those ones down to 35 or even
40 just that extra five dollars off
seems like it would be a little more
worth it because they don't necessarily
use the best ingredients in these
shadows they're a little more cheap
they're not like a morphe cheap okay but
they definitely tend to be a little bit
on the cheaper side you can tell the
difference between the matte shadows in
here and say like I'm Marc Jacobs a
matte shadow I recently got my very
first Marc Jacobs eyeshadow palette I'm
incredibly impressed
one thing that vinyl Fausto's are very
very well are their foils ok these are
really really good tonight.a foils are
their foiled shadows they are super
super beautiful very high pigmentation
really nice for the lower lash line as
well as all over the lid but I
definitely think this guy right here
should not be 75 it should be 60 and
then as far as their regular eyeshadow
palettes are concerned I would say 35 or
48 not 45 so that is it for repricing
popular of beauty products I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I definitely
will have a part 3 coming up very soon
for you guys thanks so much for joining
me and I'll see you guys on Friday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
