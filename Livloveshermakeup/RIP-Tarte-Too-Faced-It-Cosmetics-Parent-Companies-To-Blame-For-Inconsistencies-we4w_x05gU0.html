today's video is going to be a
conspiracy video no it's not you see I
don't really know this is going to be
called a tryst in peace heart campus and
it cosmetics it really should just be
called rest in peace new face okay
because they are digging themselves a
Greg right now seriously um basically
today we're going to be talking about
parent companies I wanted to talk about
this for a while I don't feel like I'm
super educated on the topic and I didn't
want to come off like as a rambling mess
but you know what you guys requested it
so I'm going to give you the information
that I can I did go ahead and write down
a few little notes on my phone so I can
stay focused and not feel like you
two-faced as you guys know me lately I
have been my parent with Too Faced in
charge but yeah so basically we're going
to talk about it cosmetics which I feel
like is not really too bad yet but if
you didn't know they were sold to
L'Oreal about a year ago and I have
noticed recently like the amount of
products that they are releasing is
absolutely insane I do feel like they
belong on this list they're not as bad
as tart into face as far as being
inconsistent is concerned but I did want
to go ahead and put it on your radar
just so you guys know but they were
bought out and just you guys know you
know when you're seeing all these new
products and all the stuff on QVC
basically what's going on there because
they're mass producing products all the
time now so anyway let me tell you what
is the parent company so Google says a
parent company is a company that owns
enough of a brand to be able to control
management so let me explain it a little
better this is the parent company say
this is Estee Lauder okay underneath we
have a cute little umbrella and then
underneath the umbrella you're a bunch
of little baby brands licked your face
so you know they bought out to face so
two faces below them now basically it's
kind of like if you were a parent and
you have like a child
but the umbrella would be like the rules
so you know the kid has to ask hey can I
have some candy mom can I sleep over and
my friend's house tonight you know you
have to ask for permission I really
about the best way to describe a parent
company is that they pretty much own
your ass like it doesn't matter how much
of the brand be acquired they do kind of
own your ass because you have to go and
ask for permission for certain things
and they are below you see they're
underneath the umbrella so parent
companies tend to own a lot of different
brands
especially Estee Lauder and L'Oreal
those guys are huge they buy so many so
many little small companies and brands
and all that kind of stuff so anyway
that is the best way to describe it
basically here is the parent company he
has a little umbrella a little safety
whatever year and then underneath you
have all these little brands so they
have to go up and say okay can I do that
can I do that so it's basically like yet
you told you ran so anyway let me give
you some background information on like
cruelty free status so all three brands
are cruelty free on but they did sell to
parent companies that do test on animals
now it's very hard at now these to find
a parent company that doesn't test on
animals Jose is the Japanese one that
Tarts little too they test on animals
estee lauder does L'Oreal L'Oreal and
Estee Lauder supposedly are known for
having like really really bad like
testing areas and facilities I've seen
some images before that way I really
wish I could unsee that we're not going
to tell you guys to go look at any of
that because you don't want to see it
you know I mean it's just such a
horrible thing it's good to see it but
at the same time it's really really
horrible so I mean I kind of have a bad
taste in my mouth with Estee Lauder and
L'Oreal right now because I am going and
transitioning into cruelty free now
because the parent company does tests on
animals a lot of people will say you
know what that means that to face it
cosmetics and Tarte cosmetics are no
longer cruelty free and the reason why
they say that is because when you pay
for a palette you know it's going to go
in and then if you go all the way up to
like we said the parent company so you
basically are putting money in the
pockets of a parent company that does
tests on animals I really don't like the
thought of being associated with that
but at the same time another way to look
at it is that you know they have a bunch
of little brands under their umbrella
right if they notice a certain brand is
doing really well and they happen to be
cruelty free me people maybe they'll pay
attention I don't know it hasn't really
happened yet but a lot of people say you
know what as long as the product itself
is not tested on an animal I'm okay with
purchasing it so yes no matter what
you're going to be putting at some money
in qsa Lauder loriel you know co-pays
pockets and they do tests on animals but
the product that you have in your hand
you know that that was not tested on
ah and I think that is good enough for
me right now all right so anyway let me
tell you basically the numbers here like
how much they bought them for cause it's
ridiculous
L'Oreal Bato it cosmetics in July 2016
for 1.2 billion dollars now Estee Lauder
about out to face in November 2016 for
one point four five billion dollars that
was huge it was absolutely huge and then
Cote or Cody I think it's cause a bonnet
or cosmetics in March 2014 this was
quite a while ago for one point four
five million I'm sorry 135 million
dollars yeah they didn't get into the
billions there so basically the question
is was it worth it was it worth it for
the brands to do that I have four little
points here that I want to talk about
and I try not to get to like I think
it's a fee but I really think that this
is an important discussion I want to
know what you guys think do you agree
that a lot of this has to do with the
parent could be I mean I know like a
look at your face right now and Jared's
been an apple and all the drama and
stuff obviously that has nothing to do
with the parent company but the
consistency the products you know does
the has nothing to do with the parent
company are they just pushing out new
stuff all the time it's something to
think about so the first thing I want to
talk about is quality of product has
changed on newer releases does this mean
older products will suffer as well so I
noticed this especially with chart and
to face to face right now like their
eyeshadow palettes oh I think the past
few that I have picked up a 9pn palette
and then the natural love were really
really not good for me and you know it
needs to be back in the day I could
purchase from Too Faced and I was super
excited because I would maybe get one
bad palette a year you know what I mean
I love the 9 pan palette formula the one
that they released before the peanut
butter and honey would be totally cute
which was one of the best formulas for
the 9 pan palette like ever they updated
it you know and then they come out with
their peanut butter and honey and was
horrible
it was horrible no pigmentation really
doesn't work on a lot of different skin
tones even on my fair complexion skin I
felt like the colors didn't even show up
that much Chucky did not like it
and you don't like the natural love
palette the darker shades all glitter
infuse chunky they looked horrible on my
eyes I'm no makeup artist but I have
been trying to learn a little more about
the limping and all that kind of stuff
and I just could not get those to work
either so for me to face is like the
biggest culprit of this I feel like
right now I'm very scared to be
purchasing from them especially from
their website because they say they'll
take returns but they would not take my
natural love palette back so I can go
ahead and declutter that but yeah also
into her cosmetics it's hard for the
past three years
I mean God like you know I just think
apart I'm like okay think of like
eyeshadow palettes that they have I just
think of one big blob I feel like
everything that tort releases as far as
eyeshadow is concerned is kind of the
same now I love the rainforest of the
sea i shadow formula that's like a new
kind of foiled finish I also really love
it the Tarte what is it totally in bloom
palette but I will say the majority of
palettes I had decluttered out of my
collection the past three or four years
I used to buy chart when I was in high
school
I never had this issue now I know that
my friend Alessandra did tell me that
their new unicorn collection is really
really fantastic and again I'm done
Jared you know he's in there like I
there's no unicorns in there in the
rainforest in the Amazon whatever is to
come on what is wrong with you I
seriously didn't in everybody's business
but yeah so basically they had their
unicorn collection I was too scared to
purchase it I was just too scared
because I hate being let down by Too
Faced and its heart and at this point
like I get pissed I think it's
pissed and I'm go ahead and throw up in
my cards like consistent versus
unreliable makeup brands video because I
sold that back in January I've been
talking about torte and Tuesday for a
while now on my channel and how
everything is a hitter gets in my
opinion and I just feel like that is
still going on with targets well so yes
that is the first thing I want to talk
about quality of products now does this
mean older products will suffer as well
so these older products these og
products that we all love like I love my
natural eye palette knife and palette
from Too Faced when I repurchase is it
going to be a new formula you know is it
going to be something different I don't
 know and that really really
scares me and I know it scares a lot of
you as well
one of you told me that you had picked
up like a milk chocolate bronzer
chocolate Soleil bronzer and you said it
was completely different than the one
you had before that scared me that
really really scares me and I think that
is so unfair and not cool if you have a
good formula just continue with it you
know what I mean so anyway that is the
first thing now in number two marketing
is through the roof
total overkill so I feel like the
brand's market in a different way
tarts does it in this kind of let's use
influencers to show our products and get
people to go buy them like they take
them on these you know special not
retreats but you know they think of all
these trips to Bora Bora and all these
kind of places not wonderful every time
I talk about this everybody's like
you'll just tell us that you're not
there no I would actually turn it down
if they were to ask me to go to Bora
Bora I would say no you want to know why
because they're probably having these
people sign into contracts where they're
literally saying oh yes I will say I
love absolutely every single product and
when a brand is paying for you to stay
at a nice like resort like that you know
you're jumping out of helicopters you're
going like boogie-boarding up let me
know what thank you but you are more
inclined to want to give a positive
review and that is why I'm never going
to put myself into that situation that
is another reason why I have yet to have
done a sponsor video on my channel and I
probably won't because I do think I do
believe that like no matter how honest
you are when a brand is like oh here
here's some money you know your mind
kind of changes a little bit and I would
like to think that mine wouldn't but I'm
not going to go there you know and I I'm
not trying to say like oh my could be
bought out for money but you guys know
what I need we have all watched those
youtubers we're back in the day you felt
like you could trust them and then
suddenly it's like oh every single video
is sponsored and it changes people it
changes people I've thought about it
before but sponsored content goes for a
very high price on YouTube like way more
than you make from just like click view
you know what I mean so it's very
tempting but I don't know this whole
thing would tart the way they do their
PR it's like nobody will say anything
bad because they all want to go back
and I'm sure that some of the problem
may be some of the products are good but
you know I trade someone eat our
products out you guys so many chart
products and I'll go ahead and throw up
in the cards my product sales list or my
playlist I just it's hit or miss it's
hit or miss and I don't like the way
that they do the whole marketing thing I
don't like the Bora Bora trip I don't
like all that kind of stuff we'd be
doing a video for you guys doing
tripping with heart or brain wash with
chart all right and then as far as
two-face is concerned cause it's like
those cringy commercials like the same
thing as Maybelline right now you know
where they have like the influencers and
it's like all super awkward and like oh
my god you're definitely not an actor no
shade seriously it's just you cannot
agree after you're not a collector it's
okay now I feel that way about some of
these like peach commercials
I loved the candy Johnson better than
sex like mermaid bathtub all the little
like the commercial for that was so cute
but now it's just like this peach thing
be cake beige and it's like oh she's
picking a peach and I'm like oh my god
okay peach we get it you like peaches
you know what I mean so yeah not into
that and as far as Cosmetics is
concerned I know a lot of people say
they've been really pushing a lot of
stuff on QVC I don't go on there often
enough to be able to really see that but
I have people a lot of kids you know pop
up all over the place so that goes into
you at number three huge amounts of new
releases practically every two to three
months definitely it cosmetics I don't
know if you guys have noticed this and
this is one of those brands is starting
to kind of make their way into this
group they're not an ID yet but they're
kind of making their way in now I
haven't noticed any difference in their
products yet but I will say I am just
surprised by how much they're
releasing you know they never used to
release as much I know that they do
these QVC deals but they always had you
know like permanent items from their
collection now it's like new foundation
new celebration new bubble buy like I
can't keep up with all the foundations
that they're releasing confidence in a
creamy powder buffa block confidence in
a cream container eye cream I just
really can't keep up to be completely
honest and I am someone who literally go
to the sephora.com website and looks up
new releases but there's something about
like a cosmetics or an aldose really
okay calm down you know what I mean I
feel like I can't get excited when
they're just pushing so much new stuff
and of course that has to go over to
face as well you know they had the
peanut butter and honey a month later
they have the natural love and then in a
couple of months here we're going to be
getting a huge collection from candy
Johnson that I want candy I love candy
oh my gosh it's an edgy salad but yeah
so that is not very spread out that
means they are really putting this
together pretty quickly huge quantities
and I am a true believer in that you
know the bigger the quantity the less
likely every single pallet is going to
be perfect and I mean I don't think I've
ever had a truly perfect pallet no you
know what my natural eye palette from
Too Faced was perfect now I'm scared to
buy a new one but that one was perfect
you know I mean it's just so sad that
they change up their formulas an ideal
is like what what why if people love it
like why I don't understand why they
haven't done more chocolate bar palette
like those are so let everybody love
those I know they're into the sweet
peach thing now but sweet peach did not
do nearly as well as the chocolate bar
you know what I mean is just so
ridiculous but anyway okay I have to
look back at my phone okay
practically every two to three months
okay get myself back on track so yeah
peanut butter and honey natural love in
a few months we're gonna be getting a
bunch a new palette glitter bomb palette
that's like five releases in like four
or five months that's basically every
single month a new eyes shadow palette
and in between they've been releasing
new sheets of lipsticks and their
collection for they're really
uncomfortable liquid lipsticks and all
that kind of stuff but I'm very
concerned seeing a new palette every
single month especially an eyeshadow
palette from Too Faced I'm a big
believer that they need to spend some
time on their eyeshadow palettes because
the ones that I guess it's just kind of
like both surprise this is a new thing
it will be available also next week
those end up being the ones that
they kind of Keys like on Instagram and
they're like oh it will be coming in a
year or so those are always good quality
so I just don't trust this stuff and I'm
not going to pick up that candy Johnson
collection I just I love candy Johnson
she's such a good human being and
I am just a slightly concerned about her
working with two-faced to be completely
honest
alright guys and finally let's talk
about the view that thing too much a
repetition will start with parts like a
bit sorry literally every single
eyeshadow palette looks the same I went
on Instagram today and I saw yet another
neutral eye palette and I went oh I have
that one in my collection
oh no I don't it's new doesn't look too
same old shades you know I don't know if
it's the Amazonian clay formula which I
love as sure as hell isn't the
rainforest of the sea formula which like
why are you not releasing more of those
the rainforest of the sea collection was
damn good and like I said my friend
Alexander told me if that's the unicorn
collection was good as well
I'm not saying that they don't believe
good parks you know Tuesday seems to be
my favorite brand they used to release
good stuff Tarte does too they have good
products but it's so hard to purchase
from a brand and be like okay I'm going
to give this eyeshadow palettes like
okay okay calm down calm down you know
it might be good it might be good I
shouldn't have to think that I should be
thinking it could be excellent
it's going to be amazing I love it and
that is not how I feel about turn and to
face you know so too much repetition and
as far as you know just a color
selection for Tarte I know they're all
about like the Amazonian clay neutrals
or whatever yeah because their
uniform collection they went into
colorful stuff more colorful stuff more
of the foiled formula I would like to
see more and not like everyday friendly
palette I know that sounds kind of silly
but like I would say smoky palette I
want to see just like a straight-up
smoky palette from Tarte I'm so sick of
seeing like the same colors over and
over and over again and it's just like
it doesn't interest me it doesn't get me
excited I don't know if it gets you
excited but um as far as two-face is
concerned peaches peaches peaches like
they have literally turns me off from
everything peach related I have is the
blush and then the little highlighting
trio or whatever I was not impressed
with the peach collection okay first of
all I had to wait in line for like two
 hours some people are reading it
for like six hours I'm not saying ah
how's your weight there I think get your
 together get your website together
you know what I mean is just so
ridiculous to me and they Highfill this
stuff up and they're like whole our
website crash will of course
look how much you hyped it up you know I
love that they do the scented bang you
know that's really really fun but I
swear God if I get another pallet it
smells like peaches I am going
to punch a peach I don't know I just
cannot deal with the thought of any more
descent I opened up the sweet glow kit
the other day which I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna declutter and I was like it's just
like I took a whiff of it and I thought
of like the new palette that they're
releasing which is like a matte peach
palette and I'm just can you
stop with the peach okay and now they're
doing peaches and cream you know they
are trying to melt the out of that
and I don't know if it's to face or if
it's the parent company I feel like it's
kind of a state lauder as well that's
like let's note the out of this
because people seem to really love it
but yeah I'm sick of it I'm sick of the
repetition with charts as far as colors
are concerned I'm a sick of the
repetition with two faces hard you know
 peaches I'm done with peaches
like I want more chocolate bar palette
we're in that good quality you know they
came out with a little mini chocolate
chip palace I didn't like the chocolate
chip with the matte one but I loved the
white chocolate chip for my particular
complexion because I'm super fair but
like why not make a big chocolate bar
palette again like white why'd you have
to do peaches like I feel like they're
going to go boom no berries and cream
now and then like cream and cream and
then raspberries and cream and then
second I don't know they'll probably
start peach over again and I'm just like
I'm done like I'm done with it
so will not be purchasing anything peach
related I'm not getting that new
eyeshadow palette the thing about that
picture that I saw from trend booth was
you could not see the actual like
itching on the shadow they look super
soft and buttery but like I feel like I
know two feeds well enough to know that
there's like little lines kind of
imprinted on the top there and that will
be able to tell me just from seeing an
up-close photo if it is going to be
there smooth buttery matte formula or
their piece-of-shit
formula so anyway guys sorry if I'm like
swallowing a lot and stuff like that I
had a gig last night totally like hurt
my joints and uh oh I just feel like I'm
freaking choking I'm only my voice I
sigh yeah I hope you enjoyed this video
I know it's very chatty but I just
wanted to get this off my chest you know
I'm not trying to give you back fear
this is just my conspiracy and
this is just me talking about being a
consumer and being slightly annoyed I'm
not trying to go overboard and so it's
 you to face even home so cute
little toys but yeah let me know what
you think do you think of that when
these parent companies acquired these
smaller brands do you think that they
changed have you noticed it I have
noticed it with chart from the past
three years especially like their
holiday collections forget about it cute
face definitely notice a change this
year and it cosmetics have announced a
change with their products yet but for
sure the amount of products what they're
releasing is kind of ridiculous right
now how can you get excited about a
product when it's like oh get excited
about this and then the next day there's
something else is present what I can't
keep up so anyway let me know your
thoughts down below thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
