wanted to jump on here really quick yes
I do have so watches all over my arm you
guys will be seeing some more reviews
and comparisons probably today and
tomorrow and the next day but yeah I'd
like to jump on here really quickly
before I leave with my dad to drive to
Minneapolis I've not even filled in my
brows today a mouth is all dry look like
a massive but I wanted to give you guys
a little bit of like a health update so
we're gonna be talking about mental
health as well as like physical health
I've been getting a lot of questions
lately about like I don't want to say
mental health because ADHD I mean yes it
is like a mental thing but at the same
time I don't want to make it sound like
a YouTube huge deal because I do have it
under control but I have been noticing a
lot lately in the comments section just
some really well first of all brood
people just being like oh my god like
shut the out you talk too fast have
you just snorted two lines of cocaine
you know stuff like that which is like
alright whatever but also just people
like trying to give me advice on like
how to talk slower how to take breaths
how to do all this kind of stuff and I
just thought it would be better for me
to come on here because I do have new
subscribers and kind of explain to you
guys a little more about my ADHD I have
done a video on my ADHD before but it
was years ago like literally a year and
a half ago so I thought I would just
talk about it a little more because
there has been a change as far as my
ADHD is concerned so one of the things
on YouTube but there really gets me
going is when people do talk about how
fast I talk how I go and take big
breasts and things like that so first of
all I just want to say really quickly I
am a professional flutist and I don't
want to only blame it on that because I
believe it is also me and also the ADHD
but I take large breaths that is just
how I've been trained I went through
four years of conservatory I've been
playing flute since I was 12 years old I
do take very large breasts when I take a
breath with flute I don't go through my
nose I go and I fill my lungs up okay so
I can't help it
a lot of the time when I'm talking I am
taking large breaths and then I go and I
go and I go without breathing that's
just what I'm used to doing when I'm
actually playing my flute so I want to
talk about that really quickly also
about the fact that you know I like
swallow a little bit when I'm talking
and things like that this is all related
to yes how fast I talk but also that is
related to my ADHD so I
was diagnosed with ADHD when I was very
very young we tried a lot of different
methods on how to work with it one thing
I will say about my ADHD that I love is
that I always feel good like even if I'm
not on my medication I have a good
outlook on life I feel happy that's just
who I am as a person and I know that on
YouTube a lot of the times and that
comes off as being fake or phony or
people say oh my god the way you talk
you're trying to be this you're trying
to be that I'm not I mean if you watch
me like on snapchat or stuff like that I
mean every other word that comes out of
my mouth
it's practically a swear word okay like
I I swear like a sailor I have some
attitude I have a little bit of fiery
nice going on there but for the most
part yes I'm a happy person and a lot of
that has to do with just who I am as a
person but also it has to do with my
ADHD I recently have put my dosage down
from 20 milligrams which by the way I
used to take 75 milligrams of medication
okay so we have been working our way
down and basically I'm down to 10
milligrams now this is been this has
been really really difficult for me
because it happened about we can have
two weeks ago right before I filmed my
review on the chocolate chip palette
which just so happened to hit a lot a
lot a lot of views and you can go in
that comment section and you can see
lots people saying like take a
breaths Jesus like what's wrong with you
did you just snort cocaine you know this
and that and I don't think that's
anything to joke about you know people
who have actually had addictions and
things like that I don't think it's okay
to joke about stuff like that first of
all and second of all um you know just
as someone's happy and talks fast and is
excitable like I am does not mean that
we're like on drugs I want to tell you
right off the bat people who do not have
ADHD who take a prescription like
adderall or Ritalin or something like
that you will get high off of it people
like you people like me who actually
have it we calm down it actually calms
us down so when people are saying things
like oh my god did you just drink ten
cups of coffee and this and that like
that's cute I'm okay with that or even
people who say like oh you talk fast
that's really cute I'm totally fine with
that but one thing on YouTube that does
affect me is when people get really rude
about it and then I explained to them I
have ADHD and they just like will say
lol or Oh
funnier this or that and I think ADHD is
one of those one of those things where
people think it's fun and it's funny
because I'm always hyper and I'm always
happy and this and that and of course I
have my bad days but if I had a bad day
and I didn't take my medication I
probably would have a better outlook on
the whole situation now that's not -
because I'm just happy that is also
because people who do have ADHD we have
so much adrenaline pumping all the time
okay I feel like sometimes I'm almost in
a manic state and it's hard to feel sad
or hard to feel mad okay so I just
wanted to put that out there because you
know yes I do tend to be a little bit of
an eternal optimist and a lot of that
has to do with who I am as a person and
when I don't take my meds and also when
I do take my meds I still feel like
there is a part of me there and you know
there are so many things on YouTube that
don't bother me people saying oh you do
your makeup horribly oh your lips look
like this oh you look like that oh god
you're spitting on the camera I'm like I
really don't give a flying I don't
know if you guys have noticed but I tend
to be a lot more laid back on my channel
when I first started my channel I was so
nervous I thought I had to act like
everyone else and do this and do that
and then I realized you know what
it okay we need something different on
here you know you can only watch so much
on the same thing and I'm so sick of
watching overly edit videos everyone
acting perfect all the time and nobody
is perfect I'm not perfect it's not in
my opinion a very good thing to come off
that way and then be completely
different on the other side because you
know young girls watch us especially
like the beauty channels a lot of huge
percentage of people that watch us are
like in high school you know teens
people that really really when they see
a video like that where everything's
perfect and everything's this and
everything is that and they see we're in
fake eyelashes in perfect hair and this
and that they think that's maybe what I
need to look like her this or that I
won't get into I won't get into that but
I like to just keep it real on my
channel first of all because this is not
what I do for a living I don't have any
interest in doing this for a living
flute is where my life is that which is
one of the big reasons why when people
say oh my god you're gasping for air
which is why I'm not gonna change it
because if I were to lose that I loved
everything to me okay so yeah I just
kind of wanted to touch on that I feel
like I'm already rambling but I wanted
to touch on that
kind of explain to you guys a little bit
why I am kind of in a hurry a lot and
why I talk kind of fast and things like
that and you know I get very excited
about makeup I get very excited about a
lot of things right now I feel a little
more calm because I'm just looking into
the camera there is no makeup in front
of me I am getting slightly distracted
by these beautiful swatches on my hands
but besides that I'm not holding
something I'm not doing this I'm not
doing that I like to get my point across
and I think you guys can tell when I
hate something or when I love something
and you know I just I just wanted to say
to some of the haters or the people that
keep repeating and saying oh my god slow
down and this and that
this is Who I am as a person and I don't
know what the deal is with leaving that
comments like just just unsubscribe
don't watch my channel don't do it you
know everybody is different and you know
I'm not on speed I'm not on this I'm not
on that yes technically you could say oh
you're on ADHD medication you're on
speed but guess what it slows me down it
slows me down I have never ever been on
camera without medication completely I
think there's maybe been once or twice
so many people laughing in the comments
section I actually thought it was funny
watching it back I was just all over the
place but let me tell you if you think
I'm talking fast now and doing all that
kind of stuff you should see me without
the meds so it's just who I am as a
person I appreciate people saying oh
learn how to take a better breaths or
this or that I'm like well wait a minute
I went to conservatory to learn how to
train my breasts and do all this kind of
stuff and I am right in the prime of
like my career as far as music is
concerned so literally training myself
to take more breaths or do this or do
that or start breathing through my nose
like that could technically kind of
things up because when you are
practicing your Instagram you are just
you're so focused in on the music that
you're not focused in on breathing and
doing all that stuff at the same time
that has just been a habit that has
formed and I am so willing to keep that
habit because music is everything to me
so I just wanted to put that out there
I'm not trying to play a victim
available I have ADHD because you know
what there are good things too ADHD too
if I don't take my meds I can stay away
for like 48 hours and not that that's a
good thing but if I need to I can do
that I have abundance of energy I have a
lot of energy a lot of you say how do
you do it how do you work full time how
do you teach how do you do gigs and
posts you know I have a lot of energy
that's just who I am as a person it's
great I love it when I take my meds I
calm down I just took my meds they just
started kicking in and I feel like I'm a
lot more calm right now so a lot of the
times also in the morning when you guys
are seeing me I will take my meds I you
know get ready in the morning let mr.
badger out and then I sit down and
sometimes my beds aren't completely
kicked in so if I seem a little Spacey
or if I'm repeating myself a lot you
know there there is a reason for that
and again I don't want to play victim
and be like oh whoo blah blah blah I am
somebody who's all about living up to
owning things you know only things like
if you feel like you did something just
say okay I did it like I'm not gonna
play victim and try and get your
sympathy that is not what this channel
is about so yeah I just kind of wanted
to talk about that very briefly like I
said I have lowered my dosage and I have
noticed a difference I've been having
really bad insomnia of being about four
hours of sleep a night because I just
want to be awake all the time when my
meds start to wear off I'm just all over
the place like hanging off the wall you
know and a lot of people think it's
funny but it's hard it's so hard you
guys you know working full-time and
doing all this stuff and then coming
home and feeling mentally exhausted and
then just laying down and your body's
twitching and you're shaking and you
can't sleep you know so and that is
definitely difficult you know I love
getting on in the morning and posting
and doing things like that I don't like
coming home and filming after a full day
of music the last thing I want to think
about is makeup I'm excited about makeup
in the morning which is why some days I
won't post because I'll come home late
at night from work and then I come on
camera and I am so preoccupied with my
students and what went on with music
today that I don't want to think about
makeup it is not my thing I'm not a
makeup artist I'm not in love with
makeup
I am totally a beauty addict but I am
obsessed with music I'm obsessed with my
flute you know I would gladly clear out
my whole entire makeup collection to
keep my flute you know what I mean so
anyway I just wanted to put that out
there as far as lupus is concerned
everything is going pretty well I do
have two more months of
trial left right now I'm dealing with
like a big batch of cold sores and it's
really hard because every time I get the
lupus shocked I end up getting cold
sores and it's been really bad this time
I think I'm continuously reinfecting
myself with my flute head joint but I
mean using rubbing alcohol on that and
all this kind of stuff is just it's
ridiculous it's very hard to practice
when your lips look like this and I also
come on camera cuz people are like oh my
god do you have herpes it's like no but
anyway that's all the other thing I'm
sorry guys I don't mean to be like
all the haters but seriously kind of
 you um most of the comments that I
get from haters make me laugh and I am
kind of got a little bit of a heated
side to me and I do sometimes twirl them
back and I know some of you find that
entertaining sometimes I kind of feel
like I'm being a little aggressive and
I'm like you know don't like bully them
you know but at the same time if
someone's gonna say you know you I
hate your eyebrows you look horrible
don't expect me to say thanks for
watching or whatever no in real life I
wouldn't say oh I'm so sorry you don't
like my eyebrows let me go fill them in
I would say uh why why would I care why
do I care what you think you know just
stuff like that so I mean it's yeah
related to lupus stuff kind of comes
into the ADHD and the lupus all kind of
combined and there's been certain things
that have been talked about on my
channel this year like my hair what's
going on with my hair and you know
sometimes my eyebrows are shedding and
this and that and you know I come onto
camera and I'm really just not
embarrassed to show my true personality
and spit on the camera if I need to if I
start talking you know whatever I always
upload the video I take one take if that
one tape doesn't work that's why I don't
jump back on camera and start it again
because you start the camera you say hey
guys so welcome back to my channel the
second you mess up or something happens
you turn it back off then you turn it
back on again and then you're just like
hey guys welcome back to my channel you
know it's super it's like acting and I
have never thought about my channel is
like being someone else or acting a
certain way I don't want this effort to
come back and bite me in the ass you
know I have a very strong personality I
do consider myself to be a nice person I
try and be a good nice person but
I do also have a little bit of a heated
side to me and if people do kind of come
after me I jump on them a little quickly
now most of the time like I said when
it's related to lupus when it's related
to health mental health I get I I feel
offended and I think a lot of anger
comes from a place of hurt but other
little comments here and there I know
some of you have been worried I've been
getting a little more hate on my channel
recently please don't worry you guys
that kind of stuff doesn't bother me
I mean I don't mean to say oh I went to
conservatory I'm so special but I have
you guys ever seen the movie yeah what
is it called whiplash go watch that very
similar to a conservatory experience in
my eyes so this is like nothing compared
to what I have gone through with music
and things like that I've been told no
so many times I've been told you're not
good enough so many times and I'm just
kind of like numb to that sensation
which again isn't a great thing but at
the same time there are things that
affect me things that I am like you know
I have ADHD I have lupus there's certain
things I can't change it hurts my
feelings and I think you know a lot of
people come on here let's read some hate
comments oh that's funny but at the same
time you know you know I feel like a lot
of people do hit bad wires and they
insult someone without even knowing it
and you know like I said I'm on camera
today my hair is greasy you know my
makeup my lips are all gross and whatnot
I'm not gonna sit here and say oh please
excuse this and please excuse that and
sometimes I do that but at other times
I'm just like why do I do that you know
if I'm comfortable with being on camera
like this then I don't care what you you
know what people think I don't say where
you guys think but you know what people
think but when it comes to the ADHD and
the lupus I do care I care a big time
you know the hair thing because really
really bad scarring right now on my
scalp so embarrassing everyone saying oh
just let your hair down once or twice
and immediately I'm insulted and I'm
trying not to be like that because I'm
like of course they don't mean it in a
bad way but it's just so hard you know I
cry when I shampoo my hair I literally
cry when I shampoo my hair because I
have scabs breaking open and I I don't
want to go too much in depth about it
but it's very painful so overall the
Lupus thing I'm sorry I'm totally
digressing this me bear
rambly but the Lupus thing is going
about like two more months left on my
trial if you didn't know I'm doing an
experimental trial for my lupus I do
plan on making a video all about my
lupus very soon I want to be that strong
person that says oh yeah I'll do it and
I'm strong and this and that but lupus
makes me feel weak as okay I cry
all the time during flare-ups I feel
ugly I feel gross I feel whatever I got
my shot you know two days ago and got
this thing going on with my lips and
this and that and most of the time I am
a hundred percent comfortable in my skin
but there are certain things that make
me uncomfortable just like everybody in
the world you guys okay so just wanted
to come on your kind of talk about that
I haven't been gained as much like
rashes on my body which is awesome
because although you know I claim to be
I'm so comfortable with myself there is
a part of me obviously I like to do
beauty vlogging and whatnot I love
makeup I I don't want my skin to look
like I don't want my hair to look
like
but unfortunately lupus attacks the you
know organs which it would be worse if
it wasn't attacking my internal organs
which update on my liver liver is in
good shape now tea is starting to
regenerate but the outer stuff does
still bother me like you don't want to
wake up and have a huge rash on your
face it's gross I don't like coming on
camera like that I don't think I ever
have so if you're wondering why I just
disappear for a week when I'm actually
in a lupus flares probably because I am
self-conscious about what's going on you
know I get scabbing on my face and you
know I'm so lucky that everything heals
up and that I do have a autoimmune
condition that only comes in flares
because there are people that you know
and I always keep in mind that there are
people out there that are suffering more
there are kids that are starving you
know I just there's so much worse things
in the world but you know that is an
area where I baby myself because you
know it's hard you know sometimes coming
on camera especially if I'm not feeling
too well and saying oh I love this and
it looks so great on my skin but I have
like stuff going on or this earth
so although I am very very comfortable
in my skin related to lupus and also
ADHD yeah that's where it hits me that's
where it hurts when people say stuff
like that so anyway um yeah lupus is
good ADHD working on that right now I
almost feel like I do want to jump back
up in my dosage I'm like right now like
I said I took my meds about thirty
minutes ago I feel super calm but it
starts to wear off
that's what meds do I used to take four
doses a day in the morning at lunch at
dinner and then before I went to bed
before I went to bed it would put me to
sleep and I don't have that anymore and
I'm trying to deal with Who I am as a
person and who I am as a person is just
you know sometimes I'm like well Jesus
like do you do you feel stuff sometimes
because I feel like if I don't take my
meds I'm just I'm very happy and that's
also the way to complain about but I
can't seem to feel a lot of anger or
sadness and that's also not a good thing
that is one of the reasons why I do
believe in taking my medication because
it evens me out and I'm not in a manic
kind of state basically so yeah I just
wanted to go ahead and put that out
there kind of give you guys a little bit
of info maybe new subscribers and then
also old subscribers just kind of update
you on the lupus I'm hoping that these
flares are gonna slow down they have
slowed down significantly the shots have
been horrible I get super like
constipated and also I puke all the time
and this and that when I do get it like
the day of but I really appreciate you
guys being so supportive and sweet about
it and I do think that this is going to
make a difference so yeah anyway like I
said I will make a lupus video when I'm
ready I don't want to come on and
pretend to be this strong woman about
lupus when I'm not like it makes me feel
like a little coward and a baby and I
feel very withdrawn when I am in
flare-ups which is why I don't show my
face for a week you know and a lot of
that is emotional too you know the
rashes may clear up and then I just
don't want to go on camera because I
just feel like and if you're gonna
tell yourself hey you're gonna feel like
 you're gonna feel like and I
find that even if I stop taking my ADHD
medication during flare-ups it's like it
affects my mind in a way that I don't
have that energy my normal self to
back up on if that makes sense so yeah
anyway that's that's about it so this is
so rambley and I really apologize if I'm
all over the place but I just wanted to
give some insight tell you guys how I'm
feeling right now and if you do update
it excuse me if you do want an updated
see my breathing
let me try nose breathing's if you do
want an updated video on ADHD let me
know as well I did one like I said about
a year and a half ago and I get so many
comments on that video you know people
saying oh that's not what you have this
is what you have well that's not what
you have this is what you have when it
comes to health
please don't diagnose people in the
comment section I mean yes we can all
sit there and watch like I don't know
Trisha Paytas who I feel like is having
a mental breakdown right now we could be
like she needs to see there but she
needs to do this she needs to do that
but it's very very it affects people
when you say things like that this is
not stuff to joke around about and I've
been misdiagnosed so many times people
thought I had just so many different
things like growing up and this and that
and I've been misdiagnosed so many times
to know that the drugs that you take
when you're on when you do have a
certain condition are nothing to
around with you know what I mean
yeah I was diagnosed with bipolar yeah
they thought I was bipolar because
sometimes I would be in a depressive
state and sometimes I would be super
super manic but that was just me going
through the day without medication
feeling certain things and they were
saying extreme mania you know extreme
and manic behavior and I just feel like
so many people are misdiagnosed like if
someone is really really hyper and
you're shaking a lot and you're moving a
line you're breathing heavily and you're
talking super fast and you know things
like that there is a chance you know and
you can't concentrate very well there is
a chance that you may have ADHD and I
you know what the ADHD thing has been a
bad also yeah anyway I don't really
sorry I just like gazing off right now I
don't really know what else to say you
just want to come on here really raw
I always come on hit really wrong you
guys know you don't edit my videos
because I don't ever like I feel like I
see all these like youtubers getting
exposed nowadays for things they said on
their snapchat and then you know they
act a different way on YouTube I never
want to be that
I don't want to be that person that's
like Oh Olivia got exposed she swears
like you know on her snapchat but
doesn't on YouTube know if I want to say
 I'm gonna say you know I want
you guys to see the real me on camera in
person in real life so if you've ever
met me you would know what to expect you
know I don't want to be phony or fake
and I think that starts to happen when
this is you're living and I I believe in
that you have to be careful if this is
what you do for a living and this is
where you're making your money you
should be having you know the highest
quality production someone said to me a
few months ago I feel like you produce
more quantity than quality and I said I
absolutely agree I'm all about quantity
over quality I do not edit my videos I
do not do anything special for you guys
really I still need to get a microphone
I mean it's not like saying I don't do
anything special for you guys but what I
mean by that is I don't put huge amounts
of energy you know into into the channel
I feel like I put huge amounts of energy
into work and music here I put in the
amount that you would do for a hobby so
you know when people say oh you should
start editing or oh you should do this
or you should do that there's way
there's ways around all that kind of
stuff you know doing first impressions
Lane you guys know how it were through
out the day in the comments section
doing a follow up review I feel like I
can still do everything but maybe it's
just a little bit of a different take on
the typical beauty youtuber I just want
to be the person that I am in real life
on camera watch guys to know who I am
because this was all about coming on
here and making friendships and talking
to people and talking to you guys and
I'm just so overwhelmed by all the love
and I tried so hard so hard to keep up
with that comment section you guys by
the time I hit 13,000 subscribers I was
just like I can't I literally can't do
this anymore cuz it started to affect

my life right now and yeah it's kind of
a update on mental health physical

noticed a difference with hate comments
and things like that the bigger my
channel gets a lot of them make me laugh

certain comments are the ones about my
mental health and also things related to
lupus or this or that so yeah that's
about it guys I love you so much I hope

chapped but I really shouldn't give a
