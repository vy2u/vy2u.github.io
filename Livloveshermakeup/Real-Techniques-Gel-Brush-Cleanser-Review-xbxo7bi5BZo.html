thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a really excellent
day in this video I will be reviewing
for you a new product that recently
released from Real Techniques if you
guys don't know Real Techniques Sam and
Nick Chapman are here on YouTube I
believe they're under pixie woo is that
correct I'm pretty sure that's what it's
under anyway I'm they started like a
brush line and they have I don't think
they have any makeup yet but basically
they came out with this deep cleansing
brush gel that I thought was really
really interesting so I picked this up
on the alto shaam website it goes for
$8.99
so under $10 really really well priced
and you can get online tutorials for you
know using any of their products any of
their brushes and also this particular
brush gel but I just thought it looked
really interesting it is a weekly deep
cleansing brush gel and I thought it was
really cool because a lot of deep
cleaning you know brush products are not
gel and I just thought that was really
cool I am very attracted to anything
that's like gel like I don't know why
but I am so I definitely wanted to pick
this up and it says it improves brush
performance as well so this is the
packaging comes in just the normal Real
Techniques plastic packaging and the
actual products looks like this I love
the packaging I think it's so pretty so
it's just a pretty white bottle with a
black cap and then you can see the ombre
effect it goes down from light pink to
dark pink it says Artie Artie Artie and
that just is stands for Real Techniques
so basically it tells you to use this
weekly and dampen bristles in warm water
squeeze a drop of the gel onto bristles
rub between fingers and rinse until
clean so you want to rub it like with
your fingers you can also rub it like on
the palm of your hand but I noticed that
if I rub it with my fingers it does get
more product out and then you reshape
and dry flat or upside down and like I
said you can see it in action on the wwl
techniques comm website if you guys want
to see the ladies Sam and Nick do it on
the actual looks like you can see it
live in action but anyway let me read
for you guys a little bit what it says
on the altar comm website so it says
Real Techniques gel brush cleanser
99 it says this deep cleansing gel brush
cleanser from Real Techniques will help
extend the life of your brushes you love
so much
this exclusive gel formula harnesses the
power of a concentrate is alcohol-free
and non drying which is really really
good for the bristles of your brushes it
has also been proven to effectively if
you removed effectively or only of
nearly all makeup residue and has been
dermatologist tested for gentleness they
concentrate gel allows you to create a
lather to those brushes and get them
squeaky clean and good as new at weekly
and it is alcohol-free laboratory proven
to effectively renew remove nearly all
makeup residue and dermatologist tested
for gentleness I would get tongue-tied
when I read those but anyways so does
this work basically I have used it on my
eye brushes face brushes and I also have
used it on you know beauty sponges like
my Real Techniques sponge and also my
Beauty Blender so I will say right away
it is amazing amazing amazing at
removing stains on your Beauty Blender
and your Real Techniques sponges it
completely rinses them clean what I do
is I run the sponge by step my sponge
will be dry because what I do is I apply
my foundation you know i dampen it and
then I apply my foundation on the sponge
and then I let it kind of sit out and I
don't actually like reak leaned it until
usually the next morning when I use it
so what I do is it's completely dry I
run it underneath water one time I kind
of squeeze out the excess I will take
about a I don't know I would say
probably like a quarter sized amount of
the product and I start rubbing that
into the actual sponge and it's amazing
you guys I just start rubbing it in
there I really start kind of squeezing
it out and then once I rinse it
underneath water it's amazing how well
this removes stains from the Beauty
Blender or the Real Techniques sponge my
Beauty Blender is almost six months old
and it has completely removed all stains
from it and my Real Techniques sponges
it does a great job of cleaning those
too so this is probably my favorite new
product for cleaning my makeup sponges
because honestly you know the blender
cleanser or whatever from Beauty Blender
is nice I don't really like the scent I
don't like the solid one and it's quite
expensive so this is a great alternative
and also I want to just point out it has
an amazing scent it does not smell like
typical brush
you know cleaners basically it smells
very very fresh and floral eats and it
just smells so good and for under ten
dollars you cannot beat the price so if
you're looking for something that can
really really clean your makeup sponges
this is great it is also great at
cleaning eye brushes I noticed that even
with like my goat hair bristle brushes
which are the white ones that really can
stain easily it really picks up any kind
of residue that's in there and really
rinses them clean however I will say
unfortunately it does not do the same
thing for my foundation brushes it does
for like bronzer and blushes but blush
brushes but as far as foundation brushes
go I feel like foundation brushes and
you know the foundation really gets
stuck in there and it gets really gung
key and they are hard to clean whether
it be the Real Techniques the AB what's
it called expert face brush or you know
any kind of brush from Sigma you know
they're Kapoor keys it is just so hard
to clean those and this unfortunately
does not take all of that residue out so
that's kind of a bummer however I am one
of those people that tends to lean more
towards Beauty sponges in general for
applying my foundation but yeah it's
kind of disappointing and it doesn't
completely remove you know buildup from
foundation and foundation brushes but
overall amazing amazing amazing for I'm
weekly used on your eye brushes and
everyday use on your Beauty sponges so
highly recommend it for that it smells
great the price is right and yeah I'm
really enjoying it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review please give it a
thumbs up if you did and I'll see you in
my next one five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
