channel today's video is going to be all
about rediscovered makeup items I'm very
very excited for this video I'm kind of
piggybacking off of my friend Meg
barnardo's video that she posted about
two or three weeks ago called beauty
rediscovered where she talked about
beauty items and just like makeup in
general that she has been like she
basically rediscovered and has been
loving so I have about 10 products here
that I recently have been really really
loving that maybe you guys haven't heard
me talk about in three months or six
months or a year or anything like that
so I thought I would go through them
today share with you guys my
rediscovered makeup items and I believe
Meg's channel and her video down below I
of course want to give her credit since
this was her idea but thank you beg for
letting me piggyback off of your idea
alright so I'm a first item that I have
been loving is the urban decay naked
skin one in done hybrid complexion
Perfector this has broad spectrum SPF 20
in it and my shade is light this is what
it looks like it just comes in this nice
little pump bottle I have two pumps of
this on my face today as my actual base
I think it's beautiful and every time
like I just don't want to put a full
face of makeup on obviously today do you
have a full face of makeup on but over
like on the weekends and things like
that and just on days where I'm feeling
kind of lazy I really have noticed that
I have been enjoying pulling this out I
like to put it on with like a buffing
foundation brush I don't really like the
way it goes on with my fingers or a damp
sponge I think I used to like to apply
it with my fingers but now I just like
two pumps of it with like a real
Techniques buffing brush and I just buff
it into the skin it is a little dark on
me but honestly I'm just so happy that I
rediscovered this because I think I
reviewed this what three or four months
ago and I used it like every single day
for a month and then I stopped using it
and now I'm just happy that I
rediscovered it so that is the first
item and they second item that I have
recently rediscovered is the elf
illuminating palette I am obsessed with
this this palette is totally a do for
like the hourglass powders in my opinion
today I do have on this shade right here
they don't have names but I have this
kind of pinky color on right here these
are all very very smooth and creamy and
blendable and I just love the way that
they go onto the skin they really give
like a lit from within sort of glow and
they are very very pigmented you guys
know I love the hourglass ambient
strobing lighting
and I feel like these are a hybrid of
the two like the regular hourglass
powders and also the ambient lighting
powders they just go onto the skin
beautifully you can use them to set in
your foundation you can use them to
highlight like I did today for a very
very nice like barely there sort of
Sheen I just feel like they look so
beautiful on the skin and at least
really to remind me of the hourglass
powder so if you do want a Duke for
those hourglass powders just in general
I mean I can't say that these are
complete colored oops i know that this
one right here is definitely a dupe for
dim light or maybe it's this one I can't
remember but they're very very beautiful
and they are similar in tone and I feel
like they really have a very similar
formulation so I've been loving that and
I don't think I've used that for quite a
while now and I finally started pulling
it out again I've been enjoying it
alright the next two items that I have
been loving are these Maybelline Color
Moulton's you guys I reviewed these like
what like a year and a half ago on my
channel these are so fun I don't know
what the shades are because the actual
little sticker came off but this is the
first one you have a dark purple it did
it a dark purple and a light pink this
is what they look like and I would say
the consistency or the formulation on
these reminds me a lot of like color pop
I shadows are just at colour-pop sort of
formulation where you have that like dim
ethic own sort of cream to powder finish
I really really really like these i
think i like the more than color pop I
shadows I will be doing a video called
the best and worst of color pop that
will be coming up soon and to be
completely honest I don't love a lot of
products from colour-pop I like some of
their eyeshadows I mostly like their
lippies I don't really like toms of
their face products but I feel like this
formulation from the color Moulton's
from Maybelline is actually better i
really like the way that they go on to
my eyes the other little duo i have is
this one right here and i did use it
today to put together my eye look i have
this color all over my lid and this on
my lower lashline smudged out I think
they just go on so nicely they do have
that sorted to methacholine tanned buff
into the eye area and normally I just
don't like working with creams but I
really like the formulation on these so
those are the third item that I've
really been enjoying and it definitely
is like a rediscovered makeup item I
have fuzz on my nail
where that came from alright the next
one that is they rediscovered and makeup
item is the Physicians Formula conceal
our exposition strength concealer in the
shade soft green you guys this is a damn
good concealer like really really really
good let me show you guys what it looks
like on the back of my hand I'll put a
little out oh my god i'm running out of
this stuff it's really really good um so
this is basically just a very very thick
and okay concealer it honestly is really
really gorgeous on the skin and I like
this color it's very good for obviously
color correcting but it just has this
beautiful kind of finish to it where
it's very very blendable but you're
still getting a ton and ton like a ton
of coverage basically you're getting a
lot of coverage from this baby I used to
have it in the actual I think it was
called the fair shade but the fair shade
was so dark on me that's one of my
complaints is that physicians formula
like with their foundations and their
concealers and their BB creams even the
lightest shades are too dark on me even
when I'm self tan like today but I
really do like that concealer in the
green shade really nice for color
correcting redness I put it around my
nose on any pimples things like that
really adore that the next two items are
from Makeup Forever these are the aqua
extra large I pencils so if you guys saw
my little kit I did a review on a kid's
when these first released and I swear to
you I use them for like a week and then
I just didn't touch them again I think
it was because two of the shades were
really basic and they just kind of got
muddled up with the rest of my eyeliners
I have a lot of eyeliners but these two
shades right here I recently have been
reaching for I like to wear these on my
waterline these are the two shades
they're really beautiful this one is a
minty green and then we have a navy blue
well it's more like a bright blue with
like it's like a sapphire color with
shimmer and that shade right there is I
24 and then this one is m30 which is the
mint green I like the way that these
we're on the I like on the actual water
line I don't think they wear as well as
like my next slide on eyeliners or my
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils
but they are still really really hard to
get off as you guys can probably see and
they really don't budge like once you
put them on I think they're really nice
if you want to go underneath the lash
line because once they SAT two people
not budge so I've been enjoying those a
lot the next four items I've been
enjoying are these
they're correcting sticks i am using
these in shop and swatch my stash this
week these are the smashbox smashbox
these are the smashbox color correcting
sticks the first one we have is look
less tired light which is a peachy color
we have look less tired dark which is
like an orange creamsicle color get less
red which is like a nice kind of creamy
pistachio shade and then we have don't
be dull which is the purple I love the
formulation on these you guys these are
the proper black put I cannot speak
listen to me stuttering these are the
perfect purple purple perfect um like
color correcting products for the
summertime if you do have combination or
oily skin because I like the way they go
on it they go on like this and then
they're very very blendable but you guys
will see they dry down to like this demi
matte finish and they just don't budge
they just don't budge I find that like I
really can't be using like my NYX color
correcting palette a lot even though I'm
going to bring that to the cabinet just
for you know ease of use um ease of use
you know because it's easy to use I'm in
no sense yeah I'm just listening to
myself no boy what do you say live um
anyway I am bringing that up to the
cabin but like sometimes it's hard to
work with those or like the Becca
backlight targeted color correctors
because they have this very humectant
moisturizing creamy formulation to them
and if you are oily or combo skins like
I am you just can't do that during the
summertime it just ends up like going
off your face so I really love these
Smashbox color correcting sticks because
you put them on and then they just like
dry down to almost a matte finish which
is awesome all right and the next item I
want to talk about is the lorac Pro
cream eyeliner initiate copper this is
what it looks like I have been popping
this on my lower lash line the past
couple of weeks here and there I really
really like it you pull this open and
you do have a little brush I don't
really use it I think it's kind of weird
and it gets gunky really easily even
when I clean it but this is what the
actual color looks like he can use this
as an eyeshadow base as an actual cream
shadow or as an eyeliner like I said I
just like to put it on my lower lash
line I love this because once you put it
on and you let it set it is there all
day long it's a beautiful coppery shade
with a little bit a big gold Sheen and
it's absolutely stunning before at the
summertime so I've been enjoying that
also have been enjoying my tarts clay
pots you guys remember when I review
those I swear I was raving about them
for like a month a half and then
suddenly it's like they just got lost in
my collection like I forgot about them
so anyway I really been enjoying these
the first shade i have is mint and the
second days rose gold I've been using
rose gold this week because it's just so
beautiful and it goes really nicely with
the palette that I chose this week which
is the revealed too it's just a
beautiful rose gold color it's got a
little more texture in it than the mint
color but it's beautiful on the lower
lash line or the inner corner of the eye
or even just all over the lid and these
babies just like the lorac one once they
set these sets they do not budge I swear
these are like waterproof you literally
could wear them to the pool and not have
any sorts of issue and then the other
shade is mint and I can't seem to open
it but this is what the mint color looks
like I really try and close these super
tightly just because they are super
creamy but over all these are just
really beautiful I love popping these on
the lower lash line if you know how to
do like upper winged eyeliner you could
do that too but yeah super super
beautiful been loving those kind of
cream eyeliner products and the United
product that i have been loving is the
ameet a makeup diamond tarts based
primer in the illuminating version so
this was the actual products that kind
of made me want to do this rediscovered
makeup items video and I have just been
in love with this stuff this is amazing
I got this primer and I believe my
glossybox a few months ago it has a soft
focused effect and it's just such a
beautiful consistency so it comes out
and as you guys can see it's like a
peachy color and this reminds me a lot
of the hourglass and God what is it
called see nothing light diffusing
primer the primer i'm using this week in
shop and swatch my stash which is in
luminous light it's like that hourglass
lighting primer or whatever it reminds
me a lot of that except for like a
fraction of the price and i actually
like the way that this dries down better
so the hourglass one definitely dries
down completely matte and i'm not
talking about the mineral veil i'm
talking about the newer primers they
like lighting ones but anyway i like the
way that that one dries down but i feel
like this one is even better it gives
like just a nice amount of moisture to
the skin but it doesn't feel too sticky
or tacky it has a nice scent it
definitely does kind of blur
imperfections and it really does make
your makeup lasts a lot longer so I even
loving that little a meat product and
the last item I have to hear these are
the Laura Geller baked baked balance and
brighten foundations in fair and
porcelain so these are the 10th item
that I have really been enjoying and
have been total rediscovers from my
actual makeup collection so here is the
shade fair now fair is a little dark on
me so I like to mix the two of these
together because fair is a little dark
while I'm self-tan but porcelain is a
little too light so here is what
porcelain looks like and these are baked
powder foundations now i will be doing a
two-part series when i get home from my
trip and i will be doing a two part
series basically one day I'm going to
share with you guys products that I used
to love that I now hate and the next day
I will be sharing with you guys products
I hate that I used to love so these are
one of those products that i actually
used to hate that i now love I just
don't write never like this I never got
into this everybody always raved about
these emilynoel83 I think makeup by
Tiffany D I watch a lot of people that
raved about these powder foundations and
I remember putting it on my face for the
first time and just thinking oh no
that's not going to work for my combo to
oily skin they definitely have a little
bit of a sheen to them you guys they're
not like that creamy creamy radiance
what's it called the tarts like the new
powder foundation that came out that's
like pretty darn Matt these are not like
that they really do give a little bit of
like luminescence to your skin I am
wearing the two of them mixed together
today to set in that urban decay one and
done hybrid Perfector gel thing whatever
it's called and I really do like them I
think they give you a beautiful Sheen to
the skin what I recommend doing if you
are oily to combo skin door combo to
oily is to go ahead and set your face in
completely first with like a powder and
then go on top with these you get like a
little bit of extra coverage but it just
gives a beautiful like Sheen to the skin
these are amazing really really like
these so anyway guys those are my
rediscovered makeup items let me know
down below if you have recently found

rediscovered and you're like where the
