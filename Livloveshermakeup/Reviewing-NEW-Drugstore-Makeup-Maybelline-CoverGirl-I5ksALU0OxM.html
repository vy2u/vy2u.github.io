today's video we are reviewing some new
drugstore makeup I have some swatches
going on here on the back of my hand and
now we will be talking about the new
covergirl these super sizer fibers of
mascara and also i will be reviewing for
you guys three of the new bold lipsticks
from maybelline this is their bold
collection and i guess we'll start with
these because these are really just an
utter disappointment in my opinion i do
have two of the colors mixed on my lips
right now and i literally have been
wearing this for like five minutes now
it is already starting to wear away on
the inner part of my lip i feel like
these are just not opaque whatsoever and
on top of that they already started to
go outside of my lip line even though i
did use a clear what is it the Urban
Decay zero lip liner which is just a
clear lip liner so these feather like
crazy i'm just i'm not i'm not about
these so we'll start with these but by
the way if you guys are curious i did
purchase all of these products at Ulta I
will have links below in the description
bar but you guys can pick them up I
believe everything was under ten dollars
not together but each one separately was
under ten dollars so relatively
relatively well price cannot speak um
anyway I was super excited when
Maybelline released these bold lip
sticks they had so many bold and vibrant
cool colors so I did end up picking up
three different shades this is what the
outer packaging looks like it is like a
bold kind of sapphire blue color which i
think is really pretty in comparison
here are some of the Maybelline vivids
which I really love the formulation of
the Maybelline Vivid's I think these are
amazing and I have I think every single
1i have like I think 10 of these so I
love the vivid these do not have the
same sorta formulation in my opinion
whatsoever and I really thought they
would and a lot of them do not there is
only one shade out of those three that I
picked up that I really like and the
shade is called gray over it which is
actually that kind of like a mocha color
that you're seeing there anyway they do
have the same sort of packaging as the
vivid as I can see it's just in blue
packaging so the shades I picked up for
each 40 midnight blue and I was so
excited about this you guys because I
have wanted to rock out a blue lip
forever now so I do have a little bit of
this mixed together with the D shade i'm
going to show you next which is called
gray over it I do
that on my lips today and great over it
is definitely more of a it's like a gray
brown but it definitely leans more brown
than gray on the actual website like the
Ulta website and looked really really
great but it's really not that great and
the final color that I picked up was
called wickedly white because I was like
what the hell I don't know I want a
white lipstick i think that's cool i
could use it for halloween or i could
use it to mix other colors together and
get the perfect color that i want so i
would say overall I just feel like these
are not worth the money like honestly if
you are going to go and you really want
like bright bold colors from maybelline
i would highly recommend checking out
the vivid they just have a wonderful
formulation the formulation on these new
bold lip sticks is just kind of a hit
and miss so here i have the three shades
swatch so here we have wickedly white
and then we have the shade midnight blue
in the middle and then right there is
great over it I think you guys can see
just from looking at the swatches that
gray over it is the one that has
definitely definitely the best
formulation what bothers me the most is
the one in the middle which is keep
buying some call it sapphire blue it's
called midnight blue that one bothers me
the most and I honestly thought this was
going to be the coolest one and the most
opaque is not at all this goes on so
freaking patchy you guys and I put that
on my lips up like I said about five
minutes ago and then I topped it with
great over it because this literally
will not go evenly onto my lips no
matter what no matter if i exfoliate my
lips first if i put down a really
moisturizing lip balm and then go in
with this i had read it with my laura
geller lip spackle I have tried it with
primers I have tried it with everything
I cannot get this fricking like a
lipstick to go on smoothly so like you
guys can see I did go probably three or
four times back and forth with each
lipstick and I feel like this one is
very sparse and patchy the white one is
also very patchy and kind of dry looking
this is the only one with a good
formulation so I am definitely going to
be returning a midnight blue and I'm
definitely going to be turning returning
wickedly white just because the
formulation sucks on these the white one
is so horrible and I mean like I know
that like when you put white lipstick on
it's not going to look very attractive
on your lips but even mixing this in
with different colors I had some dark
bite beauty lipsticks that I tried to
make
this with it still looked so bad it just
emphasizes all the little like lines and
everything on the insides of my lips and
if you have one dry patch on your lips
this is not going to glide over it so
the white one was definitely a fail and
then of course the blue one like I said
like just now my lips are somewhat good
right now I know I'm a flute player and
practice all the time and for the most
part I don't have like these smoothest
like nicest lips but i could not glide
this over without it being completely
patchy and even on the inside of my lip
right now after only five minutes of
where it is completely wearing off it is
feathering outside of my glip point it's
absolutely ridiculous just a horrible
formulation I would much rather like use
my I don't know Bobby Brown University
lip palette or even my so for lip
palette and just mix together a blue
color myself then use this because it's
just so disappointing and this was the
one I was definitely the most excited
about it just goes on even more patchy
than the wickedly white shade so overall
the one that I found out of the batch or
the three that I picked up that has the
best formulation is definitely great
over it as you can see great over um has
sort of like a matte finish to it the
other two are a little more sad me I
wouldn't call them glossy but I also
wouldn't call them completely matte
great over it just is super super opaque
and beautiful and I like the consistency
of this a lot better I can put this on
my lips and it looks really nice it
glides over my lips very very nicely it
does not ball up or patch up and even
when I just kind of like put it on the
back of my hand quickly it's a full-on
opaque color beautiful reminds me of the
formulation of the vivid so overall I'm
a little disappointed with the ones that
I picked up i will be returning of these
two which is a wickedly white and again
the midnight blue shade I'm going to
keep gray over it I think it's beautiful
sort of like a your lips but better sort
of 90s vibe there so yeah I guess for
these I would say I really think it's
cool that Maybelline wanted to go there
and start launching like new colorful
lipsticks because that's so like on
point right now and in trend or whatever
you guys are already be like I feel like
jeffree star has all these crazy colors
like blue lipsticks and like his white
liquid lipsticks and I think it's cool
that a drugstore brand wanted to jump on
the band
again I just talked in the formulation
was it very very good honestly if these
two had the formulation of the great
over it shades they would be absolutely
beautiful but yeah these three that I
picked up or at least the two of them
we're quite disappointing so let's go
ahead and move on it to my review on the
super sizer fibers mascara so this is an
item that i will not repurchase either
mom I'm not going to be returning it I
do like it so this is the cover girl the
super sizer fibers mascara I think this
was around seven or eight dollars again
I'll have everything linked below the
price and everything but I had the ID
same identical want to the original
super sizer mascara which if you guys
have been watching my channel for a
while that days my all-time favorite
drugstore mascara so when I saw that
they were releasing in fiber is a
version I was a little confused at first
I was like fibers like the white ones
that you put on and then you go in with
them you know like the actual mascara no
it's not that and you can't actually see
the fibers on the wand it's not like
fibers I think what they were kind of
going for is kind of like the L'Oreal
telescopic like extensions like they
were just going for length when it comes
to this particular mascara so I don't
have my old covergirl one to share with
you guys like my original super sizer
had cleared that out in last month's
empties so I can't do a comparison for
you guys but I can promise you the wand
is identical the formulation is not
identical though so although it does
have this great little wand which if you
guys are familiar with the original
cover girl super sizer it's the same
exact thing you have this really small
little tapered like side at the bottom I
guess and then it gets bigger as it goes
up it's a very very interesting wand and
I used to think that it was the wand
that made this particular mascara so
special but now I know that it's
actually the formulation because the one
on this is not do what does the original
one does I mean it's a wand with the
formulation is obviously different so I
do like this I am wearing it today just
have one coat on and I have built up two
or three coats I was wearing this
particular mascara I think two or three
coats of this when i did my jaclyn hill
eyeshadow palette review which by the
way it's crazy right that those were
completely like taking off the market so
those are shadow palettes anyway sorry
it does big anyway
did go ahead and I have three coats of
this on and my eyelash just looked
really nice they were very very long i
had quite a few of you asking me which
mascara i was using but in my opinion
this really only gives good length now
i'm going to say right away i do
artificially enhanced my eyelashes I
don't have extensions or anything like
that but I do use lie lash cargo lash
accelerator things like that I will go
ahead and post a video down below if you
guys would like to see the products that
I recommend for eyelash growth so I
can't really tell you like oh you know
like these are my eyelashes because they
didn't used to look like that but for
the most part i use gross products for
my eyelashes and it has made them very
very long and strong not so thick though
and the reason i love the original cover
girl super sizer mascara is because it
gave me definition it gave me volume and
it gave me length it was like a trifecta
perfect product this particular mascara
only gives me length and i already have
long lashes now and i don't need to say
that in a cocky way it's because i
worked for it and i bought products to
make them longer but now that i have
long lashes what i really look for is
definition and thickness so i just think
that this kind of falls short for me i
do not want to repurchase this
particular one I think the formulation
is just completely different and I don't
really see the whole fiber thing maybe
it's like the extending tube sort of
things sort of like the L'Oreal
telescopic one or the carbon what is it
called you guys know what I mean like
the shocking extensions it was kind of
like the same like formula where it's
supposed to build on top of the eyelash
like in little tube I guess maybe that's
what they were going for but for the
most part I don't think this is anything
special i would highly recommend just
going ahead and sticking with the
original cover girls super sizer mascara
and now i know that it's not the ones
that makes it special it's actually the
formulation so anyway yeah this was not
a fail i will use it up but i would not
repurchase i will just purchase the
original one alright guys so those were
of my reviews on some of the new drug
store and makeup items that i could
picked up recently not too happy it's a
little upsetting but it is
it is the drugstore does start releasing
a lot of new products this time of year
so I do look forward to trying out some
new stuff and let me know if you guys
liked videos like this where I try out a
bunch of like drugstore makeup products
and then I just do one review for you
guys so let me know if you like this or
if you like separate videos and yeah I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
