have another review for you guys today
or not a review I have another video for
you guys today it is a review and it is
on a new Revlon product these are the
Revlon highlighting pallets and they had
two shades this is what it looks like
these are new at the drugstore I
purchased mine on the ultra calm website
they were 1199 a piece I believe yeah
1199 a piece but I got them when there
was a buy one get one 50% off sale I
originally only wanted this shade which
is called rose glow it is like a
beautiful kind of pinky color but
because they were having the buy one get
one 50% off I thought I would try both
and get the other one as well which is
called bronze glow so I was looking at
these on the website and I thought oh my
gosh those look very very similar to the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips umm
they have the Physicians Formula has
this great like shimmer strips thing
going on where you can use it as a
highlight you can use them as eyeshadows
you can use them as blush or bronzer top
like toppers basically and I honestly
get a lot of use out of those and I just
thought you know what these look very
similar Revlon doesn't really steer me
wrong I thought that these would be
really great and honestly I'm super
super disappointed I don't even know if
I want to keep these that's how
disappointed I am so um basically what
they look like first of all let me show
you the first horrible thing about it is
that these lids pop off way too easily
they do pop back on but I mean every
single time I open it it like pops off I
hate that so anyway what they look like
is basically they have 5 different color
like strips so in the Rose lo one you
get like a lighter strip and then a
pinky one a darker one a peachy one and
then more of a golden one and then in
the bronze glow one you get a really
really light one and then some you know
bronzy shades so my issue is that when I
mix these together even when I mix them
together with a brush they start to seep
into the other colors and it's not just
when I do like a finger swatch it's when
I actually mix my brush in um and that
normally doesn't happen to me um
normally the brush kind of evens the
texture back out and that shouldn't
happen but it literally bleeds into the
other colors so if I want to use this on
my eyes and say I want to use that white
shade as like you know my brow bone
color it's not going to work because
it's already been mixed in with that
color which is such a shame so if that's
the first thing that kind of annoys me
the second thing that kind of is that
bothersome is the fact that there's so
much kick up when I swirl my finger in
here and also you can see on my hand
it's actually pretty much kind of chunky
I would say the product is just chunky
and this is the one that is a lot more
pigmented I was gonna say better
pigmented but a lot more pigmented than
the Rose glow one but I just want to
show you guys I just went like this this
is the swatch can you see that can you
see how streaky and kind of chalky and
chunky that is that should not be
happening you really have to work it in
to blend it out and it just picks up too
much powder it's just really really
gross and like I said they're not
particularly um they're not particularly
soft too so like you know you're kind of
putting it on your face and the fact
that it's not soft doesn't help with the
blending process it's barely there if
that is the darker one can you guys see
that
that's it blended into the skin this
one's even worse this is the Rose glow
one I'm really really picking up
products there okay so you can see it's
kind of chunky and then you put it on
and it's like what seriously it is so
streaky it's just unbelievably streaky
and then I blend it into the skin and
it's barely there so I'm just not
impressed because not only do these not
blend well not only do they not I don't
know feel soft to the touch they
literally are really really poor when it
comes to pigmentation now I did know
when I picked up the bronze one that I
probably wasn't gonna use this as a
highlight it was probably going to be
too dark for my skin but honestly the
pink one - I just ends up looking a
little muddy on my skin I don't like it
as a highlight like right above my
cheekbones what I like to do with them
is apply them on top of my blush but
even then they're still barely
noticeable and I just I'm just so not
into these I'm very very disappointed I
would say if you see them at the
drugstore and you think oh that looks so
cool you know look at those new Revlon
palettes they're probably gonna be
similar to the Physicians Formula don't
get them go and get one of the
Physicians Formula if you're looking for
a drugstore pod product or go ahead and
spend the extra ten to twelve dollars
and pick yourself up a yeah pick
yourself up
pick up a highlight that's like high-end
do you guys know what I mean like go and
pick something up that's literally like
ten or twelve dollars more and it's
going to be amazing because these are
just so incredibly not worth it you
can't use them for your eyes because
they mix in with each other you can't
really use it as a highlight because
they barely show like it's just oh it's
one of those really annoying products
and I really wanted to get this review
out for you guys because I think $11.99
even is a steep price for a highlighting
palette at the drugstore and it's just
ridiculous how bad these are so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this quick little
review and I will be filming my empties
video tomorrow so if you guys want to
see that stay tuned for that that will
be up tomorrow afternoon and yeah I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
