video is going to be a bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
haul plus Sephora haul we're gonna start
with Bath &amp;amp; Body Works because these
candles are about to literally fly off
this desk in front of me or my music
stand in front of me
so anyway Bath &amp;amp; Body Works was having
eight dollar and fifty cents three wick
candles $8 and 50 cent set three book
candles about a week and a half ago and
I think they were 1015 Canada or
something like that so of course you
know I jumped on that and then so for I
gave me like a $25 off code or whatever
off of $50 if you were at the IB Rouge
you got that as well
so I'm gonna share with you guys the
items that I picked up alright so let's
go ahead and start with Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works the first three with candlelight
picked up was called a fireside I have
never had this one before but it just
comes in the white barn at packaging and
the fragrance notes for this are smoked
cedar clove buds and warm rich embers
and it really does smell good it's very
very woodsy and I feel like tom is going
to like that one a lot I also went ahead
and picked up a marshmallow fireside we
actually got two of these because we are
a big fan of this particular scent now I
will say we usually get the scent when
it comes to what does it call
wallflowers because honestly one of
these candles doesn't have that much of
a scent throw so I did go ahead and pick
up two of these the fragrance notes in
here if you are curious are toasted
marshmallow smoldering woods fire
roasted vanilla and crystallized amber
so that is marshmallow fire cider
really cute little lid right there but
we also went ahead and picked up let's
see here frosted cranberry this is a
favorite of mine during the holiday
season it just smells really sweet and
yummy and the fragrance notes in here
are frosted cranberry Red Delicious
apple and blonde woods so I'm very
excited for that and then finally we
picked up two winter candles so winter
is one of those scents that I used to
not like at all I actually was very very
much not in love with this scent but
that was because I was smelling it cold
so when you smell it cold it really
doesn't smell that great however when
you heat these up like when you actually
start to burn them they smell incredible
so this is what the outer packaging
looks like we did get two of these for
the living room and I just love this
packaging look how sparkly and pretty it
is and of course the little snowflake
lid the fragrance notes in here are
white woods pine needles sparkling
Clementine and spiced clove and like I
said it really doesn't really doesn't
smell that good cold but when you
actually start to burn it it smells
absolute
amazing so anyway those are all of the
candles we picked up let's go ahead and
jump into the item that I picked up from
Sephora so like I said I got $25 off of
$50 so there were a few little sets that
I had seen and also some lip products
that I really wanted to get my hands on
the first item is a little set this is
actually from origins so this is
normally $35 actually was on sale for 28
this is the origins Explorers Club for
the ginseng line now I have tried a few
items from the ginseng line and I really
really liked them I think they are a
cult favorite from the origins brand so
I saw this and I immediately thought you
know what that would be perfect to take
as my morning skincare routine like this
little kit here when I travel for the
holidays so that is what I'm going to do
this is little kit does have the ginseng
energy boosting treatment lotion mist it
does have the refreshing scrub cleanser
it also has the energy boosting
moisturizer and the refreshing eye cream
so I'm very very excited for this this
is literally going to be my morning
skincare routine when I go for Christmas
to visit my parents so that is a lot of
fun and I'm very very excited so I have
tried the eye cream before this is what
the eye cream looks like I have not
tried the scrub I've heard really good
things I have not tried the boosting
moisturizer and I have not tried the
treatment lotion mists which is kind of
like a toner so super super excited to
try that little kit out if you've tried
any of those let me know if you like
them I also did pick up these little
Clinique pepp start quick cleansing
swipes so these were like $10 and again
what I'm going to do with these is take
them for travel and I did open one up
the other day I want to show you guys so
it comes in this little mono dose pod
like this you actually press in the
middle and the little cloth comes out so
I thought these would be really perfect
for travel this whole little kit here
only has 9 pods in it so technically
it's like having 9 cleansing wipes but I
really like how compact and travel
friendly they are so I picked it that up
I also went ahead and it picked up
another one of Izzy's Sephora wonderful
cushion matte lip cream so this
particular shade is called wonderful red
these are one of the only like honestly
probably one of the only liquid
lipsticks or lips liquid cream lipsticks
that I really do enjoy I love I love the
formulation on these so this is what the
applicator looks like it's a little
sponge and I do have a few of these I'm
sorry I but leftovers to watch there but
I do have one of these already
should say a few I have the shade what
is it called bright fuchsia or magenta
or something like that so this is what
the red shade looks like and I honestly
feel like the formulation on these
really kind of blur out fine lines and
wrinkles on your lips like it's
incredible so I picked that up and then
I also went ahead and picked up these
Sephora collection lip stain in the
shade this is the Rouge infusion stain
in tangerine so this is something that
I've heard really good things about this
was also on sale in the same little area
that I found the origins so a lot of
people say that these are really really
nice lip stains if you guys didn't know
I'm all about comfortable lip products I
love lip oils I love really really
comfortable
creamy lipsticks and I really do enjoy
lip stains because I feel like they just
sink right into the lip so this is what
the Rouge infusion looks like actually
really beautiful packaging and you pick
it up like this and that is the shade
this does not look like a tangerine
shade at all but okay if you insist
Sephora so there is the actual shade it
actually looks very pretty it's starting
to turn a little more orange but I don't
mind him very say to try this out so
yeah very suited for that I also did go
ahead and pick up another one of those
wonderful cushion matte lip creams
because I think these were actually also
on sale I think everything I picked up
with in the sales section this is the
wonderful cushion matte lip cream in the
shade wonderful plum so this is more of
a purpley shade and then I did go ahead
and cash in some points so the first
hundred point perk I got was the origins
high potency night immense mineral
enriched face cream this is so beautiful
it smells like an orange creamsicle it's
a wonderful wonderful night cream so I
love that I also did get this Lancome
energy de vie this is the lotion
smoothing and plumping pearly lotion so
it's kind of like a kind of like that
origins product actually what is this
called it's like a energy boosting
treatment lotion mess so you can kind of
use it as like a toner or you can just
kind of use it to I don't really know I
get confused with these kind of things I
love skincare but I don't know Perley
lotion kind of confuses me I guess it's
kind of like a hydrating toner and then
I did get a little sample here of these
Sephora instant moisture cream with
hyaluronic acid I've actually tried this
out before I love it I did it cash in
some points for this Laura Mercier
foundation primer this is in the
radiance version and looking at this
this would actually be perfect for
my trip as well because look how nicely
sized that is let's go ahead and swatch
it I want to see if I has like color to
it since it is radiance yeah it has a
little bit of like a peachy peachy glow
to it can you guys see that so that
would be interesting maybe I will take
that for my trip as well and then I also
cashed in a point perk for the Anastacio
Beverly Hills lip gloss indeed potion
this is what it looks like and this is I
think like a really deep of purpley
color yeah it's like a deep deep deep
purpley color so that is what it looks
like and yeah that is it guys so that is
everything that I picked up from Bath
and Body Works and also Sephora I hope
you enjoyed this little collective haul
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
