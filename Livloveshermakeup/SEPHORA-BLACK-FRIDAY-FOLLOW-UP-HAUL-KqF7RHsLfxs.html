happy friday i hope you guys have a
wonderful weekend i am so excited it is
the weekend I'm telling it has been a
very long week of anyway welcome back to
my channel today's video is going to be
a Sephora follow-up hall so exactly we
go or like a week and a day ago on my
channel i did a Sephora haul during like
the Black Friday event so basically I
have all these little kits and sets that
I picked up and i'm here to give you
guys either my first impressions or my
finalized thoughts on them so let's go
ahead and jump right into it the first
level set I picked up was I believe $10
this is the clean rollerball layering
trio this is what it looks like there
were three different roller balls that
you got to the first one is warm cotton
which is what i am wearing today you
also got the scent skin and then the
last one is called air I am absolutely
incredibly in love with these you guys
these are beautiful and they smell and
last all day long seriously I can still
smell warm cotton on me right now and I
put that on probably about three and a
half hours ago so this is a really
amazing little trio if it is still
available on the sephora.com website I
would highly recommend going ahead and a
trying them out all of them smell
incredible but my favorite one is
definitely the scent called air this is
just very very interesting I honestly
don't have anything similar to this it's
very fresh but it's got like a little
bit of like patchouli or something in
there little spicy and I just hope I
just got on my nose anyway I feel like
these lasts all day and they really do
have a strong scent throw to them when
they're on your body even so I really
really enjoyed this and i would highly
recommend picking that up if you have
seen it around i also did pick up this
little kit from Murad this is the
essential c cleanser we have the rapid
age spots pigment lightening serum and
also the essential see a day moisture
cream so I actually use these a lot this
week it doesn't look like I've made any
progress and I'm on them whatsoever but
i did use them so the first i do we have
here is the essential c cleanser I like
this a lot but I feel like there is a
product from clean and clear called the
morning burst facial cleanser in the
orange tube that is very very similar to
this it does have a little bit of an
orange scent but it's beautiful I feel
like it does kind of brighten up my skin
in the morning it feels nice when I'm
using it so this is a really really nice
little cleanser as far as the essential
see date moisture cream is concerned I
haven't used this too much honestly
because I'm
that big of a fan by the way if you guys
are curious I scraped myself while
trying to get stuff out from underneath
the couch yeah so if you see those
little cuts that's what it is anyway so
yeah I think this is just okay it does
have broad spectrum SPF 30 PA plus plus
plus which is awesome but has a little
bit of a strange scent and although it
is really nice and humectant and kind of
like a thick cream and it does
moisturize the skin I don't really see a
difference when I'm wearing it so i
probably wouldn't purchase a full size
of that i would purchase a full size of
the cleanser though and then the final
item that we have here is the rapid age
spot and pigment lightening serum this
does have hydroquinone skin lightener in
it this is quite nice I think that you
really have to use this quite a bit to
see a difference but it does burn and
sting the skin a little bit when you
first apply it so if you're very very
sensitive skin i would not recommend
this but i think it does eventually kind
of lighten up hyperpigmentation alright
the next that i had picked up was the
rose set to this was um from the sephora
collection so the first item you got
worthy sephora rose cleansing wipes
these are ultra moisturizing and
brightening i have already completely
used up this pack you will see it in a
Maya December 2016 empties but these are
beautiful these are one of my all-time
favorite cleansing wipes at the moment
so I really did enjoy these you also got
this little guy in there this is the
sephora Bros sleeping mask this is also
ultra moisturizing and brightening the
whole entire line is supposed to be
ultra moisturizing and brightening but
yeah this is what it looks like it
actually is like a mono dose pod so you
take it out and basically you have this
thick kind of gel creme here so i notice
any time i use these little sleeping
mask from sephora honestly these last
like a week so i'm actually going to
take this with me for Christmas so I
have not tried it out yet but I have
tried these before I got a whole set of
them last year during the holidays they
are really really good quality and I do
like these a lot you don't have to wear
them at nighttime you can even even just
like put them on in the morning use it
as kind of like your skincare and then
wash it off before you put your makeup
on I also really enjoy doing that and
then finally we have these Sephora Rose
face masks so this is what it looks like
I feel like they have changed the actual
consistency of the cloth in here so this
is a sheet mask and normally i'm not a
big fan of their sheet mask I don't feel
like they really adhere to my face very
well they just don't conform to my face
I don't know what it is I just do
really like it but uh yeah I don't know
I feel like they've kind of changed it
because it seemed like it was a little
thinner and it did kind of stay on on
the outer parts of my face so I think
that these are getting better so that
was just okay but out of all three of my
favorite are definitely the Rose
cleansing wipes all right moving on I
did also pick up a little spray set here
from taco or toca is atoka I feel like
it's talka anyway in here you are
getting the Florence fragrance mist you
are getting Cleopatra and also Simone at
first I thought it was the Cleopatra
fragrance mist that I had tried out from
a Sephora play box it was not it was
actually this guy right here which is
the Florence fragrance mist these are
spray forms which i think is awesome
this is about twelve dollars you can
still find it on the Sephora com website
it is the Florence fragrance that I'm
obsessed with it is very very beautiful
it's got like a little bit of a perfumey
smell to it with a lot of added
sweetness which I really really like the
Cleopatra is just okay I don't find it
to be that unique but the Simone scent
is also very very unique kind of like
being down at the beach a little bit of
like a salty fragrance so i really like
Florence and i really like Simone I
think they are very very unique it can
be hard with the talk of perfumes
because they are all packaged very
similar so it can be hard to remember
which one you like because they do have
a very large collection but i would
highly recommend checking out this scent
in this one so Simone and also Florence
alright i did also pick up another
little perfume here picked up a lot of
perfumes during that little sale um this
is the elizabeth and james nirvana rosa
bourbon roll on so I'm sorry Nirvana
Rose roll on I do have be full size of
the Bourbon perfume and these really do
pair together nicely um I actually think
that this particular perfume last longer
in rollerball form so one of my issues
with the Bourbon perfume is just the
fact that I don't feel like it has a
very long it doesn't it doesn't have a
loan where time it doesn't stay on the
skin very long you start to lose that
fragrance unlike those little like clean
roller balls if you like these last all
day in the spray form I really feel like
this starts to dissipate so I'm happy
that I got the role on version i think
when i am out of my bourbon i will go
ahead and get the rollerball as well but
yeah this is a beautiful scent it
doesn't smell straight up like rose kind
of like the rowset from actual like the
sephora collection but i do you think
it's beautiful it's got a little bit of
like wood zenus in there as well and I
really do enjoy this so this was on sale
for I believe 18 dot fifty cents which
is a really good deal
and finally the last item that I had
picked up was the Sephora collection
delicate eye shadow palette I love this
packaging it is so adorable these
shadows are made in China but I think
some of them are relatively good quality
so this was only nine or ten dollars i
think it is a nice little pocket palette
even though it's shaped kind of weirdly
my favorite chains in here are
definitely the more metallo sized or
metallic finishes so number two number 8
and number five and number nine some of
the mats in here are creamy that brow
bone shade right there is really really
nice but then some of them are quite
shockey I will go ahead and do some
swatches for you guys so the first one
is number one so this actually goes on
quite nicely there's just a one finger
swipe to watch this one right here does
not go on very nicely so this is number
three can you guys see that it's just
very very patchy but the first one goes
on really nicely and then we have a
number eight which is my favorite kind
of foiled shades so this one goes on
really beautifully as well oh god that
did not go on nice but there it is it
actually looks very beautiful when you
actually get it on the eyes and then we
have a number two which is another one
of my favorites and that one also goes
on quite nicely so there are just some
swatches for you guys they're not
incredible they're not like the best
eyeshadows I've ever used but they are
something that I would take for travel
and that I think are really really cute
so anyway those are all of the items
that I tried out this week I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow at 9am for look of the
week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
