final video to post for you guys today I
know that I've been posting a lot today
but it's mostly because all of my Black
Friday orders came in so we have one
more to go and this is going to be my
Sephora Black Friday haul so if you guys
didn't know it during Black Friday's
before I had all these little kits and
sets that you could pick up so I did
pick some up I'm gonna share with you
guys what I got all right so the first
little set that I picked up was called
be simply chic toka or talk--i fragrance
set so you get Florence Cleopatra and
Simone in here so Florence is the
Parisian sophisticates Cleopatra is a
Mediterranean seductress and of course
Simone is a fearless Beach Beauty so
this was only ten dollars I believe and
they are sprays which i think is awesome
I do like the sense on these I have
already smelled them before so I was
super excited to get them I really like
the I think it's the Cleopatra scent
that I liked the most but this is what
they look like and I believe this set is
still available on the website so that
is the first item I picked up and the
second item I picked up with a little
palette this is adorable look at the
packaging on this this is called the
delicate eyeshadow palette again I think
this was around ten dollars this is from
Lisa for collection and I just could not
resist the packaging on honestly it was
the packaging to that it was the
packaging that's told me so it's just
this adorable little light pink and gold
box and I'm literally just ripping it
open here because I can't open it but
yeah I was super excited to get this I
think you get about ten or eight or ten
eyes shadows in here and this is what
the actual packaging looks like and this
is just too cute I know that it's not
super great for like putting inside of
your Alex series nine drawers because
it's literally a triangle but it's still
really cute so shows you different looks
at the top here um you don't have a
mirror which I don't like but this is
what the colors look like and I thought
this was just adorable so that is what
the palette looks like I will of course
do a follow-up haul exactly a week from
today to give you guys my final thoughts
but I think that is just an adorable
little palette the next item that I got
is from clean this is the rollerball
layering trio
it says introducing clean warm cotton
skin and air so this is supposed to be
like a little ornament that you could
put on your Christmas tree
I have not smelled any of these
together sense they'll be opening up so
I don't know what these smell like but
let's go ahead and take a little whiff
so this one is what that smells good and
by the way these are roller balls which
I normally don't like roller balls but I
don't I don't really mind
I don't know especially when it's like
$10 for the said oh my god that smells
so good this one is called skin that
smells absolutely incredible and then
like I said we also have air and warm a
cotton I think I've smelled warm cotton
before this is what warm cotton looks
like and then here is the one that is
called air so super excited to play
around with those I also did pick up a
little skin care set from Murad this was
$20 this is called the Bright Beginnings
environmental shear shield sure shield
the mystery what it will looks like and
in here you are getting a Murad
essential seek cleanser you're also
getting the essential seed daily
moisture cream and the Murad rapid age
spot and pigment lightening serum so
I've only tried one of the products in
here and that is the rapid age spot and
pigment lightening serum I tried that
when I was in high school after I dealt
with some really bad acne breakouts and
I remember it being kind of good it's
done my face a little bit
I felt like this was a pretty good deal
for $20 so this is what the cleanse
flash toner looks like it says cleanse
and tone and this is basically just the
vitamin C facial wash super excited to
try this out and then here is what the
little moisture cream looks like and
then the actual serum looks a little
something like this and it may look like
there's not a lot in there but I
remember a little goes a very long way
and also this is an extremely expensive
product I think this is around 60 or 70
dollars so anyway I think that mallick
it up I also did pick up another perfume
that's exactly what I need guys write
more perfume so this is actually a
rollerball this is the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana rose so if you guys didn't
know I do happy full-size of the Bourbon
perfume Anna when I first got bourbon I
also kind of tried out rose and I was
like I don't need it but then this
rollerball went on sale for like $18 one
day which is really really low and
normally these are like 25 or $35 so I
did pick it up it really smells good
it's like a smoky rose kind of scent so
you do get a nice amount of product in
here but what are you getting
oh it's covered I think it's 0.25 ounces
or something like that so you're getting
a nice amount of product here and this
is
what it looks like and it does pair of
very very beautifully with the Bourbon
perfume and they find a little kit that
I picked up I was so excited about and
this is still available for $10 on the
sephora.com website this is called the
essential Rose skin trio you are getting
one of their rose face masks in here 25
of the cleansing wipes which you guys
know I'm a huge fan of the cleansing
wipes I even have some out next to me
right now
I love these cleansing wipes these are
my all-time favorite cleansing wipes at
the moment and then also you're getting
one sleeping pod which is there
overnight masks which are really really
good as well so for 10 dollars this is a
really good deal highly highly recommend
going ahead and picking this up so here
are the goes cleansing wipes I just
dropped a little mask but the mask pot
is just basically a monopod so it's kind
of like a one use kind of thing however
I do notice that you can use it multiple
times it's kind of like a gel but you
guys know I love those clean cleansing
wipes cleaning wipes and then finally
you have the rose a face mask which
looks a little something like this
I'm not the biggest fan of their sheet
masks for the face but I really do like
the under eye mask so that was a great
little kit as well so anyway let me know
down below if you picked up and he have
the little Black Friday specials I will
be back in a week to give you guys my
final thoughts or my first impressions
on these products and yeah I will see
you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
