video is going to be a quick little
review on this new Sephora dry clean
instant brush dry brush cleaner spray
you get 2.0 fluid ounces the product in
here for $14 that is what it retails for
I will go ahead and link it below in the
description bar if you guys would like
to pick this product up but anyway this
is supposed to be a quick drying gentle
brush spray that instantly removes
makeup product and lifts impurities from
makeup brushes so that they are ready
for immediate reuse and no water is
necessary I was really interested in
this product because it is an aerosol
can which I thought was cool and the
fact that it is quick drying I thought
that would be awesome for like my eye
makeup brushes and things like that so
this is a nice product
I will not repurchase because it has the
most overpowering scent ever and I am
someone who can handle a lot of
fragrance you guys like I can burn like
literally 5/3 wick candles from Bath and
Body Works in one room at a time I
cannot handle the scent on this it is so
overpowering and after you clean your
makeup brushes it still smells like that
overpowering scent it's like grandma's
perfume very very old school makeup sort
of overpowering scent really really
don't like that I did use this product
to like I said clean all of my brushes
last night it did not clean my
foundation brush well whatsoever I think
that foundation brushes in general is
hard to find a quick kind of cleaner
that will actually get the gunk out so I
just recommend deep cleansing those
every single night but for the most part
it does remove residue from eye brushes
here I have two eye brushes these are
the Sigma tapered blending 35 brushes
what you do is you spray the product
right on to the bristle I would say two
to three sprays is exactly what you need
and then you wipe it off on a dry paper
towel and it completely takes the
product off it dries instantly quicker
than the Mac one and you're good to go
you can immediately use these right away
so I do like that it dries very quickly
there obviously is alcohol in here which
is why it dries so quickly so if you are
sensitive to first of all scent you're
not going to like these and second of
all if you are sensitive to alcohol you
are not going to like these but for the
most part I do think that it is great
for cleaning I brush it
as far as these brushes go I'm a little
worried too I did go ahead and use the
blush brush that I clean cleansed it
with yesterday when we now that made no
sense I used this product and cleansed
my blush brush yesterday and I did put
that on today and I felt a little bit of
stinging and tingling while I was
putting my blush on and I knew it was
probably because the alcohol in here and
also the scent the scent is just so
overpowering you spray it and literally
it's like you have like a cloud of
fragrance in the room that you're in I
don't even want to spray it in here
because this is a small closed off room
and I know that the scent won't go away
very quickly so that is like a big
downfall in my opinion like I said it's
great for makeup brushes you do need to
spray them about two to three times and
then wipe them but for the most part I
would not recommend using these for face
products because you know around your
face area it's probably gonna irritate
your skin it technically still could
irritate your eye area so if you are
sensitive to fragrance or if you are
sensitive to alcohol I really don't
recommend but I will use it up
completely it's just not something I
would repurchase and on top of that I
don't feel like you actually get that
much product in here for $14 you're only
getting two fluid ounces which is not
that much so overall really good concept
love the fact that it's in an aerosol
can I love that it's very quick drying
but for the most part it's just the
fragrance just too overpowering and I
can tell it is loaded with alcohol so
yeah I would not repurchase thank you
for joining me for this review guys and
I will see you in my next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
