this video I am giving you guys a review
and some swatches on three out of the
eight new Sephora collection Rouge bombs
with SPF 20 these are a sephora
exclusive they are part of their house
brand and they are twelve dollars and
fifty cents apiece
you do get 0.12 ounces of product in
here and they have eight different
shades ranging from a really really
light pink to a deep berry color which I
have right there and I am wearing it on
my lips right now
I just did a review and swatches on the
new Kat Von D everlasting lip duo and I
was wearing the shade Suspiria on my
lips I did take that off completely and
reapply with this particular product if
you're wondering the shade is called
mild plum so any color that you see on
my lips currently is color coming from
this not from the Suspiria shade so
anyway these are supposed to be a balmy
lipstick with a gel formula that
protects the lips while adding a
dazzling pop of color they're supposed
to nurture and protect in eight
different shades you're supposed to see
improvement to date over day with an
ultra comfortable formula each one
hydrates as it protects with SPF 20 wax
concentrates use of extract any vitamin
E derivative it says the creamy gel
texture delivers fresh and vibrant color
in one swipe with a dazzling juicy shine
from light reflecting pigments I agree
with all of that these are absolutely
amazing I thought these were gonna be
very similar to baby lips so I was like
I don't know I don't want to buy all
like eight of them for $12.50 apiece I
thought that that was kind of like that
was a lot but honestly I plan on
collecting all eight shades I think
they're amazing they really really
reminds me of the Lancome shine lover
lipsticks if you've ever tried those out
those are like a balmy sort of lipstick
that go on really nicely they stay so
moisturizing on the lips and they stay
extremely glossy on the lips as well so
it almost looks like you're wearing like
a gloss over your lipstick they're in no
way shape or form similar to baby lips
they glide on way easier they are much
more comfortable on the lips and they
definitely have a little more of like a
sleek texture to them the one thing I
like about baby lips is that they are
very very moisturizing but at the same
time they have a little more of a dry
formula so you basically can put them on
and not worry
about them getting on your teeth or
going outside of your lip line and
feathering because these tend to be a
little more emollient and oily not oily
but they're just a little more slick
they do start to feather outside of your
lip line if you do a lot of this which I
do and I also think that they're just
more pigmented than baby lips so they
tend to have that issue with a little
bit of feathering now they're not super
super pigmented to the point where
they're gonna get on your teeth or
anything like that these are so easy to
use they're just one of those products
you don't even have to think about you
can just brush onto your lips and you're
done you can do it without a mirror
they're really really fantastic but
overall I'm just super super impressed
with the quality and the formulation on
these I definitely plan on getting all
eight shades I think they're beautiful I
like all of them and all of the swatches
that you're seeing here right now I just
got it on my hands are just one swipe
swatches they don't really build up on
each other nicely I feel like baby lips
and like just tinted lip balms in
general don't really build up but like
this is what you get with one layer and
that's the kind of color you're gonna
get it's the same sort of thing with
these and now they're just awesome you
guys they're really really awesome
they're better than baby lips at my
opinion you do get SPF 20 in there which
is great so they're fantastic for the
summer time and yeah I really have
nothing bad to say about these I just
think they're really really great they
are not completely transfer proof as you
guys can probably see they do have that
sort of pigment there but I just love
how glossy they stay on the lips I love
the pigmentation and most of all I love
how comfortable they are so this is what
the outer packaging looks like they just
kind of correspond with the actual shade
that you got the three shades I picked
up our zero nine miles plum and I have
that one swatched right there and this
is just a beautiful kind of berry color
and these kind of have like a sweet sort
of like grape soda smell to them and at
first one I opened it up I was like
maybe it smells like grape soda because
it's like a purple color but no they all
kind of smell like that so that is mild
plum right there and then the next one I
got is this shade right here which is
called gentle coral 0/5 and this is like
a bright orange --red shade
really really enjoy this one and I have
that swatch too right there and I feel
they are pretty true to what they look
like in the packaging and then the last
one that I picked up is called
enchanting blush which is a beautiful
kind of I don't know I feel like it
looked a little more pink in the tube
but it honestly pulls a little more of a
warm tone than it looks like as you guys
can probably see from the packaging it
pulled a little more of like a warm sort
of undertone than a cool toned pinky
color but I really like it I think it's
beautiful and yeah those are all three
of the shades that I picked up like I
said these are incredibly comfortable to
wear I'm loving them I think this is
going to be a go-to products for me
during the summer I am one of those
people I'm all about just having
comfortable things on my lips at all
times but I love that I can get a nice
amount of shiny pigmentation with these
without having to worry about them you
know getting on my teeth or just being
like having to reapply them throughout
the day they do last quite a long time I
would say even with eating and drinking
about 4 to 5 hours which is really good
for a bomb but yeah they're just really
really fantastic and I highly recommend
that you guys check these out so I hope
you enjoyed this quick little review and
swatches on the new Sephora collection
Rouge bomb stains thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
