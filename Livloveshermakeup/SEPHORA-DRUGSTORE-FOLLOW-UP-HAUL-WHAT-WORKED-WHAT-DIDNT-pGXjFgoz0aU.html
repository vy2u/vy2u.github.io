today I finally have my Sephora as well
as my drugstore follow-up haul to share
with you guys so first impressions as
well as final thoughts on the items that
I hauled I will go ahead and throw up in
the original hauls and the cards if you
would like to check them out but let's
go ahead and jump right into it I have
everything kind of mixed together so
this is the Burt's Bees micellar
cleansing water it is a three and one
that removes makeup it cleanses and it
hydrates it does not hydrate the skin it
does cleanse the skin but I would not
really necessarily say it removes makeup
all that well either I just really like
this for in the morning what I have
residual eye makeup so if I have
cleansed my face at night before and I
wake up and there's still a little bit
of eyeliner or mascara I like to use
this around my eye area now it kind of
irritates the skin on my forehead for
whatever reason but it doesn't irritate
my eyes so I probably would repurchase
to get 12 fluid ounces of product in
here for around ten to eleven dollars so
pretty good micellar water that is
cruelty free up next we have the Urban
Decay afterglow highlighting palette
this is the ONS also known as the
one-night-stand palette I really do like
this I did a it's on sale is it worth it
video featuring this palette so if you
would like to see that I'll throw it up
in the cards you give for a different
really really nice kind of bronze e with
a few little pinky kind of golden tones
in here and these are beautiful
highlights I feel like they go onto the
skin really nicely and they hang in all
day long so if you were looking for a
really nice palette that is currently on
sale and so far as well as Ulta for $19
and something that's gonna stick around
on your skin I feel like this is
definitely something to look into
especially if you love more bronzy toned
highlights now another palette that I
have here is actually a 50 Kat Von D and
metal matte mini and I do have this on
my eyes today
paired together with one of these Tila
glitter and glow duochrome so the shades
that I'm wearing today are basically
suede in my crease is my transition as
well as oak all over in my crease and
then I do have flash on my lid and then
I topped it with C siren nazi siren into
the blue no sorry I'm forgetting the
dual chrome that I have on my eyes today
that is this deal the glittering globe
I'll link it down below but yeah this is
a beautiful palette I'm very very high
that I know some people have not been
enjoying this palette but I've been
enjoying it a lot I do think the mats
are a little more difficult to work with
however the beautiful kind of shimmery
and foil shades on the top are really
really nice and buttery so I would
recommend looking into the Kat Von D
metal matte mini if you did not get the
full-size one here from the drugstore we
have the NIC suborn to glow and
illuminate a primer in the shade of
pearl I'm sorry in the shade of white it
says a primer that gives the face a
luminous glow while targeting dull skin
for a brighter more radiant appearance I
love this this is probably my all-time
favorite illuminating primer that I've
found ever I'm not really a huge fan of
the Becca backlight priming filter as
well as the first light priming filter I
feel like they leave a little bit of an
artificial cast on my skin this however
really goes on nicely it's kind of like
a mix of a hydrating primer it gives a
little bit of a glow but not like an
artificial cast and then I also has the
tiniest bit of like a silicone slope to
it so I really like this for my dry skin
would highly recommend you guys look
into this it does leave a little bit of
a white cast on my skin so I am looking
for a deeper shade but I really do enjoy
that and this is the diamond fire
highlight and I really really enjoy this
you guys and this is what it looks like
you can see there's a bunch of different
kind of multi-dimensional sort of colors
multi-dimensional whatever a
multi-faceted different colors going on
here you have greens and purples and you
know everything together kind of comes
out to be this very icy blueish purple
II kind of color I'm very into colorful
highlights like this now everybody's
highlight is supposed to be a little
different and just depending on which
colors are mixed but mine comes off very
very icy and curly I do like to mix this
together with highlights to have a
little more depth to them just because I
feel like right now if I have a stark
white kind of highlight on my skin it
doesn't look as natural when I am self
tanned but still a beautiful beautiful
formula would highly recommend checking
out in the chocolate diamond fire
highlight are you moving on we have the
pixie skin treats a nourishing cleansing
balm I picked this up at Target I'm
actually loving this I know a lot of you
do not like this product I believe it's
because it leaves a little bit of an
oily residue on the skin but what I like
to do is actually take this remove my
makeup so I applied this all over my
face with a dry fingers onto dry skin
and then I get a warm washcloth wet and
then I go ahead and I just wipe off and
it comes off completely it never strips
my skin it leaves a little bit of
moisture so
is actually a product I would recommend
if you absolutely hate oily oily
cleansing pumps and you don't like
something that has to be used with a
washcloth would not what recommend but I
do like that for my dry skin up next
from Sephora I picked up the Ordinaries
grande active retinoid 2% emulsion as
well as the high adherence silicone
primer I'm loving both of these and this
is really really nice at night time if
you are someone who is usually pretty
sensitive to retinols I would highly
recommend you look into this you can use
it around the eye area I avoid it kind
of around my mouth area but I did start
to use it a few days ago around my eye
area and it works just fine a very very
beautiful beautiful retinal emulsion so
would highly recommend you check that
out I think it's around 9 possibly like
$13 so these sephora.com website which
is a steal and then here we have me hide
here in silicone primer high adherence a
blurring surface smoother and primer I
have it on today I do enjoy this quite a
bit I feel like it's sort of similar to
the NYX illuminating primer but it
doesn't have illuminating benefits this
retails for about five dollars which is
amazing you do get one fluid ounce of
product in here and I do it like that it
does help to prolong the wear of my
makeup throughout the day it's not the
best primer I've ever tried I still do
prefer the next one just a little more
but this has some hydrating properties
in there as well as some silicone a sort
of pore filling properties so if you're
really really dry skin and you can't use
something like the benefit Porefessional
like that's just a way way way to
silicone base for you you would probably
actually really enjoy this because it
does have some moisturizing benefits so
I have been enjoying that and will
probably repurchase moving on from the
drugstore I picked up the Physicians of
formula witnesses called mineral wear
talk a free all-in-one cushion
foundation with SPF 50 in the shade
lights not the most hydrating cushion
foundation that I've ever found I don't
like to necessarily use this little guy
right here I have tried using it I like
it for touch-ups but I basically will
just bounce right into the product with
a damped sponge and I apply it to my
face in this particular shade is a
little dark for me but because it is a
little more of a light coverage
foundation it's not as noticeable as
long as I pair it together with like my
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder or my ELF tone correcting powder
and cool it does lighten things up a
little bit as I'm looking for a better
Christian foundation so let me know if
you have any recommendations
up next we have another product here
from Pixie this is the h2o skin drink
pure hydration a gel it is very very
beautiful I've been enjoying this a lot
it does have all sorts of different
ingredients in here and it does have a
little bit of fragrance to it so if
you're super sensitive this might bother
you
I noticed that gives me a little bit of
tingling sensations if I get it anywhere
near my eyes however I really like this
I feel like I'm going through it pretty
darn quickly I do have dry skin so maybe
I'm using a little more than I need to
but I do mix this together with an oil
and it gives me all day hydration and I
really do enjoy it so I would definitely
repurchase that and then also from pixie
the glow tonic 5% glycolic acid and aloe
vera cleansing pads are pretty nice i
prefer the liquid formula just because i
mean i prefered these for convenience
obviously but I don't feel like these
are as saturated as I can get like a
cotton pad with the normal glow tonic so
I do prefer the normal glow tonic
probably wouldn't repurchase these guys
but still really really nice if you're
looking for something to help with
breakouts which I have been breaking out
this week as well it's something that
will go ahead and brighten up your
complexion and make it look not as dull
so I do enjoy that there we have the
Milani make it last setting spray I am
obsessed you guys can see I've used a
lot of this it is beautiful I love the
scent I know a lot of you were saying
actually be careful because there is
alcohol in here but the majority of my
setting sprays do have alcohol in them
it's very hard to find one that doesn't
I've tried it the Too Faced hangover RX
as well as the Smashbox photo finish
primer water which is my all-time
favorite those ones don't have alcohol
but this one right here I feel like as
long as it's not like a skin spray where
I'm just spraying directly onto my skin
I'm okay with having just a little bit
of alcohol in it the alcohol is going to
help to prolong your makeup throughout
the day so I'm okay with spraying a full
face with this on but I'm not gonna use
this as like a primer or anything like
that work it's too close to my skin and
then here we have the wet and wild photo
focus pressed powder in the shade a warm
light so this is way too dark for me
even when I am self tan but I like using
it for a light contour and now it's a
very very silky finely milled powder so
if you are looking for something that
will set in like a BB cream or a CC
cream or even a tinted moisturizer this
will do the job if you have really
really oily skin I would not recommend
this it's probably not going to give you
enough sort of a shine proof
we're throughout the day up next we have
the Knicks ombre blush in the shade a
soft flush this is absolutely gorgeous
and I want to pick up all of the nicks
of blushes now or at least the ombre
blushes they do have a gorgeous mirror
and I love that they have the highlight
at the bottom and then be a really
really rich pigmentation and matte kind
of blush down here this is a gorgeous
shade I love it on my cheeks a lot of
you were complimenting me last week when
I was wearing this so yeah I really do
enjoy that like I said when I pick up
the other ones in the collection here we
have the Becca what is this called
liquid crystal lip topper globe loss in
the shade of champagne dream flashes
Bellini I purchased this for $15 on sale
on the Sephora calm website but I would
not purchase this full price
these have a pretty interesting scent to
them very very sunscreen sort of scent I
made on top of that I feel like you can
get something at the drugstore that will
do the same thing it is nice for tapping
right on to the lower part of your lip
as well as the upper part of your lip
that's actually what I have on today on
top of a liquid lipstick just to give it
a little more moisture but it's not
anything groundbreaking and it's not
anything too special so definitely would
not obviously repurchase something like
that but that is B Becca lip topper and
then here we have from the drugstore the
Milani retouch and erase light lifting
concealer this does not have as much
coverage as I was hoping for however if
the shade light is quite nice it does
have a lot of yellow undertones to it so
if you're someone who does have a yellow
undertones in your skin you would
probably enjoy this I like the way it
goes on my only complaint is I don't
really like the packaging I feel like
this is not super super hygienic and
then when you squeeze it out I feel like
way too much comes out at once however
it's beautiful it really does look like
skin so if you want a nice kind of
hydrating a solid medium coverage
concealer would highly recommend at the
Milani one up next we have the Burt's
Bees goodness glozell liquid and makeup
in the shade ivory I told you guys in my
sales of holy grails on Sunday I really
really do enjoy this product it's
absolutely beautiful
I feel like if I go ham with this I do
notice that I get a little bit of
separation throughout the day so I only
use a one to two pumps and I use that
with a damp sponge and then I set it in
with a powder but overall really really
beautiful love the way it goes on to the
skin I know so many people hate this but
if you have dry skin you definitely
should give it a go and finally guys we
have the Alba Botanica Hawaiian a detox
scrub this is an aunt
pollution volcanic clay hypoallergenic
scrub and it is absolutely amazing it
smells really good kind of like
pineapple I'm deathly allergic to
pineapple so I was trying to look at the
ingredients list here to make sure that
there's not like pineapple in here even
if it went on my skin I don't think it
would give me an allergic reaction it's
more like if I ingest it but it smells
great I do it like the upper a sickness
that it has now I know that sounds kind
of bad but I really do feel like it gets
all the gunk out of my pores so I will
go ahead and dampen my face with some
water I'll put this on oh really scrub
in circular motions I let it sit for a
few minutes then I rinse it off with
cool water and my skin feels super nice
and soft and glowy don't overuse this
because it will strip your skin um but
you know once or twice a week it's
really really good so yeah how does the
new scrub that I'm really loving from
the drugstore so anyway guys that is it
for my follow-up haul I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
you guys and I will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
