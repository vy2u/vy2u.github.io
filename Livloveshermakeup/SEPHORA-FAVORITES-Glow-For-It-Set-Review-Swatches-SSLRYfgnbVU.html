video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Sephora favorites

new it is a limited edition this is a
$75 value but you can get it for $30 on
these sephora.com website I will have it
linked down below if you would like to
pick it up and obviously it is exclusive
to Sephora since it's a sephora favorite
set inside of here you are getting a
multi branded sampler set of six liquid
powder gel cream and oil highlighters
all in a collectible box and it's really
really cool because you are actually
getting a full-sized product in here and
that is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in moonstone and that is the
liquid version so you're getting 0.68
ounces of that you're also getting zero
point zero eight ounces of the Benefit
Cosmetics what's up what's up what's
cream to powder highlighter in the shade
champagne zero point ten ounces of the
cover FX custom infusion drops in the
sea plus lemongrass radiance version
OHSO zero point two zero four nine
ounces of the hourglass ambient strobe
lighting powder in incandescent strobe
light you're also getting 0.14 ounces of
the Lancome glow sub teal silky creme
highlighter in glowing lights zero six
and zero point one ounces of the milk
makeup sunshine oil I was very excited
to get my hands on this I also picked up
another set from them I normally don't
pick up these sets honestly because I
already I tend to already have the
products like in my collection but there
was only one in here that I had already
tried well two in here that I've already
tried and a few of them I was really
really curious about so I finally went
ahead and picked up Easter for a
favorite set so anyway here is what the
outer packaging bit the outer packaging
will looks like it's a beautiful kind of
tan pinky color and it's kind of like a
collector's item box you could probably
keep it on to store things and you have
a kaleidoscope effect here and these are
all of your products so you are getting
a few deluxe sizes in here and then
you're getting that full size of the
Becca
so anyway we're gonna go ahead and start
with the Lancome product so this is the
Lancome Lancome glow subdial silky creme
highlighter in the shade glowing lights
a zero six if this is what the outer
packaging looks like so so so pretty and
I remember when these hit the market I
was so tempted to buy one um I everyone
was saying they're very similar
to the colour-pop highlighters and i
think they are slightly similar but not
completely I do feel like this one has a
little more of a domotic own feel to it
it's easier to blend onto the skin even
though the colour-pop ones are very easy
to blend this one is just a little bit
easier and because it does have so much
to metha cone or silicone in it it does
slip and slide on the face
I think this shade right here is 0-6 is
absolutely beautiful I have it's watched
right here on top it's really really
gorgeous and I do feel like these
sephora favorite sets sets always cater
towards every single skin tone every
single skin tone and every single skin
type because you're getting cranes
you're getting founders you're getting
oil thing here so no matter what skin
tone or skin type you have you could
definitely pick up at this particular
set so it's a beautiful beautiful kind
of rose gold bronzy color and it's so
shiny on the skin it is a crema product
and when you open it up it looks pretty
much just like one of those marbled
finish color pop highlighters and ice
like I said I'm not a huge fan of the
color pop highlighters I just feel like
this is a lot more soft to the touch and
I think it just builds up absolutely
beautifully on the skin so even though
this is darker than my particular
complexion it doesn't mean that I can't
have glowy skin with it so I really do
like that product and I'm quite
impressed like I said the only thing I
don't like is that the wear time because
it is so slippery on the skin
the wear time is not very good so if you
do have combo to oily skin definitely
set that in with a powder think that's
what we're going to talk about is the
what's up or from benefit if this is a
liquid to powder highlighter and the
sheet is called champagne this is what
it looks like and it's very very
beautiful this is so shiny looking on
the skin I have it's watched right here
for you guys really really beautiful I
love the way it goes on I do prefer the
Lancome color over this one but this one
still has that gorgeous gorgeous like
wet but dry thing going on so it looks
absolutely beautiful on the skin a very
very multi-dimensional look I think it's
nice for kind of highlighting down the
bridge of your nose and like your
Cupid's bow and your chin if you do have
like ombre or oily skin but you
definitely need to apply these before
going in with your powder so if you do
have combo to oily skin and you really
want to powder your face just make sure
you do it after you put this on if that
makes sense but I think if you have dry
skin you would absolutely adore those
first two products there because they're
very very nice on the skin
they're definitely not drying and they
don't emphasize any fine lines or
texture so really adore that the next
item we are going to talk about is the
hourglass incandescent strobe lighting
powder now you guys know if you've been
watching my channel for a while I love
these strobing powders from hourglass
they are one of my all-time favorite
highlighter formulations so I was more
than happy to pick up the set with a
little baby size because I do you have
this particular shade in a full-size and
it's a gorgeous gorgeous kind of cool
toned pinky color and what I love again
about this set is that they have warm
tones they have cool tone so it doesn't
matter what kind of undertone you have
it will work for you you know you'll
have a you know selection of products to
choose from so anyway there is
incandescent strobe light it's beautiful
I love the formulation on this they are
so soft and buttery and they're very
similar to the ambient lighting powders
except they do have tiny tiny micro
shimmers in there you don't even notice
them on the skin I swear to you it feels
like a little baby but like it feels
amazing and they're very very beautiful
if you've never worn any of the
hourglass lighting powders before they
really do kind of cancel out like it's
almost like they conceal the skin you
literally can just dust them all over
your face and it kind of gives like a
what does it call take a blurring effect
to your skin it's very interesting but
yeah I love this product they wear a
very great nice amount of time if you
are combo to oily skins and I feel like
these would still work for you if you do
have dry skin because they're so finely
milled alright moving on we are going to
go into the full size item here is the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector this is
the liquid version in moonstone I was so
excited because at first I was like I
don't need that set I don't need that
set it's gonna be opal guess what it's
moonstone if you are a fair skinned girl
like I am opal is just not really like
the best highlighting color I think the
reason why everybody loves the shade
opal is because it's just right in the
middle and I feel like a lot of people
just have like a medium skin tone if
that makes sense so I always felt like
of the really really darker girls and
they're really really lighter girls like
myself where I always just kind of like
opals okay but moonstone I think is
beautiful especially if you do have
fair-skinned and here is the packaging
they did change the packaging on it
these liquid versions they used to come
in a pump but I actually think I would
prefer that but anyway this is a sheer
um creme liquid that perfects the skin
with ultra fine light reflecting pearls
for a soft natural glow
and I do have it's watched right there
so I really like the shade of moonstone
it definitely has a stronger yellow
undertone or like a warm undertone so if
you have fair skin with a warm undertone
you would love this my favorite way to
use this is just to squeeze a little bit
into my foundation mix it together then
put it on my face I think it looks
absolutely beautiful that way and I love
the way the light you know kind of hits
it you can use it if you do excuse me
bug in my throat if you do have dry skin
you definitely could use it just as a
highlight and just put it on with your
fingers it's so easy to blend beautiful
beautiful consistency but I think it
really really looks amazing when you mix
it with your foundation so very very
happy that that was in there and then
the last two products are actually oils
so they're not going to swatch out very
well I'm just going to tell you guys
what I do with them the first is the
cover FX custom infusion drops this is
in the radiance um set or the radiance
of version they have like the block
drops they have all these sorts of
different drops these are really cool
now I will say this thing is super super
tiny and I've used this I think two or
three times now and as you can see like
I've I've taken a good chunk out of
there so what you do is mix 1/2 to 3/4
whatever you want however many drops you
want into your foundation or you can
just use it as a hydrating oil to prep
your face for a foundation so if you
want to use this kind of like you would
use the Smashbox primer oil you can do
that as well
if you have dry skin but for me
personally I like to add like one or two
drops of this into my foundation if you
guys didn't know Wayne Goss talks about
this a lot but anytime you add like a
drop of oil into your foundation I swear
to you it goes onto the skin so much
more beautifully even if you are like
acne prone or you have sensitive skin or
even just like oily skin combo skin it
will still work for you I got a really
really worried trying to mix oil into my
foundation but I swear to you it looks
beautiful so these are really really
cool they do have a nice little scent to
them as well yeah they have like an
interesting scent it's almost like
dandelions or something I know not
everybody likes the scent of dandelions
but this is a very cool product and it
definitely makes me want to go ahead and
check out some of the other cover
effects like little drops that they have
alright and then the last item that you
get in this kit is the milk makeup
sunshine oil so milk makeup is one of
the newer brands to Sephora I was
excited to see this I do have their
cooling hydrating like water stick which
i think is awesome if you have like oily
or combo skin especially during the
summer time so I'm trying to open this
open anyway this is the cool product so
basically this is one of those oils you
wouldn't necessarily mix with your
foundation since it is a rollerball
style as you guys can see what you do is
just roll or roll it onto your face
where you need extra moisture if you do
have dry skin and you want to put it
over your foundation you could probably
get away with that if you have gone bar
oily probably not but what I like to do
is basically use this like I would with
a Smashbox primer oil so I put it all
over my face for a little bit of extra
hydration I do feel like it helps my
makeup to a hear throughout the day and
it's just a really nice product to
elster smells quite good so that is that
little guy so overall I think this is a
really cool set oils are really in right
now so I thought it was cool they
included those you have a powder
highlight for those of you who are oily
beasts like me where we have a wonderful
like a mixer product and this is a
full-size then you have that gorgeous
Lancome highlighter and this could be
whatever you want it to be it could be a
highlight it could be you know a blush
topper it could be a blush if your a
fair enough really really gorgeous and I
just think all of these are incredibly
beautiful really really diverse
everybody could use them and then the
Watts op is very cool as well I do want
to say this dries out pretty darn
quickly I don't know if I mentioned that
yet so definitely dig into this right
away but overall really beautiful little
set definitely worth the $30 in my
opinion and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and swatches thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
