this video I have a quick little
collective Sephora haul to share with
you guys I think I played to everything
in two orders so if you see double the
samples that that is why I do want to
say really quickly I do plan on doing a
follow-up all next week on this
particular hall and also the Sephora
haul I did about a week and a half ago
on my channel so i'm gonna combine the
two for next week i know i had a
question about if i was going to do a
follow paul on that and i will i'm just
gonna throw them together because i
thought what the hell they're from the
same place so anyway let's go ahead and
get started shall we and the first item
that i purchased is actually from nista
for a house brand so the reason i wanted
to purchase this was just because I
actually do like a lot of the products
from the Sephora house brand and I've
never tried anything from their hair
care line or their skincare line so I
did pick up the Sephora express dry
shampoo it says odor-eliminating formula
fast fresh and clean so we shall see how
this works out if you don't get that
much product in your like 1.5 7 ounces
it doesn't feel like there's that much
in here but i do love these 24 rouge
bones and also the sephora outrageous
curl mascara so i thought i would go
ahead and try out a hair care item from
their house brand alright moving on it
the next two items i purchase were some
more of these just 80 facial Cotton's i
love these these are like a necessity
for me now these are nine dollars and
fifty cents a pack i believe which is a
lot oh but you do get 865 sheets of one
hundred percent pure cotton in here it
is extremely soft around the eye area
and i highly highly recommend looking
into these you don't need to use them
for everything like toner or micellar
water i personally still use my target
up and up what are they called dual
resurfacing this that's not what they're
called those are the rock resurfacing
just what I they called um I don't know
but they're like cotton ovals premium
cotton all those I think that's what
they're called on the up-and-up premium
pot and opals are really nice because
they're huge and they're a lot cheaper
than these so I like to use those for
toner and micellar water but these are
beautiful for the eye area they really
really are nice and they won't pull and
tug at that very sensitive skin around
your eyes so
I highly recommend looking into those
you will not find anything softer in the
next item I had purchased was this
clinic uplighting illuminating powder
and by the time you guys are watching
this there is already a review up on my
channel for this particular product put
the shade that I picked up with 01 nude
glow and this is what it looks like I do
have this on today as a blush topper
it's absolutely stunning and beautiful
it is pressed a little friendly but I
really do like it and it's got some
gorgeous packaging you do get nine point
six grams of product in here way is that
right yeah nine point six grams of
product which is huge and I think this
was around thirty dollars so anyway
there is nude glose watched on my hand
really beautiful product and I'm very
very excited to continue playing with
that alright the next item I got were a
will to i should say the next two items
like that were the only henriksen truth
facial waters and also the grease relief
facial water did I say facial waters yes
so there's two of them all I henriksen
finally went ahead and released some
facial sprays you guys know I'm obsessed
with facial spray so I was super super
super excited to see these so the first
one is the truth facial water this
energizes and hydrates with mandarin
white tee and pomegranate and this is
what the actual packaging looks like
you'd you get for fluid ounces in here
which is a little more than the standard
amount for a facial spray it does come
in a plastic bottle however I do trust
the truth line I really really enjoy the
scent on this and i love the serum that
they have so i thought i would try this
out and we shall see how that works as a
free facial spray it was going to pay
for a shal spray and then the other one
that I got is the grease relief so this
helps to purify and mattify your skin
with lactic acid poulton seal and hops
extract and you guys know I'm a huge fan
of the grease relief spazzing cloth so I
thought I would try this one out as well
since IM oily two combo skin or combo to
oily skin and i do get very very well
oily during the summertime starts out
that would help with my skin a little
bit all right in the next item that I
got was a little collection of body
butters this is the Korres luxury body
butter kit and I have been eyeing this
for a while on the sephora.com website
and I finally just went ahead and
purchased it so we have different scents
in here and though that's what was like
Lauren the end basically where the Sun
so
the first one right here is Japanese
rose and this is a delicate and sweet
rosebud scent and then we have guava
which is an invigorating blend of
tropical fruits and the next one is
called fig and this is a juicy scent of
freshly cut figs and then we have yogurt
and yogurt is a refreshing clean
authentic experience so I just thought
this would be nice to have they come in
these little 1.69 squeezy bottles
basically so you get 1.69 of bounces of
product in here I cannot speak one point
six nine ounces of product in here which
is a nice amount and I just thought the
fragrances sounded really really nice
for the summertime and also I thought
these would be perfect for traveling so
I picked it that up and I'm very very
excited to play with those I will
definitely let you guys know what I
think of them next week alright let's
talk about some point perks and little
codes and things like that so I typed in
the code for the fresh Umbreon umbreon
clay purifying facial toner this is what
it looks like and I've heard that the
Umbrian line is really really good for
problematic skin so yeah it says that it
mattifies the skin it minimizes the
appearance of pores and it's good a fort
breakout so I'm very very excited to try
this out I also went ahead and picked up
the 100-point perk of the jack black
deep dive glycolic facial cleanser this
is technically supposed to be like a
man's brand but I wanted to try it out I
love glycolic acid I think it's so nice
and exfoliating the skin and I was so
clearing out d congested or you know
congested skin so on this has kaolin
clay and volcanic ash in it as well so
I'm super excited to try that out let's
see here what else they also got to be
Lancome what is this hydration infusion
melt in sleeping mask I thought this
would be interesting I love anything
that has to do with masking and I do
like sleeping mask quite a bit so I
picked that one up from Lancome and then
I also got to the formula x full
strength nail polish this is just a nice
like nudie pinky color I thought that
would make my nails look really nice and
healthy and then as far as samples are
concerned I got two samples of the
doctor brand to choose to infuse powered
OCH fighter vitamin c twenty percent
complex so you have the twenty percent
calm
at the top and then you have the face
cream at the bottom again twenty percent
complex at the top and then you have the
face cream at the bottom and then we
have the Amica nourishing mask i also
picked that up the Amica products melt
really freaking good so I'm excited for
that I also got these just 80 Benefield
wriggle resist when t4i cream I do have
a full size of this and I'm i ordered
like the the sample that i picked was
supposed to be there abu ki sleeping
mask but you know it obviously was sold
out and then this one is the md solar
sciences daily i repair emulsion i also
picked that and then the last sample
that i picked with the belief the true
cream moisturizing balm so anyway those
are all of the items that I picked up at
sephora i hope you guys enjoyed this
quick little haul thank you so much for
joining me and i'll see you guys
