as you guys can see I ordered some items
on the online website I already
separated these samples and the point
perk whatever like little points things
that you can get just because they were
really really cluttering everything in
here um they did come in two separate
boxes but this was one order um so I
don't really I don't really know what
happened with that because the boxes
were super super beat up which is like
really strange for sephora i normally
have really really good like nice boxes
really sturdy and whatnot both of them
were like they have holes in them I
thought something was going to break
nothing did break but um they ended up
sending me like triple the samples if
you guys have watched any hall from
Sephora that I've done recently ever
since I moved to Milwaukee for some
reason every time I pick my free samples
they send me double so this time it
looks like they sent triple I don't know
if it's because they sent the two like
different orders I mean they weren't
different orders that's the thing they
sent the one order in two different
boxes which is really strange for
Sephora normally they would just do one
big box but it was around the holidays
than I guess they were out so they sent
me lots of samples and I also did use up
a lot of hundred point perks I think I
had 900 points and I did I was not
interested in any of the 500 points um
perks that they had like the little kids
so I just ordered a bunch of 100.1 and i
will show you guys that after i go
through the main stuff so the first
thing i purchased was a new Beauty
Blender I just get the original one on
the pink one it's the best in my opinion
I've tried the white one and I've tried
the black one I swear they just did not
work as well seriously this is what it
looks like right now it's a dry feels
really soft interesting mine has gotten
all pristine disgusting um yeah mine is
over there and it basically has like
chunks missing out of it you know that
when you're um like foundation sponges
or whatever start to fall apart it's
probably time to get a new one so I did
that and then in the sale section i saw
this bare minerals and mineral licks
urza's alright minimal xers yeah facial
cleansing oil you get six fluid ounces
in
which is a lot of product and this is a
cleanser for dry skin or you can use it
as a makeup remover which that's what I
will be doing because I have combination
skin but this is what it looks like and
it was on sale it was like half the
price and I just thought you know what I
love my beau sean makeup break up cool
cleansing oil but this was I think like
eleven dollars and a full-size of the
bow Siobhan is 30 so I just thought why
not try this if I don't like it then
that's fine I do have a friend with dry
skin who would probably like it as a
cleanser but um it looks like you use it
the same way you put it on dry skin and
then you just rinse with warm water so
I'm excited to try it out I'll let you
guys know if it's as good as the bow
show on but yeah definitely check that
out if you're still having I don't know
if they're still having that sale thing
where you can get an extra like
twenty-five percent off sale items but
check to see if that's there another
little set that was in the sail area and
I didn't get that deal that twenty-five
percent off to go because I ordered this
before but that's okay they were still
really really good like all the prices
these are the only henriksen your skin
is a gift to be treasured glow on the go
trio so this is a set of three um
cleansing white packets you can use
these um to remove makeup they deliver
anti-aging benefits um they're on the go
you can use it to cleanse your face in
the morning that's probably what i'll
use them for these are really really
expensive so i probably won't use them
to remove my makeup because it takes at
least three wipes for me to completely
remove everything off my face and I
don't want to waste them I really like
the Olay henriksen brand especially
lately so I thought this would be fun to
try out and you know when I'm gonna
curry in the morning maybe I could grab
one of these and wipe my face quickly
instead of grabbing my micellar water
let me open it up so we can see come on
you can do it open okay it's a really
cute little um a really cute little box
yeah so there's like not a lot in each
little packet which is why I want to use
them not from makeup remover removal so
this is the only henriksen grease relief
cleansing cloths this is oil free pour
refining it has botanical
thas and eucalyptus to exfoliate to
clarify and refine the pores and they
just smell it mm-hmm oh my gosh it
smells great that's going to be super
super refreshing so that is the first
one that you get in this little kit the
second one is the purple one this is the
nurture me cleansing cloth it is the
makeup removing one it's got Moringa and
borage borage seed oils I don't know
remove all traces of waterproof mascara
we'll see about that ooh this up it
smells exactly like their truth serum
they are vitamin C serum oh really
really nice I love things that smell
good and here we have the clean truth
cleansing cloth these are the
brightening ones with vitamin C so these
probably smell like that too like orange
it's not like an orange creamsicle this
has vitamin C and coq10 it cleanses it
brightens and hydrates and it
illuminates so maybe these would be
really good in the morning oh no they
don't smell nearly as good why do the
triple one well like the vitamin C one
that's kinda strange alright well that's
fine I am excited to try those and I
think those will just be nice when I'm
in a hurry in the morning I can grab one
of those it seems like the eucalyptus
one and the orange one would be really
really refreshing alright the next thing
I got was this little urban decay travel
size set of five delirious 24-7 glide on
eye pencils this is one of my favorite
formulas of I pencils ever so I thought
what the heck I probably should just go
ahead and get this and then I went to
alter the other day and I saw their
little kit and I was like are you
kidding me like I chose the wrong one oh
the one that they came out with for
Sephora is just I don't know it's got
like a lot of like jewel tones you get
it green a purple a blue but the one is
also looked so much better it's just
like a lot more neutral and pretty and I
totally just room this packaging open
why do I have such troubles all right
cute what have I done alright I'm going
to watch these because I to live with I
pencils have a lot of these this is muse
and I
our limited-edition shades this is kind
of just like a dark brown and we'll see
here yeah just kind of like a dark brown
but it's cool toned very very pretty and
the formula on these are amazing they
last all day on your waterline one of my
favorites for sure I definitely don't
have this one I don't think I really
don't know I have so many of these
pencils and they come out with like a
new kit every single year and i always
get it um but who knows I mean the
colors are pretty I'll use them this is
called accused it is a beautiful blue
color with a bunch of baby blue sparkles
in it there's a ques very very pretty
i'm excited to use that especially
during the spring and summer and then we
have delirious which is the purple kind
of eggplant shade with a lot of shimmer
in it as well yeah it's got a little
pink shimmers in it really really pretty
so that's one is right there and then
what is going on with my hair it's just
like all fluffy whatever um then we have
this I like this color a lot this is
zodiac it's kind of like that all of the
green color it's like a murky green
color but it's got gold shimmer in it
and it's really really beautiful so
there it is these are going to be a pain
in the ass to remove I already know that
but I really wanted to swatch them again
these were on sale I don't know if
they're still on the sale part of the
website but i think it's like what
fifteen dollars but that little kid or
something something like that however I
do kind of wish that I had gotten the UM
the other one wait what happened it's
one of them didn't wash my did um but
yeah i saw the Ulta one and it was just
so much more neutral and like natural
everyday sort of colors these are pretty
these jewel tones are very pretty but I
don't feel like I would wear them on a
daily basis so I don't know I probably
should have picked up the altar wanna
throw elbows are so many I laters and so
many of that formula so I just thought I
shouldn't you know I want alright here's
another little sample hidden
alright the next thing I got was because
of my friend Leora or liras makeup loved
52 she did a blush stash video where she
showed like her sash and she showed this
blush and I love the formulation of the
two-faced love flush these are the
long-lasting 16-hour blushes I have
justified my love and love hangover and
the reason I didn't get the little
palette that came out a couple weeks ago
was because I actually want to get 8 I
want to get every single one in a full
size that's how much I like the formula
so this is your love is king it's a
beautiful kind of berry color and such
cute packaging this is the color oh
isn't that pretty oh my gosh i love it
let me swatch it it looks so beautiful
i'm really into these berry shades right
now especially during the winter i think
it's so nice so there is the color right
there I think it will be absolutely
gorgeous as long as you use a light hand
and I'm really really excited i already
know i love the formulation okay so i
don't think i'm going to have any issues
i do want to collect all of them you
need both sides alright and then I got
in the first aid Beauty facial radiance
pads I have gotten like a little deluxe
like packet of these at one point over
the summer and I just remember the mean
really really nice they're not like the
dr. dennis gross ones where they like
literally like burn your face off and
they don't irritate your skin as much as
the peter thomas roth um I'm wrinkle
peel pad so it can be a little
irritating if you overuse them but they
still are a favorite of mine but these
were just nice literally I had no
burning sensation or anything they
exfoliate tone and brighten and on top
of that they have like glycolic acid and
everything in it really really good
stuff and it says you can use them twice
daily after cleansing it's basically
like a toner sort of thing and I think
that you're not supposed to rinse these
off right um white pad across face neck
and décolleté once or twice daily
after cleansing yeah so it's gentle
enough that you can actually keep it on
the skin unlike some of the other feels
like the peter thomas roth one or the dr
dennis
get to wash this off and that's a doctor
that's gross one but um that one ruined
my skin I hated that but um I got
breasts what was I saying um yeah the
peter thomas roth ones though you're
supposed to rinse off after 60 seconds
because there's so many like acids and
stuff in there all right and then the
last thing that I picked up was the
josie maran whimsical wonder argan oil
skin care essentials this was a $72
value for thirty-nine dollars i got it
for like 20 something again found it on
the sale part of the website look at
this box like what so cute and um I
really like a lot of Josie man's skin
care products I really like her argan
oil infused products so um in here you
get a nice little obviously this is
bigger than a deluxe size of the josie
maran one hundred percent pure argan oil
and looks like that and you get let's
see here point five fluid ounces in
there oh god that's just like totally
fell on the ground and then you get to
the josie maran argan infinity intensive
creamy oil i already have a full size of
this but i really really enjoyed it it's
awesome if you have really really dry
skin really good product and it lasts
forever and then get one of her body
butters in my favorite favorite scent
this is the josie maran whipped argan
oil in be joyful it is a mixed up
vanilla and apricot you guys it smells
so good I had a little size a little
tiny size like this from last year for
her holiday kid she had like the be
spirited one which was citrus and then
this one it's just actually like sweet
but not too sweet sort of scent it's
like natural but not artificial yeah it
just smells like natural apricot apricot
it's really really delicious I kind of
want to eat it and it's a little greasy
it's a tad greasy on the skin but it
really really hydrates ah and I've been
having
eczema on my hand so I probably should
go ahead and use this tight I think I
will all right and then you also get
this is the product that I haven't tried
from her I'm really really excited by
the way look how it comes in still
opening they were all stuck in the
bottom they're so adorable I love this
box I've been drying Buddha I have been
dying to try this product this is the
josie maran pure argan milk it's an
intensive hydrating treatment one
hundred percent natural it says shake
well before use massage three to five
drops onto clean face day and night
finished with one hundred percent pure
argan oil so i don't know if this is
going to be thinner and consistency than
the oil sometimes the oil can be a tad
heavy i do have the lite version as well
i like the normal version i have more
but i think that this one's was to like
sink in quicker and not be as gracie it
does have the argan oil in there but i
guess we'll see who knows because the
josie maran argan infinity this one the
intensive creamy oil this is super super
oily and greasy on the skin but really
really nice crazy like it really
hydrates all right and then the last
product you get in here i also have not
tried this is the josie maran argan
daily moisturizer with SPF 47 SPO 47
would it strange little number she
picked ah this is it's got natural
broad-spectrum SPF 47 so it looks like
it's a physical sun block which is nice
those ones are nice on my skin they
don't make me break out yep it's got
tidy titanium dioxide and zinc oxide
which are natural sunscreen so I was
like to use this it comes with a little
pump and we shall see how that works for
me alright guys let's get into the point
perks so like I said I ordered a lot of
100-point perks um because I wasn't
interested in any of the 500 points kits
I just I don't know can't remember what
they were even that's how uninterested I
was in any way I got a bunch of the
100-point perk ones I cannot say that
like 100 point five hundred point for
the first thing i got was the Korres or
coors um black pine firming lifting and
anti
called night cream you guys know I love
me some skin hair and black pine doesn't
really sound appealing it seems like
it's probably most malicious to convey
the oddest hopefully not but it says
firming lifting an anti-wrinkle on I'm
all about taking care of my skin so hold
on let's see here I kind of I don't know
nevermind it has like a whole little
seal over it i was going to see what the
texture is like but i'll keep you guys
updated on that one then I got the
100-point perk at the origins a
high-potency nighta means it is a
mineral enriched renewal cream and I've
never tried this I've heard really
really good things if it's as good as
they are um drink up overnight intensive
mask then I'll be very very happy
because i love that product um so we
shall see how this works ah it is it's
got relaxing aromas in it it helps get
you ready for bed Oh while you dream the
night away time to release exfoliating
extracts plus extracts vitamins minerals
in Reshma you sir okay so it helps
delete dullness and restore smoothness
so I'll keep you guys updated I guess if
I like any of these you'll probably see
them in my weekly favorites alright and
then I got the 100-point perk the caviar
anti-aging moisture intense oil crown I
don't know why I could say 100.4 they're
all 101 worth ok this is the moisture
intense royal creme it is a pre shampoo
treatment I haven't really liked a lot
of the slick stuff from the brand caviar
I think it's just okay um I haven't
tried their shampoo and conditioner I've
heard those are the best but like their
leave in conditioners and spraying
conditioners really uh never really
wowed me I never thought they were
life-changing by any means but this
really was interesting to me ah you
applied to dry hair for 5 to 15 minutes
you rinse and then shampoo and condition
so I kind of do this anyway with a
conditioner to help get rid of tangles
before I get into the shower um what I'm
going to wash my hair I put conditioner
in brush it through and then I get in
and shampoo so this is kind of the same
thing hopefully it will help
not only soften but also detangle
because that's my big issue it says for
very dry horsehair so we shall see I was
very very interested in that at first I
thought it was the shampoo and I was
like that but then I saw pre shampoo
treatment mm-hmm alright and then I got
the philosophy live joyously um firming
body emulsion I would three of these but
I don't have the choice please whatever
it is sent oh it smells nice it smells
like the holidays that's why I wanted it
i thought i would so i have the regular
ones like i just have little tiny
bottles like this one i think i have two
or three of them I think they do work I
remember them sinking in pretty quickly
I do some like on my upper arms where i
want to firm umm that smells good so I
thought you know I might as well pick it
up and then I got to the Clinique
turnaround daytime revitalizing a
moisturizer let those little clinic box
with a really tiny little sample so this
is what it looks like and I pretty I
have a pretty good experience overall
throughout the years with clinic they're
very very non-irritating I find the only
thing that really irritated irritated my
skin when I was younger was the
exfoliating toner but besides that their
products don't make me break out or
anything so good to go alright and then
I got two of these shishido and I took
one out of the box of those like did I
order to these I don't understand no
they're different okay that's what I
thought I was like how can I get two of
these okay so i got the shiseido
ultimate power infusing concentrate it
says apply morning and evening after
cleansing and balancing skin so i'm
guessing this is a serum and shiseido is
a really really fantastic brand and i
also got the shiseido glow enhancing
primer it soothes on a vibrant finish
and it is oil-free really really cute
packaging and this is what it looks like
so I'm excited to try that out as well
all right those were all my point perks
and now i'm going to show you all the
samples that they send
that they sent me cannot talk to a day
so the first thing is this clean for men
classic I did not pick this as one of my
samples it is just a men's cologne my
boyfriend has a lot of clones like I
have a lot of clones and he hates using
the little tiny sample bottles but I put
it out put it by his stuff so he can try
it all right I got let's see here my
goodness no wonder i have so many
samples all right I have four yes four
of the foaming milk cleansers from oly
henriksen this is the empower foaming
milk cleanser I was really excited to
try this and even more excited when they
sent me four of them and then I have a
few samples of the clinic Moisture Surge
I used to have a full size of this it's
a really really good product however I
think that the Neutrogena hydroboost
water gel is very comparable and you can
get it at the drugstore but this is just
the extended thirst relief gel creme so
nice to have those little samples and
then I got the I don't for during this
one either the phyto specific specific
specific swear it's not specific alright
this is um boosie hey auntie oh no no
French oh it's only in French um okay
fatty supposed you know okay so it is a
heat protecting serum at least that's
what I'm reading I know a little bit of
French um so yeah this I guess just goes
in before you go dry and giving lunch
today yeah so you put this in before you
blow dry or I guess you could put a
little bit before you straighten your
hair as well but if they serum and also
a heat protectant in one and then oh
this is another hundred point park I did
orbita so I remember this is the Lancome
drama liquify pencil
and employee and it's a beautiful
beautiful kind of purple shade go ahead
and so watch it oh it's so vibrant oh I
love it so that's uncle day right there
my goodness i'm getting it all over me
how pretty is that going to be doing
this summer like on the water line yes
hopefully will wear long um and then
I've got two samples of the Dior um
capture totale dreams skin I remember
putting these in my basket I'd only
remember putting one in it thank you
also for sending the extras but I guess
I kind of deserve it since my box
literally looked like I'm he look like
 it looked like it had been dropped
from like a helicopter or something both
of them I was like whoa it was crazy and
then the last thing i got i just have
enough this is the bozhe to boogie deep
hydration cebu key to becky Tsubaki deep
hydration sleeping mask I wish they
would have sent me all of these I love
sleeping masks and I'm obsessed with
masking and I really like the bow ship
ran so yeah come on so far next time
just leave the clinic ones give me three
of these so that is what it looks like
I've never tried this I'm very very
excited to and that is it guys okay this
is how long 22 minutes okay I'm sorry
that it was so long I think um you know
my fur they didn't get that much stuff I
think it was just because of the points
and also the samples it just took a
while to get through and I like to
swatch everything how pretty is that
shade I'm putting it's a little bit of
pink shimmer in it as well or just
alright well that was it I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm going to go throw
out that other beauty blender right now
oh my gosh look you guys it's staying on
pretty well so I think it's gonna wear
very well on the waterline nice alright
guys thank you for joining me i'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
