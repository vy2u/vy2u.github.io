you so much for joining me i hope you
are all having an absolutely fantastic
day I have another Sephora haul for you
guys today I did some online shopping
and I'm really excited i basically
shopped my love's list so you know how
you have to live a loves list on sephora
i basically just shocked that section
because i had so much stuff in that list
so i finally went ahead and purchased
some items that were on there so let's
go ahead and just get right into it the
first thing i purchase and this thing is
huge i'm so excited about this this is
the laura mercier body bath this is the
crème brûlée honey bath and i had no
idea this was going to be so big you get
out 12 ounces or 300 grams in here this
is what the outer packaging looks like
and let me show you on the inside first
of all you get this little literally
like a little honeycomb to go ahead and
pull the products out this is basically
just a delicious smelling bubble bath I
have heard great things about this so
I've not opened any of this yet
obviously so this is what it looks like
oh it's in a beautiful glass container
and yeah it's just as creme brulee honey
bath and I'm guessing you just put your
little honey covin run it under warm
water and it makes wonderful um bubbles
you guys know I love my bubble bath to
take a bubble bath every other night oh
oh my god oh it smells great oh sorry it
really smelled good though I am so so so
excited to try this out it looks
beautiful I feel like the glass
packaging is gorgeous it'd be beautiful
like right like on your bathtub like
right on the side of the bathtub really
really beautiful and I feel like that's
going to be so luxurious I cannot wait
to try it um it says that it has a
manuka honey in it it says discover a
new twist on luxury with Laura Mercier's
honey bath twirl the creme brulee
emulsion into your back and watch a
transform into a decadent foaming
experience this thick rich bubbles the
thick rich bubbles will leave your skin
supple and her senses calm and relaxed
while shea butter and vanilla extract
leave your skin velvety soft sweet
almond oil rice in OH proteins along
with pro-vitamin b5 offers skin moisture
balance and
action for that skin that loves to be
pampered indulge in delicious honey bath
oh my god that sounds such as two
amazing it's too amazing look how cute I
am so excited to try this out so that
was the first thing I purchased the
second thing i purchased is the Beca
backlight priming filter okay so I'm
kind of like in a dilemma with this one
because my friend hailey hated this so
much that she returned it but my friend
Mellie love it so I really don't know if
I'm going to love it or hate it I could
doing first impressions on it if you
guys would like me to UM but I'm really
excited to try it I feel like when I
have friends that love something and
hate it I gotta try it for myself and
see how I like it so yeah this has let's
see one fluid ounce in here and let me
show you guys what it looks like it's
kind of got the same exact yeah
literally say whose bag packaging as the
new Becca aqua luminous foundation that
I reviewed so really cool it's got the
little top that kind of pops up right oh
no it just opens like that and you got a
little pump here and yeah I'm excited to
try this it's supposed to be basically
like a priming filter kind of thing I
guess more than just a primer it's the
secret behind the iconic Becca glow
infused with three unique flattering
luminescent pearls each one adds a
different drop of diffused light lunches
together they result in the first of its
kind lightweight whipped fluid that
creates a smooth canvas and access an
instant filler it blurs imperfections
and gives skin a healthy luminescent
glow so that describes it better than I
can but this is what it looks like and
I'm very very excited to try it out let
me know if you guys would like a first
impressions on that alright moving on I
found this in the skincare section it
was like a newer product it's by the
brand chalo lion CA 0 l io n it says
where is poor it's a poor black head
steam foam cleanser and a pore
tightening cooling foam cleanser so you
get something that opens up the pores
then something that closes the pores I
just thought this was so so cool that I
think this is a newer brand to sephora
this was a new product is in the new
section under the skin care little thing
that you can pick and what is this like
a little spatula I guess to get the
product out but this is what the actual
product looks like so it literally is
like two little things on
so you have this and then you can undo
it and do this at the bottom so it
literally is like two different counters
in one and this was really nicely priced
I think this was around like twenty
dollars so i thought that was really
well priced and yeah the first one is
the poor black head steam foam cleanser
that will heat refine and exfoliate your
skin and then on the bottom you get the
poor typing cooling foam cleanser which
will deep pop soothe and soften the skin
so I can't wait to try these I think
these are going to be awesome I'm super
super excited about those and yeah
really really well priced like I said
alright the next thing I got was it a
little small size of the glam glow
thirsty mad just because I will be doing
a video on all of the glam glow mass how
to find the right Clem Clem asked for
your skin type I know it sounds like
that would be a very obvious video like
okay thirsty men would be for hydrating
the skin so people who have dry skin but
I think there's a little more to it and
also glam glow of us are so expensive so
I thought that it would be fun to do a
video on which one to pick because I do
think it is better to invest in the full
size which I did not do with this little
guy these only get like I don't know we
could probably only get like a week's
use out of the little small ones like
this if you mask is off unless I do
which is pretty much like everyday three
to four times a week um but yeah I
really like this one and it's wonderful
smells amazing like all the glenville
mess and it is for dry skin but you can
also use it I pombo skin i like it on my
cheeks so i think that uh the next thing
that I picked up was from Korres this
was also in the new section under skin
care this is the Wild Rose vitamin C
active brightening oil and I love oils
on my skin especially if they brighten
and I love anything Rose so I was super
super excited to try this out it says
with rose petals and wild rose oil the
first precious beauty elixir of the
Korres herbal apakah theory all to
constant ultra concentrated vitamin c
oil that brightens even skin tone and
reveals smoother and younger looking
skin it is fast absorbing a non-greasy
that says this nourishing treatment oil
is rich in essential fatty acids and
powerful antioxidants that instantly
replenish skin moisture and help
diminish the appearance of fine lines
and discoloration so I have talked about
it a lot but I used to have pretty
severe acne
I definitely have get like hormonal acne
still and I get scarring along my jaw
area it's very very hormonal if it's
around this area and that's where I get
mine so I have a lot of scarring in the
cereal like underneath like my cheekbone
kind of round my jaw area and I just
thought this would be really really
lovely to see if this can help lighten
some of that hyperpigmentation and
discoloration i'm guessing also if you
have like melasma or anything like that
this would be great but it has really
really good reviews so far and oh my god
this is so cool so you get a huge amount
in here my goodness I missing here this
is just one fluid ounce it looks like so
much more so it says the wild rose and
you guys do see that there are actually
little wild rose petals at the bottom of
the oil that looks so cool I cannot wait
to try this i love oils i'm super super
excited now so this looks amazing it
says to use gently massage a few drops
on to cleanse face and neck and avoid
the eye area so really really excited to
try this i will let you guys know i'll
of course do a follow-up hall on all of
these products next weekend and let you
guys know how everything kind of worked
and yeah well i'm really really excited
about that i feel like that's a huge
amount of oil right there alright the
next thing i purchased was a carry grin
um liquid but this is the colored lip
whip I have a lot of her lip whoops I
have the naked one which is just like no
color I have one that's like a little
more darker called radiant and then I
have like a light pink one but they had
ones that were for the Pantone color of
the year and this one was from last year
this is the marsala shade and I thought
it was so beautiful i love the way that
these are I love the formulation of
these basically the way they are
formatted they are just so luxurious and
I feel like this color is going to be
gorgeous on the lips they're just super
super moisturizing definitely a favorite
of mine as far as lip balms are
concerned i will be doing a top 5 series
on my favorite lip balms for dry chapped
lips during the winter but these are
fantastic smells really good smells like
peppermint if you enjoy mint you would
probably like these and yeah i'm super
super excited i think that that shade is
beautiful as well so that is the Carrie
Graham whip whip in the shade marsala
alright and then the next thing that I
go
let's see now we're going to get into
some of my point perks and whatnot so
they had this Kate Somerville this is
the skin health excerpt a little big
somerville skin health experts this is
the anti-aging derma quench liquid lift
plus retinol it's an advanced
resurfacing treatment this was I think
like a 200-point Burke hundred paper one
of those but I was super super excited
for this because this was a new product
that they were featuring in the like new
section on these four website in the
skincare area and yeah this just looks
really awesome it is yeah use it once a
day you shake bottle well press and it
looks like it's kind of like a foam so
I'm really excited I like anything with
retinol in it honestly retinol is
amazing for your skin it can really help
with discoloration I can be scarring all
that kind of stuff we can help with
break out so I'm very very excited to
use that let's meet a little bit about
it it says transform your complexion
with this revolutionary cannot talk
today come on Olivia goodies okay with
this revolutionary a derma quench liquid
lift it says retinol and anti-aging
breakthrough that combines the power
oxygen with firming retinol to refine
skin's texture and create a smooth
supple glow inspired by the most sought
after treatment at the kate somerville
skin health experts x x or y do you guys
think i keep saying excerpts it's
because i'm a musician and i'm thinking
up orchestral excerpts no experts um the
kate somerville skin health experts
clinic this resurfacing treatment is
formulated with a retinol active
ingredients two types of natural bio
retinols which are but baci baci edible
seed and spanish needle extract and
kate's advanced hydrophilic complex to
firm skin by promoting collagen
production increasing elasticity
reducing the appearance of pigmentation
and accelerating healthy skin and so
turn over so i'm really really excited
to try that out and I feel like you
can't like a really nice amount of
product here so that is very cool
alright the second hundred point perk I
got is the living proof perfect day hair
or perfect hair day nightcap overnight
Perfector so i'm guessing that this is
just your supposed to apply it to damp
or dry hair roots to ends comb through
and then you wash it out in the
morning so I don't know I thought I
would just try this out it looked
interesting I liked a few items from the
living proof line not everything but a
few items so I thought I would try it
out and then last time I hauled a
Sephora box hall last time i did a
Sephora haul these are the times i wish
i did edit my videos last time i did my
Sephora haul I did pick up one of these
hundred point perks this is the origins
high-potency vitamins mineral enriched
renewal cream and I have no idea where
it went like I think I might have
recycled it with the box I don't know
where it went but I decided to get
another one because everybody's like
speak so highly at this so I'm really
really excited um i guess it was
supposed to smell amazing team so two
thumbs up for that i got to pour a
little uh deluxe ice samples of the
smashbox photo finish primer oil I've
actually been using them I have like one
of these and I've been using it this
week like it's been very very nice on my
skin actually so I haven't enjoyed it
quite a bit I feel like it does
prolonged aware of your makeup but again
it is an oil so you want to be careful
depending on what kind of skin type you
have but it is quite nice that I do like
it reminds me a lot of this Smashbox
photo finish primer um so I do like it
and so I have two more of those I also
picked up or I got the ren / prints one
minute facial is a water activated
vitamin C flash runs it looks like this
got a sample of that and then they had
like a little sample bag that you can
type in a code for and you get a bunch
of samples in here of course the first
is the mandarin of glacial a te a clone
and this is for men so we'll see if my
boyhood wants that the second sample in
here is the Beca backlight grinding
filter so there you go I can try it out
sample form before break it into my new
one and then we have the Lancome every
girl needs this is the makeup stick and
it looks like hopefully yes good have a
nice light color there in 110 ivory so
we shall see how that works the next
sample in here is the ultra Repair Hydra
from sleeping cream from first day
beauty i know that i do like this i
tried that out during my sample week
series that i did over the holidays this
is the perricone md re firm surface
recovery treatment have never tried that
I have tried this little trio from bite
Beauty it's the agave lip mass um in the
smash shade some kind of weird strange
peachy shade that I remember not liking
and then the original formula so that's
always nice to have um and then I just
can't get that back in there I got the
fresh Lotus youth preserve radiance
lotion with super 7 complex it protects
and illuminates you can wear that in the
morning you also get a sample of the
hour glass of ale mineral primer with
SPF 15 I just came back today you guys I
just cannot get eat alright then you get
thee feels like honeymoon skin base this
looks very very similar to my um Nick's
honey do me up primer Plus serum so it
firms the revitalize the skin improves
complexion boost natural radiance unique
honey texture intense moisture perfectly
prime skin so we shall see about that
I've never seen that man before and then
example of the German doctor KP duty
this is the moisturizer yeah I guess
it's a moisturizer we've gone through
like a large size of this it was just ok
so on an elbow like that I'll give it to
my boyfriend he has worst KP than I do
where's chicken skin than me alright and
then the last thing that I picked up was
the 500-point perk from dr. brand I had
to get this because it has the new
needles no more 3d filler masking here
and I was like oh man yeah I really
really wanted to try that so I'm super
super excited so in here let's see you
get a course in needles no more 3d
filling mask I'm so excited to try this
I would say they're gonna get this one
or the glam glow one and i ended up
dating the glam glow but i'm super safe
to try that you also get the dr brandt
microdermabrasion age-defying exfoliator
which looks like that next you get the
dr brandt needles no more this is just
the regular instant wrinkle relaxing
cream I do like this it's quite nice and
then the last thing you get in here is
the doctor brand pore dermabrasion it's
a perfecting exfoliator so I have tried
about two or three of them in here but
