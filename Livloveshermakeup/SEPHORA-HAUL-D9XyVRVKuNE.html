this video I have a Sephora haul for you
guys I did some online shopping on the
Sephora com website so I'm going to
share with you guys what I picked up I
love filming stuff or halls and I love
filming empties videos so I'm really
happy that I'm doing one of these today
so let's just get right into it the
first thing that I picked up was the
glam glow super cleanse daily clearing
cleanser now the reason i picked this
out was because this is the outer
packaging and then you open it up and
then a little pamphlet just fell out but
this is what the actual magazine looks
like I feel like you get tons of product
and it is a pump which I love but anyway
um if one of my subscription boxes this
month i did get like a nice deluxe size
sample of these thirsty cleanse which is
like the hydrating version of this
cleanser and i have been using it all
week at nighttime i love it as like a
night Ted cleanser so I went on to the
online website or on to sephora
obviously and i was looking at all the
different cleansers that they had and
honestly if you guys have been watching
my channel for a while you know i love
the dual cleanse treatment which is the
mask and also the Tinga legs fully
treatment so i was thinking about
getting one or like one of those
basically but then I thought you know
what no I should go with super cleanse
because this is supposed to help with
problem skin skin imperfections it's
supposed to be poor affine mattifying
and clarifying and I know that like the
super cleanse treatment really clears
out breakouts and honestly this time of
year I start to get a little more oily I
have combination skin and when I get
oily I get more breakouts so I thought
this would be the perfect cleanser to
use during the spring and also the
summer months when my skin is a little
more oily and I'm super excited this is
like a huge huge huge thing you
literally get let's see here um 150
grams or five ounces of product here so
really really good deal i'm excited to
try that out they second item i picked
up was the NARS velvet matte skin tint
with broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen my
friend Amy recently did a review on this
product and let me know if you guys want
me to do a first impressions on this but
the shade she got was light 0 which is
Taryn wit a and we're pretty much the
same skin tone I think she pulled a
little more yellow undertones than I do
but we pretty much are the same skin
tone so I thought I would get the same
shade that she has and this has let's
see chemicals
screen in it and look at this packaging
look how sleek that is I love that it's
in a squeezy tube and it's completely
math like this is like a really sexy
packaging but anyway let me put a little
on the back of my hand so it basically
is just like an oil-free like Matt
formulation this is what it looks like
and it does pull a little bit of a
yellow tone on me which is probably why
it matched Amy a little better because
she's a little more yellow in her I
think I'm pretty darn sure but anyway it
basically covers like a foundation in
her video she actually said it gives the
coverage of foundation so I'm really
excited to try it out I know that I just
put it on the back of my hand but let me
know if you want me to do a first
impressions on my face and we can kind
of see what the where time is on it and
also i'm curious as to hot like coverage
wise because it seems like it's actually
kind of a liquidy formulation um but
yeah it's supposed to have a soft matte
finish its oil free is supposed to wear
comfortably on the skin while
maintaining the skins natural moisture
barrier so I'm really excited about this
let me know if you guys would like a
first impression alright and then the
next thing I purchased is new from
origins and recently I did pick up the
mask miser which is a product it will be
returning i'm going to show that and
feature that in my products i'm
returning video but anyway i really want
to try this out origins i feel like is
usually really really good for me that
Maximizer product did it work a nice
concept it just wasn't very good
whatsoever however i really do like
their skincare line so i did go ahead
and pick up their new origins by all
greens foaming deep cleansing mask with
green tea spirulina and spinach so this
is basically supposed to be like a
mousse like it's literally supposed to
be like a foaming let's go ahead and put
a little bit of this on the back okay so
literally comes out like green and you
guys can see and then it's supposed to
foam up and then you leave it on wow it
really phones up that is so cool it
folds up and it's actually like a clay
mask which is so cool so it's definitely
going to pull out impurities and things
like that and i'm really excited because
first of all I love foaming mask the
second of all I love anything to have
clay in it that will pull out any sort
of impurities and oil help with
breakouts especially during the summer
and during the spring when my skin tends
to get
little more oily and I just like the
concept of this because I feel like it's
not going to be super like overly drying
on the skin and it smells like you know
what it smells like it smells like the
oly Henrickson truth lines that which
smells like orange creamsicle if you
guys are familiar really really good so
I'm excited to try that out of course i
will be doing a follow-up all exactly a
week from today to let you guys know how
all these products works out for me
alright the next two things i got our
two more of the two-faced love flush
long-lasting 16-hour blushes I really
should just get my hands on the palette
that came out during the holidays I saw
that they still have that on the
two-faced website but honestly these are
like my favorite formulation of blush
ever so I am collecting all of them in
full size they only have one left that I
have to get and that she is called baby
love and of course on the day that I was
on the support calm website they happen
to be sold out of baby love so I only
could get my hands on I will always love
you and how deep is your love so how
deep is your love is a beautiful hot
water melon shade I love the packaging
Ethan the outer packaging is so cute
like look at that so this is how deep is
your love this is what it looks like and
I just love the way that these we're on
my skin they're so beautiful gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous and they describe this
on the support website I believe as a
hot water melon shade it just looks
beautiful so let's go ahead and swatch
that so there is the shade really really
pretty i'm so excited so here is how
deep is your love I think that's going
to be beautiful took a hot coral color
for the summertime and then the other
one I got is more of like a peachy
apricot a shade and that one is I will
always love you and that one looks like
this I feel like these two shades are
perfect for a summer so this is what it
looks like it has a little more like
peachy shades in it than coralie the
other one is more coral this one's more
peach so there it is let's watch it oh
it's beautiful it's got like this really
nice golden Sheen to it I'm so excited
so excited to play with these so I love
the formulation on those 16 our blushes
I think they are fabulous these are
probably like my favorite blushes ever
which is why I am collecting a full-size
of all of them so all i have left now is
baby love and
hope to get my hands on that soon and
then the last thing that I picked up or
the olay Henrickson Greece relief
cleansing cloths these are oil-free
poorer finding they have botanical AJ's
and eucalyptus to exfoliate clarify and
refine the pores so I got the one that
has 30 in here these are fifteen dollars
for 30 wipes which is kind of ridiculous
they were sold out of the one that had I
think a hundred wipes which is for
thirty dollars so that's a much better
deal but they were sold out of those
ones but i love these on days where i
wake up in the morning and i don't have
time to cleanse my face I will literally
just take one of these wipes and I will
rub it all over my face they do have
kind of like a dual textured thing going
on so one side is soft and the other has
exfoliating particles on it to really
like get into like the areas where your
oily like for me in my t-zone I really
kind of scrub away at those areas and I
just love them they don't like lather up
on the face or anything like that but
they take off any excess product that
you might have had from like the night
before and they smell really good I feel
like they keep me nice and matte
throughout the day and again this is
just one of those staples that I really
like to have during the warmer months
you guys can see I'm really picking up
some items that are going to be good for
like my combo skin as it starts to get a
little more oily so I really really
personally love these and they do not
remove makeup well I think these are
truly just like cleansing cloths so they
don't really remove makeup but if you
are in a hurry or on the run or you like
to wipe your face after going to the gym
or something like that these are amazing
i highly recommend these ones and also
the UM the truth ones which smells like
orange juice cool but anyway I got a
pack of 30 of those which I'm really
excited about and again I don't use
those on a daily basis so I can justify
the fifteen dollar price tag alright
let's talk about some samples so the
first thing i got was from typing in a
little code on the sephora website my
friend Amy and I have been wanting one
of us to pick this up forever literally
when this first relations like okay get
a full-size man let me know and I was
like I don't really want to buy or don't
you get a full-size come love me
so anyway we both finally got this as
like one of those little codes that you
type in and this is a nice amount of
product here this is the boscia charcoal
poor pudding it is supposed to be an
intensive wash off treatment and this is
what it looks like so it's like a wash
off treatment and basically I think you
just put it all over your face and then
kind of wash it off after it's kind of
like a mask it smells really really good
as smelled exactly like the oh I have it
right here the bow show revitalizing
black hydration gel smell exactly like
that but it looks like fax lines like
putting like I really want to eat it
it's like a mix of like the dark color
and then the white color in there and
I'm just super excited to try this out
it literally feels like pudding and you
just like put it all over your face and
you leave it on for a while and then you
wash it off it's got active charcoal and
I'm so excited that we both finally got
this because we've been like you should
order that you should order and then I'm
like no I don't want to buy it and I'm
like you should order it so we both
finally got that and I'm so excited to
try it out and then I also got this
little sample this is the essay edit
flash photo gloss I have no idea what
this is really I guess it's just a gloss
it looks like this it's such a mini
little tiny tube adorable I also got a
100-point perk I wanted to try out the
belief to Aqua bomb again I have gone
through a full size of this product but
this is really nice for the warmer
months it's just a really really nice
lightweight gel moisturizer if you have
oily skin or combination skin i highly
recommend checking this out and i also
got a little sample of the Urban Decay
ultra definition skin this is supposed
to be I believe it's like a 0 prime
perfect prime perfect so 3.5 is
definitely not going to match me as far
as like foundation goes that I can
definitely try the Urban Decay poor
perfecting complexion primer potion so
yeah there's just a few little samples
is there and then I also got a sample of
these sephora total age defiant night
cream i really like their day cream so I
went ahead and purchased this eyes like
I think the Sephora brand is really
underrated i really love i really love
it i really love their products and I
feel like a lot of them just a lot of
their line is underrated I love their at
what is it outrageous curl mascara
that's like a favorite of mine sorry
I'm gonna try that out and then I also
got these shiseido ultimate uh what is
this power infusing concentrate this is
a really really lovely serum if you guys
can get your hands on this i highly
recommend it so anyway i will be back in
a week to let you guys know how all
these products worked out for me I
cannot speak how all these products
worked out for me if you guys would like
me to do a first impressions on the NARS
skin tint let me know down below and I
