my channel happy Thursday today's video
is going to be a Sephora haul so if you
are interested in seeing the items that
I purchase from the online website and
then please keep on watching alright so
the first three items I have already
reviewed for you guys the first one I
picked up was the anastacio Beverly
Hills Nicole guerrero glow kit this is
absolutely stunning I am loving it so so
so much i do have a review on it so i
will go ahead and throw that up in the
cards for you guys but this is what it
looks like on the inside i think it's
stunning and really really wonderful for
all sorts of different skin tones now i
have heard if you do have more mature
skin these do tend to cling to dry
patches and they look a little glittery
on the skin i have not had that issue
whatsoever i think these are absolutely
beautiful and my two favorite shades are
forever young and kitty cat alright did
the next two items that i picked up i
did review yesterday again I will throw
that up in the cards for you guys if you
would like to see a my very
disappointing review on these these are
the urban decay naked skin highlighting
fluids I did pick up two different
shades and these are being returned the
first one that I picked up is the shade
luminous which is an opalescent white
color with a gold shimmer and then I
also did pick up the shade aura which is
a cool tone pink color with a little bit
of a silver iridescent I do not find
that these have very good pigmentation
the where time is incredibly poor on my
combo skin and I just think for $28 you
don't get a lot of product in here so
not worth it in my opinion there are
much better at liquid illuminators on at
the market alright the next item that I
did pick up was the purity one-step
facial cleanser I like to use this to
actually wash my makeup brushes this is
a huge huge huge container as you guys
can see I also did pick up the becca
shimmering skin Perfector prestine
prismatic amethyst and I have been
playing with this now for a week I
actually got this box in last week so I
have played with a few of the items you
do get seven grams of product in here
the box is amazing and this is really
really beautiful you guys so here is
what the actual packaging looks like
really really gorgeous little flying
lavender saucer I would say you do open
it up and here is the actual color so
this is stunning if you do have a fair
complexion especially if you do pull
more of a cool undertone it is what I
would describe as a opalescent white
color with a lavender shift to it so
it's got a little bit of a pinky
lavender shift to it it is stunning and
beautiful i love how pigmented it is it
looks gorgeous on the skin and I
actually do you find that this is a
little less powdery than some of their
other shimmering skin
vectors press so if you are looking into
this I would HIGHLY highly recommend
checking it out it definitely has a
lighter tone to it and more of a
lavender undertone to it and then the
Becca what is it shimmering skin
Perfector in rose quartz that one is
still like darker than my skin this one
is not it is a true highlight especially
if you do have fair skin so then loving
that you guys it is so so so beautiful I
also did pick up the Urban Decay what is
this eyeshadow primer potion in the
anti-aging version i remember liking
this and this was on sale for like
twelve dollars for a full size I know
that they are currently redoing all of
their primers and stuff like that I
actually heard that their new face
primers have been giving people like
allergic reactions but this is what the
anti-aging eye primer looks like I
thought for twelve dollars it was
definitely worth it this is a very nice
primer it does have a little bit of
retinol in it so you want to make sure
that you do follow up with some
sunscreen but it has a really really
nice dometic own slip to it so excited
to try that out and then also I picked
up the cover FX custom enhancer drops in
the shade halo so this is the first time
I am ever experiencing the cover effects
custom enhancer drops I have been planed
with these for a few days here is the
actual packaging super super beautiful
i'm so happy that cover FX is equal to
free brand I got these ones because I
want to do a battle of the holographic
or do a chromatic highlighters for you
guys I'm gonna do a video on that which
will be coming up probably towards the
end of the month but this is what it
looks like in a dropper form you just
put it onto your skin and honestly these
are so beautiful do you guys see that so
you can see it's kind of liquidy and
then when you rub it in this has a very
very strong purple bluish shift to it
and i really like putting this on I
don't even know if you guys can see the
shift i really like putting this on
after my foundation before i go in with
powder and i feel like it gives a very
very beautiful wham-bam in-your-face
kind of highlight so it is like
straight-up purple as you guys can see
but it is beautiful especially if you do
layer it with your foundation instead of
actually you know putting your
foundation on and then putting your
powder on and then going in with this I
do find that this moves around my
foundation a bit if I do it that way but
if I put it on and then or if i put the
foundation on then i put this on in the
night powder you actually get a
beautiful really gorgeous highlight so
i'm enjoying these i think i'm going to
pick up a few more shades as well I
did pick up the sunday riley title
brightening and some water cream it says
increases hydration by sixty-eight
percent in 15 minutes it exfoliates in
smooth texture and visibly brightens
hyperpigmentation this is like $65 i
love that sunday riley is cruelty free
because i just found out the drunk
elephant may not be cruelty-free that's
another skincare brand i love but i
definitely don't mind purchasing
full-size full sizes but that full-size
products around sunday riley because i
really do find that their products work
so this is what the full-size cream
looks like and it's a really nice kind
of gel consistency it has a little bit
of like a blue color to it and it's just
really beautiful on the skin so very
very excited to be playing with that I
have gone through quite a few samples
and a deluxe sizes of this so I know I
already love it and then the last item
that I didn't pick up is the Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eye shadow so if you didn't know
stila recently went cruelty-free which
is awesome and I have wanted this
particular shade which is called smoky
rose for quite some time now here is the
shade smokey rose it's a really really
beautiful kind of like pewter color or I
guess you could say topi color very
excited to try this out I have not
actually worn it yet to have a flat doe
foot applicator and then here is the
swatch now I know some people were
saying these go on a little patchy I
don't really think this is patchy that
is just one layer right there and as you
guys can see you could probably build it
up and get a lot of shimmer going on so
very very excited to go ahead and play
with that and then I did pick up a
500-point perk this is the Too Faced
what is this called bite sized beauties
500-point perk it says you get a little
mini Deluxe chocolate bar palette in
here a better than sex mascara a melted
chocolate honey lipstick and a deluxe
shadow insurance so here is the
500-point perk and let me show you guys
the stuff on the inside so we have a
little mini chocolate bar palette it's
like a chocolate bite palette they
should call it I thought this would be
great to carry in my purse we have the
shade champagne truffle salted caramel
semi-sweet and then the chocolate Soleil
bronzer so that is what it looks like
and then you get a little deluxe size
I'm better than sex mascara which I love
this mascara super excited for that a
little deluxe eyes I'm liquid lipstick a
long word liquid lipstick in the shade
chocolate honey I might keep this one I
did declutter all of my melted
liquefied lipsticks just because I don't
find them incredibly comfortable to wear
and then also a little mini shadow
insurance which is great for travel so
that is what is inside at the 500-point
perk and then I did try and choose out
cruelty free samples like I said I just
found out that drunk elephant might not
actually be cruelty-free but this is the
sea from a day serum which is a
wonderful wonderful one and then i also
got two little samples of the sunday
riley CEO antioxidant moisturizer i want
to try that out so anyway that is my
Sephora haul I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I will have a follow-up hall
going up next week for you guys to share
my first impressions at my final
thoughts on these items so yeah I will
see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
