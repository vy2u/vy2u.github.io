thank you so much for joining me happy
Tuesday if you recognize this outfit and
my dirty ass hair and this makeup it is
because I am pre filming this for you
guys on Saturday I just filmed my look
of the week and I actually have a gig on
Tuesday so I'm not gonna be able to do
any filming so as you're watching this
there's just a pre film in the video so
anyway I am here to share a Sephora haul
with you guys today as well as my top 5
series on me Milani Bram I'm just
smushing them into one video I hope you
guys don't mind I'm gonna go ahead and
start with these Sephora haul and I will
place a time stamp for the actual Milani
top 5 series video if you just want to
watch that one and you're really trying
hard not to be buying I know it's
very hard to watch hauls if you're
trying not to buy stuff I have a few
people that watch me they're like I
can't stand your help I can't do it but
if you just want to watch the top 5
series um like part of the video I will
go ahead and time stamp it down below so
you can just fast-forward that'll be the
first thing you see in the description
bar but yeah we're gonna start with the
Sephora stuff so I placed two orders on
these Sephora calm websites it was so
stupid you guys so I placed one order
and I was like I'm only gonna get like
two or three things off of my love's
list I wasn't even planning on making a
video I don't really like to film a haul
video from Sephora unless I have more
than five or six items and then the next
day it went back on it order like four
more so I have 7 items to share with you
guys from haircare to skincare yeah
ranging from haircare skincare to like
makeup so anyway let's go ahead and just
get started the first item that I picked
up was the AC D by DP hue this is an
apple cider vinegar leave-in hair
therapy treatment and this is new you
guys know I love new
um and I'm constantly stocking the
Sephora website especially the area that
has like the new arrivals section so
this was in the hair section and I also
saw this on the all TOCOM websites so
this is the story about two years ago
when I was still living in Manhattan I
think it was my beauty box 5 I got like
a sample of like an apple cider vinegar
hair rinse and also a little sample of
like a detangling treatment I have never
experienced such soft silky hair when I
was using apple cider vinegar and when
younger my mom used to actually rinse my
hair with apple cider vinegar after we
would put in shampoo and it really just
helps to make your hair really nice and
healthy
and just really really beautiful and
manageable and I know that apple cider
vinegar is amazing for your hair so when
I saw this on the sephora.com website it
reminded me that I had that little
sample from the beauty box five it
wasn't this particular brand I could
never actually find a full-size of the
brand which is why I didn't purchase the
product but this just reminded me to go
ahead and pick something up with apple
cider vinegar in it and you guys know I
will be chopping my hair soon so I feel
like this will make my hair extra silky
and lovely especially once I chop off
like ten inches okay anyway that is the
first item I picked up and it was
reasonably priced you get six fluid
ounces in there ink that goes around
twenty-five or thirty dollars all right
the second item I got I'm so excited
about you guys okay Viktor and Rolf
finally finally released flour bomb soap
yes a bar soap that smells like flower
bomb and I'm all about that life I love
the flower bomb scent I love the perfume
so I definitely wanted to get my hands
on this bar soap I plan on having I'm
gonna buy another one
so I plan on having one in the bathroom
obviously like in the actual shower and
then this one is actually going to go
into oh my god
Oh smells so good this one's gonna go
into our guest bathroom we have like an
area where we have like the regular soap
that you can like pump out and then we
have a little glass dish where I like to
put a bar soap and I think this would be
perfect I'm constantly in the guest
bathroom anyway a store a lot of like my
skincare and stuff in there so I think
this will be nice because I know I will
be able to use it very very frequently
so that's going to be on a little dish
in the guest bathroom I'm super excited
for that it's ridiculously expensive
that was like 30 bucks but it's worth it
in my opinion and then the next thing I
picked up was the Urban Decay perversion
mascara this has a full-size mascara and
a travel size so the reason I got this
was because you are getting the full
size and the travel size for just the
price that the full-size is which I
believe it's $24 so I just thought that
was a good deal I've recently gone
through I think three or four mascaras
so
I'm trying to get through all of my
little deluxe sized samples now but I
obviously like to have full sizes around
and so anyway here is the deluxe sized
sample and I really like the formulation
of the perversion mascara it's super
super jet black it's very inky and it is
kind it's definitely not smudge proof
okay it definitely can travel like
underneath your eye area and normally I
like this during the winter time however
I think it's just so nice it really
builds up a lot of volume on your lashes
it's a very wet formula so if you don't
like that you won't like it but I do
like it so anyway the deluxe eye sample
has a lot in here I'm still working on
my deluxe a sample from my naked on the
run palette and then this is the full
size so anyway I just thought that was a
really really good deal to get the
deluxe eyes and the full size for the
price of just the full size so I picked
that up and I'm excited for those the
next item I picked up I have had my eye
on forever this is the pharmacy lip
bloom it has echinacea in it which I
feel like all of the pharmacy products
have echinacea in them but this is in
the strawberry basil scent oh my god
nope nothing amazing so these are just
little lip balms you guys know as a
flutist I just constantly I'm voice
rising my lips all the time and I just
thought this would be fun to pick up
they have so many different cool scents
and I thought strawberry basil would be
so nice I love making oh my god it
smells really good
I love making strawberry basil spa water
and I find it so refreshing so I thought
this would be really really nice and I
like the consistency it seems very uh
kind of like petroleum petroleum II
patroling me it seems kind of like
petroleum jelly but thinner and I know
that there's no petroleum in here
because pharmacy has really really
natural products but oh my gosh oh my
god I taste so good it smells really
really good very strongly of strawberry
so anyway I'm excited to try that out
and of course I will have a follow up
call in a week for you guys after I use
these products up or not use them up and
you know what I mean after I try them
out and it will be a week after I filmed
the video so exactly a week from today
when you guys are watching this not from
when I'm filming wait what did I say
not when I'm filming it from when you
guys
so Tuesday it will be on next Tuesday my
follow-up all my goodness Olivia all
right moving on the next item that I
picked up was this herbivore okay so
everybody is raving about this brand and
I was like I need to get this this is
the herbivore rose hibiscus coconut
water hydrating face mask okay so the
story behind this is that well first of
all everybody's raving about the
herbivore brand in general but second of
all I had all these backups of facial
mess you guys know I like to set in my
skincare with facial mess I use these
all the time
I love the Mario Badescu one the Jun
Jacob Swan especially the Shirley crows
water balancing mist so I literally just
ran out of all of my faces I don't know
what happened I swear to you I had like
a huge stash of them and the other day I
ran out of the Mario Badescu
I go to open up my little drawer and
there's nothing there there was just
nothing there so I was like okay so I
thought I would try this one out this is
new to me and although I really wanted
to try out the Josie Maran one next I
thought that I would try this one
because I typed in rows on Sephora and
this came up I mean come on Rose
hibiscus coconut water like that just
sounds so lovely so anyway this is what
it looks like and you to get quite a
large amount of product in here you have
four ounces and I think this was $32 so
that actually is less than the yeah I
think the price is less than these early
crows water balance image which is like
three ounces for $35 so anyway it says
it's a truly natural base of organic
coconut water it's infused with youth
youth boosting how this gets flower
extract and moisture enhancing rose
water to tone hydrate and soften all
skin types and it says instantly
hydrating and replenishing due to high
levels of amino acids
it also contains skin cell renewing
cytokines and lauric acid to minimize
aging of the skin so very very excited
to try that out I will let you guys know
what I think of that in the follow-up
haul and then the next I know I picked
up where these just say no facial
Cotton's yes okay
everybody raves about this hold on a
second one two three four five okay no I
thought I was missing an item anyway
they should say do facial continence
everybody raves about these and
I probably should have gotten them like
during the 15 percent off sale because I
think it's like $9.50 for 165 sheets
it's just 100% pure cotton I need to
open this right now to touch it because
everybody's like it's so much softer but
I don't know oh my god it is I'm always
so skeptical cuz I'm like how could it
be that much softer than just like
regular things you guys Wow
this really feels nice oh my god oh it's
so soft even getting makeup on it but
wow really really soft these are what
the little pads look like I'm totally a
like cotton pad like oh it smells weird
actually okay no that must be something
else haha anyway I mean total cotton pad
like addicts and I have to have a
specific sort of kind so I hope that
these work for like toner and things
like that and that the toner doesn't
sink in too much but people really use
this for removing their eye makeup I
have ones from Target that I'm obsessed
with but these are a lot softer so I may
like these more I'm very excited I'll
let you guys know what I think of those
all right and then the last thing that I
picked up was the chlorine this is the
mango oil this is a mango oil basically
just say UV protectant for your hair so
the reason I got it was because again
getting my hair done and I am chopping
it and also we're going blonder so this
is nice because it the mango oil
naturally helps with like nutrition and
UV protection for dry Sun exposed hair
I love the chlorine mango butter line I
love their shampoo I really liked their
hair mass so I thought I would pick this
up as well and it was on the love's list
so let me count all those items I could
have sworn I had seven one two three
four five six where's the seventh item I
swear to you I thought I had seven maybe
I didn't alright well those are all the
items that I purchased let me show you
guys quickly my deluxe sized samples so
the first one I got is the amore Pacific
Future response age defensive serum I'm
excited to try this out we shall see
what that is like I also got this little
nest fragrances citrine ODA perfume and
hoping this smells good it's a little
rollerball so there is put it on oh my
god yeah yeah I love it it smells so
good I love anything that's just super
super citrusy this smells like a mixture
of lemon and flowers so I really like
that that's so cute so I'm gonna put
that on my little deluxe phibes perfume
sample bra right there and then I also
got this little drum elephant to be
intensive hydration gel and I was so
happy that I got this as a little it
wasn't a point perk it was one of those
little codes that you can type in if you
buy more than 25 dollars worth of
product and I'm super excited because
this actually is something that I have
on my love's list so I want to try it
out first and see if I like it before I
purchase a full-size and then samples I
got the brioche EO blossom and bloom
ginseng plus biotin volumizing shampoo I
also got the torch tart guard SPF 30
sunscreen and then I got a sample of the
glam glow super mud clearing treatment I
love how those I also got the it's also
amore Pacific no I love skin the skin
Inc pure revival peel so those are the
samples I picked up alright guys so that
was that my Sephora haul I could swear
that there was another item that maybe
I'm just missing right now so if there
was I'll just leave it in the
description bar and let you guys know
what I got and then I'll show it in the
follow-up haul or maybe I just got six
items and I'm crazy okay so let's go
ahead and get into the top five series
for a Milani
so I feel kind of silly like the reason
I added in the Sephora haul honestly was
because I felt really silly about the
top 5 series for the Milani because four
of the items are blush and I feel like
with the top 5 series the video like
people want to see different sort of
things from the brand however these
really are my top picks from the Milani
brand so anyway I have trying a lock on
the Milani brand I think they have
decent eyeshadow palettes I just hit
myself in the mask I think they have
decent eyeshadow palettes I do like
their liquefied eyeliner
of their eye primer but honestly these
are my top five picks the ones I just
can't live with that so let's go ahead
and get started the first one is the
Milani baked blush in the shade red vino
this is so beautiful you have to use
this with a very light hand if you are
quite fair like I am it's a deep ready
sort of plum color it actually shows up
a little more red on my skin and it has
a ton of golden shimmer in it and it's
kind of like flecks of golden glitter
there is the actual color let me go
ahead and swatch it for you guys but
yeah it definitely shows up more like
red than like a raspberry colored I
think in my opinion on other skin tones
if you have darker skin it shows up
really like very looking but for me it
shows up very very red so I have to be
very very careful with this blush so I
don't just look like a straight-up like
china doll but this is really really
beautiful
I love the color and I love the
formulation on the Milani baked blush is
I have all of them and let's see here
three of them are favorites of mine big
time favorites so the next one is the
Milani baked blush in the shade
delicioso pink and this is sort of like
a satiny matte color it's beautiful it
is a cool toned pink and I just love the
formulation on these baked blushes I
can't talk about them enough I think
Milani blush game is so strong like so
so so strong so there is Lee co so paint
and let me go ahead and swatch that one
for you guys I just love the way a cool
toned blush looks if you have very very
fair skin it makes your skin look very
like doll-like and just like you went
outside and your cheeks got cold and
like that's the color of your cheeks so
I really really do love that one I think
it's absolutely stunning the next item I
want to talk about is the non blush item
and this is the Milani brow shaping wax
then you may be like what the hell
Olivia like any brand has good like brow
wax but honestly and this is the best
brow wax that I have ever found for
Melania I think it's absolutely
fantastic it just comes in this pencil
form I can't even open this now because
my fingers are all oily but it just
comes in this pencil form and I think it
was about this long when I first started
so you just keep sharpening it you can
sharpen it with like any sort of
sharpening you just use the bigger side
but it honestly is the best thing for
keeping your brows in place all
they better than any sort of brow gel I
have honestly this is this Milani brow
shaping wax it's the best thing and I
like that it doesn't believe them
looking oily or slick it literally just
holds them in place all day without
adding color or anything like that all
right the next item is the baked blush
in Luminoso as you guys can see I have
completely worn off everything on there
you can't even see you don't even know
who this is from but it is from Milani
it's a beautiful peachy iridescent color
this is gorgeous on everyone everyone I
swear to god this is such a universal
wash it's just this beautiful peachy
iridescent color with like gold shimmer
running through it it looks beautiful on
fair skin it looks beautiful on medium
skin tan skin deep skin everybody like
can wear this blush and it's stunning it
is just absolutely stunning and this is
one of the big blushes out of the bunch
that has really really like finely
milled the Limor in there so it's not
like you have chunks of glitter like red
vino or maybe some of the other ones
like coralina or even what I don't know
roasty Ora all those Dilisio not only
see also pink in the UM
what's it called that other pink one you
guys know what I'm talking about a lot
of those have like chunks of glitter
this one has a really finely milled
smooth like the Limor effect it's
awesome and then the last final item is
the Milani powder the rose powder blush
yes and this shade is called Coral Cove
I really like all three of them that I
have but honestly this one is just so
beautiful I love the way a coral blush
or a peach blush looks on fair skin I
think it's absolutely stunning and these
are so beautiful they're just so
beautiful look at that color it's like a
hot coral and it just makes it look like
again you just like came back from a run
or something you know you just look like
you've really flushed skin so really
really adore that blush as well so
anyway that is why I combine the two
videos just because I felt like I don't
have although I do have a lot of
products from Milani a my top five like
products are not really that diverse I'm
just really into their blushes so anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this Sephora
haul it's half AI series video thank you
so much for joining me and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
