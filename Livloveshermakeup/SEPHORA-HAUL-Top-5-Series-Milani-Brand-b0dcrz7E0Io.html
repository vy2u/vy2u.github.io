thank you so much for joining me happy
tuesday if you recognize this outfit and
my dirty ass hair and this makeup it is
because i am Pre filming this for you
guys on saturday I just filmed my look
of the week and I actually have a gig on
Tuesday so I'm not going to be able to
do any filming so as you're watching
this is just a prefilled in the video so
anyway I am here to share a Sephora haul
with you guys today as well as my top 5
series omni Milani Bram I'm just
smashing them into one video I hope you
guys don't mind I'm going to go ahead
and start with the Sephora haul and I
will place a timestamp for the actual
Milani top 5 series video if you just
want to watch that one and you're really
trying hard not to be buying I know
it's very hard to watch halls if you're
trying not to buy stuff I have a few
people that watch me they're like I
can't stand your home I can't do it um
but if you just want to watch the top 5
series and like part of the video I will
go ahead and time stamp it down below so
you can just fast-forward that'll be the
first thing you see in the description
bar but yeah we're going to start with
the Sephora stuff so I placed two orders
on these sephora.com website it was so
stupid you guys so I placed one order
and I was like I'm only gonna get like
two or three things off of my loves liz
i wasn't even planning on making a video
I don't really like to film a haul video
from Sephora unless I have more than
five or six items and then the next day
went back on it order look for more so I
have seven items to share with you guys
from here care to skincare yeah ranging
from here care skin care to like makeup
so anyway let's go ahead and just get
started the first item that I picked up
was the acd by DP Hugh this is an apple
cider vinegar leave in hair therapy
treatment this is new you guys know I
love new um and I'm constantly
stocking the Sephora website especially
the area that has like the new arrivals
section so this was in the hair section
and I also saw this on the altar calm
websites so this is the story about two
years ago when I was still living in
Manhattan I think it was my beauty box 5
I got like a sample of like an apple
cider vinegar hair rinse and also a
little sample of like a detangling
treatment I have never experienced such
soft silky hair when i was using apple
cider
and when I was younger my mom used to
actually rinse my hair with apple cider
vinegar after we would put in shampoo
and it really just helps to make your
hair really nice and healthy and just
really really beautiful and manageable
and I know that apple cider vinegar is
amazing for your hair so when I saw this
on the sephora.com website it reminded
me that I had that little sample from
the beauty box 5 it wasn't this
particular brand I could never actually
find a full size of the brand which is
why I didn't purchase the product but
this just reminded me to go ahead and
pick something up with apple cider
vinegar in it and you guys know I will
be chopping my hair soon so I feel like
this will make my hair extra silky and
lovely especially once I chopped off
like 10 inches so anyway that is the
first item I picked up and it was
reasonably priced you get 6 fluid ounces
in their ink that goes around
twenty-five or thirty dollars alright
the second item i got i'm so excited
about you guys okay Viktor and Rolf
finally finally released flowerbomb soap
yes a bar of soap that smells like
flower bomb and i'm all about that life
i love the flower bomb sent I love the
perfume so I definitely wanted to get my
hands on this bar soap I plan on having
I'm gonna buy another one so I plan on
having one in the bathroom obviously
like in the actual shower and then this
one is actually going to go into oh my
god Oh smells so good this one's going
to go into our guest bathroom we have
like an area where we have like the
regular soap that you can like pump out
and then we have a little glass dish
where I like to put a bar soap and I
think this would be perfect I'm
constantly in the guest bathroom anyway
to store a lot of like my skincare and
stuff in there so I think this will be
nice because i know i will be able to
use it very very frequently so that's
going to be on a little dish in the
guest bathroom i'm super excited for
that it's ridiculously expensive that
was like 30 bucks but it's worth it in
my opinion and then the next thing I
picked up was the Urban Decay perversion
mascara this has a full-size mascara and
a travel
sighs so the reason I got this was
because you are getting the full size
and the travel size for just the price
that the full size is which I believe
it's twenty-four dollars so i just
thought that was a good deal i've
recently gone through i think three or
four mascaras so i'm trying to get
through all of my little deluxe I
samples now but I obviously like to have
full sizes around um so anyway here is
the deluxe size sample and I really like
the formulation of the perversion
mascara is super super jet black it's
very inky and it is kind it's definitely
not smudge proof okay it definitely can
travel like underneath your eye area and
normally I like this during the
wintertime however I think it's just so
nice it really builds up a lot of volume
on your lashes it's a very wet formula
so if you don't like that you won't like
it but I do like it so anyway the deluxe
I sample has a lot in here I'm still
working on my deluxe a sample from my
naked on the run palette and then this
is the full size so anyway I just
thought that was a really really good
deal to get the deluxe size and the full
size for the price of just the full size
so I picked that up and I'm excited for
those the next item I picked up I have
had my eye on forever this is the
pharmacy lip bloom it has echinacea in
it which I feel like all of the pharmacy
products have echinacea in them but this
is in the strawberry basil sent oh my
god don't know if I'm amazing so these
are just little lip balms you guys know
as a flutist I just constantly oyster
izing my lips all the time and I just
thought this would be fun to pick up
they have so many different cool sense
and I thought strawberry basil would be
so nice I love making oh my god it
smells really good I love making
strawberry basil spa water I find it so
refreshing so I thought this would be
really really nice and I like the
consistency it seems very uh kind of
like petroleum petroleum me patrolling
me it seems kind of like petroleum jelly
but thinner and I know that there's no
petroleum in here because pharmacy has
really really natural products but oh my
gosh oh my god I taste so good it smells
really really good very strongly of
strawberry so anyway I'm excited to try
that out and of course I will have a
follow-up call in a week for you guys
after
I use these products up or I'm not use
them up and you know what I mean after I
try them out and it will be a week after
i filmed the video so exactly a week
from today when you guys are watching
this not from what i'm filming it wait
what did I say now for what I'm filming
it from when you guys are watching so
Tuesday it will be on next Tuesday my
follow up all my goodness Olivia he's
date can you see all right moving on the
next item that I picked up was this
herbivore okay so everybody is writing
about this brand and I was like I need
to get this this is the herbivore
rosehip viscous coconut water hydrating
face mess ok so the story behind this is
that well first of all everybody's
raving about the herbivore brand in
general but second of all I had all
these backups of facial mist you guys
know I like to set in my skincare with
facial mess i use these all the time I
love the Mario Badescu one the june
jacobs one especially the surely crows
water balancing miss so I literally just
ran out of all of my face with I don't
know what happened I swear to you I had
like a huge stash of them and the other
day I ran out of the Mario Badescu I go
to open up my little drawer and there's
nothing there there was just nothing
there so I was like okay so i thought i
would try this one out this is new to me
and although i really wanted to try out
the josie maran one next i thought that
i would try this one because i typed in
rows on sephora and this came up i mean
come on Rose hibiscus coconut water like
that just sounds so lovely so anyway
this is what it looks like and um you to
get quite a large amount of product in
here you have four ounces and I think
this was $32 so that actually is less
than the yeah I think the price is less
than these early crows water balance
image which is like three ounces for
thirty-five dollars so anyway it says
it's a truly natural base of organic
coconut water it's infused with youth
youth boosting how this gets flower
extract and moisture enhancing rosewater
two tone hydrate and soften all skin
types and it says instantly hydrating
and replenishing due to high levels of
amino acids it also contains skin cell
renewing cytokines and lauric acid to
minimize aging of the skin so very very
excited to try that out i will let you
guys know what I think
that's in the follow-up hall and then
the next item I picked up were these
should say no facial Cotton's yes okay
everybody raves about this hold on a
second one two three four five okay no I
thought I was missing an item anyway
they should say no facial continent
everybody raves about these and I
probably should have gotten them like
during the fifteen percent off sale
because i think it's like nine dollars
and fifty cents for 165 sheets it's just
one hundred percent pure cotton I need
to open this right now to touch it
because everybody's like it's so much
softer but I don't know oh my god it is
I've always so skeptical cuz I'm like
how could it be that much softer than
just like regular things you guys wow
this really feels nice oh my god oh it's
so soft you can get makeup on it but wow
really really soft these are what the
mobile pads look like I'm totally a like
cotton pad like oh kind of smells weird
actually okay no that must be something
else anyway I mean total cotton pad like
addicts and I have to have a specific
sort of kind so I hope that these work
for like toner and things like that and
that the toner doesn't sink in too much
but people really use this for removing
their eye makeup I have ones from target
that I'm obsessed with but these are a
lot softer so I may like these more I'm
very excited I'll let you guys know what
I think of those all right and then the
last thing that I picked up was the
chlorine this is the mango oil this is a
mango oil basically just a UV protectant
for your hair so the reason I got it was
because again gain my hair done and I am
chopping it and also we're going blonder
so this is nice because it the mango oil
naturally helps with like nutrition and
UV protection for dry sun-exposed hair I
love the chlorine mango butter line I
love their shampoo i really liked their
hair mass so i thought i would pick this
up as well and it was on the loves list
so let me count all those items that
could have sworn I had seven one two
three four five six where's the seventh
item I swear to you I thought it had
stuff
maybe I didn't all right well those are
all the items that I purchase let me
show you guys quickly my deluxe size
samples so the first one I got is the
amore Pacific future response age
defense serum I'm excited to try this
out we shall see what that is like I
also got this little nest fragrances
citrine o de perfume and I'm hoping this
smells good it's a little roller ball so
there is put it on oh my god yeah yeah I
love it its most so good I love anything
that's just super super citrusy this
smells like a mixture of lemon and
flowers so I really like that that's so
cute i'm gonna put that on my little
deluxe sides for a few example bra right
there and then i also got this little
drunk elephant to be intensive hydration
gel and i was so happy that i got this
as a little it wasn't a point park it
was one of those little codes that you
can type in if you buy more than
twenty-five dollars worth of product and
i'm super excited because this actually
is something that i have on my love's
list so i want to try it out first and
see if I like it before i purchase a
full-size and then samples i bought the
Brio geo blossom and bloom ginseng plus
biotin volumizing shampoo i also got the
chart charge card SPF 30 sunscreen and
then i got a sample of the glam glow
super mad clearing treatments i love how
those i also got the it's also more I
Pacific know I love skin the skin Inc
pure revival peel so those are DC apples
I picked up alright guys so that was at
my Sephora haul I could swear that there
was another item that maybe I'm just
missing right now so if there was I'll
just leave it in the description bar and
let you guys know what I got and then
I'll show it in the follow-up hall or
maybe i just got six items and I'm crazy
okay so let's go ahead and get into the
top 5 series forum lelani so i feel kind
of silly like the reason i added in the
Sephora haul honestly was because i felt
really silly about the top 5 series for
the Milani because four of the items are
blush and i feel like with the top 5
series video like people want to see
different sort of things from the brand
however these really are my top picks
from the Milani brand so
way I have tried a lot on the Milani
brand I think they have decent I shadow
palettes I just hit myself in the
bathroom I think they have decent
eyeshadow palettes I do like their
liquefied eyeliner I love their eye
primer but honestly these are my top
five picks the ones I just can't live
with that so let's go ahead and get
started the first one is the Milani
baked blush in the shade red vino this
is so beautiful you have to use this
with a very light hand if you are quite
fair like I am it's a deep ready sort of
plum color it actually shows up a little
more red on my skin and it has a ton of
golden shimmer in it and it's kind of
like flecks of golden glitter there is
the actual color let me go ahead and
squash it for you guys but yeah I
definitely shows up more like red than
like raspberry colored I think in my
opinion on other skin tones if you have
darker skin it shows up really like very
looking but for me it shows up very
great red so I had to be very very
careful with this blush so I don't just
look like a straight up like china doll
but this is really really beautiful love
the color and i love the formulation on
the bill on ebay splashes I have all of
them and let's see here three of them
are favorites of mine big time favorites
so the next one is the Milani baked
blush in the shade delicioso pink and
this is sort of like a satiny matte
color it's beautiful it is a cool toned
pink and I just love the formulation on
these baked blushes I can't talk about
them enough I think Milan ease blush
game is so strong like so so so strong
so there is delicioso pink and let me go
ahead and swatch that one for you guys I
just love the way a cool tone blush
looks if you have very very fair skin it
makes your skin look very like doll like
and just like you went outside and your
cheeks got cold and like that's the
color of your cheeks so I really really
do love that one I think it's absolutely
stunning the next item I want to talk
about is the non blush item and this is
the Milani brow shaping wax then you may
be like what the how Olivia like any
brand has good like brow wax but
honestly and this is the best brow wax
that I have ever found from Milani I
think it's absolutely fantastic it just
comes in this pencil form I can't even
open the
now because my fingers are all oily but
it just comes in this pencil form and I
think it was about this long when i
first started so you just keep
sharpening it you can sharpen it with
like any sort of sharpening you just use
the bigger side but it honestly is the
best thing for keeping your brows in
place all day better than any sort of
brow gel I have honestly this is this
Milani brow shaping wax is the best
thing and I like that it doesn't leave
them looking oily or slick it literally
just holds it in place all day without
adding color or anything like that all
right the next item is the baked blush
in luminaux so as you guys can see I
have completely worn off everything on
there you can't even see you don't even
know who this is from but it is from
Milani it's a beautiful peachy
iridescent color this is gorgeous on
everyone everyone i swear to god this is
such a universal wash it's just this
beautiful peachy iridescent color with
like gold shimmer running through it it
looks beautiful on fair skin it looks
beautiful on medium skin tan skin deep
skin everybody like can wear this blush
and it's stunning it is just absolutely
stunning and this is one of the big
blushes out of the bunch that has has
really really like finely milled glimmer
in there so it's not like you have
chunks of glitter like red vino or maybe
some of the other ones like coralina or
even what I don't know Rosie or all
those dalesio not delicioso pink in the
what's it called that other pink one you
guys know what I'm talking about a lot
of those have like chunks the glitter
this one has really finely milled smooth
like glimmer effect it's awesome and
then the last final item is the Milani
powder um the rose powder blush yes and
this shade is called Coral Cove I really
like all three of them that I have but
honestly this one is just so beautiful i
love the way a coral blush or a peach
blush looks on fair skin I think it's
absolutely stunning and these are so
beautiful they're just so beautiful look
at that color it's like a hot coral and
it just makes it look like again you
just like came back from a run or
something you know you just look like
you really flushed skin so really really
adore that blush as well so anyway that
is why I combine the two videos just
because I felt like I don't have
although I do have a lot of products
from Milani a my top five
like products are not really that
diverse I'm just really into their
blushes so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this Sephora haul it's hot by
series video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
