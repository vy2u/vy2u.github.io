thank you so much for joining me today i
am doing quite a few different videos
i'm going to be posting some reviews i
have a hall i'm going to be doing my
empties and so I thought I would start
with a hall from Sephora I think we can
all appreciate a good haul just in case
there's some people that don't enjoy
watching reviews or don't want to watch
empties I figured we can all appreciate
a good support hall so anyway I placed
an order on sephora.com and i'm going to
show you guys what I got so the first
thing I got if you guys watched one of
my support halls maybe a few weeks ago
you saw that I picked up a supplement
from Cobb which is having bird nutrition
um you can get these at Sephora
obviously um but I've got there like a
dietary supplement it's called skinny
bird and so it's basically like a
supplement that just helps you from
overeating throughout the day you take
like three capsules right 30 minutes
before three different meals and I have
noticed that I just don't eat as
crappily as I used to like I really
really think about what i want to eat
what I want to put my body so I'm really
really happy with that supplement so I
thought I'd pick up some other humm
nutrition products so i picked up the
hum flatter me supports flatter stomach
and healthy digestion i'm not quite sure
if this will make my tummy flat but it
is basically a proprietary enzyme blend
to break down um like just it's just
really really good at house like ask
topless in it and things that just help
to flush everything through your body
really nicely so it's basically just a
healthy digestion aid I guess you can
say and it has 18 full spectrum enzymes
and it says your secret to a flatter
stomach designed around your diet we
developed a comprehensive proprietary
enzyme blend that supports all major
phases of nutrient digestion flatter me
is formulated to optimize protein carb
fiber and fat breakdown and to help with
nutrient absorption relief from
indigestion and bloating so I just
thought this would be fun to try out I
am not currently taking fiber and even
like that so
I thought oh well you know this could
kind of be like my digestion 8 so anyway
it says to take two capsules with food
before your two main meals of the day so
my main meals personally our lunch and
dinner so I will be taking one at lunch
and one at dinner and that just helps
you know everything really clean out of
your system yeah you guys catch my drift
the next one I picked up was hum moody
bird and it says your monthly allied
versus PMS and I thought this would be
interesting I usually use my doll and I
just find that I literally pop like six
of those a day when I'm on my period and
I don't think that's very good for you
they have caffeine in them they just I
just don't think it's good for you so I
thought I would try something that is
completely natural and I just thought
this would be interesting it has dong
quai and chaste berry which is like a
vitex mix or something and it says I
check out hums moody bird formulated
with dong quai root and chaste berry
extract that helps maintain healthy
hormonal balance Chaz berry is widely
researched for its reputation to
alleviate the symptoms of PMS so I think
that would be interesting also let me
know if you guys wanna I don't know what
happen on there's much but let me know
if you guys are interested in seeing a
supplement video where I show you guys
what kind of beauty supplements I take
including stuff like this but also
things I take for my hair my skin my
nails and skin you know all that kind of
stuff let me know if you're interested
in that because I would really think
that that's kind of fun to make a video
about that let me know below if you're
interested in seeing that and the last
thing I got to me how nutrition line is
uber energy it says it supports
consistent energy through adrenal
strength with ABS out of a tofu Jews
l-tyrosine b5 and b6 and I do have a lot
of energy I was telling my friend I flip
this off the other day but Nana now your
way to energize you don't need it but
however I find that around like the
afternoon I just really start to get
like I start to yawn I feel a little
tired however at night time I've never
tired and in the morning i'm never tired
so I thought it would be nice to take
this supplement in the afternoon with my
lunch it says to take two of them with a
yeah two capsules daily with food so you
just take it once a day two castles
um so yeah so anyway so I'm really
excited to try out some more of the calm
nutrition I really do like supplements
and I have tried a lot so I think it
will be fun to kind of see how those do
in my routine anyway let's get on to
some makeup kind of stuff that was kind
of health-related but let's get on to
some other stuff I am really really late
on the bandwagon when it comes to this
product this is the hourglass ambient
lighting powder I don't know why I never
picked one of these up but um I was
really interested in getting like the
little um trio of them however I went to
Sephora and I actually swatched them
before I ordered online and I just
thought in that trio everything was a
little dark I was thinking if I'm going
to use it as a highlight or if I'm going
to be using it to set my foundation it
just looks you know too dark so I ended
up just going and picking up one of the
full sizes of this shade right here this
is called ethereal light and it is like
a cool-toned white color and I just
thought I could highlight with this I
might be able to set my foundation with
this will see it just looks really
really beautiful and I think it gives
the beautiful glow to the skin can you
guys see it so I'm gonna try that out
and I think it's beautiful the
formulation is gorgeous I'm so late on
the bandwagon when it comes to these but
anyway ethereal light is the one that I
picked up and I just think it's going to
be really well-suited for up my skin
tone personally so I'll let you guys
know what I think of that I think I'm
gonna like it I know it's like a hit and
miss for a lot of people some people
love it and some people are like this
doesn't do anything and I know it's
expensive the big ones are forty five
dollars apiece um and if you do have
like I would say middle like medium tone
skin too dark skin you should definitely
pick up the trio because the trio
actually has um like three different for
I think like around $45 to so you get
three different products but anyway so
yeah this was 45 for this big thing but
um I'm gonna try it out and you know
we'll see how it goes so anyway moving
on the next thing I got this was
actually on sale so it was thirty nine
dollars and $125 value however I got
this for like fifteen dollars on the
Sephora sale part of the website so
definitely check it out and see if it's
still there I was just really drawn to
it I thoughtful packaging was really
cute it's like a
/ this is the Sephora brand by the way
he just unzip it and inside check this
out whoa beautiful you get like these
gorgeous gorgeous baked eye shadows you
get a bronzer a highlight two blushes
and an eye pencil so I just was like wow
those are really nice and I just wanted
to definitely see what they were all
about and I think the colors are
beautiful they swatch really nicely they
do feel quite like baked if you guys
catch my drift when I say that I mean
like they don't feel particularly smooth
and creamy but they are very pigmented
and I'm really really excited to try it
out the eye pencil is black and then of
course you get that nice bronzer
highlight and blush duo at the bottom so
really really excited to try that out
that's the way you know a lot of fun I
have nothing to wipe my fingers on so
I'm going to wipe it on my arm okay now
i think the rest of this yes the rest of
this this is crazy i used up tons of
points tons of points i have like a
thousand something points racked up and
I was like you know what I'm gonna get
some and I'm going to you know spend
them on me and I'm going to spend some
of my boyfriend's so anyway I really
like on the Sephora website now they
have a section where you can actually
look under men's point perks and I just
think that's kind of interesting I'm
kind of trying to start I have a lot of
perfumes as you guys know way back there
I have a lot of perfumes I have a lot of
body mist I like to collect and I kind
of gotten my boyfriend into trying out
new colognes and wearing a different
scent every day something that you like
so be kind of restoring a little
collection for him of colognes which i
think is really cute I don't know how
when he feels about it but i thought i
would pick up some of these 100-point
perks for him so we can try out new
sense also so i got the prada luna rossa
this is for men this was one of the
hundred point perks and it's so cute
because actually comes in like the
little bottle but it's like a nice
deluxe size sample so he really can try
the product out see if he likes it it's
not like one of those little like roller
balls or even the tiny little spray ones
like it's actually cute keep the bottle
um
i also got him the paco rabanne poker
with on top / bot I don't know 1,000,000
it looks like this and the packaging for
this is also really really cute and I
just wanted him to try it out and see if
you'd like to that sent also i know that
is a popular one and i also got him
gucci guilty for men it looks like this
and the bottle is really cute too i'm
such a sucker for these tiny little like
deluxe sized bottles i think they're so
cute so that's like a nice level they're
great to travel with two got him that
one and then I think I've got him one
more i spent like four hundred points on
him but it was worth it because i have
so many um i also got him the gucci made
to measure which looks like this and the
bottle looks like this it's so cute
adorable so anyway so I found him four
of those they were 100 point perks I
think it's awesome that you know like if
you have a bunch of points racked up you
can use some for yourself and use some
for your man so sadly have a few of
those I'm really excited to give those
to him um next I got this hundred point
work this is for you to what no this was
one of those deals that you just type in
online and you get like a deluxe size
this is the new Urban Decay revolution
high color lip gloss in bittersweet and
it's funny because I will actually today
be filming a review on this product I
picked up a full-size in the color fail
bait you'll have to check the review to
see what I feel about it but um this was
really nice as the great color like
really nice purpley tone for summer
really really cool so as you can see
pretty pigmented also so anyway that's I
was fun you can always type in those
little codes and they have like specials
for the week so that was one of them um
the next thing I got I got some more
samples for the man
I got polo black from Ralph Lauren
another fragrance I got the dolce and
gabbana the one for men I got to the
lacoste for men and then for me I got
the versace bright crystal i also got
let's see here dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion skin exfoliant the
Sephora instant moisturizer and then
another 100 point perk I got was the
josie maran hundred percent pure argan
oil and I actually got two of these I'm
going to grab the other one over here my
mom is staying with me so I did give her
one of them and then I'm going to keep
one of them I really should try this oil
whoops sorry somebody was calling me
there I've never actually tried the
josie maran argan oil so I thought this
would be interesting my mom did use it
last night she said she liked it so I
also got one for myself for a hundred
point perk and that's a nice little size
so that's the josie maran argan oil one
hundred percent argan oil I think it's
our damned if to awesome um and then is
a 500-point perk he had a son who
haven't used up a lot of points but I
got a lot wrapped up so I thought I
would um they had the Bumble and Bumble
hair dressers invisible oil kit so in
here this is a 500-point perkin in here
it just opens up like this and I've
heard a lot about the invisible oil the
hairdresser's invisible oil thing so I
thought I'd try it out you get the
actual oil you get a little nice size
like that I have another one that's like
that I haven't tried it yet though but
you also get this nice size um
hairdressers invisible oil heats like UV
protected primer that's like such a
great size you know totally worth it
then you get the hairdresser's invisible
oil sulfate free shampoo also really
nice size and you also get the
conditioner so I thought that was really
worth it they also had a bare minerals
one at the time but I thought I'd go
with this one because I've heard a lot
of good things about this particular
line from bumble bumble so next I just
have a bunch of samples i get so many
samples from sephora and anytime i order
online i just get triple everything so
up anyway I got this clinic cleanse
exfoliate and moisturize three-step
system I've got the Chloe perfume sample
I got another 100 point perk this is the
chaser shine cream from dry bar I
thought it'd be interesting i've never
actually used usually I use like shine
sprays I've never actually tried a shine
cream so I think you put this in in damp
air yeah work a small dollop through
damp or dry hair avoiding the roots you
slightly on fine hair so thought I'd try
that out um two more versace crystals
perfume samples another dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion ad or capture totale
dream skin sample a Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer sample another
one of these Sephora instant
moisturizers another Smashbox photo
finish the Brio geo don't despair repair
deep conditioning mask and the last
thing another Smith Smashbox photo
