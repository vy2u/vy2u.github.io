happy Wednesday happy wednesday i hope
you guys are having a wonderful day i
woke up super late i have about 10 to 15
minutes to film for you guys and
originally I was going to be filming two
different videos today my highlighter
declutter and also my Sephora vib
recommendations you guys can see I look
like a mess i did my five-minute makeup
i have my hair up in a messy bun and i
have a sweatshirt on i had to head out
the door quickly so i thought what can i
get up for you guys that wouldn't be too
time-consuming that would definitely be
a Sephora haul so I did get a box from
Sephora last night and I'm going to
share with you guys what I picked up so
let's go ahead and get started the first
item that I picked up is from bite
Beauty this is a new product and
currently I believe it is sold out on
the website this is the bite Beauty
creme lip gloss with resveratrol and the
shade is called gold and this is kind of
like the Jew a lip toppers this is what
it looks like it's a beautiful beautiful
creme of gold lip gloss and I was super
excited to get this I don't have any of
these you a lip toppers here is what's
the little ones looks like but I don't
have any of these you a lip toppers so I
was super excited to get my hands on
this and it looks beautiful but beauty
is definitely a brand that I trust as
far as formulation is concerned as far
as it being comfortable on the lips and
things like that so super excited to try
this out that is hella pigmented and it
is just absolutely beautiful to look at
I will try and get a review up on that
if you guys would like to see one but
I'm not making any promises this week
and next week are really busy for me
work wise so I will try but if I don't I
will definitely do a follow-up hall on
here wait yes a follow-up all for this
hall next week and then i will give you
guys my thoughts on it alright moving on
the next item that I picked up was from
the Sephora collection you guys know I'm
a big fan of the Sephora collection so I
got another one of their eye mask this
is actually knew this is the LG I'm
asked this is what it looks like and I
was super excited to try it out it's
supposed to tone and detoxify your
under-eye area so very excited for that
I also picked up a highlighter from
Makeup Forever when these release I
wanted both of them and then I put just
one of them in my loveless so this shade
that I picked up is 0-1 this is their
typical kind of beige delay formulation
highlighter this is what it looks like
and this one is called golden pig isn't
that gorgeous like it's so beautiful so
let me go ahead and squash it it is
typical bake sale a formulation and
because it does have that kind of like
ripped thing going on I do think ribbed
oh my god that sounds so wrong but how
because it doesn't have that texture I
think that you do need to go ahead and
really dig your finger in there but
there is the actual a swatch I cannot
wait to put this on my face look at that
absolutely beautiful definitely more
pink tones and Goldie but I may have to
pick up the other one which is just a
pure gold color all right to moving on
at the next two items that I picked up
worse in sephora cleansing wipes I
really love these and these are my two
favorite out of the whole entire sephora
like collection that they have for their
does that make sense these are my
favorite out of the entire like
cleansing my collection that they have
so these are the roads ones these are
ultra moisturizing and brightening
really beautiful and then I also got the
yuzu ones and the usual ones are like
lemon scented and these ones to tone the
skin and they also revitalize so I like
both of those I have already purchased
those before and then I also picked up a
NARS velvet lip glide the shade that I
got is called bound and I recently saw
emilynoel83 talking about these and I
was like I need to try them out her
video was called like creamy lip love or
something and i was just like i need
those in my life so I did pick up this
shade and I put three on my love's list
so i will pick the other two up during
the vib sale if I like the formulation
but oh my god this is so creamy yes yes
yes yes when I first saw that these
released on the website I thought they
were more of a liquid lipstick and I'm
really not into those anymore so I
didn't want to pick it up but look at
that really beautiful very shiny and
very very creamy so I'm super excited to
try that out alright and then let's go
ahead and get into some of my little
like point perks and things like that I
did pick up a 500-point perk from the
amore Pacific line this is the 500-point
reward age-defying skincare collection
so this is what it looks like I do like
the more I Pacific line at my only
complaint is that these are very heavily
fragrance but I think they work well so
inside of here you are getting the
treatment enzyme peel peel you're also
getting the future response age defense
cream you're getting the treatment
cleansing foam and absolutely future
response age defense serum so very
excited to try this out i have tried
quite a few of the products in here in
sample size already
so I know that they are good and I feel
like these are probably pretty darn good
sample sizes these are definitely deluxe
sized samples so very very excited to
try those out i have tried out the serum
and i liked it a lot again my only
complaint with amore pacific is that
just that they are very very like overly
fragrance so here is the last item this
is the cleansing foam I've never tried
that so that will be fun and then the
other 500 point perk that I got was from
Murad and this is the instant effects
smooth and firm set so we have the eye
lifting firming treatment the aah a
slash of bha exfoliating cleanser the
hydrodynamic ultimate moisture cream and
outside the rapid collagen infusion
serum so that is what it looks like and
I'm super excited for these as well I
don't think I've tried any of the ones
in this kit which is crazy because I was
right a lot of products from your ad but
none of these so here we have the
firming treatment again of these are
really really nice sizes here and right
now during the holiday season they have
some really good point park so if you
have a lot stocked up like i do i highly
recommend going ahead and picking up one
of these sets this one here is the
ultimate moisture cream then we have the
serum here and then right here we have
that cleansing foam I'm super excited
for this aaha / bha so this is like a
basically a chemical cleanser i guess a
chemical exfoliant i guess you could say
all right and then I did pick up some
hundred point perks the first is from
the st edit line this is the pink peony
overnight water pack kind of like a
sleeping mask I also picked up this
herbivore moonfruit superfruit night
treatment it is like purple do you guys
see that so this is basically kind of
like an overnight mask as well or an
overnight cream I also picked up the
tart drink of h2o hydration boost this
is just a nice little citrus kind of
moisturizer and then I also picked up
let's see here the benefit gimme brow
brow volume my lip ral volumizing fiber
gel in the shade number three probably
going to be too dark for me I don't know
why about that and then I did pick up
the elizabeth and james nirvana rose
roll on because i do like the scent of
it i only like to mix this together i do
have a full size of bourbon but this one
is nice for mixing together with other
fragrances so those are all the items
that i got
it looks like i left my three samples
out I can't remember which ones I got
but those are the items that I picked up
from sephora i hope you guys enjoyed
this hall i'm sorry this was a little
last minute but this was the only video
i had time to film today so thank you so
much for joining me i hope you guys have
a wonderful night and i will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
