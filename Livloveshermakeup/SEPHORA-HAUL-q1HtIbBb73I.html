haul for you guys I was doing just like
some random small items shopping the
past week and I basically added
everything together so this is a
collective haul there's not tons and
tons of stuff but I thought that I would
show you guys anyway i think i got like
six or seven different products um so I
thought I would just call it anyway just
put them all together and haul it so
here we go let's get started the first
two things that I picked up were um glam
glow mass and I picked them up in the
smaller side I really need to just go
ahead and invest in the full sizes of
all of these glow mass because I like
all of them but the two that I picked up
where the smaller size of the glam glow
use mud which is the tingle exfoliate
treatment and I also picked up the glam
glow power mud which is the dual cleanse
so I really like both of these out of
all of the gunwale mass I would say my
favorite is this one right here the dual
cleanse I think if you're a combination
skin this is perfect it's got a little
tiny kohli ating beads in it and it
smells amazing but really for
combination skin it's really really good
because it will like clear up and
decongest you your t-zone which is where
you tend to get oily if you have
combination skin and if you get really
dry on your cheeks which usually happens
with combination skin it will help
moisturize that area so that is what the
mask looks like again it is probably
worth it to go ahead and just splurge
and purchase the full size of the mass
which are sixty nine dollars a piece
these little tiny ones are twenty
dollars but honestly I think you'll make
it like trying to remember how much use
I got out of this I feel like I these
smaller sizes i only get like a week's
use out of if I use it every other day
so probably worth it to go ahead and
purchase the full size but that is the
dual cleanse and then this is the tingle
exfoliate one and this one is for um
just like it's called youth mud so it's
basically supposed to be like anti-aging
it smells really good as well and I
would definitely recommend for basically
all skin types except for sensitive it
is a little abrasive this one definitely
has like exfoliating particles in it so
if you have sensitive skin it might be a
little too much for you but it's really
really nice it looks like this awesome
else really really good that is what it
looks like and I believe there are green
tea leaves in
why which is why its anti-aging because
green tea is it very very good for you
so anyway I'm excited to try both of
these or how to try them just use them
because I have tried both of them before
but again twenty dollars for this tiny
little container and there is point five
ounces in here so I would recommend if
you really like know that you like one
of these go ahead and just start to sit
in the full size so those are the first
two things I got the second two things I
got our supplements I don't know if you
guys have ever seen these on the
sephora.com website but there's this
brand called hum or hummingbird
nutrition ah this is a repurchase for me
this one right here is called skinny
bird this one is new to me but let me
know if you guys want to see a video on
um like a whole video dedicated to
hummingbird nutrition products i think
i've tried almost every single one of
their supplements i really really like
the brand like i said this is a
repurchase for me i want to say right
away i'm not trying to lose weight at
any way shape or form I like to just
kind of maintain my weight where it is
right now my weight definitely
fluctuates between either 102 like 115
pounds I think right now I'm around like
110 so my weight definitely fluctuates
but the reason I use this particular
product is because it's all-natural and
it's not like something like what's that
weight loss thing called like hydroxycut
or something it doesn't have caffeine in
it nothing that's like unnatural
basically and it is pure and potent it's
non-gmo it's gluten-free GMP certified
no artificial colors or preservatives
and they are sustainably sourced and all
of their products are like that this
particular product you are supposed to
take one capsule up to three times daily
30 minutes before food I will tell you
guys right away these will make you sick
to your stomach if you don't have like
food like in your stomach already so I
actually only take two supplements a day
and I will take them 30 minutes before
lunch and 30 minutes before dinner and
what I noticed with this product is that
my sugar cravings are almost
non-existent like non-existent and it's
really funny because i'm normally
someone who craves sugar like a lot
either really salty foods or really
sugary foods I don't notice that this
helps with salty foods but um when it
comes to like sugary foods this really
really like and it's almost non-existent
like my cravings are almost non-existent
when it comes to that so I really really
do like this I take it every single day
and this is every purchase for me like I
said so what's in here if you guys are
curious they have five htp which helps
with stress eating they have green tea
extract which does have fifty percent
caffeine in it but it is like naturally
sourced since it is from green tea and
that I supposed to help boost your
metabolism and then it has a car luma
fimbriata which helps with appetite
suppression as appetite suppress your
suppression right yeah it's like an
appetite suppressant suppressant and
then they have chromium in here which
controls blood sugar which is why I
think that it really helps with my sweet
cravings so anyway I really like this a
lot um it doesn't have sugar starch
yeast wheat gluten corn soy milk egg
preservatives nothing like that really
really natural and let me know if you
guys would like to see a whole video
dedicated to these kind of supplements
because I really do like them and then
the second one that I picked up I'm is
the Big Chill this is supposed to help
you cope with and remove the signs of
stress I'm not somebody who's normally
stressed out but I just thought this
might be nice to take I do have ADHD
like pretty severe ADHD and I'm really
really hyper and constantly just kind of
I guess if how do I put it if I don't
use my energy the right way my ADHD
symptoms turn into a little bit of
stress for me so I try and just I just
want to be like consistent and kind of a
little more calm if that makes sense so
I'm hoping that these work I really have
had good luck with this brand in here is
rogelio rhodiola rhodiola extract um and
yeah again it's free of sugar starch
eased all that stuff and it says don't
this dress room your look stressed
releases hormones that make a unhealthy
breakout and age Big Chill contains a
adaptogens that are clinically
researched for their ability to stop you
reacting to stress so that you can keep
it clear head and stay beautiful during
demanding conditions so you're supposed
to take one capsule daily with food um
and yeah it says that you should see a
difference within like one to two weeks
so i'll let you guys know about that so
that is there yet alright moving on I
pick
up a palette and I have been looking at
these eyeshadow palettes for a very long
time this is the Stila I serve the
window I shadow palette so they have
different ones um I have masks all over
my finger they have different ones and
they're all called like mind body soul
like stuff like that really really cute
the one that I picked up is called body
and i was looking at all them and i was
like i really wanted to get the all not
one or the neutral one this was the one
that really stuck out the most and i was
like should I get it but then I was like
wow look at those colors so first of all
you guys look at this packaging oh my
god stila I am sorry but is there
anything prettier than just an all-over
rose gold packaging I don't think so
it's like mirrored rose gold totally
totally stunning you open it up you have
a really nice sized mirror and they have
a little thing here this is the true
work of art is but a shadow of the
divine perfection whoo-hoo Michelangelo
um and then look at these colors I'm
sorry but is that not like one of the
most beautiful eye shadow palettes ever
I think that is stunning and I don't
even know if some of the glitters are
being picked up in here but they have
like glitter in here it's like gorgeous
gorgeous colors so this is the one I
picked up I want to swatch a few of
these wow they feel buttery oh my god
I'm so excited there's a few colors
right there that's kind of like the past
le side of the palette they look like
they're really pigmented and beautiful
hold on let me wipe my hands but they
look really pigmented and beautiful and
I just thought it really reminded me of
like winter going into spring because
you get these kind of darker like colors
here which are kind of wintry but then
you go in and you get these light pastel
shades like that purple shade right
there that one right there has like
little flecks of blue glitter in it I
just thought it was stunning I want to
watch that aqua color the purple they
feel really nice to the glittery shades
feel a little rough but nothing crazy so
I just thought these were beautiful
colors and I was like that's the one I
want to get which was funny because
normally
I'm the kind of girl who would get a
neutral kind of palette but really
really stunning and I'm so excited to
play with this you guys I can't even
tell you I'm really really excited while
these are really not coming off at all
good to know all right moving on so yeah
I'm definitely excited to play with that
palette moving on I also picked up okay
this ham so but this was in the sale
section this is from nest fragrances
this is the woodland truffle liquid hand
soap now my boyfriend is obsessed with
truffle truffle everything he literally
has these little tiny bottles of like
$75 truffle oil I know that he dumps on
everything like he puts it on like he
could probably put it on cereal he loves
the taste of truffle and he loves
truffle salt truffle oil so when I saw
this woodland truffle liquid hand soap I
was like I have to get that for him
we're gonna put this in our master
bathroom and I think he's really gonna
like it plus the container is actually
really really cute so I feel like we
don't need to fill up the soaps leave
like this is cute enough so let's go
ahead and take a whiff of it and see if
it actually smells like truffle or if it
doesn't oh my gosh oh god I got on my
dogs out here I can smell it it smells
really really good it actually felt a
little bit like trouble but not like
straight-up truffle oil or anything but
I think you'll really like it and even
if he doesn't like the scent he'll like
the thought that I think of him as being
a truffle person so anyway um it says
this liquid hand soap contains natural
plant extracts to help clean and nurse
can bubble wha how to use okay we don't
need to read that you know how to use
soap but anyway I thought that was cute
it was like fifteen dollars which is
super pricey for a hand soap and that
was on sale which is crazy alright so
let's get into some of the point perks I
picked up a bare minerals I think this
is a serum this is the skin saw riyals
it's like tutorials but skins Orioles
and it says introducing skin longevity
vital power infusion this is what it
looks like and this was 800 point perk
so let's open it up I pretty storm sure
this is a serum it says after
apply to pumps over entire face and neck
use morning and night so that is what it
looks like I'm excited to try this out
um cuz I don't know they're really
getting into like skin care stuff which
is great so I'm excited to try that and
then I also got the Smashbox photo
finish primer oil I was gonna pick up a
full size of this and doing wool review
on it but then I was looking at the
reviews and everybody was just like it
just seems like a normal primer so I
thought when they had the little code
that you could type in to try it out I
was like well I might as well try out a
smaller size of it so that is that and
then I also picked up the Murad
hydrodynamic quenching essence I love
that brands are coming out with essence
like whether it's like aqua essence
water fluids or just like the essence
like these are so cool they really
really um make like a difference in
hydration on your skin especially in the
morning before you put your serum on
these are fantastic so this one is
filthy weightless moisture that is
supposed to enhance the treatment
optimizes skins cup capacity to retain
hydration leaving a soft plump and
youthful so this is what it looks like
and I am excited to try that as well you
guys know I love these in skin care and
then they were having these little
things where you could type in a code
and get like multiple multiple I think
ten samples each of certain products so
i got the dr brandt um needles no more
which is something that i like I have
gone through a full size of this so I
believe you get ten samples here of the
dr brandt needles no more it's nice it's
one of those kind of instant
gratification products so you put it on
and you really do notice a difference
right away and like your fine lines and
just the way it plumps up your skin but
it's not something that over time I
found made a difference in my skin and
then I also got the algenis power play
this is a 10-day little pack of samples
as well and this is the power advanced
wrinkle fighter moisturizer so i will
probably put this on at night and you
get 10 samples of that which looks like
this
and then I also got the only Henrickson
power peel so you get it's like a three
step system and you get three different
treatments in here opens up it's like a
little like an envelope Alice and you
get three of these so you get the step
one which is an almond polish the step
two which is a lemon strip and then step
three is the chamomile comforts you get
to try that product out so I'm really
excited I like that little code that
they were having because honestly their
samples have sucked the past week which
is why I really didn't pick up I think I
only picked up one order of samples out
of the three orders that I place if I
picked out like one order of samples
because all the other ones i have not
been liking all they have right now is
like fragrances i'm not into it I've so
many you guys Nick if you watch my
beauty room tour used to have seen that
I have a lot of perfumes and fragrances
by have so many fragrant samples so I
already had all those ones so that kind
of sucked but that's okay um and then I
got the fresh CBOE moisturizing face oil
this had omegas 3 6 7 &amp;amp; 9 in it I
already know I like this product I have
tried it before and then I got two
samples of the kate somerville exfoliate
which i don't think is that fantastic i
have tried this before but it's nice to
have around so anyway that was my little
a collective Sephora haul I really
wasn't planning on doing a Sephora haul
it's just I ended up getting you know
different things in a couple of
different orders so I thought might as
well combine them and show you guys so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you would like a more in-depth
view view review on the hummingbird
nutrition products because like I said I
think there's only two of them that I
haven't tried so I really have tried a
lot of them and go thank you so much for
