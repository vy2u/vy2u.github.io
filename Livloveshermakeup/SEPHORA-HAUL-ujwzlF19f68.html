you so much for joining me I wanted to
get this video up before my other one
goes up tonight I am doing a collab
video that I already films I filmed it
in the other room because lighting there
is a little better um for likes watching
and things like that but I filled it in
the other room and it will be out
tonight at eight o'clock if you are in
like the Western Mid Western Hemisphere
the mid western hemisphere because
that's the thing if you're in the
Midwest it will be up at eight o'clock
tonight and if you're on the East Coast
it will be up at nine o'clock it is a
collab with my friend here on youtube
and we are doing our favorite fall /
winter blushes it's basically a top 5
series so if you're interested in seeing
my favorite fall winter blushes swatched
and everything like that and it will be
up at eight o'clock Midwestern time nine
o'clock eastern time and yeah I'm really
excited I film that earlier and then I
thought you know what I wanted to come
on here and share a Sakura haul with you
guys because i know you love sephora
balls and i do too and I got a big big
big box and it is basically there's not
like tons of so I guess there is a bit
of stuff there's not tons of stuff but I
do want to say that um they're basically
gift sets but not makeup related so
these are more like skin care if you've
got like a toothpaste set yes toothpaste
I know that's weird but yes I got a
toothpaste set and like hand cream set
things like that so let's just get
started shall we the first thing I
picked up it was twenty eight dollars
and I feel like you get so much stuff in
here it's awesome so this is the
philosophy Christmas cookbook set and
this is like I said twenty eight dollars
on the website and this is a set of four
of their shower gel shampoo and bubble
bath so if you've never tried
philosophies like trio little product
thing basically they have all these
wonderful scents and they can be
basically anything you want them to be
they can be a bubble bath akibi shower
gel they can be shampoo and they always
come out little sets around the holiday
that smell really really good and this
one is the spice of the season that
fills the air so this is what it looks
like and in here you get 4 4 fluid ounce
products so really really good deal for
$28 such as steel I like to use these
mostly a shower gels and
as a bubble bath as the shampoo they're
okay but um I just prefer other shampoos
that I have but the first sent that you
get in here is called fresh cream and
philosophy always puts the recipe for
everything that like the scent is like
on the front does that make sense if you
want the recipe for fresh cream it will
be on the front tooth what I'm trying to
say they always have the recipe there
which i think is so cute but this one is
fresh cream let's smell it oh it smells
really good it smells like kind of like
buttercream frosting but like a little
like mike whipped like a little lighter
so that is the first one you get I can't
wait to use that the second one I'm
super excited about it is spice cinnamon
stick and i already know i'm taking this
with me when i travel for the holidays
when i travel for Christmas because you
know it's great because it's a bubble
bath and a shower gel and one you guys
know I take baths like literally every
other day um I just prefer like shaving
my legs in the bath rather than in the
shower so I do it every other day I know
that's crazy but it's just the way it is
um but anyway I'm gonna take this with
me for Christmas and spice cinnamon
stick smells like oh my gosh oh it
smells like cinnamon and just like a
cinnamon stick huh go figure cinnamon
stick it smells so so good I love this
one so far um the third one you get in
here it's pumpkin icing I think this is
going to be really fun to start using
like ASAP as a bubble bath yeah oh it
smells good it smells kind of like
pumpkin cupcake from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
if you smell that scent this smells kind
of similar and I love that they have the
little recipe on the front because
pumpkin I see yes I want to make that
I'm but anyway that smells really good
and then the last one they have is
vanilla bean nutmeg and I feel like that
one's gonna be really nice oh yeah it
smells really good like vanilla but like
a spicy vanilla not like a sweet vanilla
so I like that a lot definitely my
favorite out of this one so far is spice
cinnamon stick like I said I'm going to
travel with that one for Christmas and
then I'm going to use this one probably
ASAP the pumpkin one because I'm going
to use it before like fall time is gone
and fresh cream and vanilla bean nutmeg
seem like they're going to be really
nice winter sense so anyway I think that
that is
great great deal you should definitely
check that out if you guys can from
philosophy because for $28 that's a
great gift set and you get so much
product in there so I'm really excited
for that the next little um gift set I
brought is from la cita and this is the
hand cream delights and this is like
four little miniatures sizes of their
hand creams it looks like this super
super cute packaging and the ones that
you get in here are cherry blossom rose
the regular just shave scent and you
also get almond so I'm really really
excited I am literally ripping this
thing open this is what it looks like as
you guys can see and you get a decent
amount of product in here it's point 3
ounces like this is a nice little like
starter sides if you've never tried the
la cita hand creams they are so rich and
hydrating they can be a little oily and
greasy but they're wonderful and I feel
like one of these is great to take like
traveling as a hand cream or to have in
your purse so this one is the almond one
looks like that and then you get just
the regular Shea scent which looks like
this everybody raves about this one then
you get the rose scented one which is
also really nice I love anything rose
scented and then the last one you get is
cherry blossom I'm super excited for
this one I've never smelled this one so
again that's a really nice little kit it
is um they don't have a price on here
but I believe this was less than twenty
dollars maybe like fifteen dollars so
really nice prize you get four different
kinds to try out and then you can
purchase your favorite scent in full
size alright is the next little gifts
that I got is from peter thomas roth
this is the just mask it kit and I got
last year's and last year's had the
pumpkin enzyme mask the cucumber gel
mask and the row stem cell and actually
I noticed that last year's came in
bigger packaging but the reason I wanted
to try this year's was because they have
two new ones in here I already have
tried this one and I still have the
cucumber gel mask but I have not tried
the Irish more mud one which is a
purifying black mask and I have not
tried the 24 karat gold one which is a
pure luxury lift and firm mask which is
the one I was really excited about but I
believe this was around 20 or 22 dollars
it was a really good deal
but the sizes are smaller than last year
which is kind of a bummer they're like
really really mini but they'd be great
for traveling so this is the Irish more
mud and it looks like it's just like a
like looks like mud it looks like a mud
mask I don't know how else to describe
it but this is supposed to be really
nice for purifying and refining the
pores at decongesting the skin hydrating
nutrient mineral rich and yeah so it
also has a volcanic ash that revitalizes
the skin so that sounds really nice you
guys know I'm really into masking I am a
big believer in masking so and this is
the one I really wanted to try this as
the peter thomas roth 24 karat gold mask
it's a pure luxury lift and firm mask
it's got pure 24 karat gold and
collodial gold that help lift and firm
it imparts an opulent glow it just
sounds amazing and look it's so shiny
and I'm sorry but I love anything shiny
so can't wait to try that skin me that I
had the hiccups for a second there and
then of course the cucumber gel mask
which I really really like this is super
nice especially if your skin is like
inflamed or if you just need something
cooling to put on it you know sometimes
where you just like I don't know you may
have scrubbed at your skin too long or
just like know you have a lot of
breakout things like that this is a
really really nice when it's very
calming and it's a gel mask and you can
put in the fridge and it will actually
um like get really nice and cold and it
feels even more refreshing so I really
really like this one let's look at the
24 karat gold when I want to see ooh
look at that look how shiny like what
yes can't wait to put that on my face
I'm gonna tell my boyfriend I'm wearing
gold on my face so anyway I always get
the little kid that they cut out with
because they do release um usually two
new masks in each one so I do like this
one and last year's was really good too
i'm in love with the rose stem cell i
bought that in a full sides and i'm
still going through the pumpkin enzyme
one as well which is awesome i love that
one i think i mentioned that in my
weekly favorites last week or the week
before awesome and then the cucumber gel
mask is just a nice one to have
alright the next thing I got look at
this is this supposed to be an ornament
because literally this thing is like
huge like I don't even know but this is
the Marcus toothpaste I saw this on the
Sephora website like I started to see
that people were talking about this like
like Marvis brand and I was like what do
they sell like is it makeup and it turns
out its toothpaste and I am one of those
people that the only thing I look for in
a toothpaste is that it tastes good
that's my only requirement I don't get
all the stuff that helps whiten I don't
get all this like whatever I just wanted
to taste good because if it's going in
my mouth wanted a good i'm sorry that's
just like that's just what I think so
anyway um they had all of these like a
full size of these is like seven or
eight dollars takis is kind of expensive
but it's like a luxury toothpaste and
they all seem like they would taste
really good but then I saw that they had
this little kit with like seven
different ones that you could try it
like you know try them out and see which
one tastes the best to you so I got this
one and the first one is the whitening
mint one and it looks like this so that
one's supposed to help whiten your teeth
I don't know if it will actually do that
but we'll see the second one in here is
called um I'm a relly licorice
interesting I don't know if it's going
to taste like black licorice I'm kind of
not fond of that but this was the one I
was really excited about from this kit I
can barely get these out of here this
Regulus ok this is the Jasmine mint
doesn't have an amazing i love jasmine
and i think that this will be a nice
combination and these are perfect for
travel by the way to come on like if
you're leaving for the holidays is like
the perfect amount of toothpaste and
then the next one is called ginger mint
and i really like ginger so i thought i
would like this one a lot and then we
have what's this one classic strong mint
which i heard someone here on youtube
talked about was it makeup by Tiffany D
maybe I think she liked the classic
strong mint one and that's that
now I think it was her and then we have
cinnamon and I love to cinema is
probably my favorite kind of mint
besides spearmint so this is cinnamon
mint I'm very excited about that and
then the last one in here is called just
aquatic mint I'm guessing that it's like
really really strong mint I guess so
that's what that one looks like I'm
really really excited for those and I do
apologize I believe my Roomba is going
to be coming out at any moment um it is
about yeah 3 30 and so if you hear my
little vacuum coming out I'm sorry but
anyway um so I'm really really excited
for those will seem so interesting and
different and kind of fun I'm definitely
the most excited about the Jasmine mint
the cinnamon mint and the ginger mint
those gonna be awesome I'll let you guys
know keep you updated on man um and then
I got two of the bite beauty these are
the new like holiday double-ended
lipsticks my friend who I am collabing

tonight's video yeah that releases the
eight or nine depending on where you are

this her name is leora or laura i'll
link her channel below but she did lip
swatches on all of the new ones and
these two caught my eyes so the first
one is cafe and pepper and i'll go ahead
and swatch them for you guys so this
side is pepper beautiful beautiful color
and the i just love the bite beauty
formula like it's amazing and so that
one is pepper thought that was a
gorgeous color it looked so pretty on
her lips too and then cafe is kind of
like a little more of like a pinky nude
but they go together really well so
pepper and then cafe is on the top there
so that is that little one and then the
second one this looks gorgeous on her
and she does have like darker hair and
like I don't know she has more like
darker features than I do maybe that's
why it looks so good on her I don't know
if this is going to make me look really
bad they or not but this is the very
vampy do this is in mulberry and scarlet
and this one is mulberry you got
can see it's got a very like deep purple
undertone it's gorgeous its core dues
and then scarlet is on the other side
and scarlet like even though you would
think scarlet I would probably have some
red in it this one's like deep deep deep
deep like I don't even know so that's um
the one on the top is wait what's it
called mulberry and then you have
scarlet on the bottom gorgeous can't
wait to wear these and play with these
she did such a good job in that video of
like selling them to me because she did
lip swatches and I don't know if she
just edited it really nice too and like
it was such a quick video I love that
like she reviewed I think all like
there's like seven new ones she got all
of them and those were the colors I
caught my eye so really say to put those
duos and then everything else is like
point perks and samples so the first
thing I got this was a bite Beauty
limited edition 250 Point perk i
recently got the one that was in like a
Bellini which was the summer one it was
like a bright pink fuchsia color but
this one is called it's the luminous
creme lipstick and the lush fruit lip
gloss in what's called her royal so let
me show you guys this is the lip gloss
really really beautiful kind of dark
beautiful berry shade for fall then you
get a little mirror that has like the
pretty berry color on it and then you
get the little mini numinous creme
lipstick I will swatch the lipstick for
you guys I think it's beautiful and this
looks kind of similar to that duo that I
got but that's right they're a little
more pinky very very pretty so I love
that they have that has a 250 point for
it cuz that's awesome i love bite beauty
all right i got like a little do au pair
of the dior iconic over curl mascara and
the dior mascara base so I think I don't
