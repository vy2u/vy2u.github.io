this video I do have a Sephora haul for
you guys and I kind of want to like slap
myself in the face for this because I
literally just two days before a ball
like a week ago on my channel but anyway
I did place an online order I purchased
some stuff that just kind of caught my
attention and then I did purchase some
items off of my love let lola loves list
so we have a mixture of let's see here
skincare and makeup so let's go ahead
and get right into it the first item
that I picked up was this Too Faced
product this has been really um
intriguing me every time I go on to
intriguing me yeah whatever it intrigues
me every time I go into the Sephora
website this is the Too Faced mascara
melt off this is a cleansing oil for
waterproof mascara and just regular
mascara I personally don't use a lot of
waterproof mascara because I feel like I
take the product off and it takes all my
lashes with it as well and I'm like no
thank you I want those back anyways this
is basically just a it looks like a
mascara like this is the thing that was
like intriguing to me so this is what
the packaging looks like and I think the
actual applicator is like yeah it's like
a wand it's like a mascara one so this
is something that you literally put
right onto your eyelashes and it starts
to dissolve the mascara now this could
go completely wrong like in two seconds
because I feel like every time I'm
cleansing my face anyway with an oil I
do get some in my eyes and I'm partially
blinded for a minute okay now i feel
like if you're putting this directly
onto your eyelashes it could technically
like get in your eye right away but i'm
really curious to try it out you guys
know my favorite way to remove my makeup
is with oils i just feel like it doesn't
pull and tug at your eye area so i'm
really excited to try this am I will
definitely after that definitely let you
guys know if this works out for me I'll
have a follow-up hall I'm exactly week
from today or hopefully a week from
today alright moving on the next slide
in the I picked up we're still more of
the only henriksen grease relief
cleansing cloths these are oil free
horrifying with botanical a chaise and
eucalyptus I always pick these up on any
time I place a Sephora online order
either these ones or the what is it the
cleansing truth ones the orange ones
alone smell really good like orange
creamsicle but I have found a comparable
like product to this that is cheaper so
technically a dupe and those are the
Garnier
clean + blackhead eliminating I think
it's blackhead eliminating cloth they're
very similar i like to use these in the
morning when I'm in a hurry and I don't
have time to wash my face I will just
wipe one of these all over and they have
a textured side to kind of like get out
the dirt and impurities and then a
softer side to really just kind of
cleanse your face really like them I
definitely feel like they're in fig
rating and very nice on the skin the
next item I picked up with another
hourglass ambient strobe lighting powder
I'm in love with these I have one in the
shade of brilliant which looks like this
which I love I talk about this all the
time use one of my favorite highlighter
and then in the hourglass holiday
palette I do have let's see here it's
called iridescent light which is that
one right there so i really like these
strobing powders i think they are better
than just the regular um hourglass
powders like the ambient lighting
powders these ones definitely have a
little more bang and bam too though if
that makes sense they definitely have a
little more Sparkle and luminosity and I
think they look absolutely stunning on
the skin so I did pick up incandescent
light which is a beautiful pinky color
this is what it looks like and this is
one of those items like I just feel like
I'm gonna collect all of these because
they're so beautiful it honestly love
the way that these look on the skin so
let me go ahead and swatch this for you
guys so you guys can see it's just a
beautiful kind of peachy pinky color and
right now I do a self tanner on and I
feel like this is going to look
absolutely beautiful with my little tan
that I have going on so there it is
really really beautiful color and I'm
super excited to try that out the next
item I picked up with another bozhe
makeup break up cool cleansing oil you
guys know like i said i love to remove
my makeup with cleansing oils and this
is definitely my favorite one out of
every single one that I've tried I've
tried a lot like the tacho 1 i've tried
i just tried everything and i just tried
regular oil as well like coconut oil
hobo oil i just love this one it really
really gets all the makeup off it leaves
your skin feeling kind of tingly and on
top of that there was no residual like
anything so there's no residue you just
wash your face everything comes off it's
wonderful really really love this
product and i have repurchased this over
and over right now I do have a huge pack
of the order they call daily cleansing
wipes or daily facials from Olay or
something like that they're like these
dry cloths that you get white wet that
you get white
that you get wet and then you wipe all
over your face and they take off your
makeup however I just feel like they're
so abrasive and they really tug and pull
it my skin and I'm trying to get away
from using makeup wipes for that reason
because I really feel like they do tug
and pull at your skin so I'm excited to
use this again and I will use those
little ol a cost to just wipe off
squatches all right is the next item
that I picked up at 152 faced love plush
long lasting 16-hour blush in baby love
I have a full size of every single one
of these I love these blushes these are
the best blushes ever okay like honestly
the perfect highlighting formula is
those like hourglass stroke powders and
then this is like the perfect blush
formulation in my opinion and when I
find something that I'm absolutely
obsessed with I need a full size of
every single shade I just too so i
finally got baby love and it has been a
like my god it has been a disaster
trying to get this particular blushy by
so i ordered it on HSN and it came
completely shattered i ordered it on
Alta calm it came completely shattered
and then I finally bonded on so for us
though I got refunded when they
obviously came broken but I was just so
upset because I've been trying to get my
hands on this forever it is very similar
to what is it tarts exposed blush is
just a beautiful kind of neutral rosy
nude color and I'm very excited to have
it like I said now I have all six of
them so that is wonderful this is what
it looks like beautiful beautiful color
and I love the way that these blushes
have a really nice light sort of
iridescent glow to them they just look
absolutely stunning on the skin honestly
the best like blush formulation ever so
today I have all of them alright moving
on I also picked up this bosha
detoxifying black cleanser this isn't
the smaller little deluxe sized version
Tom asked me to pick up a cleanser for
him he will be leaving and going out of
town on I think June fifteenth or like
the second week of june no not June wait
I read you now to lie he'll be going out
of town with his friends in July they're
going to Iceland do they do a trip
across these every single year and he
definitely has been breaking out a
little more lately now he has been
preparing for like his medical boards
and things like that so he's been a
little more stressed out but he wanted
me to pick up a cleanser for
that would help to decongest his pores
and kind of help with the breakouts and
things like that he does have very
severe combo skin so he's really really
dry during the winter and very very oily
during the summertime so I thought this
would be nice for him and I love this
cleanser I've gone through little deluxe
ice samples like this I've gone through
well this is not a sample it's like a
travel size I've gone through full sizes
on this it's a beautiful charcoal black
sensor that you put on it warms up and
heats up on your face which is awesome
and it just feels really nice on this
game so I thought he would like that um
hopefully he'll get to it before I do
because I'm a break into this I like it
that much all right let's talk about
some little deluxe ice samples they had
these early gross water ballon Cygnus
which you guys know is my favorite
facial miss they had a little sample
code that you could type in and get a
deluxe size of this of course I had to
get that 800 point perk was the Amica
peek up p cup purpose perk up and dry
shampoo a lot of people talk about this
and say it's fantastic and smells really
good super cute packaging so I did pick
that up and then let's see here they
also had a little code for the fresh
sugar rose a not this 100.4 I can't
remember something like that this is the
sugar rose a lip treatment I do not have
rose a I have like every single one in
the size except for this particular
shade so I picked this up these are
really nice and buttery and moisturizing
on the lips and they do have quite a bit
of color payoff so I'm excited to have
that and then the three samples I picked
up the first one was the Brazilian bum
bum cream and a friend of mine actually
sent me a video the other day like
putting this on her hand and she was
like it's so nice and soft so I'm super
excited to try this out and it is
infused with naturally um gharana
extracts so hopefully kind of like you
know fast absorbing it tightens and
smooths your butt all right so excited
for that and also I picked up the
origins high potency NightA mens skin
refining oil I did not know that they
had an item in soil hopefully this
smells just as good as the night cream
and then the last sample that I got is
the overall Visia I don't know how to
say this it's from Budapest and this is
the hydro melting cleanser and melts off
your makeup and I have tried this before
and it is quite nice so anyways those
are all of the items that
got in my little Sephora box I hope you
guys enjoyed this hall thank you so much
for joining me and like I said in a week
or hopefully a week from today I will
have a follow-up file for you guys and
yeah I will see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
