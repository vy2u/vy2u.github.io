this video I have my June 2016 unboxing
on these sephora play box to share with
you guys I did get this particular box
last month however I did not unbox it on
camera because if you have been watching
me for a while you know that I am
subscribed to I think eight or nine
different subscription boxes and I just
didn't have time last month so I am here
to do it for this month and I'm really
evilly excited because I did enjoy what
I got in last month's little bag I feel
like they have a nice variety of hair
care and skincare and makeup and I'm one
of those people I'm not like makeup
obsessed or skincare obsessed I love all
things beauty so I think this is a great
little subscription bag to get for ten
dollars a month so the first thing that
was in here was this little card here
and this offers you basically 50 extra
Beauty points if you bring it in store
so the next time you go shopping if you
do get the play box you can get 50 extra
beauty insider point they give you that
every single month and then on the
inside you have a little pouch here that
says play and I'm just gonna dig in here
and we shall see what we have so the
first item that I see here is from
bareMinerals this is the bare skin sheer
Sun a serum bronzer I am so excited for
this this looks like a really nice
product for the summertime it says shake
well apply with fingertips blah blah
blah blah blah it says use alone for a
stunning sunkissed glow or you can use
it with your pure brightening serum
foundation or any sort of serum
foundation for a boost a beautiful
bronze so if you do tend to get a little
tanner during the summertime you
definitely could mix this into any of
your foundations and let's go ahead and
see I want to see what it looks like so
it comes in a little squeezy tube like
this and it looks like it is quite dark
but it's very very liquidy so it feels
like it probably has like that to Mexico
and feel to it so there is the actual
color it doesn't look to oranjee
actually it looks like it might be like
really really nice and goodness does
that blend nicely that is actually
really really beautiful so if you do
have a few foundations from the
wintertime that definitely just dropped
it but definitely are a little too late
for you now you could mix that into your
foundation awesome alright the next item
that I see in here is from taco this is
the top of Florence perfume and it says
it is a Parisian beauty and
sophisticated scent from Florence if
insurers memories of old world Paris
with the alluring common
in a battalion bergamot and crushed a
violet petals well I need to take a
whiff of those let me see here because
i'ma watch me for a while you know I
collect tons of perfume so this smells
really really nice it kind of smells
like gardenia not so much lilacs but I
am excited to try that out I just wish
they would give us a little spray bottle
instead of one that you have to dump on
your body because it never works out for
me already moving on the next item I see
here is the benefit that they are real
beyond mascara i love the they're real
mascara so i am very very excited to see
this and it says let's see here i think
i got the black shade yes yeah that's
right because the other one is like a
tainted lash primer so this is just the
black shade I love this particular
mascara it's got lots of little tiny
bristles it is a rubber bristle wand and
you really can get into all the little
areas like on the outside of your eye
right on the inner corners really really
wonderful mascara this is probably one
of my top 10 mascaras of all time so
more than happy to get a sample of that
the next item I see here is the Beca
back like climbing filter this is
another really really fantastic primer
that I enjoy a lot she invites what it
looks like with one pump on the back of
the hand it is really really beautiful
in luminous and it does prolonged aware
of your makeup or for the most part I
find it just a little more hydrating and
a little more illuminating but you guys
the scent on this primer is amazing so I
don't know if you guys can see the glow
but it's absolutely beautiful do I think
it really really extends the wear of my
makeup not so much but i still think for
me personally even with my oily to
combination skin combo to oily skin it
still is really really beautiful alright
the next item I have in here is from
bumble and bumble so we have a little
hair care product this is the don't blow
it hair styler for great hair days
without the heat or hassles so that
looks interesting it doesn't really say
anything on the back of here I really
have not been doing anything with my
hair lately however I will be chopping
it to my shoulder soon so maybe I can
basically put this into damp hair and it
will help keep my style and maybe I'll
braid my hair or something like that so
excited for that I do like a bee bumble
and bumble brand and then the last item
that I have in my Sephora play box is
the tart tart guard this is a broad
spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen and I have
gone through quite a few samples of this
this is a physical sunblock so you have
titanium
dioxide and zinc oxide in here yes
titanium dioxide three point three six
percent and zinc oxide 4.1 three percent
so this is a really really nice product
if you do have sensitive skin if you are
sensitive to chemical sunscreens is
actually excuse me this is I'm really
really nice I like it a lot um it does
leave a little bit of white cast on the
face it has a nice scent though they mix
in a little bit of like a floral scent I
guess you could say but it is slightly
greasy as well but I don't know I do
like it i've gone through quite a few of
these and i do prefer physical stuff
walks when it comes to my face because I
feel like the chemical ones do you make
me sensitive so anyway that is
everything that I got in my June 2016
sephora play box thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys in my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
