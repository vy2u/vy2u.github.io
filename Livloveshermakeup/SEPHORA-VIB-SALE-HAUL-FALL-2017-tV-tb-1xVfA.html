welcome back to my Channel today I
finally have a my Sephora vib sale order
to share with you guys so my div sale
haul the reason why I was not able to do
this earlier is because this is the
first year that I have actually had
difficulties with my vib sale order
actually shipping so first of all ups or
Sephora lost half of my order I ordered
two different times because the Rouge
event was on the first week I think a
month yeah the first week of December
and then two weeks later they had
another sale so I ordered two different
kind of shipments and the second one got
lost in the mail and now they did go
ahead and resend it but unfortunately it
was missing a certain item they didn't
tell me that this item was out of stock
it was these Smashbox drown in decked
out set which does have two different
eyeshadow palettes as well as a
highlighting palette in it and
originally my plan was to do a haul and
then the next day to go ahead and do
like a get ready with me trying out new
products but but unfortunately they
after two weeks of basically leading me
on and telling me it was gonna ship they
told me it was out of stock and they
cancelled that item so actually only
have about six different products to
share with you guys I will not be doing
a get ready with me after all because I
don't have enough products for like my
whole entire face it was opposed to be
like a full face of first impression so
what I'm gonna do instead is just go
ahead and do a follow-up call exactly a
week from today but without further ado
let's go ahead and just jump right into
it so the first two items that I picked
up were actually lips at so these are
currently actually on sale in the sale
section on these sephora.com website
when I saw that I was like damn it but
then I realized I did get 20% off with
these so it's basically the same price
but the first guy is from Tarte
cosmetics this is called the mermaid
kisses lipsticks at - this is from the
rainforest of the sea line I hear my
friend Samantha Marsh talk a lot about
this actually hear her talk a lot about
both of these sets or both of these
formulas and she is really really good
with lip products so there's one thing
that I know samantha is good with is lip
products because she collects a lot of
lip products so I would have had him
purchase the little mini mermaid kisses
set at the first shade that we have here
these are just little mini lipsticks as
you guys can see the first shape we have
is called sandals and it's kind of like
a really really pretty I would describe
this as a brick red with a little bit of
like a red our burgundy undertone going
on here it's not a true brick red but
maybe
a little more Brown running through it
maybe that's the best way to describe it
the second change that we have here and
this packaging is so cute you guys kind
of like fake or a faux marbled print and
this is called marks and this looks like
a very nice kind of your lips but better
sort of shade it's got a lot of like
pinky kind of mauve tones going on and I
am very excited for that one I was very
drawn in by the shades in here because I
felt like they were very small related
but this next one right here is called
Jet Set and this is basically a true at
deep a berry color with maybe a little
bit of brown running through it as well
no it's basically a true kind of like
hot raspberry color and then the final
shaded that we have in a little mermaid
kisses set is call but let's see here
soaked and soaked is basically and that
true oh okay on the back it looks like
it would be like a true nude but this
actually looks a very very kind of your
lips the better
e yet again so there are the four
different shades as you guys can see
these are totally up my alley as far as
lipsticks are concerned I really like to
go with lipsticks that are basically a
couple shades deeper than my lips or
possibly sometimes a couple shades
lighter but I'm not a true like nude lip
girl and then here is the snake charmer
5-piece petite enamored high shine lip
gloss set and this is from Marc Jacobs
and I've heard such good things about
these glosses you get five little
Deluxe's and like I said these are
actually on sale right now on these
sephora.com website so if you're doing
some Black Friday shopping or just
shopping for anybody would highly
recommend checking them out they smell
exactly like the tarte lipsurgence
little lip crayon so if you like that
peppermint smell you're gonna like these
the first shade right here is called
sugar sugar and this is the one that
Samantha talks about the most she is a
nude lip kind of girl like I said I'm
not really but this actually looks a lot
darker than it does in the tube so I
could actually probably wear that one
and then up next we have this guy which
is called skin it deep and this one's
probably a few shades darker but it has
a little more of like cool tones going
on oh this is totally my kind of color I
love that very very beautiful as you
guys can see and I would say it's just a
little more cool tone and a few shades
deeper the next one we have is super
gorgeous oh my god this one is called
raspberry beret it's like a true true
purple color but maybe like a little bit
of magenta running through there let's
see how bright it
when I actually swatch it out oh it's
perfect it's just that perfect kind of
purply pinky color I'm so excited for
that one over they all smell like
peppermint they smell really good I'm
excited and then here we have an even
deeper purple color and this one has
kind of like violet or blue tones
running through it and this one is
called boys don't cry and it's beautiful
oh my god this is like a true violet oh
these look got going on so pigmented and
they look absolutely gorgeous
I'm very excited I'm very excited
everybody talks about these I'm not much
of a gloss girl but because these are so
highly rated on Lisa 4.com website and I
have so many friends that recommend them
I thought I'd try them out and then this
one I'm most excited for it kind of
reminds me of at the fenty Beauty
Galasso this is called chip chip changes
so let's go ahead and swatch it this one
it's sort of like a trichrome duochrome
it's got a lot of different flecks of
shimmer in there but that is what it
looks like so I am so excited for these
two little lips that's you guys I will
definitely be using these this coming
week so over here we have elite arts and
mermaid kisses set and then over here we
have the beautiful snake charmer and
nabard a little mini lip gloss set
alright moving on let's go ahead and
talk about some skincare the first item
I picked up was another skincare set it
was between this one and a drunk
elephant set but because I already
picked up a drunk elephant set earlier
in the year I thought I'd go with this
one this is a new brand to me it is
called a youth to the people and this is
the fresh pressed superfood of skincare
set it is cruelty free and a hundred
percent of vegan and inside of here you
are getting a cleanser as well as a
hydration or hyaluronic acid cream and
then also a little mini mask now this is
the kale and green tea age prevention
cleanser it actually comes in a
beautiful little glass bottle these
don't necessarily smell amazing
yeah the customer like asked not gonna
lie but I kind of figured they would
when they're saying it's a superfood
skin set so they don't smell amazing
they kind of smell like a green smoothie
like I've ever had like a green juice or
a green smoothie but yeah I'm excited to
try that out I've heard Stephanie Nicole
talked about I believe this cleanser or
maybe it was the hyaluronic cream and
she said she really liked it and then
here we have the spirulina kale spinach
mascar this is what it looks like and it
seems like has a kind of thicker
consistency to it like it might dry down
sort of like a mud mask so I
probably only use this in my t-zone or
areas where I get very very oily but I
am excited to try it out and then here
is the item I am most excited for this
is the kale spinach green tea hyaluronic
acid age prevention moisture cream it
comes with a beautiful little spatula
and this just looks like it has been
perfect like buoyant consistency to it
if it's not hydrating enough for me I
will just add some oil and but this one
actually smells a little sweeter so
that's good to know and I am excited to
try those out and then I also did pick
up an item from pharmacy so a ton of you
have been recommending their clean green
clean clean clean green clean makeup
melt away cleansing balm this has
echinacea green envy in it this is what
it looks like this is a really really
reasonably priced cleansing balm in my
opinion I really like the price on this
and here is what the packaging looks
like kind of opens up like a little
present adorable okay it feels really
light it feels super super light but it
does come with a spatula as well and
yeah this is what it looks like let's
open this up so the spatula is in there
and then all right so that's what it
looks like it does have that typical
sent to the pharmacy usually has but
this one smells a little bit sweeter so
if you don't like the scent of like
their a gel melt
ah what is it overnight treatment or
something like that you may not like the
scent on this but I'm very excited to
try it out and I've also heard a Tara
baby loves this one as well alright guys
moving on I do have two more makeup
products here the first is from Becca
and this is a shimmering skin Perfector
press in Prosecco pop I finally put the
bullet and just purchase a full-size I
have a ton of full-size of Becca
highlighters but I have been reaching
for my Jacqueline heal palette recently
and I almost have hit pan on Prosecco
pop when I do have a little more of a
tan going on and when I'm wearing
self-tanner I really love this shade so
I went ahead and decided to just
purchase the full size let me go ahead
and swatch it for you guys so you can
see it's just a beautiful true at yellow
gold sort of highlight and for whatever
reason I really like it on my skintone
currently and finally I picked up a
foundation that I have had my eye on for
a very long time ever since my skin
started to get a little more dry I
have wanted to pick up the Smashbox
Studios skin foundation this has a 15
hour where time claim they say it's a
hydrating oil free it just seems like
it's really good medium to full
buildable coverage oil-free controls oil
all-day sweat and humidity exercise
resistant color true and transfer
resistant and a demi matte finish that
just sounds like way too good to be true
I did pick up the shade at one point one
I think I'm gonna have to do probably
two or three layers of self-tanner to
get this to match me nicely but I will
be doing a foundation a Friday with this
particular foundation but I'm very
excited I just have a hard time
believing that this can have a 15-hour
rare time if it is so hydrating but we
shall see so anyway guys that is my
little Sephora vib sale haul I did order
a bunch of Point perks but unfortunately
those never arrived either so they went
ahead and put the points back into my
account I didn't get any samples those
are really really bad Sephora vib sale
order this time around I don't really
know what happened I was worried the
other night when I was ordering for the
Black Friday sales but it looks like my
shipment is already shipped so I think
that that will be just fine but yeah
this is a little more difficult this
time around and I know a lot of you were
having issues with your order as well so
anyway I do hope that you enjoyed this
video I will have my follow up haul
going up exactly a week from today thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
