thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be my Sephora vib sale
recommendation so I asked you guys last
night on Instagram if you would prefer
to see this video or a Sephora follow up
all and and this 101 hands-down I will
be going ahead and posting the Sephora
follow-up haul tomorrow at 5 p.m. so
don't worry you will still be able to
see that video but today we are talking
about my personal picks and what I think
I should recommend what I think I should
recommend what I would recommend to you
guys I'm already like time twisting and
we haven't even gotten into the video so
I have everything out in front of me I
tried to be like as precise as I could
with this because I feel like this video
literally could be 5 hours long if I
wanted it to be I have a lot of items
that I love from Sephora that I would
recommend to you guys but these are like
the top bitch kind of products so we're
gonna go ahead and start with the
holiday related stuff and before I even
get into it number one no I do not know
when the sale is and number two I have
not gotten my email yet when I did my
wishlist video which I will link down
below if you guys would like to see what
I personally want to pick up during the
sale when I did that wish list video I
did say oh my god my Sephora code what I
was talking about was the
friends-and-family sale I misspoke I do
apologize about that but if you do want
a friends-and-family code you
unfortunately do have to be friends with
someone who works at Sephora I do have a
few friends from New York who actually
work at Sephora that I still am in
contact with so that's how I personally
got that code that sale has already
started I believe I'm not quite sure if
I'm gonna be picking up any items for
that but I definitely want to pick up
for the vib so anyway I'm the vib sale I
know that it does start within the next
couple of weeks my hair looks like a
mess I know it does start within the
next couple of weeks but I do not know
the exact date so I just wanted to put
that out there but anyway let's go ahead
and just jump right into it I'm going to
start with holiday pallets because they
do feel like they have such a good value
and also a lot of people are probably
gonna be wanting to buy those right now
since it is like that season and you
know these are limited editions so the
first one that I want to recommend is
the hourglass ambient lady at its the
real light palette this is what it looks
like and this is around $80 I believe
actually I think it is exactly $80 if
you are vib Rouge and you are getting
20% off this is going to be around 60
issue dollars which is awesome so I
would only recommend this for those of
you who do have fear
light like a fair select complexion this
is not going to work for you if you do
have a medium to dark complexion I just
don't think the color range is enough I
don't feel like there's like a lot going
on here as far as the tones are
concerned but if you are someone who
loves that ambient lighting formulation
you love the strobing powders you love
the blushes you love the bronzers this
is definitely something that you should
look into especially for with a 20% off
price the next item I want to recommend
is the Urban Decay vice junky lipstick
palette now if you saw my review on this
you know that I do prefer the black male
palette which is sold exclusively at
Ulta however I will say this one is
still pretty darn good you are getting a
few pops of color in here you are
getting um lots of different finishes
some purpley shades
some red shades some neutral shades
really really good formulations here I
like all of them I feel like the super
mattes are comfortable I feel like the
mattes are comfortable I'm someone who
really is picky about lip products so I
do think that this is worthwhile like
looking into it does also come with a
little retractable lip brush and I just
love the way that all of these wear on
the lips so I would highly recommend
checking that out if you do you want a
lip palette another holiday palettes
that I really think you should look into
is the Tarte color wheel this is their
Amazonian clay blush palette for this
year you are getting one side that has
warmth tones over here and you do get a
highlight over here and then the other
side is cool toned and it's gonna be
hard to show you guys because it's so
reflective but here are the cool tones
right here which are beautiful I feel
like this would show up on a lot of
different skin tones and then here is
the warm tone side and I think this is
really really nice it definitely is
worth it a whole lot of value in here
and this is the exact Amazonian clay
blush formula that I am used to getting
into full sizes so highly recommend
checking that out
I would also excuse me guys I have like
a really itchy throat today so I'm sorry
if I keep clearing my throat but I would
also recommend looking into these
Sephora collection blush bronzed and
ready to glow face palette this is an
item that I currently have in my 15,000
subscriber giveaway because it is really
really good you are getting a cool toned
blush here a warm toned blush a bronzer
and also a highlight and I just love
this palette these are very very silky
they're very easy to blend and if you
don't want to spend 60 70 80 dollars on
some of these other palettes like the
hourglass or even 40 on the tarts of
this one is around $32 and it will be in
the $20 range
you do have 20% office VIP rooms so this
is amazing that these pant sizes are
absolutely incredibly huge and I would
recommend looking into this all right
moving on I would also recommend looking
into the bytes Beauty a boost bouche
little lipstick quad here it's not a
quad but you get for a little mini
deluxe size lipsticks they have a lot of
different lip kits out right now so
definitely go and take a look at what
you would like this one is $25 they have
one that's 24 they have one that's 32
with three of the luminous creme
lipsticks definitely go look at these
bite Beauty steps I definitely think
they are worth it today are beautiful I
love the formulations on pretty much all
of the bite beauty products that I try
out their lipsticks the amuse-bouche
line I really do enjoy their luminous
creme line I like pretty much everything
so if you are looking for a nice a
little kit to have I would highly
recommend any of them just look and
figure out which color selection you
would like the most so this one has
these shades honeycomb also fake it also
has I believe date know they have pepper
and then it has a shade nori which is
like a dark red like I said just go and
kind of figure out which colors you
would like bite Beauty does tend to stay
more in like the neutral category so
really everyday friendly and a nice
little kit to check out especially for
$25 and with that discount so you're
gonna be paying not a whole lot of money
for that and then the last little
holiday item I want to talk about here
well actually first I want to say the
Kat Von D metal matte eyeshadow palette
absolutely obsessed with that for some
reason I can't find it right now like
it's somewhere in this beauty room and I
don't know where the hell it is but I
will link my review for that down below
it is a wonderful wonderful beautiful
beautiful palette you have some foil
shades you have some matte shades that
is my favorite eyeshadow palette that
has released for the holiday season it
is $60 but you're getting a whole lot of
value and a whole lot of products there
so I would recommend that one and the
final holiday palette that I would
recommend you look into it just took off
like a piece of my hair is the Bobbi
Brown Bobbi to Glo shimmer brick palette
this is what it looks like this is
something that just blew me out of the
water I never thought that I would be so
in love with Sarah Briggs I really never
did so we have a highlight here called
gold we have the bronze shade in the
middle and then Wild Rose over here
I use bronze as my bronzer Wild Rose as
my blush and gold as my highlight and I
am absolutely incredibly obsessed with
this I do think it's worth the value
this is something that is going to cost
you
around 70 or 80 dollars so I would
recommend going ahead and picking it up
during the sale if you can alright guys
now we're gonna move into just a random
products that I think are really really
good that I want to mention let's start
with a few skincare items so the first
thing I want to recommend to you guys is
looking into the Peter Thomas Roth mask
kits now this time if you're if he
always releases a whole lot of different
kits you can get full sizes of the mask
for like $120 all the different ones all
of them are great honestly I love the
Rose stem cell I really like this
pumpkin enzyme heat one right here which
is a dermal resurfacer which is awesome
so it has physical exfoliants and also
chemical exfoliants I really like his
cucumber mask I like all of them the
Irish war bud I highly recommend
checking any of them out so if you can
get one of the kits from Peter Thomas
Roth I really think you should it's a
great great great value another item
that I want to recommend for you guys or
just in general is looking into the
Sunday Riley brand I have recently
switched over to using Sunday Riley
products specifically on my face at
night like that's it those are like the
only things and I would recommend these
two for acne or oily prone skin the
first is the Martian mattifying melting
water gel toner and then go ahead and
follow it follow up with the UFO ultra
clarifying face oil I don't necessarily
think that you need the toner unless you
do have extremely extremely oily skin
but if you are going to pick up
something from the Sun Sunday Riley
Brandt and you do have oily skin I would
recommend the UFO oil this is a
salicylic acid dry oil and I think it is
absolutely beautiful and perfect
another little set that I would highly
recommend trying to reach over here guys
sorry another little set that I would
highly recommend you to check out if you
are someone who is looking into these
Sunday Riley brand days definitely the
good jeans duo you are getting a little
deluxe size of the Luna oil which this
will ask you forever and you're also
getting the good jeans lactic acid
treatment you're not getting a huge
thing of that I will say I feel like
that has already started to run out and
I'm like halfway through with the Luna
oil so I just wanted to put that out
there but I still do think it is worth
like looking into because the Sunday
Riley brand is extremely expensive their
dry oils in general tend to be anywhere
between $85 to 105 oil 105 tolerance'
oils they are cold-pressed oils they're
beautiful and I do notice a difference
with them and I think it's very
innovative that they have these
oils that actually have retinol and
cells silic acid in them very very cool
and then also another skincare item I
want to recommend looking into is the
glam glow brands I just have this one
masters show you guys right now but
honestly any of their masks are great to
look for something that you know would
go well with your skin so if you do have
dry skin thirsty mud is good if you want
brightening I would go with the orange
one if you have combination skin the
green one is great and then if you have
aging skin the black one and then if you
have agents can also be purple one which
is gravity bud and then what am I
missing
oh yeah the white one is great for oily
and acne prone skin so those are the
skincare um you know items that I wanted
to recommend mostly glam glow Peter
Thomas Roth and also look into the
Sunday Riley brand because like I said
their prices are outrageous and I do
think it's a good time to pick them up
moving on it let's talk about some
perfumes I have two here that I would
highly recommend looking into the first
is the Nirvana bourbon perfume from
Elizabeth and James now I don't feel
like this lasts as long on my body as
the Elizabeth and James Nirvana white or
Nirvana black however I will say any of
the Elizabeth and James perfumes are
really really good they are quite
expensive so I would highly recommend
picking those up during the sale and
also Versace bright crystal a full-size
of this which this one is only I believe
one fluid ounce 1.5 fluid ounces or even
like bigger than that is like $130 so if
you can get 20% off if you are vib Rouge
I would highly recommend checking this
out it's a very bubbly bright fragrance
and it just makes me happy when I smell
it and I think a lot of people would
enjoy it all right as far as primers are
concerned I would highly recommend
checking out to the YSL - chic la purse
a perfume to shake a lot blur primer now
you can get like dupes for this at the
drugstore like the maybelline pore
eraser is pretty much an exact dupe
however and this is beautiful it's very
luxurious I feel really special when I'm
using this and when you can get 20% off
again if you're a VIP Rouge I do think
it's worth it
as far as eyeshadow palettes are
concerned I could go on and on about
eyeshadow palettes any of the Too Faced
9 pan palettes are excellent in my
opinion also the chocolate bar palettes
are really great something to look into
but if there's one thing that I would
hands down recommend that anybody should
pick up it's definite
we be modern a renaissance palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills you are getting
some gorgeous colors in here nice and
beautiful berry tones this is the
perfect time of year to be wearing these
colors I feel like they are so pigmented
and buttery they would work for
beginners they would work for
professionals they would work for every
single skin tone and type and I just
feel like this is just an amazing
amazing palette even if you do have
really oily oily eyelids or really dry
eyelids I've heard everybody say that
this just goes on beautifully so highly
highly recommend checking out that
eyeshadow palette I do have a specific
highlighter here from Laura Mercier that
I always recommend during these sales
and this is the Laura Mercier matte
radiance baked powder highlight in the
shade is 0-1 the reason why I always
recommend this is because it is very
very pricey but this is an absolutely
beautiful highlight and I just think it
would show up on so many different skin
tones and it looks so natural if you are
one of those people that really wants a
gorgeous highlight but you want
something a little more natural and you
don't want to go down the route of like
Becca products this is something you
should look into it's very light on the
skin it feels very natural and it looks
very natural it's a very very good
highlight speaking of Becca let's go
ahead and talk about some items I think
you should check out their shimmering
skin perfecter press are my favorite I
love them this particular one is called
rose quartz which is their newest this
is probably my favorite one out of all
of them and this is what it looks like I
would also recommend moonstone and also
pearl if you do have a light or fair
skin tone but this one is just gorgeous
I love the way this looks I feel like it
would show up on every single app didn't
scuse me guys like I said sorry I have a
scratch in my throat today but like I
said I feel like this would show up on
every single skin tone and it works for
it tons of different types it never
makes me look super oily I do have
combination skin it and I also think
it's just a beautiful formulation very
very heavily pigmented and very
beautiful on the skin so would
definitely check those out since they
are a little more on the pricey side
another item that you should check out
are their mineral blushes these are very
very small and very expensive so if you
can get ten twenty percent off I would
highly recommend checking them out this
particular shade is wild honey they stay
on the cheeks a really really long time
I still do prefer my Too Faced
sixteen-hour blushes but these are
beautiful and then something that I
would recommend even before the press
mineral blush
are definitely the luminous flush
blushes this particular sheet is called
snapdragon I also have Tigerlily and I
just think these are gorgeous they're
very very pigmented so don't be confused
by the name but these are gorgeous they
do have a little bit of those shimmering
skin perfectors kind of mixed in there
and they do give a nice glow to the skin
so if you're someone who does want a
little bit more of a luminous blush I
would highly recommend checking those
out and then another item that I believe
is still available are the Jaclyn hill
on split pans I love these I am obsessed
with these I have two I have flour child
and champagne pop and then this one is
hyacinth and champagne pop and this is
what they look like if you are someone
who likes to have your makeup thrown in
your bag thrown in your purse or you
like to travel or you travel a lot this
is something that you definitely should
check out you do get a blush and then
you get a highlight really really
compact and very very easy to travel
with I didn't have any issues with these
shattering or anything in my purse so I
would highly recommend checking those
out and that's pretty much it from Becca
another highlight that I adore and has
been just a favorite this year has been
the exposed highlight from Tarte this is
what it looks like this is beautiful
highly recommend checking this out even
on my fair skin tone I feel like this
still shows up so glowy and so beautiful
it is one of those more like spoiled
kind of finishes there it is
hopefully you guys can see that there it
is it's absolutely beautiful is
something that I think would be great
for all sorts of different skin types in
different skin tones because it has that
foiled sort of consistency it goes over
the skin beautifully like it never
emphasizes every anything like any sort
of fine lines or wrinkles or large pores
so highly recommend that and then of
course it would not be some sort of like
a favourites or recommendation video
without me reckon recommending the
ambient strobe lighting powders from
hourglass
I know that I showed the palette at the
beginning but if you are going to
purchase a full-size of a strobing
powder I highly recommend incandescent
light which is this one or brilliant
light I have both of them and this one's
more like cool toned pink and then
brilliant light is more of a like soft
gold kind of color they are both
absolutely beautiful they do have a
little more shimmer in them and a little
more pigment than the regular like
ambient lighting powders but I think
they are gorgeous this is such a such a
beautiful natural kind of highlight glow
from within sort of thing kind of
similar to the Laura Mercier so
if you are someone who doesn't want like
extreme extreme highlight on fleek like
it's really obvious you're wearing
highlight I would definitely check those
out let's see here another blush it
would not be a favourites or a
recommendation video without my Too
Faced Love flush 16-hour blushes I have
every single one in full-size because
they aren't that good at this particular
shade is called how deep is your love
and these are just incredibly long
wearing they have a really nice shade
selection they have some cool tone
shades some deep berries they have some
light pinks anything that you could want
to highly recommend checking those out
in full size and they will last you
forever as far as mascaras are concerned
I do have some here I would recommend
number one would of course be my Sephora
outrageous curl mascara this has a
natural and not a natural I'm sorry a
rubber bristle one that is absolutely
wonderful it's very very small so you
can get into all of the little areas
that you need to on your eye I barely
feel like I have to actually curl my
lashes when I use that so I adore that
one a new favorite is the YSL babydoll
mascara again it has a similar sort of
wand it is one of those rubber bristle
wands but this one is a little skinnier
and a little longer so that is what it
looks like builds a lot of volume and a
lot of length and mostly volume which I
do enjoy and then if you do want a
little more length at the benefit
they're real mascara is a really great
option as well you guys will probably
see some similarities here with the
wands I do like rubber bristle wands
quite a bit so that is what it looks
like and it does have the little ball
point at the end so that you can get
into all of the tiny lashes on the inner
corner of your eye and also on the
outside and then I also do want to
recommend so many of the Laura Mercier
extra lash sculpting mascara same sort
of one as the benefit they're real this
one is quite expensive which is why it's
good to pick it up during the sale the
Sephora outrageous volume again if you
don't want to spend tons of money on a
mascara you guys check out these ones
from the Sephora collection they are
beautiful they mostly have rubber
bristle wands but they work so well on
the eyes and then the last two are the
NARS not lip NARS audacious mascara and
this is what it looks like it has a
really nice a rubber bristle wand but
it's very flexible so if you don't like
these rubber bristle ones because you
feel like they poke you in the eye this
one is actually very very flexible and
it's just very nice to use I never have
a problem with that and also the Lancome
Hypnose to draw
this particular one does have a natural
bristle wand it's kind of similar to the
Too Faced better than sex which is
another favorite but this one because it
is so expensive I think this is a good
time to pick up a full-size during the
sale which I will probably do as well
all right I do have another primer here
if you are a little more combination or
acne prone skin I would recommend
checking out the Stila aqua glow primer
this has been a favorite of mine for a
very long time I do think the YSL is
better for those with normal to kind of
combination maybe dry skin I don't know
I want to say combination I have
combination it works for me but mostly
during the winter time when I am a
little more dry so if you have more
mature skin or dry skin or normal skin
I'd go for this if you're a little more
combination or oily even throughout the
winter months I would go for this Stila
I feel like both of them really do make
your makeup go on nicely this particular
one is just going to really cool down
your skin it's very easy to use so if
you're someone who likes to get things
done in a hurry and this is a good one
and I believe it's around $32 so if you
do have 20% off or even 10% off it's
gonna be a good deal I won eye primer I
want to recommend that is the Q Faced
shadow insurance of glitter glue this is
pretty much is the only high-end primer
that I really enjoy I like it because
you can work with any sort of shadows
with this beneath them I feel like it's
just sticky enough to the point where if
you want to Pat glitter onto your eyelid
you can go ahead and do so but at the
same time you can blend normal shadows
on top of this so this is a really
really good one that I highly recommend
looking into as far as lippies are
concerned besides that lip palette
obviously the Vil up tainted oils from
YSL I plan on getting every single shade
of these during the sale these are
beautiful they smell amazing they have a
beautiful little wand and if you're
someone who likes comfortable lip
products you need to look into some lip
oils for sure another lip oil that is
amazing is the Clarins lip oil this is
what it looks like this particular shade
is called 0-2 raspberry they only have
three shades I believe honey blackberry
and then raspberry I think and I love
the way that these go onto the lips are
very moisturizing there are no fuss kind
of product there are some good ones at
the drugstore as well but if you really
want a nice thick luxurious lip I would
highly recommend the Clarins a product
that I recently picked up is that I am
obsessed with this formulation is
amazing
the velvet lip glide from nars again if
you are someone who likes comfortable
lip products I would recommend this now
this is a recommendations video so
although I do have a bunch of liquid
lipsticks and stuff that I could say oh
I think you would like these I'm not
sharing those in this video because I
don't really use liquid lipsticks
anymore so if you're wondering why I'm
showing all these comfortable lip
products it's because this is the I
wear so this is absolutely beautiful I
love the applicator on these they're
very creamy and beautiful this
particular shade is called bound which
is just a perfect kind of dusty rose
color and they did recently thank you
tree now my friend Trina told me they
did recently release a little like mini
set of six or nine of these for the
holiday season so I'll definitely go on
to a Sephora and look for it you know
put that in your loves list so that you
can remember to grab that because I
think those are beautiful what else
concealers let's talk about concealers
too that have really really impressed me
first of all they charge aqua aqua
sealer is that what it's called yeah
aqua Cooke aqua sealer I want to say
aqua concealer aqua sealer is a shade
fair if you are very very fair
complected is really really good that's
the one I have on today it's in my my
little everyday makeup drawer behind me
right now so I don't have it to show you
guys but it's beautiful if you want you
lightweight and nice kind of concealer I
would also recommend to the Kat Von D
lock-it creme concealer in the shade
whiteout if you have very fair skin and
you want to mix and match your
concealers or even just this formulation
in general if you want to get it in a
different shade I would highly recommend
checking this out it is extremely
extremely full coverage but a little
goes a very long way you just need a few
dots underneath your eyes and this
blends out amazingly so definitely a
little more full coverage than the aqua
sealer and then this one's right in
between the two if this is the Too Faced
Born This Way naturally radiance
concealer the shape that I wear is
called very fair I do like the
applicator on this I've heard that this
is very similar to the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer I have yet to have tried
that wide and go figure but I've heard
that people do compare this one to that
and I think it's just absolutely
beautiful would recommend that and then
as far as color correcting is concerned
this will come as no surprise the ones
that I would recommend you check out are
definitely the Urban Decay Naked skin
color correcting fluids
I love these that this particular shade
is called peach and this is really good
for camouflaging hyperpigmentation the
green one is good if you do have a lot
of rosacea or redness in your cheeks or
acne
like active breakouts the yellow one is
nice for color correcting underneath the
eyes to get rid of blue tones um if you
do have a little more of a warm tone
like undertone and then the pink one is
nice for the same reason if you have a
little more of a cool undertone I also
do have the lavender one it's currently
in my shop my staff doors so I don't
have to be right here to share with you
guys but that one's beautiful for just I
would say more mature skin aging skin
and also just kind of like brightening
and lifting the skin and also helps to
get rid of cell anise or yellow tones
alright I'm moving on we are almost done
guys I'm trying to make this like under
a 20 minute video it's already at 22
minutes but I'm trying I do have some
eyeliners here that I would recommend
checking out I do not personally do a
winged eyeliner because I can't do a
wing for I always say that but if
you want a long wearing eyeliner
formulation I would recommend checking
out these Smashbox always sharp
waterproof Kohl liners I have quite a
few of these this particular shade is
called Sumatra really beautiful if you
do have blue eyes it's a nice dark kind
of like a chocolatey brown shade the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide on eye pencil
formulation this particular shade is
called Vacancy they have all sorts of
different finishes and also different
shades of this I think these are
beautiful they were an incredibly long
time on my waterline and also the
Lancome a drama liquid pencil this
particular shade is called cooked Azul
and this is what it looks like beautiful
beautiful formulation love how nice they
go onto the eyes like they're just so
smooth and creamy you never feel like
you're poking your eye out and they
sharpen really nicely and also I do feel
like they are incredibly long wearing so
I would check those out as far as
waterline eyeliners are concerned and
finally let's go ahead and talk about
some foundation the first one I want to
recommend is for those of you who do
like a really nice lightweight sort of
foundation the Laura Mercier candle glow
soft luminous foundation is beautiful
it's more of a serum or water foundation
the shade that I wear is called shell
and this is what it looks like it does
have a nice little pump here and I think
this is beautiful on the skin if you
want a really really natural finish even
if you have dry skin this is gonna work
well for you I feel like oily skin combo
skin like any kind of skin I feel I can
use this so really really beautiful love
this and it is quite pricey so I would
highly recommend picking it up during
the sale if you are interested something
I would recommend for those of you who
do have combination or oily skin is the
NARS Velvet Matte skin tinge with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen the
shade that I wear is
wavey 0 1 I love the Demi matte
appearance of this it's kind of almost
like a satiny finish on the skin but it
does not make you Olli throughout the
day I wouldn't get it if you do have
completely dry skin or really really
sensitive skin because the sunscreen in
here is kind of like overwhelming but it
is really nice if you do have combo oily
skin again NARS tends to be a little
more of a high-end brand quite expensive
so would get that during the sale a
favorite of mine is definitely the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
the shade that I wear is fair beige ask
them to color match you there and make
sure that they're color matching you
appropriately because I got like three
different ones of these before I could
find my exact shade but they have a
wonderful shade selection I feel like
this would work very very well for those
of you with sensitive normal combination
and dry skin I'm sorry sensitive
combination oily and you know what was I
going to say weight sensitive normal
combination and oily skin guys 24
minutes of just talking straight through
I'm really going crazy anyway I think
this is great for everyone except dry
skin is what I'm trying to say it's
beautiful I love the way it looks on the
skin and definitely full coverage and
worth checking out during the sale and
then finally the last product is of
course the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid this is great for those
of you with dry skin it still works for
me even with combination skin I would
tend to stay away for it if away from it
if you do have very very oily skin but
it's beautiful
love the finish on this such good
coverage and at this particular shade
that I wear dynamic is a perfect match
for my skin tone so anyway guys those
are my recommendations for the Sephora
vib sale I like I feel like I could go
on and on and on and literally pull out
like 25 different palettes but these are
the ones that I had on my mind so that I
automatically just thought everyone
should look into so I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me guys and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
