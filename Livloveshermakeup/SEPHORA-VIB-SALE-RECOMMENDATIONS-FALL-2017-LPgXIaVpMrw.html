my channel today I do have my
recommendations video for the Sephora
vib sale for fall 2017 later today at 5
p.m. I will have my wishlist video going
up and people are gonna get into this I
do want to say I do have all the dates
and times of the codes for of this
particular sale I will be going ahead
and linking that down below in 18
comments so all you have to do is scroll
down to the comments section it will be
the first comment that you see you can
go ahead and screenshot that or write it
down they aren't doing the sale a little
differently than they normally do this
year so I just wanted to give you a
heads up but I thought we would start
with the basics work our way into the
holiday stuff and then go into skincare
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
alright so we're gonna go ahead and
start with color correcting as well as
concealers foundations and powders as
far as color correcting products are
concerned I would definitely recommend
these two formulas right here the Urban
Decay Naked skin color correcting fluids
are absolutely fantastic they have a
wide range of shades that you can choose
from so no matter if you have a very
fair complexion and medium complexion or
a deep complexion you will find
something that you like I enjoy using
the yellow and pink ones underneath my
foundation for a little bit of
brightening before I go in with my
concealer I enjoy using the green one
for color correcting or redness and then
also the lavender shade for brightening
up of my complexion and any sort of
selling us in my skin so I really love
those and then if you do have more dry
or mature skin I definitely would
recommend looking into the Becca under
eye brightening corrector if you're
really not into you know color
correcting fluids or anything like that
you don't have to go in with a corrector
and they were all the rage and all the
hype about a year and a half ago but
there's something that I still do on a
daily basis I work very long hours and
I'm always exhausted so I feel like I
always do have blue circles underneath
my eyes and I really like this one now
that I do have more dry skin so if this
is a very very humectant thick kind of
sticky texture so if you do have more I
would say Kongo to oily skin it's
probably gonna be a little too heavy for
you it also won't last very long but if
you do have more mature or dry skin I
really think you would like this it does
give a little bit of brightening it's
very similar to the Urban Decay color
correcting fluid in the shade pink which
is like a baby pink shade however this
one is a lot more moisturizing so those
are the two products I want to recommend
for color correcting
comes to concealers I have three here
that I want to recommend the first is
the chart shape tape now when I
originally picked this up for the first
time in did a YouTube maybe buy a video
which was a review and demo I talked
about how he didn't think this was that
fabulous but I really feel like it's one
of those products and that is great for
spot concealing as well as underneath
the eyes I feel like on YouTube we just
see people put heaps of this underneath
their eyes and basically wear it as a
foundation and honestly it doesn't look
as good if you wear it that way it does
look good on camera but it doesn't look
good in real life what I would recommend
doing that this is just going in and
doing one or two dots underneath your
eyes and then one on your eyelid and
then spot concealing it's really really
great for that it does have a little bit
of a fragrance to it so if that's
something that's going to bother you I
would not recommend going ahead and
picking this up but it does give me nice
medium to full coverage look without
being super super drying or cakey and it
really does increase on me so I do enjoy
the Tarte shape tape I do wear these
shape fair I need to get a couple shades
down for the sale because that is a
little too light for me currently it up
and actually have one that is great for
spot concealing again if you do have a
more a dry or mature skin and this is
from Becca it's the ultimate coverage
complexion creme
I'm sorry concealing creme in the shade
of praline now this was recently sent to
me for PR and has the same exact formula
as the under-eye brightening corrector I
do remember using this back when I had a
more Kampala can i purchased it like at
my altar or something like that and I
really wasn't a huge fan I felt like it
just dissipated on my skin throughout
the day but now that I do have more
normal to dry skin I feel like it really
stays on all day long it's beautiful
it's hydrating and it doesn't cake up on
the skin which I really do enjoy so that
is the Becca ultimate coverage
concealing creme and then finally the
last concealer I want to recommend is
this baby right here this easy Kat Von D
Luckett concealer creme in the shade
whiteout now this is actually a mixer
for concealer so if you do have a
concealer that's a little too dark for
you this is a great option if we're
going ahead and lightening it up and
this is also more of full coverage I've
been going for more full coverage
concealers lately and then doing a
little more light coverage foundations I
just really like the way that look so
this is definitely something I would
recommend I feel like this will work for
all sorts of different skin types and
then there is also one
another concealer I want to recommend
it's actually upstairs currently but it
is the Tarte train force of the sea aqua
sealer that is one of my all-time
favorite favorite beautiful beautiful
concealers I mean between that's and the
Tarte shaped tape I feel like you're
completely covered that one is
definitely a little more aqua light very
very beautiful on the skin if you want
light to medium coverage underneath your
eyes I would go for the Aqua sealer if
you want full coverage I would go for
the Tarte au shaped tape all right guys
let's go ahead and talk about
foundations if you are looking for a
full coverage foundation I would
definitely recommend the Becca ultimate
coverage complexion creme and this is
currently what I have on my skin or the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation I wear the shade fair beige
here and then this one is called sand
it's a little too yellow tone for me
this was also sent to me for at PR just
full disclaimer there but this guy I
have been purchasing for years I would
recommend this one over the Becca the
Becca can feel slightly heavy on the
skin so if you do like something that's
not as heavy on the skin I would go for
this it does have a whipped kind of
consistency to it so it feels lighter
but it does give it medium to full
coverage and then the Becca ultimate
coverage complexion creme is kind of
like an easier version of the cap on D
lock-it tattoo foundation so if you
tried the cap on D lock your tattoo
Foundation and you felt like it was way
too heavy on the skin it would
definitely recommend looking into that
alright moving on let's talk about some
medium coverage foundations I have three
here that I want to recommend the first
one is the Urban Decay Naked skin a
weightless Ultra Definition liquid
makeup I wear the shade a 0.5 this is a
really really everyday friendly sort of
foundation if you don't want to go too
heavy but you also don't want to go too
light and you want enough coverage this
is just the foundation I would recommend
it goes they have a great shade
selection so anybody with any sort of
skin tone will be able to find hopefully
a match with this and it just looks
beautiful on oily skin on combo skin on
dry skin on mature skin this is just
like a very very almost universally
flattering foundation in my opinion now
if you do want a little bit of
luminosity to your skin and you are
looking for something that is a new
luxury department the Marc Jacobs genius
gel supercharge foundation this shade
right here which is called 10 I relate
is absolutely detectable okay this is
gorgeous on the skin I had a few of you
that recently picked us up and said that
you absolutely loved it
it is gorgeous on the skin really really
like headed by a more normal dry kind of
skinned but it also does work for me
when I am more oily so or when I used to
be more oily so this is definitely a
foundation I would recommend you can
build up to about a medium coverage with
this guy and then finally we have my
all-time favorite foundation currently
and this is from hourglass it is the
illusion hyaluronic skin tinted don't
get twisted this is not a skin tint
it definitely has the Moosey consistency
to it and can be built up to almost a
full coverage sort of effect if you
build on two or three layers of this but
it's everyday friendly it's a beautiful
it is very very pricey but I wear the
shade vanilla and I absolutely adore
this and finally I have two very very
light coverage foundations I want to
recommend to you guys the first being
the charts at BB Amazonian clay tinted
moisturizer if you want a CC cream with
a little more coverage I would recommend
going for say the cosmetic CC cream they
have an illumination version as well as
the regular version and they just came
out with new shades for that but this
guy right here is not going to give you
a lot of coverage I do wear the shade
ivory it is oil free antioxidant rich
formulated without parabens mineral oil
fail aids triskele and sodium lauryl
sulfate and gluten very very natural and
it looks amazing on the skin in my
opinion and then also the Smashbox
camera ready BB water drops I love these
these are just absolutely amazing very
very light coverage again but you are
getting SPF in here so if you live in a
warm climate and you want a nice
lightweight foundation that is
water-based this is a great one to go
with all right now let's go ahead and
talk about powders I have three here
that I want to talk about and they're
all loose powders now I don't personally
powder my face usually with a high end
powder I am all for my ELF tone
correcting powder and cool or my essence
all about Matt fixing contact powder do
you guys have been watching me for a
while you probably know that but I do
have a couple powders here that I think
are pretty nice so the first one is the
Kat Von D setting powder this is the
Lockett setting powder I feel like this
is really nice if you do have a combo
skin normal skin as well as dry skin
there's a little bit of a sheen going on
with this powder and some people say
they can't see it but I can see it okay
I feel like it's really really good for
baking I wouldn't necessarily bake with
it all the time because you're gonna go
through this tough real quickly this
retails for around 32 or 35 dollars so I
mean if you're okay with a loose powder
you don't mind the messiness and you
want to get a high end powder this is a
good one the cover-up packs perfect
setting a powder is absolutely beautiful
I don't know where my full-size powder
is currently but this is great if you do
have more mature skin or dry skin this
is going to be the setting powder that
you want if you are looking for a loose
version and then also recently I tried
out this guy this is the Too Faced Born
This Way ethereal setting powder I do
like it it's not my all-time favorite
but I get people asking me about this
all the time I would still recommend the
Kat Von D lock-it over this one I don't
think I would repurchase this but still
it is quite nice if you do have more
normal to dry skin alright up next let's
talk about some face pallets if you are
someone who doesn't like to wear a ton
of makeup and you want something very
light and quick and something that's
pretty cute see the Too Faced sweet glow
peach palette trio whatever this
is called
is pretty darn nice I didn't like this
when I had more oily to combo skin or
Kongo oily skin I felt like it really
kind of slip and slid all over my face
and now that I'm wearing more natural
makeup and I am a little on the drier
side I feel like these really sit on top
of the skin beautifully I'm still not
the biggest fan of the bronzer over here
but I do like the blush and I do you
like the highlight so maybe if you're a
little younger you want something that
smells good something that's cute that
you can pop in your purse you might
enjoy that now you guys know I'm a
longtime fan of the anasazi Beverly
Hills glow kits so if you would like
something a little more colorful might I
suggest the moon child glow kit or the
aurora glow kit and if you want
something a little more everyday
friendly can go for the new sugar glow
kit for holiday 2017 or the new Sun
dipped glow kit or I'm sorry the Sun
DUPLO kit which has been permanent for a
couple of years now these are beautiful
really really great formula just go in
store or go online and decide which
colors or really speak to you I'm a big
fan of a becca face palette so whether
it be the up play ski glow face college
or the chrissy teigen or whatever you
can get your hands on and would highly
recommend picking one of these up
they're usually in the forty to fifty
dollar range so if you can get 20% off I
think this is a great great deal they
have big mirrors are very compact
they're very very travel friendly none
of mine ever ever shatter they are a
little more
we pressed in here so not identical I
mean the formula is the same but they
don't feel identical to like the
full-size products that you would get
from back up but that's just so that
they don't shatter okay if you've ever
gotten some of those shivering skin
perfectors before you know that they are
prone to shattering so I would highly
recommend the Becca Chrissy Teigen
palette or any sort of face palette from
Becca I do have two contouring palettes
here that I do reach for pretty
regularly the first one is from Too
Faced is the cocoa contour chiseled to
perfection kit now you can get this one
or you can get a deeper version if you
do have a deeper skin tone I've had this
one for years there is one shade in here
I'm not a huge fan of and that one is
this one right here which is called pop
of light it's like a glitter infused
highlight it's super stupid but this
shade right here called medium cocoa is
absolutely beautiful if you do want to
go ahead and just get full sizes of
their bronzers as well I would think
their bronzers haven't really changed
that much ever since they have been kind
of bought out to buy US State Lauder I
just feel like there's like a lot of
products in general that aren't really
the same from Too Faced anymore but I
feel like this is still the same this is
pretty good and there are still some
good stuff so anyway I wanted to
recommend that also the chart tortoise
contour palette has definitely been one
of my favorites for years now my
all-time favorite contouring palette if
you guys are curious is from it
cosmetics unfortunately it's not sold at
Sephora so I won't be talking about it
in this video but this is really nice if
you are a person that is on the go in
the morning and you want a blush you
also want a highlight you want something
to set your under eye width as well as
contour this is a really really nice
little contouring palette and they do
have different shade ranges for the
Tarte is Pro contour palette already
alright guys let's move on to some
singles shall we I'm a big fan clearly
of the Becca shimmering skin perfectors
and now although Becca does sometimes
send me PR all of these right here were
purchased with my own money except for
the new gradient glow highlighter which
is this one right here now I would
really definitely recommend shimmering
skin Perfector press formula they have
lots of different limited edition ones
that come out they have be like chaser
highlighters all of these are just
absolutely fabulous
I made on
fan of these formulas right here I'm
also a big fan of the luminous flush of
blushes as well as the mineral blushes
they are insanely pigmented so if you
don't like really really pigmented
products you're not going to be into
that but we're definitely recommended
the Becca blushes the luminous wash
blushes the mineral blushes as well lead
as well as the shimmering skin
perfectors now if you don't want a
pressed highlight you can always go
ahead and pick up in the Becca
shimmering skin perfectors in the liquid
version both of these were sent for PR
full disclosure this one right here is
called pearl and then this one is
moonstone you can mix these into your
foundation or you can actually wear them
as primer before going in with your
foundation they're beautiful not my
favorite I still definitely prefer the
pressed version but that's just because
I'm a powder kind of girl all right guys
moving on let's talk about some powder
highlights here from urban decay that I
know a few people have been asking me
about lately I don't know if these
recently went on sale or what but these
are the urban decay at 12:00 hour
I'm sorry afterglow 8 hour powder
highlighters this shade right here is
called sin and this one right here is
called a fireball which is kind of like
a blush topper on me personally and then
this shape right here is called Ora and
these are absolutely beautiful really
going to the skin nicely if you do like
something that's gonna stick around all
day these are definitely the highlighter
for you if you like the three of those
shades go ahead and scoop those up but
what else do I want to recommend for a
highlighter I'm at the hourglass ambient
lighting powders whether it be the
strobing powder or the original formula
I love these for just a whole lot of
things the ambient lighting powders you
can use to set your whole entire face
you can use to highlight your face
that's your under eye do whatever the
hell you want with them not everybody is
into these they're very very expensive
so maybe it's a good time to go ahead
and pick it out during the vib sale but
if you want something a little more
blinding and in-your-face i would
definitely go for the ambient lighting
strobing powders I'm going to talk about
the hourglass Holliday 2017 palette in a
mini here but in this shade right here
is called incandescent strobe light dye
I'm wearing brilliant strobe light on my
face today
it's beautiful does have tiny micro
glitters in it but it's not noticeable
once you get it onto with the skin so
those are great if you do want more
natural highlights as far as blush is
concerned I really do like the Papa
don't peach a blush from the Too Faced
sweet peaches line so this is what it
looks like it's a really really neutral
blush I sometimes do get a little bit of
hard pan on here so I just take duct
tape to it and kind of pick it up a
little bit
but anyway it's beautiful it is a really
really neutral peachy color with a
little bit of a gold sheen running
through it
again it doesn't have that sweet peach
sort of scent so if you don't like that
sweet scent or you don't like this
cutesy packaging you can go ahead and
skip on that and instead go ahead and
pick up a one of the Too Faced love
flush of blushes so although I do
on tart and two faiths quite often I'm
not gonna lie they have some good
products and the Too Faced love flush
two blushes are definitely one of them
they have a big assortment of different
shades here this one right here called
Baby Love is one of my favorites they
also have some orange shades like this
one which is called I will always love
you and then they have some really light
pink shades like this one which is
called justifying my love they also have
a deep berry shade which is called how
deep is your love and that one is
absolutely beautiful if you do have a
deeper complexion and then finally as
far as singles are concerned I also want
to recommend the Tarte Amazonian clay
12-hour blushes they are just okay when
they're in pallet form it really depends
on if they were made here or in China I
know some people might argue with me on
that but I just feel like there is huge
discrepancies between that I own a
bajillion different Tarte palettes as
well as singles and for me at the
singles are the best quality so if you
are I'm going to go ahead and invest
into a Tarte palette or some sort of
tarts of blush formula either get the
color wheel which I heard is a pretty
good formula it's identical to last
year's which was pretty good or go ahead
and just get yourself a single jumping
back to those Urban Decay highlighters
really quickly and looks like and these
tend to be on sale a lot on the Urban
Decay dot-com website as well as the
Ulta comm website for a very very low
price so maybe that's where I want to go
ahead and pick these up I have no idea
if they're even on the sephora.com
website anymore and they used to be I
swear but anyway I also wanted to add
and this was an item that definitely was
like a dust collector for me at one
point I wasn't getting a lot of use out
of these but I have noticed that these
actually go onto my skin very very
nicely when I have more normal to dry
skin if I've used them with a
silicone-based foundation instead of a
water-based foundation for whatever
reason sometimes these look a little
chunky on at my dry skin if I use a
water-based foundation but with a
silicone-based foundation they really
glide on it nicely alright let's talk
about to steal the glitter and glow is
what
I recommend you guys check out to the
little gift sets that are available for
the holiday season or just go ahead and
pick up a few of these in full size I
love them for adding a little bit of
sparkle and dimension to my eyeshadows
and this one right here is called
diamond dust this one right here is
called violet vixen I do have seven or
eight of these and I absolutely adore
them what you want to do is go ahead and
tap those onto the lid don't be swiping
all over because you're gonna lose the
pigmentation of the sparkle there but I
really enjoy those now as far as brow
products are concerned I know
everybody's gonna be asking you about
the brow Wiz and anasazi of Beverly
Hills perfect brow and all that kind of
stuff
I don't like any of my Anasazi at
Beverly Hills brow pencils the one brow
pencil I would recommend to you guys
from Sephora is the smashbox brow tech
to go I lost mine I've no idea where
mine is I don't know if my favorite took
it and hoarded it or something like that
but I cannot find it anywhere but I am
telling you right now my brows never
looked better when I was using that for
a week and a half I knew instantly I had
fallen in love you know we can have
which is a very very short amount of
time but that is like the best brow
pencil I've ever found if you're someone
who has similar brows to me you have
like a nice arch and they're pretty full
but not like overly full you just need
to fill in a few areas like the front
part of your brow and the tail end that
is a great great great brow pencil on
but if you do need a lot of work on your
brows if you need to fill in a lot of
little like tiny micro hairs I would
recommend maybe going with the brow Wiz
or the Anastacio Beverly Hills perfect
brow pencil but I'm just not a huge fan
of these I feel like they're very very
dry and sometimes when I rub super-hard
they take my eye brows out with that
which I don't like
are we moving on to eyeliners guys I
have two formulas here I would like to
recommend I'm not quite sure if the it
cosmetics note of waterproof gel liners
are even sold at Sephora but if they are
would recommend those as number one
number two would definitely be the Urban
Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencils this
shade right here is called muse which is
just a deep chocolatey kind of brown
color a little more cool tone with a
shimmer and then also I want to
recommend these smashbox always a sharp
Cola liner pencils these are always
sharp like they say the shade right here
is called storm this one right here is
called Raven these stay on really nicely
they don't glide on as pigmented when
you first apply them to the waterline
but they're nice for doing a little baby
wing if you want to or going ahead and
smoke
out to the lower lashline so I love
those four eyeliners now as far as
mascaras are concerned I feel like from
me I would definitely recommend at these
Smashbox x-rated mascara I would
definitely recommend at the Stila huge
extreme mascara I would recommend the
Marc Jacobs velbon who are mascara I
would also recommend the Urban Decay
perversion mascara and if you are
looking for a good you know mascara base
I would definitely look into the
Smashbox photo-finish lash primer I ever
really do or my Urban Decay perversion
mascara when but I'm showing you guys a
little deluxe sizes here because I know
and that Sephora does do you like a lash
stash or a lash - sector which comes out
with all of these different sort of
mascaras that you can try out I'm
obviously giving you guys cruelty free
recommendations right now since I'm
cruelty free channel but I realized you
liked this Smashbox photo-finish a
primer it has a deadly wand so if you
scrape yourself on the eye you're gonna
be pissed but it really does help
to build up volume and also the urban
decay subversion lash primer is great so
and these are both natural bristle wands
as well it's really really wet formulas
just like the Urban Decay perversion if
you're looking for a bright with drier
formula I would go for the Too Faced
better than sex or the Marc Jacobs a
velvet more mascara that one is like my
trifecta Holy Grail product currently
alright let's talk about some permanent
pallets I would definitely recommend you
guys look into the modern renaissance
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
this is my all-time favorite on a Stassi
of Beverly Hills palette it is
absolutely beautiful you get a really
nice assortment of neutrals as well is
really really beautiful red raspberry
kind of tones in here if you kind of
cover up this side of the palette you
can see you really can create everyday
natural looks with this it's easy it's
blendable it's beautiful best formula
that they have ever come out with also
the charts rainforest of the sea volume
to eyeshadow palette big fan of this I'm
not a fan of volume three and volume one
is just okay I mean I like volume one
but I like this one the most
so this is the one I'm recommending to
you guys especially if you do like more
cool toned eyeshadows I think you're
gonna be a big sucker for this and these
are foiled eyeshadows so make sure to go
ahead and tap them on to the lid they
don't work amazingly in the crease and
the outer V they're more so for like
smoking out of the lower
putting onto the lid now if you're a big
lover of a cool tone smokey eyes I'm the
pretty vulgar cosmetics and Nightingale
palette is a must it really is a must I
know that this brand isn't really that
highly rated on Sephora but this is the
beautiful eyeshadow palette and I feel
like the majority of it there i shadow
palettes the pretty birdy and all that
kind of stuff do you get highly rated
this is a good formula right here and if
you do want an everyday kind of smoky
palettes that you can get those really
nice cool tones and gray kind of steel
smokey eye looks with I would definitely
go for that as far as two-face is
concerned and the chocolate bar palettes
are great I do it like the bonbons
palettes but my all-time favorite is the
semi-sweet palette some of the 9 pan
palettes are very good quality if you
can get the peanut butter and jelly I
would recommend that one or I would
definitely recommend it the totally cute
palette to this formula right here is
buck and bomb so if you like those jewel
tones don't leak over this and then here
we have a little tortoise Pro to go
palette I recently tried this out and it
is absolutely fantastic this is a really
really fresh and gorgeous formula and
this as well as the tartlet in bloom
palette I would HIGHLY highly recommend
it to you guys and for lip products you
guys I really only have a couple
formulas here that I would highly
recommend I'm not great at doing my lips
I'm a professional flutist and to be
completely honest there's not really
anything out there that I can personally
find that laughs all day for me or that
really really won't rub off on my food
headjoint I'm just kind of picky when it
comes to lip products but I do enjoy the
tarte lipsurgence lip creme these are
basically just in cran form and they're
easy to apply throughout the day and
reapply I also do enjoy the Too Faced
lip creme lipsticks and I feel like the
formula is still pretty similar on these
and they're beautiful this particular
shade right here is called nude beach
which is my all-time favorite the only
thing I don't like about these is I'm
not very precise when I put my lipstick
on again because I'm practicing my flute
it tends to just smudge all day no
matter what if I'm wearing a lip liner
or not but we start to get a little more
worn down throughout the day so you can
always just go in with a lip brush and
then apply it to bite it from Mia I
wouldn't want to carry a lip brush with
me and then reapply it throughout the
days
that's the only downfall with the la
cremes is that the actual you know
format of it starts to kind of wear down
after time which most lipsticks do they
bite Beauty eye moves Bush lipsticks are
some of my favorite I love honeycomb but
that straight honeycomb is just
absolutely beautiful and then also the
Too Faced sweet peach creamy peach lip
oil glosses especially this shade right
here which is called Papa dome peach it
layers beautifully it would be bite
honeycomb lipstick and I really do enjoy
those alright now it is time for a
holiday 2017 and make up a
recommendations and sets now if you
already saw my best and worst of holiday
2017 and makeup you can go ahead and
skip to the next segment which will be
skin care but I want to start with the
bite Beauty a mousse bouche perfect bite
set you give for a little mini a mousse
boost lipsticks in here I am wearing one
of them on my lips right now which is
called Cayenne the shades that you are
getting are rhubarb which is a really
nice kind of plummy tone you're getting
cayenne which is that bright red you are
also getting a shade called honeycomb
which like I said is one of my all-time
favorites and then you are also getting
a shade called sugar cane which is like
a light lavender pink shade I love this
great value set only twenty-five dollars
which is amazing so I would highly
recommend you guys check that out I
already told you guys I love the Marc
Jacobs velvet who are mascara but this
is the holiday 2017 packaging I believe
it's only $1 more to get this amazing
packaging so if you are a collector or
if you're just a sucker for really
collectible items I would recommend
going ahead and getting it into the
special packaging up next we have the
hourglass 2017 holiday palette this is
definitely not going to be for everyone
but I personally really really do enjoy
it if you are a lover of really light
makeup and you do have a fear to medium
not super super deep complexion I think
this will work for you even if you have
sort of like a medium deep complexion it
will work but if your very very very
deep I do feel like this might be
slightly actually on your skin but for
the most part this is a great palette
you get two different blushes in here
you get a bronzer you get two it at
different ambient lighting powders and
ambient lighting strobing powder which I
already talked about those in full-size
so that is a great time to go ahead
that up that's normally $80 so you can
get it for around the $60 range up next
we have the Urban Decay heavy metals
palette now if this isn't like my go to
go to for the holiday season but if you
are looking for a really really colorful
fun palette to play with that is just a
bunch of metallic shades I would highly
recommend this one you have some really
really nice but jewel tones over here
and then you do have some warm tones and
some neutrals over here so I really do
like that one I feel like you need a
glitter glue or to pack that on with
your finger if you are applying these
they don't go on very well with a brush
in my opinion now the Bekaa a play skee
glow face palette like I said I really
enjoyed backup face palettes and this
one is no exception
you are getting two blushes in here one
of the is one of them is the luminous
flush of blush formula which I was
talking about earlier you're also
getting one of their sunlit bronzers
which I'm a big fan of I have two of
those in full size you're getting at
three different highlighters in here as
well as one of their mineral blushes so
this is kind of like the best of Becca
if you want to try out some of their
face palettes or some of their face
products I would highly recommend this
face palette up next we have the
Anastacio Beverly Hills a blush kit in
radiant now I know they also have a
gradient version but this is the one
that is good for my skin tone if you do
have a deeper skin tone go for the
gradient the gradient have an
interesting kind of like contouring
shade in there as well but basically you
get two kind of cooler tone shades over
here and two peachy shades over here
blendable beautiful it does happen
you're really really nice if you want to
go in for the Sephora vib sale and pick
up a glow kit and the blush kit I think
that would be great to add into your
collection the chart latina bloom and
the Tarte lect hosted palettes are both
absolutely amazing if you want to pick
up both of these and get a nice chunk of
money off during the holiday season I
think that is definitely something you
should go ahead and do they pair
together beautifully this one is a
little more neutral and cool toned and
this one is definitely more warm toned
now by the time you guys are watching
this video this should be in Sephora it
is I'm going to debut there at some
point so this is a beautiful beautiful
palette it will be there before the
actual sale but I love this I love the
formula on the new Tarte toasted palette
and then like I said the Tarte light in
bloom is just one of those everyday
friendly sort of palettes again if you
do have more of a neutral or cool tone
well undertone in your skin you are
absolutely going to love this and the
Augusta's Nia Beverly
sugar glow kit is a nice one for the
holiday season is it my all-time
favorite not really but I thought I
would recommend it anyway I know I
already talked about some of the glow
kits earlier but this one does have two
headed best selling shades in here which
are marshmallow as well as starbursts
and then you do have some deeper shades
it's a little more mundane compared to
the other honest ostia Beverly Hills
glow kits but it is holiday 2017 a lot
of people are talking about it and if
you go in store and you swatch it out
and these really match your skin tone
they go ahead and scoop it up it's a
great formula and then finally I want to
talk about the Kat Von D st. and Center
eyeshadow palette this is probably my
favorite palette that have for the
holiday season it's just absolutely
beautiful I'm so happy with the
packaging I'm happy that it's a gorgeous
collector's piece you get so many
different shades in here I know a lot of
people get overwhelmed when they look at
this but you can really get beautiful
Universal complete eye look so with it
so pops the color neutral eye looks
whatever you want this is a really
really nice a blendable sort of formula
it definitely takes a little more time
but they still do blend beautifully so
anyway that is it as far as holiday 2017
and makeup is concerned
let's go ahead and jump into skin care I
have two different cleansers here I want
to recommend to you guys the first one
is my true holy grail cleanser currently
it is from drugged elephant is the
bestie cantaloupe jelly cleanser I love
this I feel like my skin has changed
since I started using this a lot of
people don't want to purchase this it's
quite pricey for five fluid ounces you
go through it quite quickly but normally
I don't see a big difference with
cleansers because cleansers are on your
skin for what 45 seconds maybe a minute
tops but this time right here really
helps to even out my complexion it never
stings my eyes it's great at removing
makeup honestly this has been my go-to
cleanser if there's one skincare product
I would highly recommend to you guys
it's this guy as well as probably the C
from add a serum from drunk elephant but
I love that and then over here I have
deterrent rainforest of the sea deep
dive cleansing gel this is absolutely
fantastic for double cleansing because
it does have lavender oil infused in
there some people are a little more
sensitive lavender oil which I
particularly and so I don't like to use
this straight up on my skin I like to
use it after using a cleansing balm when
there's a little bit of residual makeup
left and that lavender oil in there will
break down at the residual makeup so I
really like this for a double cleansing
I currently have three full sizes of
this
my collection up an accident to
recommend the drunk elephant come see
about me set - this is $88 who do get a
full size of the C from add a serum
which is great if you do have more
mature skin or even if you have combo
skin acne prone skin this is just
fantastic
has L absorb an acid in it it will
definitely help to brighten up the skin
especially if you deal with acne or
hyperpigmentation it does have marilla
oil infused in there so will also
hydrate your skin so you want to make
sure you do what I had and also follow
up with a sunscreen or when it comes to
this guy you get a little sunscreen in
it become see about me set this is the
Umbra sheer physical daily defense
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen with 20
percent zinc oxide this is a physical
sunblock so you really need to work it
into your skin and can leave a little
bit of a white cast just a heads up now
inside of that tech you also are getting
a many of the best e-jelly cleanser and
you are also are getting at the be Hydra
intensive hydration gel which is the
deluxe eyes I'm not a huge fan of that
it's just not hydrating enough for me
personally but if you are looking for a
really nice hydrating moisturizer for
more mature skin or dry skin I would
highly recommend checking out to these
Sunday brightly title brightening enzyme
water cream and that one kind of
exfoliates and outs of moisturizes at
the same time and it's very very
comfortable on the skin alright up next
for the oily skin to people out there if
you have a lot of breakouts and just
oily skin in general these Sunday Riley
marsh and mattifying melting water gel
toner is absolutely fabulous you can go
ahead and pair this together with the do
I have it here I don't have it here the
UFO oil this is they sell acetic acid
oil from Sunday Riley these pair
together beautifully they also do have a
new exfoliating mask that you can get as
well I think there's a little set out
currently this is great for those of you
with oily skin it's not really working
for me currently but I only have a
little bit left so I'm gonna finish it
off but it really would highly recommend
the March and mattifying melting water
gel toner also the Ola Henriksen grace
relief facial water this is really nice
for purifying and mattifying this skin
it does have glycolic acid in it as well
as goldenseal and electic acid so
there's
quite a bit of stuff in here but what
you want to do is spray it on to a
cotton pad and then rub in circular
motions as well take care of the oil as
well as break out so that's a great
toner and then if you have severely
severely dry or mature skin and you need
a really good Joyce a dose of new toys
and really good dose of moisture and you
absolutely don't want anything that has
a J's or glycolic acid or retinol in it
I would highly recommend it the Josie
Maran Argan infinity intensive creamy
oil I don't think I have anything as
hydrating as this in my collection it's
beautiful it smells like an orange
creamsicle very very luxurious you can
put on your retinol and then follow up
with this it does have argan oil infused
in here incredibly incredibly
moisturizing even more so than the face
butter from josie maran so would highly
recommend that alright guys I just hit
my thumb I think that's about it we will
call it a night thank you so much for
joining me guys and I guess I will see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
