my channel happy Wednesday today's video
is going to be my Sephora Spring Sale
recommendations for VIP and VIP Rouge
members this is a 15 percent off sale
which I do think is quite worth it
because let's be honest before it never
has sales I wish they would just give us
20% off like they do in the fall but yes
it's 15% off it is a nice way to stock
up on items that you absolutely adore or
maybe try out some new items that you
haven't heard of right now I did want to
let you guys know that Tarte is having
their friends and family sale in fact a
lot of websites are having their friends
and family sales where you can get
twenty thirty percent off so definitely
look into those before you really like
stock up on your stuff for the Sephora
sale but I do think it's worth it cause
like I said Sephora rarely rarely has
sales now a lot of you are I think all
of us are confused as to when the hell
this sale is happening they've been
pushing it further and further back into
April for the past couple of years and
I'm a little worried because as some of
you said that you called Sephora
representatives and they said that there
will not be a sale this year I do have
quite a few of you that watch me that do
work at Sephora some of you said this
this sale will be happening until June
some of you say April 18 some of you say
next week I really don't have definitive
dates for you guys all I know is that it
is open to the ID and VIP bruges members
the vib Rouge clients will get first
pick or first dibs on the items and then
it will go to the VIP members so that's
all I really now like I said I wish
Sephora would keep up a little more
updated so that we could get our wish
list together so that we could get our
recommendations together ahead of time
so hopefully I made this video up in
time and hopefully it doesn't like start
tomorrow and it's like alright let's do
this so anyway let me go ahead and jump
right into it I'm going to be talking
about a lot of products that have
recently released within the past couple
of months when I did my 2016
recommendations video i talked with
alpha hadn't throw up in the cards i
talked a lot about products that have
been a really big favorite of mine that
are like just items that i would
purchase at full price to be completely
honest I think the Anastasia Beverly
Hills a modern renaissance palette is
absolutely fantastic the hourglass
ambient lighting strobing powders the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector press a
lot of those items you guys know are
like my top bitch products that I talk
about all the time
so I'm going to try and talk a little
bit more about products that are kind of
more recent favorites as well as ones
that have recently released so let's go
ahead and jump right into it too the
first two items I want to talk about our
highlighting palettes this one right
here is the
whole guerrero culo kids from anastacio
Beverly Hills and this one is the
Sephora illuminates palette now I think
that if you are not interested in this
you should go ahead and pick this up but
this is $40 that is see Nicole Guerrero
glow kit and a lot of people are loving
this a lot of people are hating this
some people are getting palettes that
are like infused with a shitload of
glitter
I can guarantee you mine does not have
glitter it's either that or it's just
the way that I'm applying this
highlights my favorite way to do this is
to go in with like a sigma tapered
highlighting brush put it on and then
you can even go in with a fluffy brush
and just dust away the glitter but I
don't seem to notice any glitter that's
the weird thing another way to apply
these is to really kind of buff it into
the skin and I'm guessing that you will
kind of buff away the glitter but for
some reason the only shade in my palette
that I feel like is glitter infused is
this one right here which is called
daydream and it's okay I wear that as a
blush anyway so I would be maybe a
little hesitant with this particular
palette if you're worried that you
really don't like glitter in your word
you might get one with glitter then
maybe stay away from this one and go for
this one this is the Sephora Pro
eliminate palette and this is what it
looks like it is really beautiful it
does retail for $32 a full price of 15%
off this will be in the $20 range and
we'll go ahead and throw up my review
and swatch vest on this particular
palette above and basically I talked
about how it's very similar to a lot of
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
press it definitely isn't as smooth and
creamy as the anastacio Beverly Hills
wanted but it's still beautiful and you
get a lot of product in here in a lot of
different colors to choose from alright
let's talk about some holographic stuff
because holographic and duo chromatic
highlighters are so in right now I did
do a battle video so I'll go ahead and
throw that up in the cards if you guys
would like to see swatches on all of
these items but the first one I want to
recommend is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector press in the shade prismatic
amethyst I think this is a great way to
try out the holographic or do a
chromatic trend without going overboard
it does have just a slight lavender
shift to it and it really is beautiful
on the skin I feel like this would work
for a lot of different skin tones if you
do have a very very very deep complexion
this can look a little ashy on the skin
I say that because I have a friend
Sonora who has a very very deep
complexion and this looked a little ashy
on her but there are plenty of the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter press to
choose from so even if you don't want
this one there will be others that you
can go ahead and choose from and then
also the cap on the alchemists
holographic palette it's not my top pick
I would go and purchase the Anastacio
Beverly Hills a moon child glow kit
before this one but this one is $32 and
with 15% off again you can get it in the
$20 range you can use this on it your a
face you can use it on your eyes you can
use it on your lips it's really cool and
these are true transformers so you can
also place them on top of a black base
and it will really kind of change the
coloring and it's just a really nice
palette I enjoyed that a lot
and then finally the cover FX custom
enhancer drops indicia halo are
magnificent you guys these are very very
cool if you have never tried out the
custom enhancer drops before you can mix
them into your foundations you can apply
them just as a highlight what I like to
do personally is applied them with a
damp sponge over my foundation before I
set my face in that is the key if you do
have more combo or oily skin but these
ones are very cool they have a very
multi-dimensional kind of effect to them
and it shows a lot of blue and purple
undertones to it so if you're not into
that you probably would not like this
but if you are so into the dual
chromatic and holographic trends like I
am this is something that's fun to have
alright let's look how to talk about
some skin care products I'm sundae Riley
it's a great brand I would highly
recommend going ahead and picking some
items up for there is a website right
now I can't remember what it is but I'll
link down below in the comments section
I'll pin it to the top I'll tell you
where you can pick up some Sunday Riley
products right now for 20% off but you
have Sunday Riley is a very expensive
brand if you do have like copper or oily
skin these two guys I would recommend
you pick up the first one is the Martian
mattifying melting water gel toner this
is what it looks like this is amazing
amazing for just completely mattifying
your face very very quickly and it is
very cooling and nice on the skin and
not irritating and then I would also
recommend picking up the UFO ultra
clarifying face oil this is a 1.5%
salicylic acid treatment and it is bound
into an oil so it's not going to dry out
your face really really love this now if
you do have more dry skin more mature
skin I would highly recommend going and
looking into the title brightening
enzyme water cream for ad cream and then
I would recommend looking into the Luna
oil as an overnight retinol treatment I
think that is just fantastic alright
something else from Peter Thomas route
that you guys know I'm absolutely
obsessed with this is the unwrinkled
keel pads this is what they look like
you do get let's see here 60 different
pads in here but you can get an even
larger option and I think this
a good way to kind of save your money
during the sale when you purchase these
I go through these pretty darn quickly
because I use them in the morning and at
nighttime I am trying not to use them as
much right now because I will not be
purchasing again since they do test on
animals I know not everything in this
video it is cruelty-free but that's
because like I know a lot of you are not
cruelty-free so I still want to give you
honest non bias recommendations but
these are really awesome I think that if
you do have any sort of skin type you
could use these if you are a little more
dry or mature I would use these maybe
twice or three times a week if you're
super oily you can honestly use these
twice a day they help with
hyperpigmentation they help with acne
they help with a lot of things so really
really do enjoy those and then also I
wanted to recommend a deodorant because
why the hell not if you are someone who
does have an autoimmune disease like I
do you really should stay away from
aluminum it's really not good for your
body and ever since I have switched over
to this little guy right here I've been
very happy with like a my deodorant
lifestyle so this is the la vanilla the
healthy deodorant ooh this one is
vanilla grapefruit - these are a little
on the pricey side which is why I'm
recommending you pick them up during the
sale but yeah do your own research look
around about aluminum and things like
that there are definitely cases of like
breast cancer being linked to aluminum
all this kind of stuff and especially if
you do have autoimmune conditions like I
do it's just not good for your body so I
would highly recommend switching to a
natural deodorant I will be going ahead
I already picked up at the vegan
deodorant from Tarte cosmetics I picked
that up during the friends-and-family
sale last night so I want to do a
comparison for you guys against this one
but they have a lot of different scents
you can get um let's see here vanilla
lemon which is my all-time favorite this
is vanilla grapefruit they have vanilla
coconut speer vanilla all that kind of
stuff really really good and would
recommend alright the Too Faced sweet
peach line I felt like was kind of a
letdown in general but there is a one
item here that I think is fantastic I
really do like their lip gloss oils but
I feel like I like this even more now
I've been using this a lot it is the Too
Faced Papa don't peach blush now I'm
sure that you could find things in your
collection that are similar shade to
this but it really is cute it really
does smell good and it's a beautiful
beautiful everyday neutral kind of blush
so I would recommend picking this up if
you are very very intrigued with a sweet
peach collection this is something that
I do think is quite good
I do not think it's gonna show up on
every single skin tone as an actual
blush if you do have a deeper skin tone
this is probably going to be more of
like a peachy highlighter for
but still really pretty has a nice nude
base with a little bit of a peachy
iridescent so I do like that a lot um
let's see here
and the Too Faced love flush
long-lasting 16 hour blush as you guys
know I love these I have all six in full
sizes these were recently on the Ulta 21
days of Beauty event if you didn't miss
that you could go ahead and pick some
more of these up at this particular
sheet it's called how deep is your love
I love these they are very very long
wearing very very beautiful I just
really into this formula you guys and
then right here I have the shade Baby
Love which is more of a nude color and
it has a little bit of gold
iridescent I wouldn't say that any of
these are completely matched they all do
have a little bit of a sheen to them but
it's like a satin Sheen not like oh my
god there's glitter on my face kind of
Sheen but I love those in love for sure
something that is new are these Stila
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows you
guys these are fantastic like
I'm not even kidding right now excuse my
language wait no don't excuse my
language who cares this is what they
look like they are just really really
beautiful a liquid eye shadows this
particular shade right here it's called
smokey storm so it's got kind of like a
pewter undertone and then it does have
gold shimmer in it so they are very
pigmented they do take a little bit of
time to completely dry down but honestly
if you are looking for like any shade
under the rainbow I feel like steel
actually released quite a few shades and
then on top of that they did today
release some holographic and do a
chromatic shades which is awesome you
can get those on Sephora so those are
$24 a piece was 15% off do you think
it's worth it I want all of these they
are that good you guys all right moving
on there is a palette here that I think
is absolutely fantastic
again pick it up on the turtlecom
website for 30% off if you can right now
this is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
volume 2 eyeshadow palette this is what
it looks like on the inside I prefer
this particular formula over the first
version and these are kind of like
foiled eyeshadows there's something
about this one that is just a little
nicer than the other one now the other
one I still absolutely adore but I feel
like this would work for all sorts of
different skin types
the first version won't show up on every
skin type it won't if you have a very
deep complexion this is gonna be the one
for you it's absolutely beautiful I have
created some gorgeous eye looks with
this one of my most requested eye looks
of all time was when I was wearing this
shade and this shade right here I still
need to do a tutorial for you guys on
that particular eye look but yeah I
think that this is beautiful definitely
worth the money very very pigmented and
you don't get as much fall out with the
volume too which is awesome
let's see here speaking of concealers
hopefully weren't even talking about
concealers but let's go ahead and talk
about concealers I do have two here that
I absolutely adore if you are very very
fair and pasty like I am you need to get
the cap on to you whiteout luck at
concealer crema I feel like all of these
actually have any very light tone to
them if you go to the store and you
actually swatch them at Sephora it seems
like she really really was good with all
of like the light skin tones which makes
sense because she's pretty pale herself
but yeah this is really nice because you
can mix it in with any sort of concealer
that doesn't work for you it also makes
a great eye base so I love that and then
of course the Tarte main force of the
seat aqua sealer really really adore
this I already shade fair and this is
one of my favorite concealers of all
time if not my favorite it's got a very
nice liquidy kind of coverage to it
liquidy coverage it's not a liquidy
consistency with light coverage and it's
beautiful it's not something that you
can build up to like full-on Tarte shape
tape which by the way it did pick up I
will be going ahead and reviewing that
for you guys but it still is really
really beautiful and I feel like the
Tarte main force of the sea line overall
was a hit a lot of products from Tarte
right now I'm so iffy about but I feel
like the rainforest of the sea line is
pretty damn good
alright from Urban Decay color
correctors like I just feel like I
talked about these all the time but the
color correcting fluids I have all five
shades they're amazing this one is peach
this one's green today I have on pink
and yellow underneath my eyes and then I
have the lavender shade around the more
sallow or yellow tones in my skin and
these are beautiful these are just the
number one color correctors I would
recommend I know the color correcting
trend is not as in right now as it used
to be but still these are really good
and color correcting is awesome and then
as far as mascaras are concerned I have
four here that I think are absolutely
awesome the first is the Sephora
outrageous curl mascara this is what it
looks like it's got a really nice
delicate little wand it gives you
outrageous curl for real so this is a
great one and then right here benefits
that they are real this is a great one
I've gone through I think six tubes of
this look in the past like five years
I'm not even kidding I've been using
this since they released it and it's
just absolutely fantastic most of these
do have rubber bristle wands or the
first two that I'm showing you guys have
rubber bristle ones and the other two I
will show you how to naturally soul but
if you like that really false look
effect I think you would absolutely
adore this and then the last two I want
to recommend are the Too Faced better
than sex now I have heard that maybe you
should go ahead and pick up the
waterproof version
it does have a nice kind of like
hourglass shape - wand it is a natural
bristle wand but this does tend to flake
throughout the day so just be aware of
that maybe you want to pick up the
waterproof and then Lancome Hypnose
drama hands down is so so so good best
natural bristle mascara I have ever
tried I would recommend you this one
over this one all right as far as
eyeliners are concerned I have three
formulas here that really really knocked
my socks off the first one is the drama
liquid pencil from Lancome yea from
Lancome this particular shade is called
cooked as you go and it's just a
beautiful beautiful blue these are
really nice on the waterline they wear
an incredibly long time would highly
recommend those if you're looking for
something a little cheaper these
Smashbox I'll be sharp waterproof Kohl
liners have been a huge obsession for me
the past six months this particular
shade right here is called Raven they
are always sharp they are always on
point okay you guys like I'm not even
kidding you have the little retractable
thing right here and it's just always
sharp it truly is always sharp so you
never have to sharpen these which is
awesome and then of course you guys know
I have to talk about the urban decay
24/7 glide-on eye pencils this one right
here is in the shade is zero and these
are just beautiful I love these they
wear an incredibly long time on my
waterline personally really really adore
those as far as liquid eyeliner is
concerned I can't do a wing for so
I can't give you any recommendations I
have heard that B if Kat Von D tattoo
liner is pretty good but like I said
can't really give you recommendations
for that alright I do have two face
primers here that I want to talk about
the first is the Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer great for those of you
who do have a combo or oily skin it
definitely gives a little bit of a
sticky or tacky feeling at first but
then it does dry down to kind of a
powder finish love that and if you do
have dry skin or more mature skin would
highly recommend the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face base all right finally
let's go ahead and talk about some
foundations if you are looking for full
coverage and you do have dry skin I
would highly recommend the josie maran
vibrancy foundation of fluid this is
absolutely beautiful I feel like because
it is infused with argan oil it's gonna
keep you hydrated throughout the day you
can even set this in if you do have ha
more oily skin like I do and you will
still get a beautiful beautiful glow to
your skin I feel like it looks more
satiny than like straight-up oily and
this is probably one of my all-time
favorite foundations of life another
favorite for me and this would be great
for those of you who are a little more
combo to oily skin is the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage found
this particular shade that I wear is
fair beige and by the way I wear the
shade dynamic in this one I don't
remember if I said that or not but both
of these are really really awesome you
guys like I said full-on coverage so if
you're more dry skinned get this one if
you have more oily skin I would go with
the Tarte and I feel like the Tarte one
has a really really nice shade selection
which is awesome if you want more medium
coverage and you want something a little
more glossy on the skin the shorter
Armani luminous silk foundation is to
die for it's what I have on today it's
beautiful it makes your skin look dull
like and stunning so I would highly
recommend that I do wear the lighter
shade which is called it number two and
then if you want a cruelty-free option
or something that isn't as luminous on
the skin I would go for the Urban Decay
Naked skin weightless Ultra Definition
liquid makeup I wear the shade is 0.5
this really does truly look like skin
and I feel like you can build it up to a
medium coverage love that and then
finally if you want more of a
water-based serum Foundation would
definitely recommend the Stila off with
low serum foundation for those of you
who do have oily or combo skin and then
for dry skin the Laura Mercier candle
glow of soften luminous foundation is
absolutely beautiful
I read the shade affair in the Stila and
then I wear the shade of shell in the
Laura Mercier so anyway that is it guys
I hope you enjoyed this video if you
would like to see more of like my
all-time like Holy Grail favorites like
I said I will go ahead and link that
video of the 2016 fall recommendations
but I hope you enjoyed this I hope it
was kind of short and concise and to the
point thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
