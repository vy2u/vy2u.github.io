have another video for you tonight at
this time I am walking you guys through
my Sephora vib wish list so Lisa for a
sale I believe starts at the end of
October for vib rouge members I don't
know the exact dates yet well I did get
my email but I can't remember the exact
dates but i will be doing a
recommendations video as well later this
week for you guys but i wanted to share
with you guys what is on my wish list
for this particular sale I probably
won't purchase every single item but I
have about 15 to 20 items on here and I
condense this down literally there were
like 50 or 60 and now there's only 15 or
20 so I'm pretty happy about that but
anyway let's go ahead and get started
the first item I have on here is from
philosophy this is the purity cleansing
collection in here you are getting a
full-size just release me eye makeup
remover it's like a dual phase so it's
got the eye makeup remover and also an
oil in it you're also getting the purity
made simple facial cleansing wipes and
also a full big huge jumbo size of the
purity made simple cleansing wash which
i like to use for my brushes normally
this is seventy dollars and now it is on
sale for 35 so I hope that it stays with
that price throughout the sale the next
item that I want to get is the laura
mercier de petits souffle body creme
collection you are basically getting
little tiny body butters here and they
all have different sense so there's one
that's like coconut milk they have fig
they have creme de pistache I'm very
excited and I really want to get my
hands on that I also have this little
rollerball collection here from nest I
don't know if this is rollerball or
spray form I do hope it's spray form but
this is a way to try out all of their
different perfumes I do like the citrine
one which is that yellow one that you
guys see there and I thought it would be
a nice way to go ahead and try out some
of the more perfumes from them some of
the more more perfumes from them yeah
moving on the next item I have here is
also another perfume this is the clean
reserve blonde Rose travel spray this is
twenty-five dollars and I really wanted
to get this because I got a sample of
this in my Sephora play box and it was
so good it smells just like the
sandalwood Rose scent from bath and body
works which I love the next two items
are from NARS so I have already
purchased one of these in a different
color you guys will see that Sephora
haul coming up later this week but these
are the NARS velvet lip glides I heard
emilynoel83 raving about these so I
picked out three different shades the
first one was kind of like a neutral
rosy color which again you guys will see
in the hall later this week and then
this is a red shade and here is a
beautiful plummy shade they seem like
they're going to be very creamy and
pigmented so I'm excited for those the
next item on my list is the 400 luna
mini this is ninety nine dollars I want
the light pink version and I really want
to compare this to the clarisonic
alright next we have the diorskin new
dare luminizing powder it's currently
sold out hopefully it will come back in
stock because this baby is fifty-six
dollars and I do not want to purchase it
full size rrb full price not full size
of course I want full size not full
price alright the next item and that is
on here is the Urban Decay all nighter
liquid foundation I've heard that this
oxidized is quite a bit so I did go
ahead and like love the lightest shade
or I put like a little heart around the
lighter shades so that's the one I want
to try I've heard that this has
excellent coverage and I thought it
would be quite good for my combo to oily
skin next we have the sunday riley title
brightening enzyme water cream you guys
know I recently have switched up my
nighttime skincare routine to basically
everything sunday riley so i think this
would be a great addition to have also
the chloe of my little roses day Khloe
perfume you guys have told me that this
smells exactly like roses and I love
everything rose so I really want to get
this a full-sized is around 90 or
hundred and fifteen dollars or something
like that so i was thinking of just
saying this little one in spray form
next we have the sephora collection
supreme cleansing oil I have heard
amazing things about this and with
twenty percent off it's going to be
really really a good price so anyway
this is the next cleansing oil that I
want to try out next we have these your
leak rosewater balancing missed my
all-time favorite balancing missed or
just facial spray in general i love this
i have had some really bad luck lately
with facial mist so i'm very very
excited to get my hands on this again
and especially for a discounted price
and then also i have the laura mercier
flawless skin infusion rose nourishing
oil on my list I've heard amazing things
about this it is $62 but I love facial
oils so very very interested in that
next we have the drm apricot fortifying
cream for nails this is twenty seven
dollars and it basically is just a
really nice smelling apparently a really
nice smelling cream for your nails to
kind of you know help with your nail
beds and if you're having any nail
problems lately my nails have been
looking like like utter so I
would really like to get my hands on
that and then we come to the big item
these are the YSL the leptin teen oils I
plan on getting ever
single shade of these every single shade
there's been a few shades that I've
looked at that don't like swatch that
well and I don't think I would like but
for the most part you're going to be
seeing three or four of these for sure
and the final item that we have on my
list is the bow shud Tsubaki deep
hydration sleeping mask this is $34 I've
gone through quite a few little samples
of this and I love it so anyway guys
that is what is on my wish list I feel
like everything is pretty darn condensed
there's only what like 13 14 15 items on
here but yeah number one picks are
definitely going to be those vil up
tents and oils I'm going to be playing
those in my basket ASAP once the sale
starts and then also I really want those
Laura Mercier lip petites who played
body creme collection so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this video like I said
I will have my recommendations video
going up sometime this week and I will
see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
