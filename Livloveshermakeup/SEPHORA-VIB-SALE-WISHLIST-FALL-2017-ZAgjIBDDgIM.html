channel today I am here to share with
you guys my Sephora vib sale wishlist
for fall 2017 we are going to start at
the bottom of my wish list here and then
work our way up please understand that
just because these are on my wish list
doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to
purchase every single one and this is
just currently what is on my love's list
at Sephora so anyway let's go ahead and
just jump right into it I am going to
start with the venti beauty by Rihanna
gloss balm universal lip Luminizer so
many people are talking about how this
is very universally flattering now I put
universally flattering in quotation
because I don't feel like any products
really on the market is universally
flattering but you can get pretty darn
close I've seen this on deep complexions
I've seen this on really fair
complexions it looks beautiful and
lately I really have gotten more into
lip products I don't know what it is
during the summer time I was like I want
to get rid of all my lip products and
right now I seem to be really really
circulating my lip products - I'm really
getting through a lot of them so I don't
know what's happened but I'm really into
lip color now so if this is the Fenty
close shimmering Rose nude shade and I
just think it looks really beautiful
I'd will have a foundation Friday or a
first impressions next Friday going up
for you guys on the Fenty Beauty
foundation I did pre-fill Mac so yeah
that will be up next Friday but I would
like to go ahead and pick up this gloss
balm because it seems like this is like
the number one rated product from the
line all right
up next I do have the Urban Decay 24/7
troublemaker mascara and eye pencil
Depot this retails for $28 and inside of
here you are getting full sizes of the
new troublemaker mascara as well as one
of the 24/7 glide-on eye pencils in the
shade zero so I do have this in full
size I think I'd two or three of 0 it's
a pretty good eye pencil I like that
this is only $28 for a mascara and a
full-size eyeliner and you get a little
bag so I figured this would be a good
time to go ahead and pick it up I've
been very curious about the troublemaker
mascara I might pick it up I might not
I'm very picky about mascara so I like a
certain look I am NOT the kind of girl
who likes natural looking lashes I
really and I don't like fake lashes
either what I like is clumpy lashes so
we'll see if this can give me that
effect of the wand looks very similar to
the YSL babydoll mascara so I have
pretty high hopes but yeah that is on my
list as well up next I have the cover FX
custom enhancer drop set this retails
for
some limited edition best-selling
enhancer drops I'm sorry the set is a
limited edition but I believe the
majority of these you can purchase in a
full size I do have this sheet right
here which is called holographic I do
have this one in a full size but the
rest of them I just think these are
gonna be great for darkening up my
foundations a lot of my foundations are
too light for me currently also giving a
nice glow and just a little more of a
skin like a purin so this guy right here
I'm pretty darn sure is for sure going
to be purchased but yeah that is the
cover FX custom enhancer drop set up
next we have two lip sets here that my
friend Samantha March has really made me
want to buy the first is the charts a
limited edition mermaid kisses lipstick
set this is the rainforest of BC
lipstick collection and I honestly
really do enjoy a lot of products from
the rainforest of the sea collection
from Tarte so when she was talking about
how moisturizing these are and how
beautiful they are I was like okay I'll
try them out they are vegan they are 12
hour at lipsticks for moisture risk
mooster rich mermaid like kisses and it
only retails for $23 so this is
definitely on my list but we'll see I
have a lot of lip products on my list
currently so we'll see if that makes the
cut up next we do have a Marc Jacobs
Beauty snake charmer by piece petite
enamored high shine gloss lip lacquer
collection okay so these are some of
their best selling high shine lip
glosses I'm mostly interested in this
kind of like duochrome or trichrome lip
gloss right here but also these two
speak to me on a very strong level now
these guys right here I really don't the
reason why I really wanted to pick this
up though is because I've heard so many
people say these are awesome including
Samantha I think Samantha said this was
her favorite color these are definitely
Samantha asked sort of colors if you
guys watch Samantha go ahead and link
her channel down below is a huge huge
lover of nude lip glosses nude
everything when it comes to lip products
so I can understand why she would like
those these are the ones that are really
appealing to me but I just heard so many
good so many good things about these so
let me know if you have tried out the
market Jacobs high shine gloss
collection or any of the lip glosses let
me know if you like them or not and
whether I should purchase this for $39
alright guys moving on we have the
Smashbox Studios skin 15 hour foundation
now this is for sure going to be
purchased no matter what I'm probably
gonna get the shade 1.15 or possibly
even 1.2 because I am self tanned or a
soft hands last night so and this is
what it looks like it's
oil-free hydrating foundation that gives
you flawless skin for 15 hours it's
tested to ensure that you look gorgeous
in any light and Diet does retail for
$42 you get one fluid ounce of product
in here which is the standard amount of
heard great things about this for normal
to dry skin all right moving on we have
a Becca shimmering skin Perfector mini
this is in the new shade vanilla quartz
so many of you were telling me you need
to get this it is basically a shifting
pinky pearl highlight is basically like
pearl mixed together with pink and I
bought it I don't know if I'll get it
you guys I do I know I've never shown
like my Becca shimmering skin perfecter
collection on YouTube but I do have a
lot of them I don't necessarily need
this but I mean I I bought it I really
do want it so we'll see if that makes
the cut up next we have the bike Beauty
Gabby kisses set this is only $20 I am
pretty darn sure I'm going to pick this
up it is a travel set with three
products made from the agave exfoliate
treat hydrate to kind of lips line or
whatever so you have the agape lip balm
which I have never tried the overnight
lip mask which is amazing and
then the lip scrub this is great for $20
so I'm pretty darn sure I'm gonna go
ahead and pick that one up
up next we do have these smashbox drawn
and decked out shadow and highlighting
palette set you guys Cerritos were $39
this is a good deal right I'm not just
like making up it's a $77 value
this is one of the better value sets
that I have seen I'm not the biggest fan
of Smashbox shadows but I have not tried
them in yours so please let me know if
you have tried the cover shot palettes
if you think they're worth it I for
great things about like the spotlight
palettes and all that kind of stuff so
please let me know if you tried out the
eyeshadows but I mean this seems like a
great deal three pallets for $39 so this
is definitely on my list I also love
those colors especially the plums next
up we have a little mini of the sundae
by Lee lien at night sleeping oil so I
don't have this in my collection
currently I think I've gone through
three or four full sizes of this it
could have even been 5 I've been using
this since it came out it is absolutely
fantastic especially if you are more
normal to dry skin and I think I want to
go for the mini just because I so what
many skincare products in my collection
I don't use this up very quickly so this
retails for 55 will most likely pick
that up as well all right then we have
another drunk elephant
Satna I did a pickup be come see about
me and I did a haul video where I
feature that show I'll go ahead and
throw it up in the cards but this is the
drunk elephant vol 3 let's do it
it is a trio of best-selling skin
quenchers that take hydration and
moisture to the next level I'm not a big
fan of the be Hydra intensive hydration
gel but my boyfriend does enjoy it so I
would give this to him but this is what
I really want to try out I have never
tried the Lala retro whipped cream I've
heard it's great for normal to dry skin
and especially mixed in with that virgin
marula oil I feel like this would be a
good set for me so this does retail for
$78 it is a 113 dollar value the drunk
elephant sets are really just popping in
my opinion so let me know if you would
like me to purchase this and do a
comparison against ya come see about me
but yeah this is on my list I know I've
been purchasing a lot of stuff from drug
gallopin but they're just such a great
brand all right up next guys we have the
Kat Von D saint and sinner perfume so
these are the sprays that these are each
$22 for some reason the sephora near me
does not seem to have these in like
testers or anything to actually go in
and smell so I have no idea what these
smell like but I love the packaging on
the full sizes I do not want to invest
in the packaging on the full sizes in
case I don't like this sense I'm pretty
picky when it does come to set so here
is the sinner here is the Saint I think
I'm just gonna go ahead and pick the two
of these up I was waiting to see if they
were going to do a holiday set which
includes both of them in full size for
like a lower amount or like a nice value
set but it doesn't look like they've
done that yet so I think I'm just gonna
pick up the little Travis phrase for now
up next we have some products here from
pharmacy so many of you first of all
were recommending this green clean clean
makeup either so clean two times green
clean makeup melt away cleansing balm
with echinacea green envy but also my
friend who does have a drier skin and
was telling me this pharmacy honey
potion antioxidant hydration mask is
absolutely fantastic this does retail
for $56 which is a lot I have tried
certain things from the pharmacy line
that I'm not a huge fan of currently
they do have a skincare set that
includes this as well as I believe the
green clean up makeup melt away
cleansing balm but it also includes a
full sides of their honey mousse riser I
hated that moisturizer so I don't think
that that set is made for me so I don't
mind going ahead and just purchasing a
full-size of this especially when I'm
gonna get a 20%
I don't mind and then this guy right
here so many of you have recommended you
said it goes a lot little goes a long
way it's only $35 really have been
looking for a good cleansing balm that
is cruelty free up next I have another
little set here from Smashbox this is VB
legendary liquid metal minis these
retail for $22 I'm trying to get outside
of my comfort zone and do a little more
of a glossy sort of lips that are very
in for it this year this is a travel set
of liquid metals that glide on rich
saturated lip color mirror like chrome
finish
I'm just really drawn to like that red
shade and this purple shade so let me
know if you have tried out this formula
this only retails for $22 I think would
be a great little thing to try out all
right up next we have some product here
from Ola Henriksen the first one is a
little brightening essentials set from
the truth line this retails for $34 and
inside of here you are getting let's see
here the truth a gel cleanser and the
truth serum as well as the moisturizing
creme I've never tried the moisturizing
creme it looks like it's gonna be kind
of similar to the origins ginseng
refreshing sort of gel cream that they
have know that one's for the eyes they
have they have a moisturizer the origins
line does and it smells really good and
I just remember I was totally devastated
when I found out origins was not cruelty
free so I feel like this could be a nice
alternative to that I do like the pure
truth of melting gel cleanser and I love
the true serum so I will probably go
ahead and pick this up for $34 up next
we the Ola Henriksen transforming a
walnut scrub I also really do enjoy this
I might not pick it up during the sale
but I will for sure pick it up at some
point
it smells like blueberries it's very
very exfoliating on the face I would
only recommend using this maybe once or
twice a week but yeah that is on the
list
up next Nia the Ola Henriksen nurse
would be moisturizing cran this retails
for $40 they do also have a through
three ounce jar for 64 this is
incredibly moisturizing it has a rosehip
fruit oil in it as well as like a
multivitamin blend so I would like to
eventually pick that up up next we have
a chart to water foundation now I think
the shade I'm gonna get is fair light
neutral this retails for $39 if you guys
recall I tried this out probably about a
year ago when I first released when the
rainforest of the sea collection it was
way too greasy and oily on my skin but I
want to start a new series talking about
products I meet they're gonna call it
second impressions or I'm going to call
it let's try
again and that's just gonna be knee
trying out products that I didn't like
before that I think would now work for
my more normal to dry skin so I'm gonna
try this guy out again up next we have
the Marc Jacobs cat's meow 5 p 5 piece
petits Lamarck lip creme collection this
retails for $45 I feel like if I don't
pick up the lip glosses this might be a
nice little set to get really really
beautiful beautiful lipstick colors in
here I especially love the berry and the
red this retails for $45 again I've
never tried the la creme lip collection
but I've heard so many good things about
these little lipsticks so let me know if
I should pick up the lip glosses or the
lipsticks up next I have a josie maran
whipped argan oil body butter trio this
retails for $36 you get a full-size of
the whipped argan oil and then you get
two little minis one of them is like a
vanilla I think a vanilla something I
can't even read what that says vanilla
plant please swear it says like clear
Pia vanilla plate I can't even read that
you guys one of them have the vanilla
scent and the other one is I can read
that lavender citrus I don't love the
smell of lavender but I really do think
this is a great deal this is like a $59
value for $36 these are incredibly
moisturizing if you have the driest of
dry skin you're going to love this so I
thought I would go ahead and pick one of
those up and then here we have the
Ciotti London this is the snow globe
collective kiss set and this retails for
$35 I've heard really good things about
their liquid at velvet lipsticks so this
is in just tiny little minis as you guys
can see a very very everyday wearable
colors holy that's a bad rating a
two-star rating that is not good at all
I'm gonna have to go double check of the
reviews but I've heard good things about
these liquid lipsticks as well so let me
know if you enjoy these next up we have
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I
will probably pick up the shade
porcelain which is very very dark I
remember trying out snow and it was
still too dark for me when I was super
super pale but I feel like now that I'm
self tan porcelain will be good but this
was another foundation that I did not
like when I had combo oily skin so again
I would probably feature this in my
second impressions or my let's try it
again
series so I thought I'd go ahead and
pick that up
another guys here from josie maran my
voice is starting to crack another
little guy here from josie maran is the
best of argon skin care Reeve Ivers
inside of here you do get a whipped
argan oil again for the body and then
you get a full size of the josie maran
argan oil I feel like this might be a
good deal this is only $52 you're also
getting the whipped argan oil face of
butter and then some sort of little
purple thing here I don't know what that
is but these three products right here
I've tried each tap this and a full-size
I have currently this in a full-size and
one of these are the full-size and I
love them so maybe this will be the
better Josie Mary Mirren set for me to
get up the next will close that up
antivirus and then up here we have the
last little guy this is called the youth
to the people fresh pressed superfood
skin kit I talked about this in my last
like look at my love's list sort of
video I'm still so interested in this
but I haven't heard of anybody really
trying it out there's only 15 reviews
it's been on there it says it's a
limited edition but it's been on there
for like a good three months it's a kale
spinach green tea hyaluronic acid a
moisturizer you have a spirulina sort of
God I don't even know what this is I
think it's a mask and then here you have
a cleanser if you tried anything from
the youth to the people line please let
me know down below but that retails for
$54 so anyway guys that is everything
that is on my wish list if you would
like to see my recommendations video
