my channel today's video is going to be
my spring 2017 Sephora vib sale wish
list I believe that the sale does start
on the 18th which which is exactly two
weeks from today so I thought I would
jump on here and share with you guys
what is in my cruelty-free wish list and
then tomorrow I will do recommendations
for you guys headed Japan James to bed
right here with me so if you hear a
little scattering on the actual tiles as
conceived running around in the kitchen
but anyway yeah so I will share my
recommendations with you guys tomorrow
and not all those will be cruelty-free
because I know not all of you are
cruelty-free but of course my wish list
is because i am going and moving in that
direction so anyway let me go ahead and
start towards the bottom because i have
a few products down here that i'm very
very excited about and these are the
fuel and magnificent metals glitter and
glow liquid I shows I do already own the
shade storm which i think is amazing I
really adore it so the ones that I want
to pick up now our goals goddess as well
as this one right here which is called
rose gold retro i also want to get
violet vixen and then this one right
here which is called molten midnight i
will eventually probably just pick all
of them up i would really like to get
diamond dust as well but like i said
they don't have that up right now this
one is sold out and because i do already
have smoky storm I feel like I kind of
already have smoldering satin and kitten
karma I know the kitten is a one of like
their best selling shades but these are
just the ones i'm going to go with like
i said gold glottis rose gold retro
violet vixen and then molten midnight
and those are for sure going to be
picked up during the sale alright the
next item is the Cielo aqua glow serum
concealer this does retail for $27 and
this is what it looks like the shade
that I'm going to pick up is fair it
says it's an ultra-lightweight ionized
water based serum concealer with
foldable and natural-looking coverage I
really been into concealers lately so I
do want to pick up a few during the sale
and i love these cielo aqua low serum
foundation so i thought i would go ahead
and pick that up for sure and then here
early cover FX custom enhancer drops
these are 42 dollars apiece and i'm
deciding between the shade blossom which
is a soft pearlescent pink and also
celestial which is a glistening pearl i
feel like these ones right here blossom
would be really nice to mix into my more
yellow tones foundations but then this
one right here would just be beautiful
to wear as a highlight I'd you already
own the shade right here which is called
halo which is a holographic mall
dimensional one but yeah solvent decided
if I will take it that up for sure and
then here we have the urban decay's
rehab makeup prep hot springs water gel
this is what it looks like it does
retail for $28 and is supposed to be a
benefit packed ultra lightweight gel
that leaves skin feeling soft intensely
hydrated and ready for perfect makeup
application this is a new product so
there are no ratings yet here as you
guys can see but I thought it looked
really really interesting and I think
this would be nice as an actual primer
so that might be on the list or that
might be something i pick up like i said
i won't be picking up every single item
that i'll show you guys in this video
but i do want quite a few of them and
then also here's another concealer this
is the urban decay naked skin weightless
complete coverage concealer and honestly
i just want to get this shade razor
which is fair and neutral I think it
looks a little better than light warm
from me personally and I just really
love the urban decay naked skin
foundation at the wanted done hyper
complexion Perfector I love the color
correcting fluids I didn't love the
highlighting fluid by for great things
about this so that is on my list another
item that is on my list is from kat von
d this is the metal crush eyeshadow and
the shade thunderstruck now if you
already own this shade right here which
is called doce or dolce which is a
metallic copper unfortunately mine
shatter these do have a really large
amount of product in here two point
eight grams if you can see that they are
so silky and so buttery so mine did go
ahead and shatter which is really
unfortunate that I heard thunderstruck
is an amazing amazing highlights on fair
skin and because these do have such a
large amount of product in them you can
fit your highlighting brush in there
with no problem whatsoever so that is
definitely on the list and then also on
the it cosmetics bye bye under eye
illumination full coverage anti-aging
waterproof concealer so I have tried out
the regular version before and I found
it so sticky and tacky and just too much
coverage for me personally unless I was
on stage so I thought maybe I would go
ahead and try out the illumination
version please let me know if you have
tried this and let me know if there are
glitter particles in it like the CC
cream in the illumination one because
I'm not a huge fan of that one but i do
think i'll pick this up and shade lights
possibly and then next would you have
the charts clean queen of vegan
deodorant to this is $14 so it's going
to be a pretty good deal with fifteen
percent off it is a natural deodorant
that's not irritating and full of
natural odor neutralizer and
conditioners
healthy clean field without harsh
chemicals and a lot of you want me to
compare this to the LA vanilla healthy
deodorant so i think i will go ahead and
do that for you guys and then another
chart product i have here is the
rainforest of the sea drink of h2o
hydrating boost moisturizer I really
like to use this as an actual primer it
does have silicone in it so it's not
really something i would use as an
actual moisturizer but i feel like
during the summertime it's kind of
similar to like that Urban Decay Hot
Springs whatever I feel like this would
be really really it nice to just throw
on your face quickly and then through on
your foundation during the summertime so
that is on the list as well as the vice
beauty agave lip mask and be shade
smashed i already own at this one right
here which is the clear version I hate
this one right here I used to own this
this one is champagne and it honestly is
so ugly it just happens really really
strange iridescent to it looks like you
have like salmon on your lips or
something but this one right here in
smash is beautiful it's a sheer candy
apple red and I thought it would be nice
to wear before going on stage and things
like that and then I do have two of the
bites beauty a moosh moosh lipstick I'm
Irish on booze booze lipsticks in mashiz
Kaaba and also honeycomb so I love the
formula on these I love bite beauty and
honeycomb are you already actually owned
in a little deluxe size it's a beautiful
beautiful perfect new shade and for some
reason this looks amazing absolutely how
are dancers nibbling on my toes okay I'm
holding him now it doesn't look amazing
on my affair skin which I really
appreciate and then it that once whistle
so where is khabar think kavas around
here somewhere i'm let's see here cava
is a really really beautiful kind of
nudie pink beige lilac shade i really
really want to get this one as well i
think it's beautiful so there is the
shade cava and those are very high on
the list you guys I think I want to go
and do a bigger declutter of my lip
products I know I did quite a few of the
52 15d clutters but I think at this
point I actually want to go ahead and
and have like a minimalist lip
collection so i am going to maybe record
that for you guys and so thats where i
really do give me where i really go
ahead and declutter a lot of lipsticks
and lip products mr. badger what is your
problem he's nibbling on me alright next
we have these sunday riley ceramic flip
clay cleanser i heard that this is
really nice if you do have combination
or oily skin it is supposed to be
balancing and deep cleaning and
I yeah it looks pretty darn good i left
sunday riley so i thought i would try
that out and then also the drunk
elephant la la retro whipped cream it is
sixty dollars which is quite pricey but
I want to try this out as a facial
moisturizer here we have the it
cosmetics / makeup three-in-one makeup
melting cleansing balm want to try that
out as well and then here i do have q
Anasazi of Beverly Hills a brow products
the first is a brow Wiz and the second
is the drowsy finer I'm going to get
either of them in the shade taupe which
is like ash blonde for light to dark
blonde hair this one right here has a
little retractable actual brow pencil
and then here you do have these then
just stop it here you do have the actual
of you know spoolie so anyway I have
been obsessed lately with this Revlon
Colorstay brow pencil and I know that
you know revlon does test on animals so
I want to find something similar to it
you know its cruelty free and this one
it looks very very similar so i'll
probably get the brow definer in the
shaded choke and then here are the NARS
velvet lipslides I cannot decide which
shade I want because honestly it's
gotten really annoying to the point
where I feel like all of these shades I
own in other like lip colors do you know
what I mean like okay you have a brown
you have some berries you have some
bread you have some news I already
initiated right here called bound and I
feel like that's the most unique out of
all of them so I don't know what shade
i'll pick up but i do love this formula
and then here i do have the hourglass in
vail mineral primer that does retail for
a very very large price of fifty four
dollars for one ounce but i love this oh
my gosh now they have a jumbo version
for 75 holy no i'm just going to
get the 1 ounce version i have gone
through three full sizes of this in at
my lifetime i used to use this all the
time when i was in college i think it's
beautiful just have a little bit of like
a silicone kind of Airy texture to it
which is very very nice and then on top
of that it does have some pre-built in
there which is great for the summer time
and then here i do have the two base
taking over our X replenishing face
primer and I'm not quite sure if i will
pick this one up like I said I'm or you
know I'm more attempted to get to be
hourglass one but this is a wonderful
wonderful hydrating primer and then they
charge the BP canted treatments add this
is a 12-hour primer broad-spectrum SPF
30 sunscreen this actually gives insane
full coverage you guys so i do think i
want to take this up any shade fair i've
gone through 3 deluxe I samples I'm just
like you gotta pick it up girl
and then here is a drunk elephant be
Hydra intensive hydration gel this is
for sure something that I'm picking up
this is great for me during the
springtime and outs of the summer when
my skin does get a little more oily if
you do have dry or like normal or you
know really mature skin I don't think
this is going to give you enough
hydration but it does have vitamin B
side and it just helps to like Brighton
and improve the appearance of skin
texture and things like that and then
finally there is a little boy beauty set
called love by two lips at four $42 kind
of interesting you do get two different
multi sticks in here the shades are I
believe like mess sorbet can't even
remember it's like cupcake and something
else but you get 2 of the multi sticks
right here and then you do get is this
little guy and I'm really interested in
trying this out I have picked up the
gold version of this I busy clutter is
woke up like the gold is not for me but
this is beautiful just come with like a
pearly kind of rosy tone if they lip
gloss multi-dimensional and then the
multi sticks can be used on your cheeks
or your lip so anyway guys that is
everything that is in at my Sephora wish
list definitely let me know down below
what is on your wish list and I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow for the
