my channel a happy 4th of July to those
of you who are here in the United States
I'm getting this video up a little later
tonight but I wanted to go ahead and
still do a video for you so today we're
going to be comparing it the Ulta house
brand and the Sephora house brand so the
uLTA Beauty brand versus the Sephora
collection I have tried out 8 to 10
products from the Ulta beauty brand and
about 20 to 25 from you Sephora
collection so I thought it would be fun
to go ahead and walk through what I
think is the best makeup who is for
makeup who wins for skincare body care
miscellaneous all that kind of stuff so
I'm going to be going ahead and
inserting the photos just because I
don't have everything unpacked here in
the Beauty room yet really really sorry
but I'm gonna insert photos because it's
going to be easier for me but yeah let's
go ahead and jump right into it so the
first thing I want to talk about use
makeup hands with down at the Sephora
collection wins from makeup in my
opinion there has only been one makeup
product from the uLTA Beauty line that I
really enjoyed and that is the legendary
Lynx mascara I have a game you shade of
black brown it sells retail for $10 it
has a really really nice rubber bristle
one I like that it gives a lot of
natural length and a volume and as you
like the black brown shade but that is
really the only makeup product from the
uLTA Beauty line that I have really
really enjoyed now as far as the Sephora
collection is concerned I love the
colorful eyeshadow filter palette in
sun-bleached filter this retails for $28
but currently it is on sale for 15 it
has a really really nice color selection
to is there's a shade in there I'm going
to say a song in there and then the save
them they're called swan song but it's
absolutely beautiful it's like a mask
purpley pinky color is gorgeous if you
have a fair complexion and overall I
would say the shadows in there there's
definitely more chips than mrs. I do
notice sometimes with the Sephora
collection eyeshadows they can be very
much hit or miss like you get half of
palette that's really good and then half
the palette is not but in that one I
would say there's definitely more hits
than misses would highly recommend
checking those out also the outrageous
curl mascara one of my all-time favorite
mascaras is got this tiny little itty
bitty box
I believe it retails for about $12 a
curls the lashes that give the length is
volume would HIGHLY highly recommend you
guys pick that up also be illuminates
palette this is something that's a
little newer I did a whole review and
swatch fest video on this so
and throw it up in the cards if you're
interested but it has a really nice
layout of different colors that are very
similar to the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
Glo kits as well as kind of like color
dupes for the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter so that is a really really
nice palette especially for that price
also the ethereal finish natural
foundation I remember loving this it
does retail for $24 I think they're
starting to discontinue it if you can
find your shade I would highly recommend
checking it out it's a serum based
foundation very very silky and beautiful
on the skin and it does last all day
long and then finally the wonderful
cushion matte lip cream they are eight
dollars apiece I own all three I am NOT
someone who is huge on liquid lipsticks
and all that kind of stuff but these are
very very comfortable they're very
bright colors they have like a magenta a
red and then like a black berry shade
they are beautiful they have this little
sponge tip applicator that actually kind
of blurs out fine lines and wrinkles in
your lips as well so really really enjoy
it those all right this far as body care
is concerned I feel like it's a tie
between all the beauty and support
collection so for also beauties I will
say they're moisturizing body lotions
are fantastic because they have such a
good you're going to say shade selected
in sense collection so the one that I'm
working through right now by the way
they are $9.50 but I will say the uLTA
Beauty brand always has like buy three
get one free or buy one get one 50% off
which is really really nice so the one
I'm using currently is nectarine rose oh
my god I can't even find cents like that
at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so I really really
like that it has a nice kind of gel and
moisturizing feel to it I wouldn't say
that if this moisturizing a say a body
cream but they also do have five creams
in the collection if you want something
a little more moisturizing those are
fantastic they look smooth the body
scrub those retail for $19.50 but they
are so freakin good as well I do still
prefer like my tree cut scrubs we feel
like those are a lot cheaper you can get
those buy one get one 50% out all the
time as well on the sephora.com website
but definitely the luxans body scrubs
are very very nice from Ulta beauty and
then also the three and one of the
Beauty smoothie that wasn't a Buddhist
movie the Beauty smoothie you get 24
ounces of product in here for 16 of
dollars I'm looking at mine right now
I don't love it for washing my hair just
cuz I do have scalped problems but I do
like it as far as taking a bath as
concerns now I've kind of changed my
mind on the product I wouldn't purchase
any more of these but if you are a big
fan of like three and one products or if
you have kids or something you want to
be able to use one product for all sorts
of different things I would recommend
these they do have nice sense the reason
why I've kind of fallen out of love with
this is just because I feel like the
bubbles don't last when you do put it as
a bubble bath
so I'm someone who takes bath like
practically every single night I like
really luxurious bubble baths and the
bubbles just say too quickly so that's a
good product for it like it's a very
good deal you know 24 ounces for $16
especially if this buy one get one 50%
off so for me I just like something to
give a little more bubbles all right as
far as Sephora is concerned I think you
have some interesting a body care
product so they have foot mass as well
as hands but again I feel like it's a
tie because very cool to be honest and
flip math not everybody is into that but
if you love to pamper yourself you would
probably enjoy these they have foot mats
that are five dollars apiece I have
tried it both of them that they have my
favorite was the lavender so basically
you put your little foot in this little
bootie you kind of velcro it around your
ankle you leave it on for about 45
minutes and you are left with super
super smooth feet I really like that as
well as the hand mask those or $6 a
piece of my favorite would be avocado I
did try out the argan oil one I felt
like it was a little too greasy if you
have extremely dry hands maybe that one
would be good for you but overall I
would say that it's a tie between uLTA
Beauty and Sephora collection when it
comes to body care with a little more of
like the uLTA Beauty kind of leading the
way if that makes sense I feel like they
have some really good body care products
all right as far as skin care is
concerned that Sephora collection hands
down their sheet masks or I'm a store
sleeping mat for all fantastic as far as
the sheet masks are concerned those are
six dollars apiece I have tried at the
Rose one and the Lotus one at those are
my two favorites the eye mask I tried
all of them my favorites were the
pomegranate and the rose and then as far
as the sleeping masks are concerned
those are $4 apiece those are the ones I
would highly recommend out of any sort
of mass from the Sephora collection I
have tried them all in my favorite
swarthy green tea and the rose I really
like those ones because it's like a gel
and a little goes a very long way you
literally can put those on your face for
a whole week like one little monopod
will last you a
weeks oh those are absolutely fantastic
and then as far as like wipes are
concern becoming and exfoliating voice
from the Sephora collection are amazing
I have raved about these over and over
and over again you can get 25 wipes for
seven dollars and fifty cents I have
tried it on all all the different scents
or flavors I guess you could say my
favorites were the yuzu and the rose
ones and then finally I want to talk
about the Suprema cleansing oil so you
get six point for food as a product here
for $15 which is amazing for a cleansing
oil it is cottonseed oil mixed together
with argan oil beautiful beautiful oil
cleanser if you're looking for something
to remove your makeup so yeah hands down
the Sephora collection for skincare also
does make some good skincare products I
have a couple here that I want to talk
about but I wouldn't say they're amazing
now they do make some really nice
sensitive skin at facial cleansing
towelettes you can get 25 for $6 which
is cheaper than the 25 for 750 from the
Sephora collection now these ones don't
have any sense to them they're actually
really nice and moist and I do think
they remove and makeup nicely also the
regular version which comes in B pink
like the dark pink kind of pack are also
really nice those are definitely a 2 for
the Neutrogena makeup remover cost the
regular ones that come in the blue
package and then here I've also tried B
micellar water cleansing pads you get 30
of them for seven dollars
I like these for removing a face makeup
but as far as eye makeup is concerned
unfortunately they did stink up my eye
area and I wasn't really a fan now but
this are huge they actually come out
like this side kind of like those Rock
resurfacing this so they're pretty darn
big but I didn't feel like they were
alter saturated and that was just
something that kind of disappointed me
so yeah first skin care is definitely do
support collection all right as far as
beauty tools are concerned I feel like
the uLTA Beauty brand is definitely the
place to go so for our collection does
have some really really nice brushes but
I have to say the makeup blending sponge
if you o kit from Ulta oh my god you get
two little sponges for $10 I've talked
about them in my favorite sponges video
which I'll go ahead and throw up in the
cards if you'd like to check it out
those are such a do for the beauty
blender in my opinion they're very very
soft and pillowy they don't really sink
in like they don't sink in or eat up a
bunch of product I was going on trying
to say they don't eat up your foundation
is it going to the skin beautifully very
very soft the one thing that's a little
different if they're not as pointed on
the
kind of like a little egg shape so
they're a little bigger but I feel like
it covers a lot of surface area those
are absolutely fantastic they also have
some good brushes you have an angled
foundation brush from them that which
cost $18 I feel like you probably could
get a foundation brush from the Sephora
collection probably that would be a
little better this one has synthetic
bristles and although it does apply
foundation I feel like the circumference
of it it's just kind of small and it
does take a while to put your foundation
on but it's very densely packed and very
very soft and smooth and I did get that
for half off it goes around $7 during
the altar 21 days of beauty event which
is awesome and then they kind of Sonic
here like cleansing system which they do
for the Aluna pareo of like many are
just the luna for a brand in general if
you didn't know the old tube beauty
brand does not test on animals which is
absolutely fantastic so I you know
Clarisonic tests on animals ESP for Rayo
brands doesn't test on animals but
they're little devices cost like $99 and
up if this guy right here is like 40 or
50 dollars I don't personally have it in
a full size but I've tried it at my
friend's house and I tried it three days
in a row and I was amazed it is
literally identical identical to my Luna
for il many so I am definitely thinking
about going ahead and purchase me one of
those it is a little bigger and a little
bulky but it does have a little bit of a
handle on it which i think is awesome so
that is really really cool and then as
far as miscellaneous products are
concerned like brush cleansers I feel
like the Sephora collection does win
they have eat citrus brush cleaner which
is four ounces of product for $11.50
that is absolutely fantastic I'm very
very picky when it comes to cleansing up
my brushes the citrus cleanser is really
nice because first of all it smells like
citrus kind of reminds me with you so
suma scent from the body shop but second
of all it also doesn't leave my brushes
too oily leave them a little oily but
not too oily it gets all the residual
foundation out of my foundation brushes
I mean it really really deep claims
which is fantastic
and then they also have the dry clean
instant dry brush cleaner spray which
does retail for $14 this is a very easy
way to clean like I brush is very
quickly but just make sure that you do
it in a well-ventilated area because it
is an aerosol can and I don't want you
breathing in those fumes so anyway guys
those are my thoughts on these Sephora
vs. also house brain
so I feel like they're both really
really good I want to try out some more
products from the Ulta house brand but
uh yeah those are kind of my sauce so I
feel like as far as makeup is concerns
at least so for our collection for sure
wins as well as skincare but when it
comes to body care and beauty tools I
feel like Ulta is really leading the way
they're both really good let me know if
you've tried any products from the tooth
and out below and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
