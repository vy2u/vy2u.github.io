going to be my September 2016 empties I
will have another video going up for you
guys later today it is the holiday
review on the new chocolate shop palette
from Too Faced but I wanted to go ahead
and get this done because my bag is
overflowing again as always and I did
get a new bin can you guys see it
it is like Chevron printed it is white
and also he and I got a pack of two of
these on Amazon I was going to go ahead
and wait until the end of the month
since we're only like halfway through
the month for my empties and then I
would just do the two bins at once but I
feel like that videos gonna be so long
so let me know down below if you guys
think I should start to be a part 1 and
part 2 of empties because I'm starting
to think that's probably a good idea but
anyway let's go ahead and just get into
the September empties maybe next month I
will do a part 1 and part 2 alright so
the first item that I used up it was
from Sephora these are the coconut water
cleansing wipes I picked up all five of
these coconut water and not coconut
water cleansing wipes all five of the
different flavors or cents of the wipes
so this one I did like a lot if you do
have sensitive skin I think this have
worked very nicely for you it didn't
smell amazing but it was still a good
product I also used up these Sephora on
green tea exfoliating wipes I did like
these as well these are nice for a
blemish prone or acne prone skin I will
say sorry I have this freaking if you're
wondering why I'm sitting so close I
have this thing balancing on my music
stand right now and it's like making
squeaking sounds like it's going to
break anyway I use these up as well I
thought they were good I would probably
repurchase I honestly am very impressed
with all of these Sephora cleansing
wipes the only ones I really don't like
that much are the charcoal alright we
burned through a through a candle from
about Body Works as always this one is
in blueberry twist it is a mix of
whipped vanilla coconut and blueberry it
smelled really really good very very
sweet smelling so if you like those kind
of sense you would enjoy that we also
burned through sparkling waves through a
candle this is a blend of cool citrus
watery bergamot and musk this one
smelled really really good cold but
honestly like ya know when it was
burning it was just way too overpowering
like without one handle would literally
fill up the entire apartment and I'm the
kind of girl who burns like ten candles
at once and I could not handle burning
more than one candle would I have that
one burning so I don't think we would
repurchase next year here we have
kitchen spice wall flowers we have those
plugged in right now they smell amazing
would repurchase
I used up these Pacifica underarm
deodorant wipes these are odor
neutralizing with coconut milk and
essential oils you guys know I love
these I talk about them a lot they're
really really great I do think they're
nice for any time that you're just
sitting around at home and you want to
wipe down your armpits and not put do do
I not like if you're just you know
watching movies all day or something
like that I think they're fun alright I
used up the Dior we've burnt through the
suntan through wood candle this is
basket least semi fragrance a vibrant
orange blossoms bright citrus and soft
coconut musk this smelled exactly like
sunscreen but at smelling good sunscreen
I liked it it kind of smells like
Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen so if you like
that you probably would enjoy that
candle but anyway I had that in the
beauty room and I probably would
repurchase next summer alright I used up
these summer's eve ala loved cleansing
wash for sensitive skin this is pH
balanced and dermatologists and kind of
colleges tested it is for your
downstairs area I do like this one but I
prefer the new like thicker more
luxurious cleansing one I like that one
a lot more alright I used up the glam
glow super cleanse daily clearing
cleanser this is a mud to foam clear in
cleanser I do like this a lot however I
do not use it the way that they
recommend they say to put it on dry skin
and then start lathering it up with like
different like different water start
lathering it up with water um you can't
just adding more and more water I feel
like it doesn't work that way what I
like to do is use it in the shower I get
my whole face completely wet and then I
start massaging it in and then it foams
up so it smells really good very similar
to the actual glam glow clearing mud
mask so if you don't like that smell of
like licorice and kind of mint eNOS you
wouldn't like it but it is a good
product and it does help with breakouts
alright the next item I used up was the
glazed apple bath jelly this is from a
big body shop this is what it looks like
this mold really good I liked it because
I feel like Apple is one of those scents
that you can use during the summer time
you can use during the winter time it
always smells good so this was really
nice if you've never used their bath of
jellies before basically what they are
is just like a jelly and you literally
stick your hands in there and take a
little handful out and then you run it
underneath warm water and it makes
bubbles in your mouth so I liked that
and I would repurchase that I used up a
lot vanilla the healthy deodorant stick
this was in the lemon vanilla scent I
love this this is my new favorite
deodorant you guys will be seen three
more at the bottom and there's a little
bit of a backstory on those so
to that in a second we used up the
pumpkin pecan waffles these are a dual a
wallflower pack again we have these in
the living room right now they smell
amazing really really adorable I used up
a pack of these rice brightening a
facial cleansing tissues these are from
skin-food skin food did send these to me
for PR and I will be doing a full PR
honest review video next week so I'll
talk about these a little more but I did
enjoy them quite a bit there were a lot
in here you've got 80 different wipes
and I thought they worked pretty well I
wouldn't necessarily say that they like
brightened my skin but they were nice
for removing swatches this was the best
sheet mask I have ever used in my life
this is from the brand Secret Garden
this was the camellia oil on Poulet mask
so basically you have a step one system
right here by the way I think I got this
in my Ipsy bag and you have this step
for the system which is a serum you put
it all over your face and then you go in
with the sheet mask I have never had a
sheet mask fit my face so beautifully
and perfectly honestly best sheet mask
I've ever used if you know where I can
purchase the secret garden mask please
let me know down below I used up the
Garnier clean plus blackhead eliminating
scrub this was something I used in my
project pan video for the month or my
last project pan video it was just okay
would not repurchase I also used up this
OGX Sunkist blonde lemon highlight
shampoo this was also in my project pan
just okay would not be purchased I used
up the batiste dry shampoo are the
batiste dry shampoo this is the strength
and shine dry shampoo version did not
like this would not repurchase um here
are those three deodorants that I wanted
to talk to you guys about so these are
from la vanilla and I got these in a kit
from last year so I got it this year but
it was part of last year's holiday
collection I should know better than to
order something so natural that was like
part of last year's collection this was
a little trio of full-size deodorants
and you could get it for the price of
one the first scent was pure vanilla
they also had vanilla amber and vanilla
snow berry vanilla snow berry smelled
really good I feel like vanilla amber
smelled really good and then the pure
vanilla smells completely wrong and I
was like what the is going on here
like excuse my language but seriously I
would put this underneath my armpits I
tried all three of them out it was like
scraping you literally could hear the
deodorant scraping on my underarms from
using the other one which was even illa
lemon I knew something was wrong and it
just turns out that these had actually
gone bad so like I said I had purchased
them from the Sephora
so I was kind of like taking it back
because I was like oh my god like how
could they have gone bad like that's
crazy but anyway yeah they had gone bad
I did contact Sephora and they went
ahead and gave me a refund but that
totally sucked but anyway I love the lot
vanilla formula but just know that they
do go bad pretty quickly since they are
so natural alright so the next item I
used up was from Nissan this is the
special solution goodnight to white
sleeping mask this was really really
beautiful it was a very nice light and
shell consistency so if you do have oily
or combo skin I think you would really
enjoy this the scent was really nice I
feel like it did help with like
discoloration on my face which is why it
was a like whitening sleeping mask it is
a Asian skincare brand and they usually
know what they're doing with skincare so
I would repurchase I found that on
HauteLook so I feel like I would only
find it on HauteLook again so if you
ever see it on there go ahead and send
me an Instagram message or something
because I would repurchase that alright
I also used up this bare minerals
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream would not repurchase leaves me a
hot oily mask the only time I can use
this really is like in the middle of
winter if I'm super super dry that was
in my project pan video I am tossing
this blotter a sea sponge this is the
piece of we're not gonna talk about
that alright moving on a homily burns
through the islands margarita through
the candle oh one of my favorite scents
of all times during the summer time and
this is the classic scent of let's see
here mandarin sweet mango and plum with
a freshly salted rim that is what it
looks like seriously one of the best
summertime cents you can get from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works I'm not even kidding
love it so much I also used up the booty
parlor flirty little secrets this is the
luminizing body butter with pheromones
this is something that I used in my
project pan as you can see from the
little check mark there check mark oh it
smelled really good it was blackberry
honey but I don't really know like the
whole pheromones thing I don't really
know why I picked that up again another
HauteLook purchased would not repurchase
I did use this this is from skin-food
again like I said they did send me some
PR I will be doing a video next week
like I said this was the tomato
what was this oh yeah it was a facial
mask shape did not like this nothing
compared to that beautiful beautiful
Secret Garden mask that I showed you
guys that I got in my Ipsy bag I don't
feel like there sheet masks aren't that
great again I'll talk about it more in
the video but I feel like this was
following off my face
I didn't really feel like it did much
for my skin normally tomato is very high
in like
which is really really good for acne
prone skin it helps to mattify your skin
I just feel like it made my skin feel
smooth but that was it so I wouldn't
purchase that with my own money nor
would I recommend it to you guys alright
moving on I used up these Pacifica
natural skincare super detox to take
purification wipes these have kale
cucumber and mangosteen you've probably
heard me talk about these on my channel
I really like these for rubbing on my
face off smells like a smells like green
juice um but I really like these for
rubbing down my face in the morning when
I'm in a hurry right now I'm really into
the Sephora cleansing wipes um just for
basically cleansing my face in the
morning and then going in with my other
skincare but these are really really
fantastic we're great for me right in
the middle of summer because they really
did deeply clean alright um oh by the
way they're not very good at removing
makeup I feel like a lot of cleansing
wipes are actually not good at removing
makeup I mostly just use them to cleanse
my face
alright I used up the Evian facial spray
this is what it looks like this is a
really really nice little guy I like to
carry those around in my purse and
basically just put it all over my body
if I need it I used these nice flushable
moist wipes I use these to remove
squatches they're a lot cheaper than
buying they're actually cheaper than
baby wipes then on top of that they're
actually obviously a lot cheaper than
buying makeup wipes so if you're looking
for some good swatch removers the nice
flushable butt wipes it's very good
alright moving on I used up let's see
here the up enough cotton swabs these
had 300 little purple cotton swabs in
them they were great I love these for
touching up underneath my eyes because
they always get like dried mascara under
here and it just flakes right off with
those so would repurchase I used up this
L'Oreal visible lift off to blur
technology this is a what is it so yes I
concealer look at what I've done to the
front in my project pan looks like crap
um anyway this is the 301 fair concealer
I love this I would repurchase this this
is a beautiful formulation the visible
lift line from L'Oreal is overall really
really beautiful in my opinion I don't
feel like the Alaskan lasts an
incredibly long time on the skin but
they look beautiful
alright I used up a pack of these
Shiseido's facial cotton you guys know I
have basically fallen in love with these
really really nice and soft to use on
the eye area and I've also started to
use them on my face as well as I really
love them
alright I used up these Sephora Express
dry shampoo this is odor-eliminating
it's supposed to be fast fresh and clean
I thought that this was very
overpowering the scent wise and on top
of that it left a very bad boy cast so
no I would not repurchase
all right moving on okay I have to reach
in here all right I used up a little
agenda that's what it looks like I moved
on to a few more if you guys would like
to see a video on like my agendas like
my Lilly Pulitzer agendas I do have
three different agendas that I use every
single day one for work I use one for
YouTube and then I also use one for like
everyday house chores and things like
that so let me know down below if you
would like to see an organizational
video let's see here I used up the
benefit dandelions shy beam this was a
liquid matte highlight I did have this
in my project pan video would not
repurchase a full-size of that I feel
like it's basically just a color
corrector and you guys know I love my
urban decay color correcting flu it's
more so would not repurchase that I used
up the sample of the Elle Genest genius
ultimate anti-aging vitamin C serum
vitamin C really does make my stiff my
skin sting a lot I don't know what it is
I can do like lactic acid I can do
retinol but for some reason a vitamin C
really really burns on my skin I'm just
very very sensitive so that did not work
for me I would not repurchase or I would
not get another sample of it something I
would consider purchasing in a full-size
but I don't feel like I need to you is
this Codel e instant detox mask this
deeply cleanses and minimizes the pores
this is what it looks like it's a really
really nice mask but again I feel like
you can dupe it out of the drugstore so
that's why I don't feel like I need it
I'm something I would repurchase for
sure is the benefit puff off this is an
instant eye gel to help smooth the look
of puppies
it's so cute it has a wonderful
wonderful little applicator you know
there's like tiny little bits coming out
at the bottom now because there's
nothing left in there but anyway it's
got a really nice cooling tip applicator
you rub it on and it feels so good and
the actual formulation is a pretty nice
it's very very thick but it's still an
eye gel so it's cooling and then on top
of that it does have a little bit of a
pink tint so it color corrects alright
moving on I used up the Victoria's
Secret flavored lip scrub this was in
strawberry fizz I go through lip scrubs
very very quickly since I'm a flutist
and I explain my lips daily I used up a
tree hut Shea body butter in the almond
and honey scent I love the tree hut
brand you guys know this and their body
butters and also their what was I gonna
say their body butters and also of
course their body scrubs obviously are
my favorite all right so this should say
no ultimate power infusing concentrate
went bad it reeks
gonna toss that I used up the glam glow
Parma dual cleanse treatment in the mini
version I really really love that would
repurchase you guys know I'm a big fan
of glam glow I am going to toss this
cactus flower in coconut antibacterial
hand gel which gives me such a headache
I cannot stand this scent I told you
guys before like coconut and what is it
coconut and lime mixed together
sometimes I can handle it sometimes I
can't I can't do it this is the
toothpaste that Tom and I used up this
is Sarah breath plus it is a maximum
strength fresh breath toothpaste we get
this on Amazon really really like it
let's see here I've used up the coat
eliris barrel firming serum in a little
deluxe size and the last item that we
used up was a three-way candle again
Island margarita alright guys so those
were my September 2016 empties since we
are only halfway through the month if I
do have a part two to share with you
guys I will but I think next next month
what I'll just do is a part 1 and part 2
since I'll probably have two of these
bins filled up so I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I'll see you later for that
