going to be my September 2016 empties I
will have another video going up for you
guys later today it is the holiday
review on the new chocolate shop palette
from to face but I wanted to go ahead
and get this done because my big is
overflowing again as al wees and I did
get a new PIN can you guys see it huge
it is like Chevron printed it is white
and I'll so pink and I got a pack of two
of these on Amazon I was going to go
ahead and wait until the end of the
month since we're only like halfway
through the month for my empties and
then I would just do the two bins at
once but I feel like that video is going
to be so long so let me know down below
if you guys think I should start to a
part 1 and part 2 of empties because I'm
starting to think that's probably a good
idea but anyway let's go ahead and just
get into the September empties maybe
next month I will do a part 1 and part 2
alright so the first item that I used up
was from Sephora these are the coconut
water cleansing wipes I picked up um all
five of these coconut water and not
coconut water cleansing wipes all five
of the different flavors or sense of the
wipes so this one I did like a lot if
you do have sensitive skin I think this
would work very nicely for you it didn't
smell amazing but it was still a good
product i also used update sephora I'm
green tea exfoliating wipes I did like
these as well these are nice for blemish
prone or acne prone skin I will say
sorry I have this freaking you're
wondering why I'm sitting so close i
have this thing balancing on my music
stand right now and it's like making
squeaking sounds like it's going to
break anyway i used these up as well i
thought they were good i would probably
repurchase i honestly am very impressed
with all of these sephora cleansing
wipes the only ones i really don't like
that much are the charcoal all right we
burned through a through it candle from
about body works as always this one is
in blueberry twist it is a mix of
whipped vanilla coconut and blueberry it
smelled really really good very very
sweet smelling so if you like those kind
of sense you would enjoy that we also
burned through sparkling waves through a
candle this is a blend of cool citrus
watery bergamot and musk this one
smelled really really good cold but
honestly like ya know when it was
burning it was just way too overpowering
like without one handle would literally
fill up the entire apartment and I'm the
kind of girl who burns like ten
Campbell's at once and I could not
handle burning more than one candle what
I have that one burning so I don't think
we would repurchase next year here we
have kitchen spice wallflowers we have
those plugged in right now they smell
amazing would repurchase
I used up these Pacifica underarm
deodorant wife sees their odor
neutralizing with coconut milk and
essential oils you guys know I love
these I talk about them a lot they're
really really great I do think they're
nice for any time that you're just
sitting around at home and you want to
wipe down your armpits and not put
deodorant like if you're just you know
watching movies all day or something
like that I think they're fun all right
I used up the Dior we've burned through
the Sun Tan through wood candle this is
Vasquez ly sunny fragrance of vibrant
orange blossoms bright citrus and soft
coconut musk this smelled exactly like
sunscreen but it smelled like good
sunscreen I liked it it kind of smells
like hawaiian tropic Sun screen so if
you like that you probably would enjoy
that candle but anyway I had that in the
beauty room and I probably would
repurchase next summer all right I used
up these summer's eve a lo love
cleansing wash for sensitive skin this
is page balance in dermatologist and
kind of colleges tested it is for your
downstairs area I do like this one but I
prefer the new like thicker more
luxurious cleansing one I like that one
a lot more all right I used up the glam
glow super cleanse daily clearing
cleanser this is a mud to foam clear in
cleanser I do like this a lot however I
do not use it the way that they
recommend they say to put it on dry skin
and then start lathering it up with like
different like different water start
lathering it up with water um you can't
just adding more and more water I feel
like it doesn't work that way what I
like to do is use it in the shower I get
my whole face completely wet and then I
start massaging it in and then it falls
out so it smells really good very
similar to the actual glam glow clearing
mud mask so if you don't like that smell
of like licorice and kind of mint eNOS
you wouldn't like it but it is a good
product and it does help with ripe outs
alright the next item I used up was the
glazed Apple back jelly this is from a
the body shop this is what it looks like
this mold really good I liked it because
I feel like Apple is one of those sense
that you can use during the summertime
you can use during the wintertime it
always smells good so this was really
nice if you've never used their bath of
jellies before basically what they are
is just like a jelly and you literally
stick your hand in there and take a
little handful out and then you run it
underneath warm water and it makes
bubbles in your bath so I liked that and
I would repurchase that I used up a lot
vanilla the healthy deodorant stick this
was in the lemon vanilla scent I love
this this is my new favorite deodorant
you guys will be seen three more at the
bottom and
there's a little bit of a back story on
those so we'll get into that in a second
we used up the pumpkin pecan waffles
these are a duel a wallflower pack again
we have these in the living room right
now they smell amazing really really
adorable I used up a pack of these rice
brightening facial cleansing tissues
these are from skin-food skinfood did
send these to me for PR and I will be
doing a full PR honest review video next
week so I'll talk about these a little
more but I did enjoy them quite a bit
there were a lot in here you've got 80
different wipes and I thought they
worked pretty well I wouldn't
necessarily say that they like
brightened my skin but they were nice
for removing swatches this was the best
sheet mask I have ever used in my life
this is from the brand secret garden
this was the camellia oil on pull a mask
so basically you have a step one system
right here by the way I think I got this
in my Ipsy bag and you have this step
for the system which is a serum you put
it all over your face and then you go in
with the sheet mask I have never had a
sheet mask fit my face so beautifully
and perfectly honestly best sheet mask
I've ever used if you know where I can
purchase the secret garden mask please
let me know down below I used up the
Garnier clean + blackhead eliminating
scrub this was something I used in my
project pan video for the month or my
last project pan video it was just ok
would not repurchase i also used up this
oh gx sunkissed blondes lemon highlight
shampoo this was also in my project pan
just ok would not be purchased I used up
the batiste dry shampoo or the batiste
dry shampoo this is the strength and
shine dry shampoo version did not like
this would not repurchase here are those
three deodorants that I wanted to talk
to you guys about so these are from la
vanilla and I got these in a kid from
last year so I got it this year but it
was part of last year's holiday
collection I should know better than to
order something so natural that was like
part of last year's collection this was
a little trio a full-sized deodorants
and you could get it for the price of
one the first sent was pure vanilla they
also had vanilla amber and vanilla
strawberry vanilla Snowberry smelled
really good I feel like vanilla amber
smelled really good and then the pure
vanilla smells completely wrong and I
was like what the is going on here
like excuse my language but seriously i
would put this underneath my armpits i
tried all three of them out it was like
scraping you literally could hear the
deodorant scraping on my underarm from
using the other one which was even nila
lemon I knew something was wrong and it
just
thought that these had actually gone bad
so like I said I had purchased them from
the support website so I was kind of
like taking it back because I would like
oh my god like how could they have gone
bad like that's crazy but anyway yeah
they had gone bad I did contact sephora
and they went ahead and gave me a refund
but that totally stocked but anyway I
love the lab vanilla formula but just
know that they do go bad pretty quickly
since they are so natural alright so the
next item I used up was from me song
this is the special solution good night
whites leaping Mass this was really
really beautiful it was a very nice
light gel consistency so if you do have
oily or combo skin I think you would
really enjoy this the scent was really
nice I feel like it did help with like
discoloration on my face which is why it
was a like whitening sleeping mask it is
a Asian skin care brand and they usually
know what they're doing with skincare so
I would repurchase I found that on
hautelook so I feel like I would only
find it on hautelook again so if you
ever seen on there go ahead and send me
an Instagram message or something
because I would repurchase that all
right i also used up this bareMinerals
complexion rescue tinted hydrating gel
cream would not repurchase leaves me a
hot oily mess the only time I can use
this really is like in the middle of
winter if I'm super super dry that was
in my project pan video I am tossing
this blotter hace sponge this is the
piece of we're not going to talk
about that alright moving on I humbly
burns through the island margarita
through the candle oh one of my
favorites sense of all times during the
summertime and this is the classic sense
of let's see here mandram sweet mango
and plum with a freshly salted rim that
is what it looks like seriously one of
the best summertime sense you can get
from Bath and Body Works I'm not even
kidding love it so much i also used up
the booty parlor flirty little secrets
this is a luminizing body butter with
pheromones this is something that I used
in my project pan as you can see from
the little check mark there check mark
it smelled really good it was blackberry
honey but um I don't really know like
the whole pheromones thing I don't
really know why I picked that up again
another hautelook purchased would not
repurchase i did use this this is from
skin-food again like i said they did
send me some PR i will be doing a video
next week like I said um this was the
tomato what was this oh yeah it was a
facial mask shape did not like this
nothing compared to that beautiful
beautiful secret garden mass that I
showed you guys that I got in my it's
tea bag I don't feel like they're sheet
masks aren't that great again
about it more in the video but I feel
like this was following off my face I
didn't really feel like it did much for
my skin normally tomato is very high in
lycopene which is really really good for
acne prone skin it helps to mattify your
skin I just feel like it made my skin
feel smooth but that was it so I
wouldn't purchase that with my own money
nor would I recommend it to you guys
alright moving on I used up these
Pacifica natural skincare super detox to
take purification wipes these have kale
cucumber and mango steen you've probably
heard me talk about these on my channel
I really like these for rubbing on my
face I smells like a smells like green
juice but i really like these for
rubbing down my face in the morning when
I'm in a hurry right now I'm really into
the Sephora cleansing wipes I'm just for
basically cleansing my face in the
morning and then going in with my other
skincare but these are really really
fantastic we're great for me right in
the middle of summer because they really
did deeply clean all right um oh by the
way they're not very good at removing
makeup I feel like a lot of cleansing
wipes are actually not good at removing
makeup I mostly just use them to cleanse
my face alright I used up the Evian a
facial spray this is what it looks like
this is a really really nice little guy
I like to carry those around in my purse
and basically just put it all over my
body if I need it I used these nice
flushable moist wipes I use these to
remove squatches they're a lot cheaper
than buying they're actually cheaper
than baby wipes then on top of that
they're actually obviously a lot cheaper
than buying makeup wipes so if you're
looking for some good swatch removers
the nice flushable butt wipes very good
alright moving on I used up let's see
here the up enough cotton swabs these
had 300 little purple cotton swabs in
them they were great i love these for
touching up underneath my eyes because i
always get like dried mascara under here
and it just flakes right off with those
so would repurchase i used up this
L'Oreal visible lift off to blur
technology this is a what is it so yes I
concealer look at what I've done to the
front in my project pan looks like crap
anyway this is the 301 fair concealer I
loved us I would repurchase this this is
a beautiful formulation the visible lift
line from l'oreal is overall really
really beautiful in my opinion I don't
feel like the Alaskan last an incredibly
long time on the skin but they look
beautiful all right I used up a pack of
the shiseido facial cotton you guys know
I have basically fallen in love with
these really really nice and soft to use
on the eye area and I've also started to
use them on my face as well as I really
love them all right I used up these
sephora expressed dry shampoo this is
odor eliminating it's supposed to be
fast fresh and clean
they thought that this was very
overpowering scent wise and on top of
that it left a very bad boy cast so no I
would not repurchase all right moving on
oh god I have to reach in here all right
I used up a little agenda that's what it
looks like I moved on to a few more if
you guys would like to see a video on
like my agendas like my lilly pulitzer
agendas i do have three different
agendas that i use every single day one
for work i use one for youtube and then
i asked to use one for like everyday
house chores and things like that so let
me know down below he would like to see
an organizational video uhhh let's see
here I used up the benefit dandelion shy
beam this was a liquid matte highlight I
did have this in my project Pam video
would not repurchase a full size of that
I feel like it's basically just a color
corrector and you guys know I love my
Urban Decay color correcting fluid
s'more so would not repurchase that I
used up the sample of the algenis genius
ultimate anti-aging vitamin C serum
vitamin C really does make my stick my
skin sting a lot I don't know what it is
i can do like lactic acid i can do
retinol but for some reason a vitamin C
really really burns on my skin I'm just
very very sensitive so that did not work
for me I would not repurchase or I would
not get another sample of it something i
would consider purchasing in a full size
but I don't feel like I need to you is
this code alee instant detox mask this
deeply cleanses and minimizes the pores
and this is what it looks like it's a
really really nice mask but again I feel
like you can dupe it out of the
drugstore so that's why I don't feel
like I need it I'm something I would
repurchase for sure is the benefit puff
off this is an instant eye gel to help
smooth the look of Puffy's it's so cute
it has a wonderful wonderful little
applicator you there's like tiny little
bits coming out of the bottom now
because there's nothing left in there
but anyway it's got a really nice
cooling tip applicator you rub it on and
it feels so good and the actual
formulation is a really nice it's very
very thick but it's still an eye gel so
it's cooling and then on top of that it
does have a little bit of a pink tint so
it color correct alright moving on I
used up the Victoria's Secret flavored
lip scrub this was in strawberry fizz I
go through lip scrub very very quickly
since I'm a flutist and I explained my
lips daily I used up the tree hat shaped
body butter in the almonds and honey
scent I love the tree hut brand you guys
know this and their body butters and
also there um what was I going to say
their body butters and also of course
their body scrubs obviously are my
favorite alright so this shiseido
ultimate power infusing concentrate went
bad
gonna toss that I used up the glam glow
power module cleanse treatment in the
mini version really really love that
would repurchase you guys know I'm a big
fan of glam glow i am going to toss this
cactus flower in coconut antibacterial
hand gel this gives me such a headache i
cannot stand this scent I told you guys
before like coconut and what is it
coconut and lime mixed together
sometimes I can handle it sometimes I
can't I can't do it this is the
toothpaste that Tom and I used up this
is Sarah breath plus it is a maximum
strength fresh breath toothpaste we get
this on Amazon really really like it
let's see here I've used up dakota lee
resveratrol firming serum in a little
deluxe size and the last item that we
used up was a three-week handle again
island margarita alright guys so those
were my September 2016 empties since we
are only halfway through the month if I
do have a part two to share with you
guys I will but I think next next month
what I'll just do is a part 1 and part 2
since i'll probably have two of these
bins filled up so i hope you enjoyed
