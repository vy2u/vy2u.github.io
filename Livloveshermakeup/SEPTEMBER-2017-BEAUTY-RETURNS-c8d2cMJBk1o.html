my channel today I am sharing with you
guys my September 2017 a beauty returns
now you guys know if products don't work
for me I either declutter them or I go
ahead and return them so these are four
different products here that I will be
going ahead and returning to Sephora as
well as Ulta tomorrow let me go ahead
and walk you guys through them and let
you know why so the first thing we have
here is actually from the new tarts 2017
holiday collection you guys know I
always say proceed with caution
when it comes to chart releases around
the holiday season this is the got a
slope highlighter you do get a whopping
12 grams of product in here you get a
nice little package kind of thing going
on here with the beautiful mirror but I
have to say you guys this is not a good
a highlighter now we will be doing a
demo with the treasured tools brush set
which is also from the charts holiday
2017 collection tomorrow as well as
demoing this for you guys so you can
actually see how it goes onto the skin
but I find this extremely extremely
powdery it has glitter infused into it
it really emphasizes texture on my skin
and it just does not look good on me so
this is a product I am returning to
Sephora tomorrow I definitely don't like
it I would only recommend it if you want
a huge amount of product and if you have
extremely extremely oily skin because
this really does kind of just settle
into fine lines and wrinkles emphasize
texture it's extremely powdery and like
I said it's got glitter infused in there
which you guys know I'm not a fan of so
I will be going ahead and returning this
little guy right here beautiful
packaging really like the overall
concept and the amount of product you
get in here but it just wasn't for me
all right
up next we have another return that is
going back to Sephora this is actually a
foundation I have had in my collection
for I would say a decent amount of time
this is the the YSL if you should Inca
foundation of the Shi that I have here
is called b10 porcelain and like I said
I've had this in my collection for
probably well over six eight months I
could purchase this before going cruelty
free clearly but I really can't get this
to work on my skin when I first did a
first impressions on it I really didn't
like it either I felt like it looks very
patchy on my skin it really emphasized a
lot of texture a lot of like dry spots
and a lot of peach fuzz on my skin in
the first place and obviously and now
that I have even more dry skin it's
still not working out for me now
originally I thought I would go ahead
and maybe declutter it to a friend who
has really really oily skin but this is
like a $65 foundation and I'm sorry if
that sounds really
there's but I want my money back I feel
like I can get to different foundations
that are cruelty free from the drug
store or wherever for the same price as
this so I will be going ahead and
bringing that back to you so far I would
not recommend if you have more normal to
dry skin all right up next I actually
have a skincare product here and that I
hauled in my recent Ulta haul and this
is the bare minerals oil obsessed total
cleansing oil it says it's a delicate
blend of bilberry borage cucumber
sunflower oil plus mineral richest sea
salts and there are something in here
that my skin really really hates I have
not changed my skincare all week and
I've been using this three nights in a
row I've been getting those tiny little
like artificial pimples or just tiny
little bumps underneath the skin that
really looks like a skin reaction and
they're itchy and this doesn't go well
around my eye area it really really
makes my eyes water so this is something
that my skin personally is very
sensitive to I'm guessing it's the
fragrance in here it's definitely one of
these ingredients right here for sure
I'm not quite sure what it might be the
dull berry or possibly the cucumber
sometimes I am a little sensitive to
cucumber which is sort of on the rare
side cucumber is definitely one of those
things that is a little more cooling and
a little more soothing on the skin but
sometimes I'm a little sensitive so and
this is going back to Ulta unfortunately
it didn't work for me there are much
better cleansing oils out there on the
market my personal favorite currently is
definitely the Burt's Bees cleansing oil
with argan oil as well as coconut oil
infused into it I've been getting a lot
of questions recently either Burt's Bees
cruelty free and they are back to being
a cruelty free just so you guys know
they stopped selling in China which is
great all right and finally guys the
last products I have here is also
something that I recently called in my
alcohol and this is the NYX HD studio
concealer I hate this I hate this I used
it for the last time today I've been
using this three or four days in a row
and I can tell immediately this is not
something that I will reach for in my
collection I don't care if it's six or
seven dollars it's going back to the
store because I will not get use out of
it now this particular shade that I
picked up is called C zero 0 C 0 0 CW 0
2 also known as fair or Clare and I just
really don't like it it's very sticky
it's very tacky I feel like it really
really settles in do fine lines and
wrinkles underneath my eyes so I tried
using it more two spot conceal because
this guy right here gave me a bunch of
breakouts this week so I thought
go ahead and try an over here down where
I have some pimples on my chin
it also doesn't look good it looks
extremely extremely cakey so this is not
something I would recommend to you guys
it is definitely definitely not similar
to the urban decay what is it called
naked skin concealer I know I told you
guys I would do a side-by-side
comparison this is nothing like it very
sticky tacky had the formula not a fan
of whatsoever so anyway guys those are
the four products that I will be
returning to Sephora and also tomorrow I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you picked up anything that
ended up being a fail for you this month
to let me know if your gonna return it
and I guess I will see you guys tomorrow
