you at my channel oh my god I was just
outside I'm a lunch break right now
came back in it is sleeting outside I
was just outside in the sleet it is
crazy crazy miserable here today it's
very windy and gross outside so that is
why I'm wearing a little sports coat but
anyway as you can tell from the title of
the video today we are talking about
these shittiest makeup products of 2016
these are either products that released
in 2016 that I personally didn't like or
products that have released prior to
2016 that I tried out for the first time
that I didn't like all of this is makeup
if you would like a skincare edition if
you would like a haircare Edition
whatever please let me know down below
in the comments section and I will
hopefully get a video up for you guys on
that but I thought makeup would be the
thing that you guys were the most
interested in I did do a bathroom Beauty
video probably about three weeks ago so
if you would prefer to see a more happy
related video I will go ahead and link
that down in the description as well and
yeah I just want to say really quickly
most of these items are being
decluttered if you're wondering why I
still have the items that I declutter
two months ago it is because I'm not
done with my declutter series believe it
or not I still have hmmm I think I have
three more videos to do three or four
more videos to do and then I will be
boxing this up I will be mailing it
to friends who either wanted to try
these products out and I also will be
donating a huge amount of it so anyway
let's jump right into it obviously just
because these products didn't work for
me does not mean that they won't work
for you I really don't want to be
getting in like bitchy arguments with
people down in the comment section
saying that I was using the product
wrong or this or that I'm not a makeup
artist I don't do this for a living
these were just products that personally
didn't work for me a little bit of
background information I obviously am
pretty fair complected I'm 24 years old
I do have combination skin and yeah
obviously you know if you're 20 years
older than me with a deeper complexion
and dry skin we may have different you
know variations on what works and what
doesn't so let's get started we are
going to start with some foundation so
the first foundation I want to talk
about that definitely was a fail that
recently released probably about a month
ago is the L'Oreal infallible total
cover foundation I laugh when I talk
about this this was so crappy I tried it
with oils I tried it with different
primers I tried to get this to work on
my skin I did a first impressions and
during the first impressions I was like
like the way that this is going on and
then I go and look in the mirror after I
got off camera and I was like what it
just clings to dry patches even me like
with combination skin you know and you
get a little more oily in my t-zone it
clung around like my nose crevices
things like that it really emphasizes
fine lines and wrinkles even if you
don't have a ton of wrinkled I do have
fine lines I'm 24 but at the same time I
don't have deep set wrinkles this made
me look like I had deep set wrinkles so
I would not recommend this um if you
want something similar like the same
kind of coverage level and also just it
looks better on the skin I would
recommend the Rimmel stay matte
foundation but yeah this was definitely
a fail for me if you are curious I Ward
the shade 3:01 light ivory alright so
the next item here is another foundation
this is from Mac and this is something
that I finally decided to go ahead and
declutter this year this is the Studio
sculpt SPF 15 foundation the shade I
have here is NC 15 now I did the color
match to NW 10 I was stupid and I said
now I want to NC 15 the other one looked
too pink tone to me whatever this just
is a wrong color match for me first of
all second of all I don't like the way
it looks on my skin and third it makes
me break out like crazy and fourth I
don't really like the mac cosmetics
brand I will be going ahead and doing a
whole separate video on that but this
was just not something that worked for
me personally I tried it with different
oils like I tried mixing it in with oils
to make it look a little more light on
the skin it didn't work like that tried
it with multiple primers could not get
it to work so this was definitely a fail
for 2016 as far as I am concerned also
the dermablend smooth liquid camo medium
coverage foundation so I actually picked
this up because a lot of you we're
recommending it and normally I love what
you guys recommend for me unfortunately
this just did not work out the shade
that I do wear is linen it does have
titanium dioxide sunscreen so a physical
sunblock in here I thought I was going
to really like that but this was so
heavy on my skin I'm just not into that
heavy feeling really lately so I did not
personally like this again I tried it
with multiple primers tried it
throughout like the whole week and I
just feel like it's very hard to blend
into the skin even with a damp sponge or
like a buffing brush though this did not
work for me but I have heard that it
does work for a lot of people that do
have combo to oily skin so keep that in
my
here is a color correcting palette that
I did not like that release this year
this is the correct and perfect
all-in-one color correcting palette from
Stila cosmetics so I did like half of
the product but I didn't like the color
corrector so the part of this palette
that I did like were these two powders
they're very very beautiful this is more
yellow toned great for correcting like
blue tones underneath your eyes and then
the lavender powder is amazing for
brightening I absolutely adore this I
may have to go ahead and deep off that
but the actual color correctors down
here were very very oily I don't think
they had a lot of coverage they didn't
look good on the skin and they just left
me an oily mess at the end of the day so
I did not like that I also did not like
these morphe concealers these released
in 2016 the two shades that I picked up
were good excuse me bare skin and also
khaki so khaki is on top and the bare
skin on the bottom these were still too
dark for me these were the lightest
shades that they offered I don't like
morphe makeup I don't know why I
purchased these I think it was cuz it
was new and I got excited but I
personally don't like morphe makeup I
don't really like morphe as a brand I'll
get into that in another video if you
guys would like me to talk about it but
I will say I think they do have some
decent brushes I use their brushes a lot
but their makeup is just a fail for me
did not like these they were actually
very very dry and underneath the eye
area I don't feel like they offered a
lot of coverage and the color was wrong
alright let's go ahead and move on to
some eyeshadow palettes the first one
that was definitely a fail for 2016 was
the Becca Jacqueline Hale champagne
collection eyeshadow palette you may be
like why you still have this because
this was literally taken off the market
that's how shitty it was okay um the
reason why I still have this is because
I do have a friend my best friend
Rochelle who does want to try this out
so I'm gonna go ahead and declutter it
to her but this is what it looks like on
the inside you have five a different
eyeshadows in here as you can probably
tell you have two more kind of satiny
shades here and then three mattes so
when they first release this people were
either getting a really good palette or
a really shitty palette all the big
youtubers were saying it's so amazing
and it's great and then the smaller
youtubers started coming out with more
like honest reviews or non sponsored
reviews had everybody kind of thought it
was so you were either getting a
palette where you didn't like the
shimmer shades but the mattes were okay
or from what it seemed like people were
really loving the mattes or they weren't
I'm sorry people were really hating the
math and then liking the shimmer so I
got one of the palettes where the
shimmer shades were super super chunky
and unflattering on my eyes the matte
shades were okay
for the most part this is just a big
waste of money like I said most people
went and returned theirs but my best
friend did want to try this out so I
held onto it for her another eyeshadow
palette or face palette that was really
a fail this year is the nikkietutorials
to face the power of makeup I did not
like this at all nothing against
nikkietutorials or to face two faces my
favorite high-end brand and
nikkietutorials is an amazing amazing
makeup artist but this was just not good
enough I think it really wasn't the two
shades down here a highlight and bronzer
as you can see I have already hit hard
pan on those and what hard pan means is
basically you put your brush in there
and basically you get this weird oily
layer over the actual product so it's
very hard to pick up the next time you
go in I did not think those were very
good they were just so firmly pressed
the two blushes in here I will always
love you and justify my love are from
the 16-hour blush line from Too Faced I
love that formulation in full size I own
every single one of them all Stix I know
that formulation like the back of my
hand this is just not the same
formulation they did have the same color
but they were not the same formulation
and did not wear as long on my skin and
then the eyeshadows were just kind of a
hot mess I only liked three of them I
like the shade ivy painkiller and makeup
until they were quite buttery and nice
and matte shades but the rest of them
were chunky glittery patchy and
disgusting so yeah did not like that
alright moving on we have another little
Too Faced palette here this was the
peppermint mocha palette this came in
there Christmas in new york collection
this was the grand hotel cafe set so I
did like the other two something that
really bothers me about two faces that
they're just not consistent they're
really just not consistent with their
eyeshadow formulation which is really
started to bother me lately and we'll be
doing a video all about consistent
versus unreliable makeup brands where we
can really talk about brands that just
kind of like on you and they're
like no we're gonna make the formulation
different the other two pallets were
absolutely beautiful so why couldn't
they have done the same thing with this
one I just really don't understand so
you've got six different eyeshadows in
here I did not like the eyeshadows at
all however the blush down here is
beautiful very silky very pretty on the
skin again I think I will go ahead and
depop that but yeah for the most part
you guys this was just a fail and it's
like why release a little trio palette
if two of them are going to be great and
then the other one lacks pigmentation is
not as good it's not as soft and buttery
I chose
don't understand so that was a feel for
me another failed was this eyeshadow
pedicure from Smashbox so this is the
Smashbox on the rocks palette it is the
photo op eyeshadow luxe palette I love
emilina well 83 here on YouTube she
raised about the Smashbox photo op
eyeshadow formulation this is the only
time I have not like something that she
recommended honestly I think it's
because she's very very good at makeup
I'm not a makeup artist or anything like
that I just can't get these shadows to
work so this released about two years
ago but I did not actually get into this
palette until this year and I just don't
like it I think it looks amazing I love
the packaging so so so beautiful but I
find these very hard to blend they look
weird when I put them on my eye they're
very patchy and I'm just not someone who
wants to spend you know 15 minutes
blending out my eyeshadow that's just me
personally if you are someone who is
okay with that this may work for you I
see it come in and out of stock I'm
being on Ulta calm and also know just
Ulta calm so if you do want to pick it
up then you can go ahead and scoop it up
but yeah this is a feel for me I also
have this little guy right here this is
the Z palette and this is actually
filled with makeup geek eyeshadow so I'm
sure that I'm going to offend someone
when I say this that I don't mean it in
a bad way I like make a geek a lot i
like their blushes i should do a video
on the products that i do have from
makeup geek i like their blushes and i
really love their foiled eyeshadows they
are incredible but their regular
eyeshadows i don't like I really don't
like so I have a whole palette kind of
filled with them right here we have a
little Urban Decay single that I got in
my Ipsy bag I'm going to be going ahead
and decluttering this to my friend
Rochelle these remind me a lot of Mac
eyeshadows and again not a huge fan of
MAC Cosmetics for certain reasons that
I'll get into in another video but also
because I just don't like the waves of
things look on my skin I get eye
irritation I break out from their
foundations and I never have like their
eyeshadows I know so many people are a
huge fan if you are that's great but
those just didn't work for me they're
very similar to Mac eyeshadows I
definitely prefer her more um foiled
eyeshadow collection all right next we
have the Too Faced matte chocolate chip
palette so this released sometime in
what late November early December last
year and it's really really cute I mean
look at it it is a really cute little
palette yep it definitely smells like
chocolate I did get the white chocolate
palette and also this one and this one
is just not good in my opinion
now most people are feeling the other
way around so a lot of people hate the
white chocolate and they prefer this one
for me personally I'm going to be
declutter this to a friend who does have
a darker complexion I think this would
be really nice on her she doesn't mind
like blending after eyeshadows for a
while but I don't know these were just
chalky I did feel like they were quite
pigmented but they were hard to blend
out again I'm just not a person who
likes to sit there blending my
eyeshadows forever the white chocolate
palette worked for me probably because
I'm very fair and I'm you know cool
complected I just feel like that palette
works really nicely on me so again I
feel like if you have a darker
complexion you would probably like this
one as long as you don't mind blending
out your eyeshadows if you are very fair
I think you would like the white
chocolate palette so anyway this was
definitely a fail for me the next one we
have here is the Christmas in New York
the chocolate shop palette again this
was from the Christmas in New York
collection from Too Faced and this is
the first one I picked up and when I did
my review I was like they're okay like
they're not too bad I think I'm gonna
hold on to it and then they released the
macarons palette and then they also
released the Grand Hotel cafe set and I
was like oh no I'm not holding on to
this so this is what it looks like on
the inside you do get about 21 or 24
different eyeshadows you are getting a
highlight a bronzer and also a blush my
two favorite shades in here were
indulgent also sugared raisin I really
don't feel like I need this anymore
because those two shades are in the
white chocolate palette but also inner
light was a pretty highlights I love the
shade down here for blush I may go ahead
and do pot a few of these but I feel
like if you're someone who really again
is not a makeup artist you don't want to
spend a lot of time blending out your
eyeshadows this is not the palette for
you you do have to put in more effort
and more time with these and again I'm
just kind of pissed off because I'm like
two-face why can't you just make the
same formulation throughout kind of like
with the matte chocolate chip palette
I'm like you know what like why isn't
this like the chocolate bar formulation
if you're going to release a little mini
version it should be like the chocolate
bar formulation which I don't feel like
the white chocolate chip or the matte
chocolate chip are identical to the big
chocolate bar palette if you're curious
but yeah I just felt like these were
hard to blend again color selection is
just kind of black in my opinion I feel
like two-face has been doing the same
thing over and over and over again so I
really wasn't too impressed with this
and yeah I'm going to go ahead and let
that go alright let's go ahead and talk
about some face palette shall we the
first one is actually one that I'm
holding on to for now I'm going to try
this this eye shadow this is the tarte
big blush book too
another really inconsistent brand I feel
like Tarte cosmetics really needs to get
their together excuse my language
but I just cannot believe some of the
stuff that they have been doing this
year like some of their palates have
just been absolute crap so this is the
big blush book - this was about $60 and
I got so excited I thought I was getting
such a steal now I'm sorry but this
formulation of these blushes this is
nothing like the true Amazonian clay
12-hour blush and they are very very
powdery which if you are a fan of the
Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes that come
in the palettes like The Tortoise one or
the Holliday palettes or even just the
singles you know that they are a little
more firmly pressed but very pigmented
silky they go on to the skin nicely they
stay on a long time these do not wear a
very long time at all they're very
powdery they're just not what I expected
and I was really pissed that you know
they put this palette together in China
probably cost him $10 to put together
again I don't know that for a fact but
they sold it for $60 and they made you
think that you were getting these
full-size blushes that were going to be
absolutely incredible and at the end of
the day it was like no no these are
crappy so I'm going to try them out as
eyeshadow again I spent like $60 so I
don't want to go ahead and declutter it
quite yet - but you may see this in a
declutter pile soon all right the next
item is also from Tarte again I just
feel like they've been releasing a lot
of stuff that I haven't liked lately
this is the Tartus Pro glow palette so
this is what it looks like and on the
inside you are getting four different
highlights and then you are getting two
different kind of like contouring
products so my first complaint is
definitely the fact that this is a cream
contour there is no little flap to cover
it up to separate it from the powders I
really don't like that I'm messy when I
put on my makeup like no shame I'm
totally messy so all of the powder
started to get in there and it started
to dry out already like it's a very dry
formula now it was very creamy when I
first got it but now it's already dried
out I did not like the shades strobe lit
or a fire I felt like they were very
very chunky I feel like they wanted to
release a new highlighting formulation
and it just didn't come out that great
the strobing powder right here this one
which is a true highlight on my
particular skin tone unfortunately does
have chunks of glitter in it and is just
not flattering on the skin the only two
things that I really liked in this
palette that I may go ahead and kind of
deep pot are the stunner shade right
here which is honestly the reason why I
bought this palette it is one of the
most unique beautiful highlights I have
ever seen this has a really nice foiled
sort of appearance on the skin reminds
me a lot of the Anastacio Beverly Hills
glow kit formulation
the others like I said are very chunky
and then this little guy down here which
is called sculpted this is the powder
this reminds me a lot of the two-faced
milk chocolate Soleil or just the
chocolate Soleil bronzer so those two
are good but again when you're paying
for a palate it's like well if only two
of the products work out of all six like
why am I going to hold on to it so
unfortunately that was quite
disappointing to me as well also this
little guy here from Urban Decay this is
the naked flushed palette this one is in
the shade in native I have talked about
this before in a product sales video I
really don't like the way this looks on
my skin I did pick up two of them and
they both had like a very orange e
bronzer it doesn't look good on my skin
I don't feel like the highlight is very
very pigmented and then the blush was
pretty much the only pretty thing but
it's like again you know if you only
like half of the palette what's the
point of keeping it so I didn't like
that I think a lot of people jumped on
that because those recently went on sale
in 2016 they were like $15 and that's
why I bought it but I'm kind of I regret
doing that yeah another item here from
Tarte cosmetics this is the kiss and
blush cream cheek and lip palette so
this is something that I actually really
like and I want your opinion right now
please go down in the comment section
and let me know what I should do this is
what it looks like on the inside now I
never was wearing these as blushes when
I did my review I told you guys I'm
going to use this exclusively at the lip
palette and that is what I was doing but
unfortunately these have dried out
extremely like they are literally hard
as a rock
I've had this open for probably 2 or 3
months um even when I put oil in them
and try and mix them together they don't
look good on my lips they used to have a
really nice satiny appearance again if
you go back and look at my review video
really like this palette I tried taking
a blow-dryer to them kind of warming
them up heating them up I even pop this
in the goddamn microwave and it still as
hard as a rock so I would love to know
if you guys have any sort of technique
that I can use to kind of get these to
be more wearable and you know usable
again but for the most part to the fact
that this dried out in two to three
months pisses me off so it's a fail and
we have another product here from Tarte
- this is the skin twinkle volume 2
lighting palette so this is also a new
release excuse me sorry guys really I
have something in my throat anyway this
is also a new release I loved the skin
twinkle lighting palette Volume one I
was a huge huge fan so when this release
I jumped on it right away it recently
released in the past month
and unfortunately this is the same sort
of formulation as
chunky highlights in the torch's pro
glow palette it is not my cup of tea
they go on just really chunky they look
absolutely horrible on the skin in my
opinion I don't know why anybody would
want to wear these those are one finger
swipes watches hopefully you guys can
see the grittiness going on there what I
do like is that they are very pigmented
but you still need something that's
going to be wearable and buildable on
the cheeks you can never go and build
this up because it's just going to be
too much product so I did not like the
formulation on that and finally we are
going to end with the Too Faced sweet
peach below a palette so this recently
released I will say it's growing on me a
little bit
I'm not going to declutter it quite yet
but I will say overall the sweet peach
collection just another huge link it was
just such a huge fail from Too Faced I
feel like they really didn't do a good
job releasing this whole collection in
my opinion there were just so many
mistakes made but I really only like to
highlight in here this is absolutely
beautiful it's very unique very very
pretty on the skin the more I wear it
the more I like it but the blush topper
and this little bronzer over here this
is very very orange e this is nothing
special I'm just kind of like I wish
that the whole palette was just the big
highlight so yeah that's the only reason
I will be keeping it I may go ahead and
deep pop that and then just you know
donate this or give it to a friend if
they want the blush or the bronzer shade
but for the most part not super
impressed with this I feel like
everybody was obsessed with the sweet
peach collection I didn't like the
eyeshadow palette don't really like this
I thought the papadum peach blush was
pretty done good if you want one thing
from the collection I would get the lip
oils so anyway guys that is it I feel
like I've been talking for a letter like
20 minutes which I have so I hope this
video was helpful I hope that you did
enjoy it thank you so much for joining
me guys and I will see you tomorrow for
a what's new at the drugstore video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
