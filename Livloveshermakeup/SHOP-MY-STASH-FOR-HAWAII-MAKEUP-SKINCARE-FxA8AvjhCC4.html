channel thank you so much for joining me
today I obviously have shot my stash for
you guys but it is going to be a little
bit of a different shot my stash I'm
gonna be sharing with you guys the
products that I will be taking to Hawaii
with me as far as skincare and makeup is
concerned Tom and I leave for Hawaii on
Thursday we're gonna be gone for ten
days we are going to be celebrating
Valentine's Day as well it's just thirty
second birthday so we're super super
excited I will have a video going up
every single day while I am gone so you
don't have to worry about that but yeah
I put everything in this little Sephora
box here let's go ahead and just get
right through it shall we
so the first item that I will be
bringing is the Neutrogena ultra sheer
body mist sunscreen and this is a
chemical sunblock which normally I like
a physical sunblock just because it
doesn't make me break out and it is
better on my sensitive skin or I guess I
get extra sensitive when I'm in the side
but this does have SPF 100 plus and
there's not that big of a difference
between like an SPF 50 and an SPF 100
literally like a 1% difference but I
need that one percentage because I
really do get bad burns on my body
because of my lupus if I do get burned
so anyway I'm going to be using that it
just comes in a nice spray bottle as you
guys can see I also will be bringing my
Stila starlight Starbright highlighting
pallets when I reviewed this over the
holiday season I talked about how nice
this would be during the summertime and
if you're taking like a vacation to the
tropics so this is what I will be using
for eyeshadow as well as highlighting
and bronzing so right here we have the
shade bronze in the middle is the shade
kitten and then transcendence is that
beautiful light pinky cool toned color
so I just thought that would be a great
palette to take with and then I also
will be bringing this little daily
concept exfoliating body scrubber with a
little mini body wash I know that we're
staying at the ritz-carlton hotel I'm
sure that they will have body washes
there for us to use but I just I did
want to bring like something extra
because after a day of wearing sunscreen
all over my body I really want to scrub
it off at the end of the day just
because I do tend to get breakouts and
things like that from sunscreen so this
I got in my pet sugar must-have box this
past month and then I thought I would
bring the body shops Fuji green tea
shower gel and that is just a little
mini that I got any holiday set alright
as far as brushes are concerned I
thought I would take this little
Charlotte Tilbury brush set now I got
this for PR and honestly I don't think
they're that great quality but I won't
be wearing a ton of makeup obviously I'm
going to Hawaii
like I don't need to be wearing makeup
everyday
but they do have four different brushes
in here that I thought would be really
easy to use so that is the little brush
set I will be bringing and then I am
going to decant this little guy into a
little squeeze bottle this is the
Brazilian boom boom or bum bum cream I
also got this sent for PR and I don't
notice the difference with firming this
is supposed to be that like ultra
firming body creme what I do notice is
that it does give a little bit of a
sheen to the skin because it does have
like not glitter particles but it has
shimmer particles in there and I also
just smells amazing like a really
tropical kind of vacation destination so
I just thought it would be perfect to
bring with me as my actual body lotion
or body creme for that particular visit
obviously this one is not super super
moisturizing so it will be perfect when
we're in Hawaii since that is a very
tropical climate and then I also will be
bringing this right here this is the
Urban Decay Naked skin one and done
hybrid complexion Perfector this does
have SPF in it as well
it is SPF 20 and normally I would bring
a stick foundation that's just like what
I that's just what I personally like to
do what I am traveling because you don't
have anything liquidy you don't have to
worry about if it's going to explode
when you're on the plane or anything
like that so I didn't want to bring it
back this time because the one that I
would bring is the Anasazi Beverly Hills
stick foundation and to be completely
honest that one it would just be a
little too much coverage for me I feel
like for Hawaii I just want something
really really quick and easy so I'm
gonna bring this little guy and the
shade is called light it is a little
dark on my skin and I probably will be
getting a little bit even if it's more
of a sunburn I will be getting hopefully
a little bit of Sun so I felt that this
would match me quite well and it's just
really nice and lightweight and easy to
wear and then I also will be decanting
this little guy right here this is the
Revlon Eterna 27 mooster cream it does
have progenitor in it I just wanted
something that didn't have any sort of
retinol or a a chase on it because I
will be bringing my Peter Thomas Roth
unwrinkled heel pads I also do you can't
these I just travel with them in a
little ziploc bag but I wanted something
that isn't going to make me Sun
sensitive because even if I were in
retinol at nighttime I really have to
make sure the next day that it's
completely off my face or I will get Sun
sensitive so I just thought I would
bring a very basic day cream and I've
had this in my collection for ever like
I said the unwrinkled peel pads I just
taken the amounts that I need so I'm
gonna take ten of them and put them into
a little plastic baggie I love the
can't live without them but I will
eventually have to because I will not be
repurchasing since theater Thomas Roth
is not a cruelty-free brand all right
here we have the love vanilla the
healthy deodorants I just picked up a
new one this is my all-time favorite -
deodorant - they are cruelty free I
believe they are vegan and also they are
just 100 percent healthy they don't have
any sort of aluminum in them if you do
have lupus you should be very careful
with aluminum so anyway this particular
scent is vanilla grapefruit and it
really does smell good so I love this
obviously have to bring a deodorant with
me if I'm gonna be in a tropical a
destination because I sweat like a mofo
and then as far as blush is concerned I
will be bringing my little Smashbox la
Lights blush and highlight palette at
first I was like do I really need this I
mean I can probably just bring and they
steal a palette and be good to go but I
thought this was nice it is super super
compact you have this shape right here
which is called rich pink and then you
have true pink and then you have a
highlighting shade which can also double
as an eyeshadow so on those nights where
we do go out and we're doing something
really special I thought I could use
that let's see here as far as cleansing
is concerned in the morning I thought I
would use this little torch friction
stick I got this in my Sephora play box
this month it is an exfoliating cleanser
and basically it just comes in stick
form which is great for travel so you
just kind of put it up like this and
then you massage it onto your damp skin
and then you rinse it off and it does
seem to work quite well I believe it has
a little bit of charcoal in there as
well which is good for it my breakout
prone skin and then at night time I
thought I would use this little sample
of these Chanel essential comfort
cleanser so this is what it looks like I
just thought after a long day in the Sun
this would be really really delicate and
nice on my skin and then as far as like
face and moisturizer is concerned I will
be using the Neutrogena age shield face
oil-free lotion this does have SPF 110
in it so this is what it looks like I
will let you guys know what this works
out for me again it is a chemical
sunblock which normally I don't do well
with chemicals Sun blocks but I know a
lot of you are curious about a breakout
free lotion so I'll keep you updated on
that and then I will be bringing this
little dry shampoo and this is a little
deluxe size and it does say that it is
air travel friendly I am NOT packing a
carry-on there's just no way and how I
can tie I could never do a carry-on you
guys I pack away too much with me
but we will be checking our bags but I
thought this would be the perfect little
dry shampoo to bring with and then as
far as taking my makeup off
concerns I will be using this little
deluxe ice sample of the Clinique take
the day off cleansing balm what
repurchase this because I mean most of
the items I'm sure you guys are just
items that have been sitting on my
collection that are not cruelty free but
this one definitely isn't but I just
have the tiniest bit left and like I
said I will be wearing makeup every day
so I thought I would bring that for when
I do want to rinse it off and then I do
have a daytime lotion because Tom's
going to forget his this is the
resveratrol face lifting moisturizer
with SPF 20 if you guys didn't know
Thomas Chinese he already has like a
deep tan going on so he definitely
doesn't need to be wearing like an SPF
110 like I do so I'll be using the
Neutrogena as my face lotion as well as
sunscreen he really only needs like an
SPF 220 because he doesn't burn alright
and then I have the they're real tinted
primer this is a tinted lash primer it's
basically just a brown mascara
I love the they're real mascara I'm
wearing the black version today on my
lashes and I just thought the brown
version would be a little more subtle
and nice so I'm going to be bringing it
back to its my mascara and then on the
nights where it is his birthday and also
Valentine's Day I'm gonna bring a little
sample of a lip product if this is the
new lip magnet um what is this called I
think it's just a liquid lipstick this
is from shore to our money I got a
little sample of it it's a true red
shade and we shall see how this goes I
just thought you know what Valentine's
Day I have to be wearing a red lip like
it wouldn't be Valentine's Day without a
red or pink lip so that is what it looks
like super excited to try it out I will
definitely give you guys my thoughts on
that when I am on my vacation I will
snapchat and let you guys know how it
works and then as far as perfume is
concerned I did want to include this I
thought I would bring my taco Simone
perfume this is actually something that
I got in a little set over the holidays
it is a spray version which is awesome
and this Simone scent is very very
beachy so I thought it would be perfect
for Hawaii and then as always I will be
bringing my overnights lash treatment so
this is the cargo lash activator gel I
think they are discontinuing this which
is not okay with me because this is how
I get my lashes to look this good and so
anyway I will be finishing that up and
I'm really really disappointed if they
do not like if they just continue this I
don't know what I'm gonna do
alright and then I do have an eye cream
here this is themed 100% pure coffee
bean caffeine eye cream and now this was
sent to me in exchange for an honest
review from octa Lee as well as the 100%
pure brand a lot of you have been
telling me to check
the hundred percent pure brand I
eventually want to stop accepting PR
that is not cruelty free like I only
want to accept I'm sorry I only want to
accept PR that is cruelty free so I
believe they are cruelty free and I just
wanted to try this out it's a really
tiny little too perfect for travel so I
will use that in the morning and at
nighttime and then I thought I would
bring the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil in the shade muse which is just a
really a nice kind of soft brown color
it will go perfectly with that barely
there sort of makeup thing that I'm
going to be doing so there is the shade
muse and then let's see here as far as
powder is concerned in this month's
Sephora play box if you got it the
dermablend loose setting powder was
something that we received and I thought
this would be the perfect travel size of
for powder because let's be honest like
I said not gonna be wearing a ton of
makeup when I'm there so I'm gonna be
bringing that and then finally I will be
bringing a little deluxe eye sample of a
mask this is from origins this has been
in my collection forever and I just
never reach for it cuz I'm not a huge
fan of this mask it is the clear
improvement active charcoal mask to
clear pores I don't like the way it sits
on my skin personally but it does help
to clear out my pores at nighttime so I
thought I would bring that since it is
so tiny so anyway that is all this skin
care and makeup that I will be using
when we are in Hawaii I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
