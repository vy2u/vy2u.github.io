my channel today I have a splurge or
purge a video to share with you guys yet
another one now this one is a pre film
so I did want to let you guys know if
there are any new makeup releases that
pop up between the time that I am
filming this and the day that you guys
are seeing it I will go ahead and paint
a comment down below and I will let you
guys know if I'm interested in
purchasing the product or not and that
way these videos are inspired by my
friend Samantha March here on YouTube
she does a series every single Wednesday
called will I buy it where she talks
about a new makeup releases and if she
is going to purchase them or not so I'll
go ahead and throw her channel as well
as her playlist up in the cards but
anyway without further ado let's jump
right into it so we have a new release
here from Becca cosmetics and it's
actually a whole new collection and I'm
quite excited and this is called the
ocean jewels collection it includes a
skin intuitive lip gloss as well as a
highlighter palette as well as an eye
shadow palette now I can tell you right
away I'm not interested in the eye
shadow palette I'll pop up a picture
here so you guys can see it it looks
incredibly basic to me and very very a
boring a typical Becca the only thing
that excites me there is probably the
little lavender kind of shade but
overall not interested in the eye shadow
palette however the highlighting palette
has really caught my eye take a look at
these colors you guys and this is very
much something and that I feel like that
guy is stepping outside of their comfort
zone with and I really do like the
overall color selection I love the
packaging I think it looks beautiful my
only thing that's kind of holding me
back from wanting to purchase this is I
feel like the pants Isis look very small
almost like it would be hard to get your
brush in there but I'm pretty damn sure
I'm gonna pick this up as well as the
skin intuitive lip gloss they skin
intuitive lip glow glosses $25 it says a
customized pink shade a lip gloss so
that enhances the natural color of your
lips with the ultimate high shine finish
it reacts to the natural chemistry of
your lips I'm blooming into it you're
perfect kind of color and now if you
guys are curious the eyeshadow palette
is $35 like I said I'm not gonna be
purchasing that but the highlighter
palette is going to retail for $46 it is
a limited edition and you get five
different shimmering skin perfecter
press in there so I'm very interested
Glaus and i am very interested in the
highlighter palette but when it comes to
the eyeshadow palette i'll be passing
all right guys moving on we have some
new products here from colour-pop the
first are their Lux lipsticks these
actually look very interesting to me I
feel like the price is right on these so
I'm gonna go ahead and take a look at
them I don't feel like I need a ton of
new lipsticks in my collection
personally but the one item that did
really catch my attention is actually
this new eyeshadow palette now this is
called the give it to me straight
palette I believe it's gonna be priced
in the fifteen dollar price range like
their other eyeshadow palettes it will
be available at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard
Time on January 25th and it is a palette
with browns of berry and plummet tones
so I feel like they can't go wrong with
this kind of a color selection you know
you have the warm tone shades for the
warm tone lovers you have the cool tone
shades for the cool tone lovers you have
a mix of different finishes here it
looks like you have some glitter and to
use finishes for whoever likes litter a
fuse photo shoots you also have some
shimmers as well as some matte so I
think this looks beautiful and like I
said I'll take a look at the lipsticks
and the color selection I personally
don't feel like I need new lipsticks at
this time but the color pop I've shadow
palette they give it to me straight
definitely gonna be purchasing at that
one alright guys now here are some
lipsticks that I'm very interested in
really for only one reason these are the
new Astrology lipsticks from by beauty
I'm a Leo and I'm hoping that they are
going to be coming out with some sort of
a fiery red color for Leo so I'm gonna
hang around and kind of pick up that one
when it releases I have no idea when it
will actually be releasing but they have
already released the Aquarius by beauty
lipstick these are the a moose blush
formula which I absolutely love they're
creamy they're pigmented and they're
easy to wear I will definitely probably
pick up a previous as well as a Leo but
besides that I'm gonna leave it the
other ones B but yeah these look
absolutely beautiful you guys on the
20th every month they will launch a new
shade of based on the month star sign so
that is going to be something that I'm
definitely going to be picking up are
you guys up next we have the christine
dominique and dose of colors eyes shadow
palette I'm actually really interested
in this now I now follow her YouTube
channel I follow her on Instagram mainly
because she's hot she makes all
my bisexual tendencies come out like I'm
sorry the girl is gorgeous but I
think she's great at makeup I think
she's a really beautiful girl but I will
say there was something about this
eyeshadow palette there really catches
my attention
I wouldn't necessarily say it's super
super cohesive but the colors in there
are drying I like are drawing me in
I really like the row of mats on the top
even though they are a little more warm
toned and I love the cool tone shades on
the bottom especially the magenta and
the blue so this is something I'm
interested in it's going to be 42
dollars it's cruelty for you and it will
be releasing on January 20 of 4th so
that's pretty damn cool I think I'm
gonna pick that up are you guys moving
on we have a shadow palette here from
Milani we actually have two of them
these are their new eyeshadow palettes
and they look pretty damn good to me
one of them is completely mattes one of
them is a shimmers these do retail for
$20 which you may be thinking that's a
lot for the drugstore but I personally
am interested in probably purchasing
both of these I feel like if I do
purchase both of these I probably won't
purchase the color pop palette but if I
choose not to purchase this one then I
will get the color pop palette I just
don't need that many of you I shadow
palettes in my collection and I'm kind
of at that point where I'm like I
have every color ever you know but I'm
so interested in these I love that
they're coming out with eyeshadow
palettes like this absolutely beautiful
packaging reminds me a lot of these
Stila palettes so yes these are
definitely on my radar we'll see if I
can find them in store that's gonna be
the most difficult task but I'd yeah I
would appreciate the new Marc Beauty
shameless youthful 24-hour long wear
foundation there are going to be 29
different shades a lot of people are
saying that this is going to be very
skin-like it's going to be kind of like
the Marc Jacobs genius gel foundation if
you did not know Marc Jacobs is a
cruelty for you a brand at least our
beauty products are so I am very
interested in this I feel like the shade
selection looks really really good we
need to see obviously some more swatches
but so far so good
29 releases 29 different shades right
off the bat this looks really beautiful
it seems like it's gonna be long wearing
as well as have a medium solid coverage
for the skin and it's going to be semi
at like Demi matte glowy kind of thing
so I'm excited for that does that make
sense semi matte Demi glowy it's gonna
be a dummy Matt it's gonna be a Demi
matte finish and I said in my video all
about like makeup trends that I want to
see for this year I said I would love to
see some Demi matte foundations because
people that have really oily skin are
gonna love that people of really dry
skin are gonna love that because he can
get some matte
you can get some coverage but I also
have a little more of a skin like finish
to it are you guys and then finally we
have the Anasazi of Beverly Hills soft
glam eyeshadow palette I'm gonna
surprise you guys with this one but I am
NOT purchasing at this palette I'm just
not interested they did say that it's
going to be at the modern renaissance a
formula and it is something that you can
pair together with all of your Anasazi
beverly hills palettes which i think is
great
but i would honestly rather just
purchase the two other Milani palettes
instead of this one because this is
incredibly basic to me you do have a lot
of newest shades in here but then you
also do have a lot of existing shades
that are put in here if you're new to
makeup if you want a good goddamn
eyeshadow palette that's gonna be easy
to blend as well as probably have a
really really nice pigmentation to it I
would recommend checking this out again
I can't say too much about it because I
don't have it but I have heard that it
is identical to the modern renaissance
formula or at least that is what novena
has said which is awesome so it will be
available in a March in stores trend
mood says right here we will keep you
updated but yeah that's pretty much it
guys like I said I'm not gonna pick that
one up I'm just not interested the
colors are not catching my attention to
a much a little too washy and light for
me even though I recently said I was
really into those kind of colorful
pastel sort of shades these are all kind
of like Browns and neutrals and that's
not really what I'm going for right now
so anyway guys that is it for this video
thank you so much for joining me for
this lurch or perch I hope you enjoyed
this thank you so much let me know if
you're gonna pick these products up down
below and I will see you guys tomorrow
