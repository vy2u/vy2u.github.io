channel happy Saturday thank you so much
for joining me today I'm going to be
walking you guys through another will I
buy it or splurge or purge video
featuring some new to face collections
because the new chocolate gold
collection there's a few items that have
caught my attention and then also I
thought at this time I go ahead and talk
about the two-faced life is a festival
collection which is basically kind of
like a unicorn collection because so
many people have been asking me about it
so anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into the video if you have never seen a
boy led by a video before my friend
Samantha March here on YouTube actually
created this series where she kind of
walked through every single Wednesday
knew what makeup releases and she'll let
you know she's gonna purchase it or not
so if you would like to see the original
creators videos I'll go ahead and link
her check her channel bit per channel as
well as her will I buy a playlist down
below I hope you guys will go over and
set her some love because this is a
great series and I really enjoy it
so anyway let's go ahead and start with
the you at Too Faced gold collection so
the first thing I want to say is that
this has 5 big releases that will be
coming out in the collection I believe
they're also going to be coming out with
some lip products but there are 5 big
items that are coming and releasing that
I know a lot of you have been curious
about this will be online at Too Faced
on November 28th online at Ulta beauty
for pre-order on December 3rd and online
in in-store at both Sephora and Ulta on
December 11 so those are kind of the
dates for the collection let's go ahead
and talk about it I think we should
start with the palette first so as you
guys can probably see it the palette is
basically a chocolate bar palette this
is called the chocolate and gold bar
palette it says that it is a metallic
matte eyeshadow palettes made with 100%
natural cocoa powder and real gold it
does retail for $49 it says take
decadence to the next level with a
luxurious gold and cocoa powder infused
eyeshadow palette this smells as good as
it looks happy needs your metallic
moment with foils shadows that are
created with real gold for an epic eye
shine finish that's paired with rich
seductive mattes for coffee to cocktails
to wear okay so I didn't know it was
infused with gold I think that's kind of
silly but you know what guys this is
really catching my attention as Samantha
would say I definitely had a double take
I had a triple take even a quadruple
take when it came to this palette so I'm
gonna have to go ahead and say splurge
I'm a little worried
when you look at the swatches which I
will insert a photo here of the swatches
and they almost look too good to be true
and you guys know what I mean I feel
like two-face really just hasn't really
been releasing the best quality products
lately but I will say a lot of their
chocolate bar palettes are
amazing so for me it there's a huge part
of me that wants to pick this up I know
that most of these are shimmer that's
very in right now to release all
metallus eyes or all kind of glitter
infuse shades now I'm hoping that none
of these are really truly glitter
infused a few of them look like they
have a little more Sparkle than the
others but for the most part they look
very foiled and very beautiful and then
you are getting four different mattes in
care so cocoa truffle which is the deep
chocolate brown is matte then you're
getting decadent which is a matte black
you're getting so boule brulee I can't
even read it I think it says so boule
and that one is a really really
beautiful kind of toffee shade that's
gonna be a transition that's matte and
then also rolling in the dough which is
like a brown bone shade so you know what
I'm gonna have to say splurge on this
one I want to try it out I think I will
wait tell I can order it from Ulta or
Sephora and I will give you guys my
reviews just in case the piece of I
will go ahead and return it just because
you know it's really hard with Too Faced
right now because a lot of their
products are still really good and then
some of their newer products are not so
good but I trust their chocolate bars
they are good formulas I overall have
always been impressed with their
chocolate bar palette so I'm gonna go
ahead and say splurge for the new
chocolate gold eyeshadow palette
are we moving on to the diamonds
highlighter this is another one that I
took a double take at triple take and a
quadruple take at this retails for $34
it doesn't seek multi use diamond fire
highlighter that you can actually use on
your body as well as your face and this
one-of-a-kind highlighter is infused
with real crushed diamond powder I just
don't notice there are they trying to
sound like classy or something because
I've never thought that Too Faced has
been a classy brand they've been a very
cutesy brand but never really a classy
brand you doesn't know what I'm saying
but anyway it says light reflecting
pearls to create a rainbow diamond fire
glow like you've never seen a light up
your complexion with a pure radiance
that works on any skin tone so we're on
the blue gold and pink shades which I
don't know if you guys can tell in the
swatches photo but they have like this
really iridescent kind of undertone it
says just swirl them all together for a
custom
highlight that can be used anywhere on
the body or the face the liquid to
powder formula that kind of makes me
nervous the liquid to powder formula is
hand poured ensuring that no two
highlighters will ever look the same
just like a real diamond so I like the
concept I think the packaging looks a
little cheap it kinda reminds me of like
the gold bar from Charlotte Tilbury like
cheap cardboard packaging but this is
another one that like I said it really
caught my attention I want to give it a
go so I'm gonna have to say splurge on
this one as well all right guys moving
on it to the new chocolate gold soleil
bronzer I was very surprised that this
was a bronzer when I originally sought
swatch on tread moots Instagram I first
heard that it was just like a dark gold
kind of highlight this four toes were
$30 it says our best-selling chocolate
soleil bronzer just went gold bathe your
skin in a golden bronze glow with this
cocoa infused powder created with real
shimmering called his smells like a
chocolate dream I'm really not
interested in this I think this is the
very interesting shade this is not gonna
be a bronzer for the majority of skin
tones out there it could be a true
highlight but then again it would be too
dark as a highlight for later fair skin
so if you do want a really really
shimmery bronzer and you have a fair to
light complexion I could see you
enjoying this possibly but if you do
have a medium to deep complexion this
would be more of a highlight I don't
know you guys this is not getting me
excited so I'm gonna have to go ahead
and say purge on that one next up we
have the melted gold liquefied gloss lip
gloss I'm sorry liquefied gold lip gloss
this retails for $21 this also did catch
my attention
it says drench your lips in a sexy
decadence of gold it says our liquid
foil formula takes on new life as a
turned-up epic hi glitter lipped
movement moment with any light shines on
it it's buildable easy to wear and
infused with real gold we get it we get
it raised the gold bar by applying two
to three layers of the melted gold for
maximum shine and decadence that's
ridiculous it should be full pigment
right on I'm definitely not gonna
purchase this it definitely did catch my
attention initially because the swatch
that I saw on trend moods Instagram that
look like she had really built it up now
a funny funny enough I had it this a
product from bite Beauty probably about
a year ago is one of their like gold
creme lip glosses I loved the way it
look but I seriously felt like I look
like a cheap hooker when I have it on my
like not gonna lie just the gold with
all the sparkles and iridescent badger I
can hear you he's scratching on the door
are you being a bad boy anyway what I
was saying was that little white beauty
creme lip gloss I just really didn't get
a lot of use out of it it did not look
good on me so I'm gonna have to say I
will go ahead and purge on this
particular lip gloss and then finally
guys we have the pure gold loose of the
litter this retails for seventeen
dollars which I personally feel like is
a little pricey for a loose glitter I
don't know I mean some people might
think that this was a good price but for
me I think it's a little pricey it says
real gold we get it it's infused in this
ultra fine and loose glitter for a
buildable formula that can be used as a
highlighter eyeshadow on lips or
anywhere else that you want to create a
highlight impacted a gold finish now
that better be eye safe and it better be
lip safe if people are gonna use it
there I'm sure it is but yeah this
really isn't catching my attention
either I'm not a loose glitter kind of
girl you guys I never ever have been
it's just totally not my style I don't
really know how to work with loose
glitters and pigments to be completely
honest I have a really hard time
applying them maybe if you have brush
recommendations down below let me know
because I do have a few loose glitters
in my collection for BH Cosmetics I
really like looking at them I enjoy
looking at them not really using them on
my face but yeah I'm gonna have to say
purge on this as well so of the
chocolate gold collection there are two
products that I think I will pick up and
then there are three products that I'm
going to pass on let's go ahead and jump
into the unicorn collection now shall we
I saw this final collection here I
believe is releasing sometime in the
winter time were a little ahead with
this particular collection I wasn't sure
if I wanted to include it in this video
or in an anti haul because I will not be
purchasing any of this this is probably
the most childish collection I have ever
seen from Too Faced and that is saying a
lot considering they really have been
going in a childish direction with a lot
of their products in my opinion but this
is the new life is a festival collection
you have an eyeshadow palette and
literally a shaped like a rainbow now I
want to say I know some people are
really gonna be into this but I am NOT
I'm not one of those people
there is a unicorn highlighter which
we've already seen a lot of brands do
there is a unicorn brush as you guys can
see it there is also a bronzer
highlighter duo and the inside looks
super
you have the unicorn in the highlight
and then you have the bronzer part which
looks adorable but that packaging I just
can't get over it it's just incredibly
childish to me I'm not into it that one
is called unicorn tears and then you do
have these two little unicorn horn
highlighters they are cream highlights
which I'm really not into cream
highlights even though what my skin is
completely dry they just don't really
work for me but I will say that pink one
right there I love that color is a
beautiful peachy color with a strong
gold shift or your innocence to it and
then that blue one I just don't really
understand I don't think anybody's
really gonna want to use that but I
could be wrong
you also have what looks like a setting
spray and then finally some sort of a
lip product or I guess it's another
cream highlight so you guys I know this
election I mean I could not believe so
many of you were tagging me and saying
are you gonna at least pick up something
absolutely not this looks incredibly
childish to me I mean I am kinda into
the gold collection I still think it's
pretty cringy that they're being like oh
my god real diamonds and gold infused in
there but those ingredients aren't even
necessarily good for your skin or you
know I hope that I safe and all that
kind of stuff but yeah this unicorn
collection definitely gonna be passing
on this I mean that is just the cheapest
looking palette I have ever seen Too
Faced release that I mean they have been
releasing a lot of childish and cheapo
looking stuff lately so yeah I'm gonna
have to say no to the life is a festival
collection I know a lot of you are
wondering so I thought I would pop that
into today's video but anyway that is
pretty much it so let me know if you're
gonna pick up anything from the new Too
Faced collections down below and I guess
I will see you guys tomorrow
it was in how to grandiose bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
