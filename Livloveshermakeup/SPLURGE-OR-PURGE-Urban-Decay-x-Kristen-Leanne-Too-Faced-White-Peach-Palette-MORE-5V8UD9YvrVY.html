my channel happy Thursday today I do
have a splurge or purge video to share
with you guys I love doing splurge or
purge and videos when I don't
necessarily have time to do both a
wishlist and an anti haul video in the
month you guys know I am overwhelmed
with the video idea I have a lot of
video ideas on my list and I do plan at
my videos at a month in advance so I
just didn't really think I would do an
anti hollower wishlist video this a
month I thought instead I would just do
kind of a will I buy it's sort of video
so if you guys have never seen a will I
buy a video before these are actually
inspired and created by my friend
Samantha March here on YouTube as always
I'm gonna link her channel as well as
her will I buy a playlist down below she
releases a new video every single
Wednesday talking about different
products kind of talking through them
and discussing if she's going to
purchase them or not and that is where I
got the idea for a splurge or purge so
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
am going to start with something that
you guys have been tagging me like crazy
on Instagram with this is the Too Faced
new a white peaches eyeshadow palette it
will be a releasing a round of February
and honestly you guys when I first saw
this immediately I kind of was like a
little bit drawn to it I told you guys
in at my products that I want to see
Beauty Browns released in 2018 a video
that I'm very interested in seeing some
more a watercolor as kind of colors
something that's a little more cool
toned and honestly this palette kind of
is right up that alley however when I
saw the swatches I was incredibly
disappointed the first two fucking rows
you cannot even tell the difference
between the shades in my opinion I'm not
gonna be able to blend these and get
something that looks like it's a
different colors at both those two rows
right there and then you're going to
look identical on my eyes so especially
considering I'm not amazing at makeup so
it's just gonna be one of those palettes
that the first two rows are gonna be
basically the same color for me and then
you have the bottom row and that last
shade which is called peach passion
looks beautiful but my god it's glitter
infused like crazy I just don't see
myself reaching for this palette so
although I do like that it's a little
more cool toned and more like water
color kind of themed and I have heard
that the peach passion are not the peach
passion the original peach matte palette
was quite nice the formula after all and
this is just not something I'm going to
reach for you guys and I yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and say purge on that open next
we do have
new eyeshadow palettes from hourglass
cosmetics called the graphic I use
shadow palettes and these look fucking
boring now you guys know I'm incredibly
loyal to hourglass I really like
hourglass especially considering they
just said that they're gonna rehab all
vegan products by 2020 I like what they
stand for I think they're very
professional very elegant very posh
they have good products but I have to
say these are so fucking boring I mean
look at these ballots you know if I was
going to pick one up I guess the purple
one with the more muted purples and the
more cooler toned vibe would be what I
would reach for it but a lot of these
just remind me of like their modernized
eyeshadow palettes which I love to the
modernist eyeshadow palettes I have the
shade obscura and I think it's beautiful
I know a lot of people did not like that
formula but if these are just kind of
repackaged in there I don't really know
what the point is to be completely
honest now I feel like having one
modernist eye shadow palette was enough
for me because the rest of the other
colors were incredibly incredibly basic
and boring so this is another palette
that I'm gonna go ahead or another
little set of palettes I'm gonna say
that I will be purging on if you guys
are curious the shades are Avista or you
have the Vista palette you also have
ravine you have myth which is all maps
and then you have expose and they will
be available very very soon on Sephora
but I'm gonna be going ahead and purging
on those alright guys moving on we have
a new product here from by beauty that
they look so fucking beautiful and I
want to like them and I want to want
them but I know I'm gonna get absolutely
no use out of these and this is called
the prismatic pearl multi it sticks now
and this is something that you can use
basically all over your face but I am
one of those people I'm not into cream
highlight and I feel like a lot of this
would be for cream highlight now the
color selection going on here kind of is
interesting because you have this really
really dark shade where I feel like
people would obviously use that maybe on
their lips or maybe they would use it as
an eye shadow but again I don't like
cream eyeshadows I'm not a fan of cream
highlights the only area that I could
see myself using these on is actually my
lips now the one problem is I remember
the bite Beauty what were they called
creme lipsticks no God what were they
called I have the shade Heather they had
this old school formula that was amazing
but I had the blunt tip kind of like
this where you don't have like the
bullet shape and I could not get that
shit onto my lips because they can wet
outside my lip line all the time it was
very hard to apply so the only thing
that I would actually use these multi
sticks for would be on my lips and I
know what's gonna be difficult I would
prefer to just get a full-size booze
Bush lipstick so although these are
twenty four dollars each and the shades
are beautiful like oyster pearl and pink
pearl are really gorgeous you have the
shade Rose pearl a blush pearl and then
peacock pearl although they look very
pretty they're just not from me
now if you're someone who wants
something for a blush as well as
eyeshadow and you want something for
your lips and you can make it work and
you want something beautiful and
monochromatic I would definitely go for
it I think these are gonna be fantastic
but it's gonna be a purge for me
all right guys moving on to the new
hourglass vanna's flashback bass slash
brandish flash highlighter stick if
these are going to be 42 dollars each
and I believe they already released on
the Sephora comm website yeah on january
9th and January 3rd they already
released on the hourglass comp website
as well so hourglass like I said I'm
usually very very loyal to them but I
absolutely refuse to pick up their
vanish foundation stick I feel like the
amount of product that you get in there
is fucking ridiculous it's so small I
just can't justify it to be completely
honest and I know I'm the girl who's
talking about buying the $58 illusion
hyaluronic skin tin but I really like
that product whereas the small amount of
product the minuscule tiny amount of
product that you get in the foundation
stick as well as these highlighter
sticks in my opinion is not worth it now
I like the colors you have like a solid
gold you have a solid kind of coppery
color they're gonna be $42 each but it's
just they just can't justify it I don't
know you guys I could justify a lot of
things from hourglass and I'm the girl
who will buy the $80 holiday palette but
this is just not something I will use
again I'm not that into cream highlights
as well so I'm gonna be passing on these
they do have five different shades so if
you are interested the shades are
champagne flash as well as big flash you
have gold flash rose gold flash as well
as a bronze
alright guys moving on honest toffee a
Beverly Hills is releasing singular
bronzers and I'm really excited this is
something that I could actually see
myself using it looks like all of them
are going to be matte and they will be
releasing sometime in March at Macy's
Sephora Diller's as well as uLTA Beauty
and I'm Matt's official LA in January so
if you're in on that satellite you could
go ahead and pick those babies up I
guess this month but these look
incredibly interesting to me you guys
know I love the blush trios I love the
face palette formula that Anastasio
Beverly Hills releases
whether it be their aglow cadets whether
it be of their blush trails like I said
their blush kits anything like that I'm
into it very soft silky finely milled
powders and I'm hoping that this bronzer
is gonna be similar to that we haven't
seen what they look like on the inside
but I'm looking for something that is
going to just give me a little bit of
oomph to my skin and kind of make me
look a little more tan and also probably
a deeper more cool tone shade that I can
actually use to contour if they have one
now the funny thing about this is that
the packaging looks very interesting to
me so this I don't know if this is on
purpose I think it actually is it almost
looks like they're wrapped up like
there's a little like looks like they're
wrapped like presents there's like folds
in the packaging you know I don't know
if it's just the reflection I don't
actually think it's the reflection it's
very interesting packaging I love the
packaging on the beautiful beautiful
Anasazi of Beverly Hills blush trios
it's just like this and you can see the
Anastasio Beverly Hills logo when you
kind of move the packaging but this is
interesting packaging but yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and say splurge on these you
guys are definitely gonna pick up
probably one or two depending on the
shade selection that they have all right
guys moving on to Becca cosmetics yeah
another brand that I am incredibly loyal
to hourglass I wanna Stassi Beverly
Hills Becca
definitely loyal so these are the new
bright eyes collection so you have two
new products and then the other ones are
not new you do have the under eye
brightening corrector in a reformulated
kind of version and also a deeper tone
I do enjoy the original color corrector
so if you're looking for one and you do
have more mature or dry skin I would
highly recommend looking into that
especially if you have a deeper skin
tone and maybe the pink one didn't work
for you that is out today also have the
first light priming filter I do have a
full-size of that not a huge fan there
Reaper moaning that and for me
personally I just feel like it leaves a
very not not as much of an artificial
vibe on my skin as the backlight priming
filter but I don't know what it is I'm
not really a fan of back up primers and
I don't really feel like that one
hydrates enough for me however they have
a new anti fatigue under eye primer I'm
ready it's kind of like there's a
blueish turquoise color I'm guessing
that it's something that you dip your
finger in and then you Pat underneath
your eyes and obviously the color
doesn't go with it but it's kind of
funny that it's the turquoise color this
looks beautiful to me I know it's gonna
be up there in price and they also have
an under eyed
means setting powder but for someone who
has been struggling with incredibly a
dry skin and this winter season and I
get a lot of creepiness in just dry
patches and emphasize texture and fine
lines underneath my eyes yeah I'm gonna
say splurge on both of these I
definitely want to pick up the under eye
primer I'm very interested and I'm very
interested in the under eye brightening
setting powder so splurge on those
babies
all right guys moving on to another
product here where is this from oh
Milania this is a new product that has
already released on their website these
are $11 each they are Dinu make it last
setting powders now you can anice a
decent amount of products in here you
have three different shades which is
great you have Trust and translucent
light to medium which is matte
translucent medium to deep which is
matte and translucent banana which is
matte oh I'm sorry you up for shades and
number four is a radiant so I am gonna
say splurge I really really like this
idea I have been purchasing the cap on D
lock-it as well as the Too Faced Born
This Way of setting powders Anna and
that is a lot of money for those powders
I mean I feel like I go through them
pretty quickly especially if I am baking
my face so I would love to find a you
know comparable or comparable product so
I'm thinking that I will pick up
translucent light to medium which is
mapped and then also radiant and
possibly translucent banana I'm not
usually somebody when I'm not self tan I
can't wear that heavy yellow kind of
banana color underneath my eyes let me
know if that happens to you as well but
I feel like if I'm self tanned I can so
maybe I will pick up 3 of them let me
know if you guys want a review so yes
words to those up next we have a
products here from Charlotte Tilbury now
immediately looking at this I'm not
quite sure what exactly it is I think
the trend boot is saying that this is a
foundation but there's only like six
shades or be sure that this is a
foundation someone told me that it's a
BB cream and then somebody else told me
that it's a tinted primer whatever it is
I'm actually really interested now
Charlotte Tilbury is one of those luxury
beautiful brands that is actually
cruelty free
I like the majority of stuff that I pick
up from Charlotte Tilbury the lipstick
I'm wearing right now called the queen
is from Charlotte Tilbury this was sent
for PR I would really like to go ahead
and pick this up whatever the fuck it is
is that a foundation is that a tinted
primer is that a BB cream it looks like
it's going to be beautiful on the skin
and very moisturizing
they're calling this the Hollywood
flawless filter for superstar youth glow
anything that's gonna give me youth and
glow in the same sentence I want it and
I'm thinking the second to lightest
shade looks like it will be best for me
again I need more information on this
but for now I'm gonna go ahead and say
splurge I'm okay with it being a tinted
primer I'm okay with it being a BB cream
and I'm totally fine with it being a
foundation although that fucking shade
selection is ridiculous but yeah I'm
fine with all three of those so this is
something I have my eye on let me know
if you guys want me to do a first
impressions a foundation review on that
and finally guys we have the whole
entire collection from Urban Decay and
Kristin Leanna we have the daydream eyes
shadow palette we also have the
kaleidoscope dream eyes shadow palette
and then we have let's see here the
beauty beam highlight palette for $34 we
have three different vice lipsticks we
have a vise liquid lipstick duo for $29
advice liquid lipsticks separately for
$18 which is called pulse which is a
comfort matte cool gray and then SGH
eyeshadow single for $19 so let's start
with that eye shadow single it's like a
mustard yellow color I know that that's
a lot for an eyeshadow single but I am
actually contemplating picking that
shade up I really really like that it
looks different it feels different to me
if I can dupe it out with my modern
renaissance palette and use what is that
that okra shade in there that kind of
gives that yellow tone vibe maybe I will
I want to see side-by-side swatches but
I'm thinking about going in store and
swatching that out I believe all of this
stuff is already available or it will be
available January 21st online and in
select stores that uLTA Beauty Sephora
Ulta Macy's all that kind of stuff so I
think the things that are really
standing out to me are not the
highlighting palette not the vise liquid
lipsticks not the lipstick duo none of
that what's really standing out to me is
that beautiful beautiful kaleidoscope
dream eyes shadow palette is $39 and the
shades they're so beautiful and I've
seen a few people get this as PR and
they did like a get ready with me or
just like a swatch video I know a lot of
people are saying that the way that the
palette is set up is very a very
interesting and some people are saying
they don't like it but these colors are
gorgeous and it's very urban decay like
in my opinion so I think I'm gonna pick
up the Kaleidoscope dream and now the
daydream eyeshadow
is all just like a row of maths that I
guess you would kind of use in
conjunction with the Kaleidoscope dream
palette but I'm not gonna pick that up
because I have too many palettes like
that in my collection but yeah the
kaleidoscope dream eyes shadow palette
as well is that eye shadow single I am
definitely thinking of picking up so
anyway guys that is it for my splurge or
perch a video let me know if you're
gonna splurge on these items if you're
gonna purge them out of your mind out of
your brain and say no I'm not gonna be
picking those up that's pretty much it
thanks again for joining me and I guess
I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
