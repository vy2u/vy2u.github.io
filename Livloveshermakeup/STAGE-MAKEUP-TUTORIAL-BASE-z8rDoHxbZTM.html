I have two different videos going up for
you guys and I'm just gonna put them
back-to-back so in this video I'm going
to be doing a tutorial on the face
makeup the face makeup that I wear when
I am on stage if you are curious I sound
so weird when I'm on stage I'm not a
stripper
I am a classical musician I am a
professional flutist so I am going to be
sharing with you guys what I put on my
face when I am under a bunch of bright
light it's kind of like right now and
then the video going up right after this
is going to be the I look and I was
doing you guys in for that I've been pre
filming all day and you guys I don't
know how people do this pre filming
thing like I can't do it I've been
sitting in front of these lights and I
just feel I feel out of my skin so I'm
breaking this into two yes this is going
to be a tutorial so I'm gonna walk you
guys through a little more like step by
step what I like to do there are a few
products that I specifically reach for
when I want a really really perfected
looking face and I just want to say
right off the bat performer performer
okay this is not natural makeup in any
way shape or form if you're gonna be
saying oh look at all that caked on
makeup it doesn't look like that on
stage and actually on a day-to-day basis
I usually do wear natural makeup but
when I'm on stage I want to look
perfected so anyway this is going to be
all of the face products and did I
explain why I didn't want to call it a
tutorial I wanted to call it it get
ready with me but then I realized
because there are certain steps I'm
doing I'm gonna call it a tutorial but I
feel like people who do tutorials are
bomb-ass at makeup and I don't like to
tell you guys do those who do that I
just don't like doing that I would
rather just get ready with you guys on
camera is probably a lot of you are way
better at makeup and I am and no Shane
that is totally fine but I hope you
don't mind that I'm calling this a
tutorial please don't feel like I'm
trying to tell you you have to do this
you have to do that I don't really know
what I'm doing
I do like wearing makeup on my face I'm
just a girl who loves makeup I love to
collect and all that kind of stuff but
please don't feel like I'm telling you
you have to do this you have to keep
your face this way because it's not like
that alright so anyway let's go ahead
and just jump right into it guys I have
already put on at my skincare and my
lips are so chapped it looks horrible
thank goodness I don't actually have a
show tonight so I am going to spray on
some of the skin to Navy I post a makeup
recovery spray this was sent to me for
PR and it is supposed to be something
that you put on
after you take your makeup off but I
don't notice that it does when I
take my makeup off and then I spray this
on it doesn't do anything so what I like
to do is just kind of spray down my face
as a setting spray I feel like it works
as a setting spray so I like to do that
when I am going to be going onstage I
use a setting this before and after all
right and then I do like to jump into a
primer so like I said this is going to
be a little more heavy duty because I'm
gonna be under very very bright lights
and it just looks good you know you
don't want to look like you have a bunch
of texture on your skin and stuff like
that we will be putting on like eight
different layers of foundation but that
is what it is you guys requested this so
anyway a primer that I do reach for all
of the time when I am on stage is the
YSL this is the Trisha cloth so this is
a beautiful beautiful blurring primer
very similar to the Maybelline Baby skin
primer is just silicone based and I just
like to take a foundation brush this one
is from BH Cosmetics and I just go ahead
and pump a little bit of that on to the
brush and then I apply it to my face
I really like applying silicone based
primers with a brush because I feel like
it really really just kind of spreads
out and sinks into the skin and fills up
all of the fine lines and the pores and
all that kind of stuff and honestly it's
better for me because I really really do
yank and pull at my skin which is not
good so anyway I am just putting that on
everywhere it's very very important if
you are going to be on stage that you
are wearing a primer like I said the
setting spray does help at the beginning
as well you can also go ahead put on
your primer and then put your setting
spray on I feel like that also helps but
just be careful because a lot of setting
sprays do you have alcohol in them and
they can it make you a little more on
the dry side all right so after I have
put that all over my face I do jump into
my favorite eye primer I'm gonna have to
find an alternative for this since
Maybelline does test on animals but it
is the master prime in the shade 502 509
512 is the lightest one I don't know I
don't know what shade that is but anyway
I just go ahead and I apply that on at
my lid all the way up to my brow and I
know some people like put their
foundation on and then their eye primer
I just I've never done that I've never
done that and then with that same brush
I'm just going to go ahead and tap that
in so yeah this is basically just going
to be the
full-coverage base that i wear and what
did i want to say I will do brows and
also eyes in the next video because I
feel like I'm gonna be chatting quite a
bit in this particular video alright so
I'm just gonna blend that in and then go
over with my fingers a little bit trying
to tap really nicely on my skin because
I'm so aggressive with my face alright
next I'm going to jump into concealer I
consistently reach for this one this is
the amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
in the shade ivory I do feel like on a
day-to-day basis this is just a little
too much for me but when I am going on
stage I do like to use this before I go
in with my foundation so I take quite a
bit of this okay I'm taking a lot of the
concealer and I am going to tap it
underneath my eyes all the way down to
my nose kind of in like a little
triangle shape and then also on my
eyelids now like I said a very very
cakey makeup that we're doing here I
cannot say that enough but it is what it
is it looks good on stage and may not
look good like straight up close like
this but it looks good on stage and
that's what kinds so to blend that in I
do like to use this elf selfie blurring
brush it's super super cute kind of
rounded and I really like the way that
it just blends this in so I go over and
I just kind of stipple this on and this
is what I do pretty much every single
time I will take it around my forehead
area down the bridge of my nose and on
my chin as well and the reason why I do
not put this on top of my foundation is
because it's super super thick and cakey
and it's very very white as you can
probably see so anyway just kind of
taking that everywhere and making sure
that we're getting a little bit of a
highlighted base and then I am going to
add a crazy I know
I'm gonna take my damp Real Techniques
sponge and I am just going to Pat over
that this definitely has a the option of
going very very like chunky on your skin
if that makes them so you really do have
to make sure that you are moisturized
ahead of time but again when you're on
stage you know you're kind of up on this
stage so people aren't going to be seen
your dryness but it is what it is
alright so and now I do go in it with a
foundation I know I look a little crazy
the one I'm going to use today is these
drawers your
luminous silk foundation I recently have
fallen in love with this and I am taking
quite a bit of this and I'm just gonna
put it right onto the sponge I'm going
to take let's see here three pumps of
this and I'm going to start applying it
to my face
this particular foundation does have a
little more of a yellow tone so it
really does help to kind of balance out
that super super white concealer if you
are very very pale that concealer will
work for you
so I just kind of like to put it on and
sometimes I will go in and I will use
you know like goodness four or five
pumps of a foundation I really love my
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation and I use a lot of that when
I'm on stage but again it's just when
you're under those bright lights you
know everything looks a little more
emphasized actually truly I had photos
taken of me at Carnegie Hall and Hannah
the photographer was right underneath me
and I was up on the stage you guys you
can see all of the texture along my jaw
line and stuff and I remember I was
wearing like a water-based foundation
never again I always go with something
that is like medium coverage like these
yours Armani and build up a couple
layers I won't do that for the sake of
this video because just gonna take up
more time but I will you know on a
day-to-day basis if I'm doing a concert
I will go ahead and I will build that up
not on a day-to-day basis but you know
sometimes I do have concerts everyday I
guess all right so after I have done at
that like I said if I was wearing a full
coverage foundation I would go in with
another layer concentrating not so much
in my forehead area where I'm dry but
definitely over here where I do have
some breakouts and things like that but
yeah now we're just gonna jump right
into some powder so I do layer two
powders together got to make sure
everything is set in this is the Catrice
prime and Vine at mattifying powder eye
and trying to get through this so I have
already hit pan on that taking my tert
ear buffer at foundation brush I always
use this and I really make sure that I'm
stippling the actual powder on because
if I'm making swiping motions it makes
it look streaky on my face since that
concealer is super super it's a very
obvious concealer and if you start kind
of like streaking your face up with a
brush you will notice
that it starts to separate underneath
your foundation which is obnoxious all
right so I am just going to hide Anna
setting my face in and then I do go in
with a loose powder on top now I'm not
the biggest fan of this Kat Von D
translucent setting powder but I'm
trying to use it up so I will take that
and I do like to take my big what is
this it cosmetics I'm sorry it costs
MedX no girl Real Techniques a powder
brush it's really nice and fluffy I tap
in just a small amount and then I like
to dust this on my face and I always do
this with a loose powder normally I
don't like loose powders but when I am
performing when I am on stage I do like
them because I do would like to feel
like I am double set especially around
my eye area and in my case um so guys
are probably seeing this go everywhere
all over my face but truly like the more
you can set your face in the better okay
alright so just going ahead and putting
that all over making sure everything is
completely set in I noticed that when
I'm on stage I'm very like aware of my
mouth area because I'm a flutist and
this area right here starts to get
really sweaty so I really like to make
sure that that is completely set in my
hair a lovely alright next we're gonna
jump into you it I guess blush and
bronzer so I always like to take a
bronzer and put it on the apples of my
cheeks not everywhere because with the
lighting when you're on stage depending
on you know what stage you're on
sometimes the shadowing can look a
little weird anyway so you just want
your whole face to look really light and
bright so that people can see you so I
don't take you know any sort of
contouring product or a bronzer all over
my face but today I'm going to try out
this pure mineral glow a bronzing powder
which looks hella dark but I'm just
gonna tap it on to the apples of my
cheeks and I always take it with this
little morphe angled it's a really
flimsy little angled blush brush so I
like to do that with the bronzer because
it won't apply as much product and I
like to use this basically as my base
for my blush which I know sounds weird
but I just want to make sure that my
blush is really popping when I am on
stage I like for my
entire face to be really really bright
looking and then my cheeks and also my
cheekbones to be very highlighted all
right so after I have applied that I do
like to always go in with one of my Too
Faced um nut flush long-lasting
sixteen-hour blushes this particular
shade is called I will always love you I
just thought it would go nice with that
kind of glowy bronzer so again I take a
angled blush brush this one right here
is from BH Cosmetics I'm gonna tap into
the products there tap off the excess
and then build that on top and these
blushes look amazing especially under
like lighting like this or stage
lighting they have a little bit of a
sheen to them they're just stunning you
guys absolutely stunning so just apply
that and you guys can see there is a
little bit of a glow building and then I
go back in with my big powder brush and
I just like to stipple over to make sure
there are no harsh lines all right
something that I absolutely love for
stage if this little guy right here the
foobie laura geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator in the shade gilded honey I
love the way a gold highlight shows up
when I'm on stage for some reason pink
highlights just don't do it for me when
I'm on stage this really really catches
the light nicely so I'm gonna take my
Sigma what are you tapered highlighter
brush and I'm just going to go into the
product and I am going to start applying
this yes
typical youtuber yeah but seriously yes
so I am just applying that two of my
cheekbones as you guys can see and
because this is a darker event at my
complexion when I go down the bridge of
my nose I do tap off the excess and then
I take it on my chin as well I don't
want it to darken up too much as you
guys can see it already has a little bit
but I love it on my cheekbones it looks
so amazing under bright lights on stage
like that glow the golden I know it
looks like a little much but seriously
when you're on the stage it looks
amazing so again just taking that powder
brush and I am tapping over the area
that I just highlighted and you guys can
see that looks really really nice and
glowy kind of catches the light from all
different angles which is totally the
point
and then this is the time where I like
to go in with my lip product now I don't
wear a lot of lip products when I am on
stage but I love my Clarins instant
light lip comfort oil in the shade zero
two raspberries so I just like to make
sure everything is nice and hydrated
which my lips look like right now
as always hashtag flutist so I just put
that on and then if I do want to go in
with like a little bit of a tamp like
the YSL the left engine oils those are
nice on stage they never rub off on my
food headjoint
I will but I like to let this sit for a
little bit and uh yeah I think that is
pretty much it guys the last thing that
I like to do is just set my face in one
more time with a setting spray and then
I do it again when I'm done with my eye
makeup so a lot of setting in but it is
worth it
I know that these are filled with
alcohol but you need your makeup to last
when you are onstage so anyway this is
the base that I like to wear when I am
on a stage it is very very glowy as you
guys can see pretty much full coverage
um I could have built up to shorter
Armani a little more but I didn't want
to the mistake of this video because you
guys would have been like that's a lot
of foundation so anyway this is kind of
my face base I will go ahead and leave a
link down below if you would like to see
what kind of eye makeup I wear when I am
on stage and how I do my brows and yeah
that's pretty much it
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
