and personal I wish I could just like
cut my lips out my lips look like it
literally looks like I thought there was
a cornflake stuck to my lip it's just
dry skin it's just the way my lips look
anyway welcome back at this is going to
be part two of my stage makeup tutorial
it has been about 45 minutes since I
filmed the first one so I'm feeling a
little better if you couldn't tell
that's had not completely kicked in yet
when I was filming that first one I feel
like you guys can visibly see when I am
like full on ADHD mode and then when I'm
a little more calm when my meds have
kicked in so hopefully this will be
easier for you guys to follow but yeah I
basically am showing you guys the makeup
products that I like to wear when I'm on
stage this is obviously a little more
like heavier makeup the eye makeup is
not super heavy it's kind of heavy it's
heavy for me so anyway if you would like
to see the first part of how I put
together this kind of cakey face yes it
is kind of cakey but it's beautiful on
stage I will go ahead and link that
video down below but yeah we're just
gonna go ahead and get started all right
to where we left off so the first thing
I'm going to do is slowly out my brows I
have been loving the Revlon Colorstay
brow pencil in the shade blonde you guys
know this I've been talking about it all
the time so I'm just going to spoolie my
brows out and then I go in with one of
my all-time favorite brow products this
is the Maybelline at brow drama creme
pomade I will not be repurchasing this
since they do test on animals but this
is amazing so what I like to do is just
start right here where I don't really
have brows towards the front as you guys
can see and I just kind of fill in the
front part of my eyebrow and then I will
spoolie that out I feel like I'm kind of
like sideways and my size is not
whatever I'm gonna spleen that out I
always do this and then I go in with a
brow pencil side if I want to fill
anything else in I'm not huge on brows
you guys I've never been a huge brow
girl I feel like really thick of brows
just looks strange on me but I'm going
to go ahead and hit kind of the arch
right here where I'm having a little bit
of shedding and just kind of fill that
in a little more and a little bit
towards the front here as well I feel
like the front part of my brows is
really where I have the most trouble and
any time a minute lupus flare up I lose
my eyebrows like so quickly my eyelashes
my eyebrows are like peace out so anyway
now I'm just gonna go ahead and split
those back out and
I just realized I forgot my main brow
tool my main a brow - Liz definitely
definitely being Milani clear brow wax
that will keep your brows in place all
night long which is awesome when you are
onstage so I would highly recommend that
I just kind of glaze it over my eyebrows
and then I against bleed them out and I
know they look a little like furry and a
little caterpillar but when I do it like
this but I really like it because I feel
like when I am far off on stage you
really can't see like my eyebrows and if
they're thicker even if they look a
little more like little caterpillars
they just you can see you can see I have
eyebrows that's what I'm trying to save
all right next I am going to jump into
eyeliner and I really always love using
this this is the NYX slide on glide on
stay on and definitely a turn-on
eyeliner in the shade of black now I can
use this one or the Urban Decay one it
really just depends on what your
preference is but I just go on my
waterline and I know I look crazy when I
do that so be very careful when you do
this I was like I'm gonna shape when I
do this on camera and stab myself in the
eye but I just like that definition that
it gives right away you can also go
ahead and line your tight line but I
suck at that so I'm not gonna do it
alright now I'm going to curl my lashes
and I just take my revlon at lash curler
and I do a couple pumps I find when I
pump it I get a better curl that lasts
longer and another tip is to actually
dip your lash curler in like powder
before you go in a lot of girls do that
backstage and you know the actual powder
will make it like a primer for your
mascara which is really cool all right
so let's go ahead and jump into
eyeshadow I really really love using the
lorac mega pro 3 when I am on stage so
we are just gonna jump right into that
this is what it looks like if you are
curious Anna we are going to start yeah
let's take the wet and wild crease brush
from went wild I'm going to take the
shade clip which is a right here every
time I say that someone's like no it's
cut at bay or it's great or it's creep
and I don't know
Kai my dad is Swedish and he always said
cut up face so that is how I pronounce
it but what I like to do is just take
this all over my lid all the way up to
my brow and I
tend to go a little more a warm tone
when I'm on stage as far as I look is
concerned and as much as cheeks and
stuff in general there's just something
really stunning about a really really
beautiful warm toned I look when you
were on stage I don't know what it is
but everything warm tone just looks
better if you do a bunch of like cool
tone highlight and just like pinky
eyeshadows this looks kind of weird
alright so next I am going to jump into
the shade at toffee which is this one
right here and I am going to take let's
see here we're just going to take that
the same brush from ELF where's Liz from
wet and wild and I am just going to work
at that unit to my crease and this is
going to be our transition shade and I
always make sure that I put a transition
down because I don't like to blend my
eyeshadows you guys if you've been
watching me for a while you know this
about me so it is very very helpful when
you can put the transition down because
it just helps the blending process to go
by quicker another thing I like to do is
just hold the mirror beneath me and I
noticed that I can get right into the
crease sometimes I feel a little puffy
or bloated before I go onstage and I
notice I can't even find my damn crease
I'm like weirded out so if you look down
into the mirror
protip know you guys I'm not a pro so
anyway I do that and now we are going to
jump into what do we do today I feel
like I'll probably just show you guys
what I normally do like the same colors
so the first thing I'm going to do is go
into a signer and this is the shade of
cider really really beautiful and I'm
going to be taking this brush right here
which is the Luxy 231 a small tapered a
blending brush so cider is a really nice
warm tone color
I definitely tap off the excess and then
I just put it right into the crease now
because this is such a precise a little
brush you have to be careful because you
will spend a time kind of blending this
out after but that is okay I mean when
I'm on stage I'm willing to blend a
little more so anyway I am just working
that into my crease kind of in circular
motions
I noticed if I just go back and forth
this starts to turn it's like a line on
my eye and
that is not cute that is not cute and
sometimes I do take it down onto my lid
it doesn't really matter because I will
be going in with a nice a bright color
on my lid anyway but yeah I'm just
working that in and now we're gonna jump
into the Sigma tapered blending a 35
brush and I'm just gonna go back and
forth and blend that out really making
sure I'd get into the actual crease or
the actual socket because when you use a
really small brush like that it really
can kind of just stamp the color on and
you want to make sure that it's
completely blended so just going back
and forth and blending that anyway I
would love to know down below if any of
you are also performers that would be so
cool to know what do you wear when you
are on stage I feel like a lot of my
friends wear the same kind of stuff with
me which is funny because a lot of them
don't wear makeup but then when they're
on stage they go all out they pull out
their lorac mega Pro threes but yeah I
would love to know what you wear if you
go on stage so just kind of going back
and forth doing little small circular
motions I really just want some nice of
warmth and then what I like to do is
lift up my actual eyebrow and then right
here I go again in circular motions and
I dip back into the shade of toffee
which was our transition I just like to
do that one more time so that we don't
have any sort of harsh lines which I'm
the queen of harsh lines oh goodness
a lot of you were like why do you make
fun of your makeup you guys it's because
like I know I don't put the time and the
effort in you know if I wanted to I
could but it's just I hope you guys know
I'm joking when I when I throw shade at
myself alright so anyway the left is the
whoops it is looking like so far now I
like to jump into this little guy right
here I always use this for my outer-v
it is the morphe m50 3 it's really
really kind of wide and sometimes it
looks a little weird when I try and get
it in there it's like bigger than my eye
but I'm tasting to like it so I will be
taking it these shade of brown sugar
which is a beautiful beautiful kind of
cool tone Brown almost I guess that one
right there and I am just going to tap
this brush in there and then it's habit
onto the outer V to be very careful to
tap off the excess because
lorac mega Pro eyes shadows are very
very powdery but they are easy to blend
which is great so just kind of working
that on at my outer-v getting a little
bit of definition going on there as you
guys can see it starts to kind of travel
down a little far so if you want to be
really exact you can go ahead and you
can do the tape method which sometimes I
do for a show but not today I don't
actually have a show today I'm just kind
of showing you guys what I do so just
kind of bring it on the outer V I love
the shade brown sugar so beautiful fall
out galore lovely so that is what it
looks like
looks great and now I'm going back into
the Sigma brush and I'm just going to
blend in circular motions making sure
not to take it too high I always take it
too high by accident but that's okay
we'll just go back in with that crepe
shade and then we will touch up the brow
bone so anyway just doing that back in a
forest and then I do like to go back in
to the shade toffee again which is the
transition shade and I like to blend
that out one more time
again using a circular motions I just
help so it doesn't look as money I feel
like my eyeshadow how we look slightly
muddy but it's not something that
bothers me too much alright now I am
just going to go ahead into the wipe
underneath my eyes quickly because I
have them fall out but let's take the a
wet and wild brush again I usually do
this I go back into the brow bone shade
and I'm just gonna kind of a blend that
right here so there is a no harsh line
alright so next I am going to tap my
finger into the shade rose quartz which
is a really beautiful cool tone kind of
rosy shade and I am just going to apply
this to my actual lid and I just have it
on it with my finger you definitely can
foil this if you want I just like the
color combination of these three shades
together but again into whatever you
want whatever color combination you like
from this particular palette so I just
kind of tap it on as the
I guess inner third third inner part of
my eye unless you could say and then I
like to go in with the morphe Envy 13
this is more of like a little flat guy
and I just like to go really lightly
kind of back and forth and in circular
motions again almost blending everything
together which kind of you would think
defeats the purpose but I I just like it
I just like the look of the kind of
warmth on the eyes without looking super
super crazy so just going kind of back
and forth blending that out and then
back in again with the wet in a wild and
going you kind of circular motions
all right and now I am going to use a
let's smooth this little guy this is the
japonesque what is this 200 brush it was
like a little angled guy like this and
I'm going to go into the shade rose
quartz the one that we just put on our
lid and I like to work this right onto
my lower lash line I love it this little
brush is angled it is so cool
never had anything like this in my
collection oh I just got it in my I
literally just got a shadow in my eye
that hurts
all right to doing that on each side and
then we will go ahead and we will blend
it kind of smoke out the lower lash line
all right so then I'm going in but this
guy this is the morphe I'm at 3:30 brush
for someone who doesn't like Morpheus
sure do use a lot of their brushes I
actually think that rushes are pretty
good I just don't like their makeup and
I am blending everything together so my
lower lash line everything all over the
lid everything and I'm just gonna get
this nice warmth to my eyes and if you
don't want things to get a little more
muddled together you definitely don't
have to do this you can go ahead and it
you can just keep everything kind of
separate but I just like for there to be
once all over the eye right back in with
the shade crepe I'm just hitting
underneath the brow and now we are going
to go ahead and jump right into what
mascara again I'm just going to pick up
any sort of follow I don't have a brush
here which is horrible
um but yeah I'm gonna jump into mascara
the first one that I like to use is
where is it oh my covergirl clump
crusher in a very very beautiful brown
shade and now this is just very very
natural looking so much eye shadow on me
now this is just very very
natural-looking and I really do like it
and then I layer it together with the
benefit they're real and this is just
what I consistently do every single time
I am on stage
so one layer of that to the brown
mascara and then I go in with me they're
real and I do wear these shade of black
and B they're real from benefit start
with the lower lashes really get them
nice and defined and then I go to the
uppers the uppers all right
I just poked myself in the eye do you
see that look at my eye it's running
don't run don't run it's like when you
just put your mascara on and you don't
want to sneeze and you're like yeah
that's me right now alright so anyway
guys that is pretty much it the eye look
that I really really enjoy wearing on
stage it is just a really nice like I
don't know like a little little spritz
of warmth on the eyes I really like it
from far away it looks really good
sometimes up close it looks a little
muddy but for the most part you know
when I'm on stage I think it looks nice
it gives a little bit of something to my
eyes makes my blue eyes look a little
more blue so yeah that is pretty much it
I hope you guys enjoyed these two little
tutorials thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
