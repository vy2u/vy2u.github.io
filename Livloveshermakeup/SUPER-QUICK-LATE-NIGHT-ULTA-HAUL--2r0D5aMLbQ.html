this video obviously I was not prepared
to film this yes but I saw that there
was an Ulta box outside of my door and I
was like well I have to get in there
right away because I just got out of the
shower as you can tell from my cute
little Turbie twist right here I just
got out of the shower and a lot of the
items that I ordered are like hair
products I don't want to use them
tonight so I hope you don't mind I'm not
the kind of person to like go throw more
makeup on and like a cute outfit at 12
o'clock at night like I'm just not gonna
do that so it's a really quick little
haul if this bothers you I apologize if
you are serious I am wearing the glam
glow flash mud brightening treatment and
I hope I'm not talking too loud because
Tom is sleeping anyway let's go ahead
and get right into it it's a pretty
quick little haul but OGX was buy one
get one 50% off and they also had new
items so this is new this is the
intensely invigorating eucalyptus mint
body wash I love anything minty and
eucalyptus E and so does Tommy and you
get 1995 fluid ounce as a product in
here I don't know if it's just a new
scent or if they've always had body
washes let me know down below I know
that they have body lotions I enjoyed
those a lot but I have never seen body
washes so anyway I feel like a little is
going to go a long way with this product
since it is a gel and of course I will
do a follow-up haul in exactly a week to
let you guys know how all of the
products are working for me all right
the next item I got was a viewer
requested suggestion they were like you
need to buy this this is the philosophy
shampoo shower gel and bubble bath in
pink frosted animal cracker of course
has to get the big size because I love
these three and one products from
philosophy I like to travel with them I
didn't clean my makeup brushes with them
I can do summer stock with them and I
did open the little the little peel here
because I knew I was gonna struggle I
knew I was gonna struggle like on camera
and it was just gonna take up more time
but you guys know spasm it smells so
good it smells like pink buttercream
frosting with the rainbows and unicorns
so thank you so much for the
recommendation I love it already and I'm
excited to use that the next item I got
it was another OGX product like I said
they were buy one get one 50% off and
this was new it is the hydrate and tone
reviving
lavender luminescence Luna luminescent
platinum shampoo for blond hair with UVA
and UVB sun and filters so if you have
blond hair you know why we use purple
shampoos just to tone down brassiness in
you know your hair a lot of people when
they bleach their hair they pull a lot
of like orange and red tones definitely
me I feel so much yellow it's like
ridiculous but anyway I thought I would
try this out since I do have good luck
with the OGF shampoos and then I also
got two more penetrating oils I'm a huge
fan of the penetrating oil is from OGX I
also like the anti breakage serums
however they're a little more thick I
like these because they're very like
liquidy as you can see so these are two
new ones well this one's new this one's
new to me so the first one is the extra
strength
extra strength the damage remedy coconut
miracle oil penetrating oil
it's got vanilla bean extract and
coconut oil in it I want to put this in
my hair when I take my Turbie twist out
it smells really really good and I'm
super excited to try this out alright
and then the other one is the vitamin e
penetrating oil I've seen this a lot but
I was like does it smell like anything
and sadly it is not it doesn't smell
like anything I'm one of those people I
love cents so if it works really well
and it smells good I'm all about that
life but I'm sure I'll get over it I'm
sure will be really really good it says
it helps to increase strength and
elasticity in your hair and it will
dramatically improve split ends and
frizziness so I'm it safe to try this as
well and then the last two items I got
to work two more of my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powders I go through
these so quickly you probably saw I
don't know maybe 16 to 18 thieves in my
empties video for the month I love these
I carry one in my purse I carry one in
my Sloot bag yes you heard that right I
have you know combo skin that gets
really really oily during the summer
time and please keep me so nice and
matte if you do have darker skin I would
just I would advise staying away they
are really really cheap they're 399
which is amazing but they do leave a
little bit of like a bright cast on
darker skin so anyway that is my little
Ulta haul I'm so excited to get into
these products I know you don't look
super cute in this video but I think
we're just keeping it real and then I
did get some samples
I already know I'm gonna hate this
sample this is the dew the hoola from
benefit this is like their liquid
bronzer this stuff socks okay it's like
straight up Oompa Loompa on the face I
have a little deluxe eye sample and I'm
like thank you so anyway that's what's
my little oho I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you for joining me at
12 a.m. and I hope Tom doesn't wake up
thank you alright guys I'll see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
