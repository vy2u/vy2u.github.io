channel this video is going to be sample
spotlight for the month of April oh I
literally just like picked at my pimple
Oh anyway this is going to be my April
2016 sample spotlight video if you don't
know what this is this is a series
collaboration I do every single month
with my friend Meg Bernardo here on
YouTube I will go ahead and link her
Instagram her video and also her channel
below so you guys can go see which
samples she used up but we normally pick
about six to eight samples that we want
to use for the month and then we come on
camera and we share with you guys what
we used up so let's just get started the
first of all stands like you stopped was
like a dual pack it was the mirrored
poorly formed poor finding sealer and
blackhead remover so it was like this it
was attached and the first step was this
little exfoliator and this was basically
just a little exfoliator that you take
it out and it's kind of like a thick
paste you put it on areas where you have
large pores I put it like basically a
concentrated in my t-zone you leave it
on for about 10 minutes and then you
wash it off with water and I felt like
it really kind of microderm to my skin
and it really kind of pulled the black
heads up to the surface and then you go
in with the pore refining sealer right
after that and you put it over the areas
that you just scrubbed and I do feel
like this actually helped quite a bit
with my blackheads I do struggle with
black heads out like around this area
pretty much in my t-zone especially
around my nose and I thought it was a
really really nice little treatment the
pore refining sealer was very very
lightweight I don't felt like it left
any sort of residue on my skin it's
sunken really quickly so I really
enjoyed that little duo alright the next
sample that I used up was the strivectin
or stray becton st advanced intensive
concentrate for wrinkles and stretch
marks this has college x it says college
xce wrinkle repair complex I don't
really know what that I think that's
their own little collagen repair serum
thing that they make up but anyway I did
like that it was a pretty nice a decent
cream I felt like it did moisturize my
skin I obviously didn't see results
right away with just one use but i do
have a smaller little deluxe i sample
that i have been going through of this
product and I do like it I think over
time it is helpful for areas where you
fine lines and wrinkles so I used that
up the next sample I used up it was from
benefit this is the benefit mooster eyes
total moisture facial cream and I
actually really like a few of these
skincare items that benefit cells I
really like their eye cream man I
thought this was really nice I really
want to try there I think they have like
a hydrating essence water that I'm
really interested in trying out as well
but this was a hydro concentrated facial
cream and it was very very nice it was
very rich and it just spread onto my
face really nicely it did not leave any
sort of oily residue or weirdness on my
skin it was just very thick and very
very hydrating so I did enjoy that quite
a bit i also used up this little Murad
of renewing eye cream sample this I did
not like I thought this had a very very
strange fragrance to it first of all and
then second of all I had a strange
texture it was very very thick and when
I was tapping and in around my eye area
I was like wow this feels amazing like
this is really gonna help with fine
lines and puffiness and all that stuff
and then it just drive down to this
almost sticky like tacky texture it felt
very very strange and I tried putting my
makeup on on top of it just hit my limit
I tried putting my makeup on on top of
it and my leg under eye area looked so
horrible throughout the day like my
concealer was crazy all day it just
looked really really bad so I tried
using a little bit of it at nighttime
and the same thing happened it just felt
very strange underneath my eye area
definitely didn't feel renewing and I
don't felt like it hydrated it just left
a very strange consistency underneath my
eyes so I did not like that one a
product I did like was this Dior dream
skin capture totale I have had a few
samples of this before in the past it's
very similar to like the l'oreal revital
it's basically like a blurring sort of
primer moisturizer SPF built into one
I'm sure this is crazy expensive since
it is from Dior but it's beautiful it
has kind of a pinky fleshy hue to it and
when you rub it on your face it just
looks like your skin is all blurred and
pretty and beautiful looking so I did
like this quite a bit the next item I
used up I really really enjoy and I
actually ended up picking up a full size
of this during the Z I was going to say
alta 21 days of beauty sale no during
the fifteen percent off see
at sephora this is the tarts deep dive
cleansing gel the rainforest of the seed
deep dive cleansing gel really really
enjoy this alot it has a beautiful
texture to it and when you rub it on it
kind of feels like it's a little oily
but then when you pat your face drive
you feel so clean I have combo skin and
I really really enjoy this and like I
said I did end up purchasing April size
of this as the next sample I went
through was the fresh black th delay
concentrate with noni fruit juice and
it's supposed to help firm and
illuminate the skin I love this eye
cream I need to put this on my love's
list at sephora because i think it's
beautiful it smells like black tea which
i love i'm a huge fan of the fresh like
black tea tiny in general I don't love
their night cream but i love the mask
that $92 mass that's all my sephora love
slip at some point I'm gonna have to get
that but I really really enjoy that
sleeping mask and I have had a small
little deluxe a sample of this before as
100-point part from Sephora and I really
really do enjoy this it smells amazing
it's got a wonderful texture and I feel
like it really does kind of plump up the
fine lines around my eyes so I really
really enjoyed this and I'm definitely
going to purchase a full-size the next
little sample I used up was the urban
essentials lavender talent I thought
this was a facial cleansing tablet but
it's not it was just a little hand
sanitizer wipe and I actually love this
a lot they are all pre packaged
separately you can get these at aalto
that's where i got my sample from and
they smelled really really good very
strongly of lavender it didn't smell
like alcohol or anything like that
whatsoever and I really want to pick up
a little pack of these they all come
separately in these little packages and
I think they're very very easy to travel
with so yeah this was really nice and it
has like an aromatherapy sort of scent
and its antibacterial it kills germs
really really nice I enjoyed these if
you see these get a little pack of them
they're very very nice alright and then
they last sample I used up was the fresh
lotus youth preserved face cream with
super 7 complex I do not like the lotus
line from fresh I do love the black teen
line but I'm not a huge fan of the lotus
line it smells sort of strange like
cucumber or like Ray top I don't know
what
it has a sort of strange scent and I
don't really feel like it does much for
my skin if you are interested in fresh I
would recommend checking out their black
tea line instead of their lotus line I
don't know I'm just not a huge fan of
this but yeah this is kind of greasy it
was an overnight cream and I just didn't
really feel like it did much for my skin
and I've gone through a lot of samples
of those so that is my sample spotlight
for the month of April don't forget to
go ahead and check out Meg's video like
I said everything will be linked below
and I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
