welcome back to sample spotlight for the
month of februari if you guys did not
know already i will link below the first
sample spotlight video i did this is a
collaboration video that I do every
single month with my good friend here on
YouTube meg Bernardo and I'm going to
link her channel her Instagram and also
her video down below like what is it
what is it that I'm looking yes her
video her channel and also her instagram
down below so you guys can go follow her
if you would like to she's wonderful I
love Meg she's one of my favorite people
here on YouTube and I think she knows
that because I literally am the first
person to comment on every single one of
her videos I love her pretty much
obsessed with her so anyway I would love
with you guys went over and checked her
out tell her I say hello and she's going
to show you guys the samples that she
used up this month and her samples are
different than mine and I'm going to
show you guys the sample done you stop
so the first one I want to start with is
the one I didn't use yet again I was
supposed to use this in January and then
I was going to use it again in February
because I didn't use it in january and i
still haven't used it you guys I don't
know what's wrong with me this is the
becca shimmering skin Perfector in opal
and I know the reason why I don't want
to grab for this it's because I already
have like a smaller sample size of this
and this just doesn't really match my
skin tone and I need to find a way to
use it I can't use it as a highlight
it's just too dark on my fair skin so i
think i'm going to mix this into my
foundation i swear to you i swear i will
use it up in March like I go through a
lot of samples and I just don't want to
touch this one but I promise March all
right in the next samples that I went
through were a bunch of these wrinkles
no more I'm sorry no needles no more /
wrinkles no more this is from dr. Brandt
right yeah dr. Brandt and I basically
got this little deal on sephora and they
had a code where you would type in
something like I don't know non-frozen
Botox face or no Botox or something like
it was like actually a coat like that it
was really weird Oh anyway cuz this is
supposed to be like Botox without the
actual needle so you would type it in
and they would give you like 12 samples
of this so I just all of these up I have
gone through three full sizes of the
needles no more I think it's really one
of those like instant gratification sort
of products I honestly did not see a
difference in using it at nighttime
that was really stupid of me to spend
such a large amount of money this is
like a hundred dollars for a full size
and you don't even get that much if we
could get like one fluid ounce but it
was stupid of me to use it at night time
because I don't think over time it does
anything for your skin it's really one
of those instant gratification products
so you can use it like right before you
put on your makeup you can use it as a
primer it's really nice it comes out as
a sick cream and you think it would be
really moisturizing but it actually
dries down to a powdery finish so it's
really nice if you a combo skin or oily
skin it does kind of plump up wrinkles
around the eyes anywhere on the forehead
smile lines things like that it's not
amazing it pretty much does the same
thing as like a silicon primer but it's
still pretty darn good and just be
careful if you bring it around your eye
area because it does have peppermint oil
in it so it will kind of make your eyes
water all right the next two samples
I've used up I got these in I believe my
glossybox this is the notch soap radio
no I'm sorry my popsugar must have box
last month I got like six of these and I
thought you know what these are kind of
like samples I mean they're like deluxe
I samples their body washes and also
they can be used as a bubble bath so I
use them as actual body washes this one
is called joy inducing bath / shower gel
how cute is that it smelled amazing like
lemons and it really made me happy like
it really really did make me happy it
was uplifting it was a yellow color it
says when life gives you one too many
lemons and end you misplaced your happy
place it's really really funny it says
do the words cheer up make you want to
slap someone hard on the face it's time
to try some positive bath formations
like affirmations it says to activate
squeeze a generous dollop into warm
running water or lather directly onto
the skin so really really cute i love
that it has like the little it just
makes me happy looking at the bottle and
it really did smell good so i love that
one and then the other one I have to get
a full size of this if you guys know
where I can purchase these not soap
radio body washes this was amazing I
can't even describe the scent it is one
of the best sense I've ever smelled it's
kind of manly but I love it it is the
achievement through self confidence a
bath / shower gel and it says bathing
with sharks for that competitive edge in
work and/or play it says and then just
squeeze a generous dollop into warm
running water or use it on your skin
love this like
really if you guys know where I can
purchase a full size of this please let
me know because I will it is so so so
darn good and I'm so excited to try the
other ones now they all have little
affirmations on the front and they all
smell really unique and different so
loved those i also used up a sample of
the l Genest all veronic acid plus alga
protein biotechnology from San Francisco
it's an anti-wrinkle night cream I
actually got like 12 samples of this and
I don't know why I what did I do with
all 12 of them I used up like 12 of this
and 12 of these I don't know where the
other ones weren't I probably toss them
but anyway um I did not like this
whatsoever actually left a really goalie
feel like on my skin but it was like a
thin oily texture so didn't feel very
moisturizing I didn't think it plumped
up my wrinkles I used it for like 14
days straight at nighttime and I use
this one like i said in the morning
before my primer I prefer the needle to
know more over this i would not purchase
a full size of this very pricey and i
didn't think it did anything special
alright the next sample that I used up
was he feels like honeymoon skin base
this is for hydration baby skin and glow
literally the same exact thing as the
Knicks honey do me up primer i have used
almost all of that up it comes in like
the spatula form it smells the same it
feels the same really really nice i
think i got this at sephora but don't
waste your money on this one because
it's probably more expensive just go buy
the next one so yeah it was good it does
have honey in it so it's a little tacky
on the skin it has a few gold flakes
gold flakes I don't know if they're
actual gold 24 karat gold flakes you
can't really see them on the face but
yes things that thing as the next one
alright the next thing I used up was the
only henriksen power peel this was a
3-step system I loved this I may have to
get this like in full size this is the
step one almond polish loved it smells
like amaretto I love anything almond
like oh just smells so good and then
they stuck to was the lemon strip which
base which was basically just appeal you
put it on your face you don't wash it
off you leave it on for a couple seconds
so it can start to penetrate the skin
and then you put on me camomile comfort
mask the Kevin I'll come from mass was
just okay i will say the lemon strip is
quite strong and does start to tingle
your skin's with you have sensitive skin
stay away you do not want to get this
however the camera mild comfort when i
put that on it immediately just like
calm down the you know tingling and
kind of itchiness that I was getting on
my skin because that lemon peel goes and
eats off the top layer of the skin but
overall it was really really good I
loved it the way my skin looked in the
morning so nice little set right there
the next thing I used up it was the skin
ink this is the little sample of the
pure deep sea hydrating mask this was
really nice it actually was a gel which
was I was kind of surprised by that I
don't know why a lot of sleeping masks
are actually like gel like the
formulation is kind of like a gel but
this is really nice if you have oily
skin or combination skin and you're
looking for a overnight sleeping mask
that's really really lightweight this
one and also these sephora overnight
ones are really really nice it didn't
weigh down my skin wait out my skin
stuff like I'm talking about my hair but
it didn't like wait my skin down it
didn't make me break out I didn't feel
like there was any residue when I woke
up in the morning all of it was absorbed
I want to purchase a full size because
well I only tried it once and on top of
that i have so many masks but really
really nice alright and then the last
sample i used up was the ren clean skin
care flash rinse one minute facial with
water activated vitamin C I can't really
remember what this was like which means
it probably wasn't that special I think
it kind of had little particles in it
that like bubbled up on your skin when
you were washing it but I feel like a
one minute facial like that makes no
sense if you're going to do a facial you
have to keep it on your skin for longer
than like 15 minutes to get the benefits
of like you know the products like
taking off the top layer of the skin so
I don't really understand the concept of
this and I don't remember what it was
like so it probably was nothing special
so anyway those are all of these samples
that I used up before februari sample
spotlights I promise I will use this
becca I just don't want to use it I just
don't want to use it it's not because I
can't because literally I what's feel
like a bajillion of these and the elf
chemist I just don't want to use it
because I know it's too dark so if you
have any ideas on how to use this if you
have fair skin let me know i know i have
a deluxe sample size of this and i never
use it i'm probably going to declutter
it but should i mix this in with my
foundation I don't really know what to
do with it it's dark like opal is dark
on fair skin tone so let me know what
you guys think what I should do with
that but I hope that you guys will join
us in this little sample monthly
spotlight thing where you go through a
bunch of samples because if you are
watching this channel you probably shop
a lot at sephora and all
you probably accumulate a lot of samples
so anyway I hope you enjoyed this make
