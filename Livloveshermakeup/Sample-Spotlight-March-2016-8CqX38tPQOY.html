here to do sample spotlight for the
month of March and if you are unfamiliar
with these videos this is basically just
a monthly collab I do here with my
friend Meg on YouTube I'm going to leave
her video down below her channel and
also her Instagram so you guys can head
over and tell her I say hello but every
single month we pick out about six to
eight samples that we want to use up and
then we come on to Cameron we talk about
them and let you guys know what we think
of the product I want to see really
quickly if the lighting is off in my
videos today I'm filming really early in
the morning right now and there is no
natural lighting coming through
whatsoever and it's like almost seven
a.m. which is crazy but we have some
storms going on here right now with
thunderstorms and not so much tornadoes
in our area but like in Iowa and in the
Midwest there's tornadoes and all that
kind of stuff so I apologize that the
lighting is a little bit off but let's
just get right into it so the first
sample that I used up was the lorac
tantalize er this is a body bronzing
Luminizer and I really didn't want to
use this just being completely honest I
really didn't want to because honestly I
don't self tan my body I don't really
use tons and tons of what body Luminizer
zuhr bronzers actually I really do but
this one was really really nice i had a
red tint to it and I put it on my legs
one day and I thought it looked really
really nice so it did um definitely
deepen up my skin quite a bit so I would
recommend putting it all over your body
there was not enough in here to put all
over my body but I will definitely
consider getting a full size of this
product for the summertime because I
felt like it had that nice red undertone
it didn't make me look orange and make
me look really really like luminize so I
did really really enjoy that lorac
tantalize er the next sample I used up
was the becca shimmering skin Perfector
in the shade opal so this is the liquid
version sorry if these samples are a
little dirty I tried washing them out
but there's still like product on there
anyway I've been trying to use this for
like two months now literally I just
really didn't want to reach for it
because honestly the becca shimmering
skin Perfector whether they're in the
press diversion or in the liquid version
the shade opal is really not for
everyone I mean everybody talked about
has been amazing but honestly on fair
skin I don't think it looks that
beautiful it's not technically really a
highlight it's more of like a blush
topper or something to bronze your skin
up a little bit so I did mix this in
with a foundation that was a little too
light for my skin and I felt like it
kind of deep ended up a little bit I do
think it gives a gorgeous gorgeous
luminous like luminous glow to the skin
lots of luminosity no chunks of glitter
but it's a beautiful product but if I
were to get a full size of this i would
get it in the shade pearl which is just
that gorgeous gorgeous like opalescent
white color alright the next thing I
used up was the tart I'd performance
naturals marcuzzo creaseless concealer
the shade that I used was fairly light
neutral which was the lightest one in
this little bubble pack this is a
wonderful wonderful concealer really
really thick heavy-duty coverage
beautiful underneath the eyes I don't
feel like a creased whatsoever I would
say it's very very comparable to the wet
and wild fergie what is it come correct
concealer so if you want to save quite a
bit of money i would check that out but
yeah really really good coverage love
the shade match and I would consider
purchasing a false ID to that all right
i also used up feet are high-performance
naturals baby tinted treatment primer so
my friend amy is like crazy about this
product I think she actually recently
she got like the little bubble pack like
this of a sample and I think recently
she picked up a full-size I need a full
size of this product I know that this
series are like this little monthly
collab is not so much to focus on buying
buying buying but I can't help it this
is so darn good the shade I used was
fair and it's just beautiful it onally
honestly just gives a beautiful little
tint to the skin I feel like it has
skincare benefits I know it has skincare
benefits it says multiple skincare and
makeup benefits e 1 and I felt like it
left like a demi that appearance to my
skin it definitely helps you prolonged
aware of my makeup and I did it I
actually applied it the way that Amy
recommended which was to wear it
underneath like a powder foundation so I
weren't underneath my actually was my
turn powder foundation right yeah the
new tart powder foundation it was
gorgeous on the skin really really
highly recommend if you want a primer
and kind of tinted moisturizer built
into one all right and then the next
sample I used up was the fresh sea very
moisturizing oil this has omega-3 six
seven and nine love this it has a
beautiful beautiful consistency i would
say it's very very very
thick what it reminds me of is the tarte
maracuja oil so if you really like that
really thick moisturizing oil but you
can definitely feel is on your skin I
would highly recommend this I think it's
beautiful it's got a little bit of a
fragrance so if you have sensitive skin
maybe stay away from it but for the most
part this is just amazing really gave a
lot of moisture to my skin and again I
would consider for just being a full
five of this alright moving on the last
product that I went through is actually
something I have a full size up this is
the crow blameless life this one's all
gross too this is the Koli resveratrol
eye lifting bomb I really personally
like this product but my boyfriend loves
it more so he's the one who's actually
going through this right now it's a
beautiful beautiful gel consistency he's
really into resveratrol as a doctor like
I don't know there's all story on it
like basically he really believes in
rest for our trials though I like to get
him all of the code alibris for a 12
products he likes the face cream and
also the eye cream but this is more of
like a gel formula really really
beautiful on the eyes if you have combo
skin or even oily skin this wears really
nicely throughout the day you can wear
it during the day and also at night
really really good product would i
repurchase for myself no but what I
repurchase for Tom yes alright guys so
