my channel I am filming this on my
laptop since I am travelling currently
as you guys are watching this on Monday
I have two other videos that will be
going up later today the second one will
be tea time with live and the third is
my July 2016 empty and but I did want to
tell you guys the tomorrow which is
Tuesday I will be back filming in my
beauty room I'm actually on my way back
to Milwaukee if you guys are watching
this or actually the day before whatever
anyway I'm in a hotel room which is why
I'm filming on my laptop and obviously
the quality isn't as good but I still
want to get these videos up for you guys
so today I have sample spotlight or in
this video I have sample spotlight to
share with you guys if you do not know
what sample spotlight is it is a monthly
collaboration that I do every single
month with my friend and Mike Bernardo
here on YouTube she already posted her
video about a week ago so I will leave
her video and her channel down below
make sure to head over and see which
samples that she used up this month but
let's just go ahead and get started
shall we
so the first sample that I used this
month was the Chloe love story ode to
path Yuma this is what it looks like
it's just a little card that opens up
you can see that is what the full-size
bottle looks like and obviously the
little spray perfume was like this this
smelled really really nice I ended up
actually bringing a half of course
there's nothing left but I actually
ended up bringing a full-size or nutty
flows like the little deluxe a sample of
this with me on my trip I love this
scent it's very very beautiful it is a
little powdery and very very floral it
reminds me a little bit of flower bomb
but I actually really like it and I
think it's a very nice so I would
consider purchasing a full-size of that
here we have the arborio and Korean skin
therapy bamboo water Locke mask this is
supposed to have hydro plumping effects
to it I did not think that this was
anything special I feel like any sort of
gel mask can do the same thing that this
does and I believe a full-size of this
is around one or two fluid ounces for
like $65 which is ridiculous so I didn't
really see any instant benefits with
this and normally with masks because I
do change up my skincare all the time
normally with masks and you end up
seeing a result after using it once or
twice and I think that I got three uses
out of this so obviously like the first
time I used it I saw nothing the second
time I really didn't see that much and
then the third time I noticed my skin
was a little more clumped and hydrated
but that was it so I didn't think it was
that special and I would not purchase a
full-size of that alright the third
sample that
used up this month is the Tartar cat
prison print park apperances have not
filmed in a while guys the charts park
at princess and glisten duo so this is
the blush right here called glisten
which is absolutely stunning I thought
that I had these full sides of this it
turns out I don't anymore so that is on
my love's list I want any full-size of
that it's a beautiful beautiful kind of
quarterly color and it has a little bit
of like a golden sheen to it it kind of
reminds me of Narges
orgasm and then per cap princess is just
that beautiful beautiful kind of cool
toned bronzing color you can use it to
contour you can use it to bronze I
really enjoyed this I already have a
gleam a full sides of this I'm not the
biggest fan of park ab princess I think
my what is it the Physicians Formula
Muru Muru butter bronzer it's a lot
better in tone and I'll interesting
quality than this but that blush is
amazing so I would consider purchasing
the full size of the blush not the
bronzer
alright the next sample that I used up
was a skincare item you guys know I love
my skincare it is the Clinique Clinique
smart custom Repair Serum I like to this
a lot and I was trying to figure out why
I liked it so much it smells very
strange like meat or something I don't
like it I do not like the scent of it
however what I really like about this is
that it is filled with simethicone and
silicone it has this really beautiful
feeling and texture when you're putting
it onto the skin and at first I was just
like you like I don't think that a serum
should have Dometic own and things like
that in its because it's going to block
off anything else that you're trying to
put on top of that and that is true but
this makes a really really good primer
so I would consider purchasing this just
to use as a primer that is what the
full-size bottle looks like but for the
most part I don't think that you should
use this as a serum just because
anything that you put on top of it is
just not going to sink in properly
because you have that slip on top from
the Dometic own or the silicone alright
and the last sample that I used up this
month was the Tarte rainforest a PC
water foundation this does have
broad-spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen there
are cute little bubbles here that you
could pick from
I chose light neutral which is the
second to legis shade it was too dark
for me so I did use a little bit of a
white mix or foundation I do not like
this water foundation I will be doing a
serum flash water foundation favorites a
video for you guys very soon this one i
never purchased in full-size not
interested I would say this one on the
back of one very unimpressed with Olli
to scratch myself very unimpressed with
I feel like they dry downs like cement
on your face they have a very strange
consistency it's almost like paint
they smell like paint not a fan of this
I have a lot of better water and serum
foundations and I will show you guys in
that that's those that's another video
soon so anyway not impressed with that
would not purchase they both sides so
anyway those are these samples that I
used up this month I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
