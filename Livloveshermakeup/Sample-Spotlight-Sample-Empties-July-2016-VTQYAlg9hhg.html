my channel I am filming this on my
laptop since I am traveling currently as
you guys are watching this on Monday I
have two other videos that will be going
up later today the second one will be
tea time would live and the third is my
July 2016 empty and but I did want to
tell you guys the tomorrow which is
tuesday i will be back filming in my
beauty room i'm actually on my way back
to milwaukee if you guys are watching
this or actually the day before whatever
anyway i'm in a hotel room which is why
i'm filming on my laptop and obviously
the quality isn't as good but i still
want to get these videos up for you guys
so today i have samples spotlight or in
this video i have sample spotlight to
share with you guys if you do not know
what sample spotlight is it is a monthly
collaboration that I do every single
month with my friend Mike Bernardo here
on YouTube she already posted her video
about a week ago so I will leave her
video and her channel down below make
sure to head over and see which samples
the she used up this month but let's
just go ahead and get started shall we
the first sample that I used this month
was the Khloe love story Oh two paths
Yuma this is what it looks like it's
just a little card that opens up you can
see that is what the full-size bottle
looks like and obviously the little
spray perfume was like this this smelled
really really nice i ended up actually
bringing a half of course there's
nothing left but i actually ended up
bringing a full-size or not a full size
but little deluxe a sample of this with
me on my trip i love this scent it's
very very beautiful it is a little
powdery and very very floral e it
reminds me a little bit of flour bomb
but i actually really like it and i
think it's a very nice so i would
consider purchasing a full size of that
here we have the herb orion korean skin
therapy bamboo water lock mask this is
supposed to have hydro plumping effects
to it i did not think that this was
anything special I feel like any sort of
gel mask and do the same thing that this
does and i believe a full size of this
is around one or two fluid ounces for
like sixty five dollars which is
ridiculous so I didn't really see any
instant benefits with this normally with
mass because I do change up my skincare
all the time normally with mass and you
end up scene of resolved after using it
once or twice and I think that I got
three uses out of this so obviously like
the first time I used it I saw nothing
the second time I really didn't see that
much and then the third time I noticed
my skin was a little more
and hydrated but that was it so I didn't
think it was that special and I would
not purchase a full size of that all
right the third sample that I used up
this month is the tart park at prison
print park a Prince's have not filmed in
a while guys the tarts park at princess
and glisan duo so this is a blush right
here called glisten which is absolutely
stunning I thought that I had these both
sides of this it turns out I don't
anymore so that is on my love's list I
want a full size of that it's a
beautiful beautiful kind of corlee color
and it has a little bit of like a golden
Sheen to it kind of reminds me of narges
orgasm and then park a princess is just
that beautiful beautiful kind of cool
toned bronzing color you can use it to
contour you can use it to bronze I
really enjoyed this I already have I
believe a full size of this I'm not the
biggest fan of park at princess I think
my what is it the Physicians Formula
Muru Muru butter bronzer it's a lot
better in tone and I'll interesting
quality than this but that blush is
amazing so I would consider purchasing
the full size of the blush not the
bronzer alright the next sample that I
used up was a skincare item you guys
know I love my skin care it is the
Clinique clinique smart custom repair
serum I like to this a lot and I was
trying to figure out why I liked it so
much it smells very strange like meat or
something I don't like it I do not like
the scent of it however what I really
like about this is that it is filled
with simethicone and silicon it has this
really beautiful feeling and texture
when you're putting it onto the skin and
at first I was just like you like I
don't think that a serum should have
dometic own and things like that in it's
because it's going to block off anything
else that you're trying to put on top of
that and that is true but this makes a
really really good primer so i would
consider purchasing this just to use as
a primer that is what the full-size
bottle looks like but for the most part
i don't think that you should use this
as a serum just because anything that
you put on top of it is just not going
to sink in properly because you have
that slip on top from the domestic own
or the silicone all right in the last
sample that I used up this month was the
charge of rainforest of the sea water
foundation this does have broad spectrum
SPF 15 sunscreen there were cute little
bubbles here that you could pick from I
chose light neutral which is the second
to legacy aid it was too dark for me so
I did
a little bit of a white mix or
foundation I do not like this water
foundation i will be doing a serum /
water foundation favorites video for you
guys very soon this one I never
purchased in full side not interested I
would say this one on the back of one
very unimpressed with Olli to scratch
myself very unimpressed with I feel like
they dry downs like cement on your face
they have a very strange consistency
that most like paint they smell like
paint not a fan of this I have a lot of
better water and serum foundations and i
will show you guys in that it dad those
that those in a video soon so anyway not
impressed with that would not purchase
they both sides so anyway those are
these samples that i used up this month
i really hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and i will see you guys in my next one
