thank you so much for joining me today's
video is going to be tea time would live
plus sample spotlight for December 2016
so if you are interested in seeing these
samples I used up this month and also
the teas that I have been loving them
please keep on watching alright so the
first sample that I used up was from
first aid Beauty this is the ultra
Repair Cream intense hydration for dry
parched skin I do not like this I am NOT
a huge fan of the first a beauty line
the only thing I really like from them
are there glycolic acid peel pads so i
would not personally purchase a full
size of that I didn't like this origins
original skin renewal serum this has
willow urban it and I felt like this was
a combination of a serum mixed into a
gel moisturizer so I actually thought it
was quite nice and that is something
that i would consider purchasing a full
size of i did use up another serum I
like this one a lot more this is the sea
from a day serum from drunk elephant
this firms and brightens the skin it
does have marula oil mixed in there so
it's quite hydrating and you do get some
pumpkin enzymes in there to exfoliate
the skin so I really like this and that
is definitely something I would check
out and purchase any full-size I did
also use up a sample of the Clinique of
moisture surge extended that extended
thirst relief this is a gel creme
honestly there is something very
comparable at the drugstore I used to
purchase this in full size all the time
when I was in college however I think
that the new Neutrogena hydroboost line
in the gel creme version is very similar
so I would not purchase a full size of
that anymore I did use of a sample of
the shiseido ultimate sun protection
lotion with SPF 50 this is a beautiful
absolutely beautiful it is waterproof
and you are getting a mixture of
physical and also chemical some blocks
in here so it goes onto the skin kind of
like a chemical sunblock would but you
are getting the sun protection from that
physical sunblock on physical some
blocks are the ones that don't really
make you break out as much or at least
for me personally they're great if you
do have a little more sensitive skin so
I like this and it does sit beautifully
underneath makeup would consider getting
a full size of that and finally the last
sample I've used up for the month was
the ulta beauty nectarine Rose
moisturizing body lotion this does have
shea butter aloe vitamins a b 5 c and e
in it and i do have a little bit left it
because i am going to be using this on
my hands today so anyway i did go ahead
and pick up a full size of this it's a
full scent and I really do like the
consistency all right let's go ahead and
jump into tea time with live for the
month the first tee I have been loving
is my celestial seasonings sleepytime
herbal tea this is in k-cup version and
i want to say really quickly i'm going
to be showing a lot of celestial
seasoning teas in this video it i am not
sponsored or affiliated with them in any
way shape or form i bought all these on
Amazon if you were curious with my own
money so anyway this is a sleepy time
tea i love sleepy time tea it's very
basic but it's super super delicious
I've been mixing a little bit of rock
sugar into here and honestly this really
does help me to go to bed I take I drink
this probably about an hour before
bedtime and i will make like a four
ounce glass so instead of going and
making a full eight ounce you know kind
of cups so that i'm going to be up all
night and like pain I just make like
four ounces of it and I really do enjoy
it i also have been loving the celestial
seasoning seasonal favorite caffeine
free sugar plums spice tea this is a
plum delicious blend with hibiscus
ginger and cinnamon this tastes really
really good you get a little bit of like
that plum flavor in there with some
cinnamon and also a little bit of
cardamom it's a little spicy but still
sweet so I've been loving that a lot i
also have been enjoying my teavana
gingerbread flavored black tea blends so
Tom and I got what is this 7 ounce 8
ounce container of this last year during
the holiday season it is absolutely
beautiful it is a loosely teeth this is
what it looks like on the inside and you
literally have pieces of like cinnamon
sticks in here as well as pieces of
popcorn and on the black on the black on
the back and they describe this as let's
see here a classic Gingerbread flavor
with a black tea base with a sweet
caramel apple finish so it's really
really tasty I like it a lot and I do
like to drink this in the morning since
it is loaded with caffeine another
celestial seasonings tea favorite that I
have been drinking this month is the
honey vanilla chamomile this is a nice
bedtime tea as well it obviously is
herbal infused since it's chamomile
chamomile is very very calming and I
actually do like to drink this before a
concert as well I feel like it tastes
really good iced it tastes really good
hot so I've been enjoying this it's just
a nice take on a you know regular
chamomile with a little bit of added
sweetness i also have been loving my
lipton green tea superfruit cranberry
pomegranate tea so I bought this during
the summer time and I think they taste
really really good ice
feel like cranberry is something that I
like to drink at this time of year since
it is a very festive and holiday like so
this is something I've been drinking as
well in the morning it's an ice pick me
up in the afternoon since you do have a
little bit of caffeine from the green
tea and the final T that I have been
loving this month is from celestial
seasonings this is the cranberry vanilla
Wonderland another one of their holiday
tease or seasonal favorites it's really
really good it comes in a red tea or
rooibos a base which just tastes amazing
and I really like that cranberry and
vanilla together so anyway those are all
these samples that I used up for the
month oh wait I do have one extra thing
I want to talk about so I did not use up
any teeth I don't have any tea empties
however I do have a condiment favorite
so last month I really favorite favorite
in a bit can't speak favorite was the
last month I did like that what was it
called nature Nate's like a hundred
percent Rob pure honey I think that's
what it was called this month i have
been loving the teavana belgian rock
sugar so this is slow crystallized pure
sugar and just a few little pieces of
this inside your tea cup will make it
super super speak so i've been loving
that so anyway guys now that is it so
those are all of my tea empties for the
month or I'm sorry mighty favorites for
the month and my sample empties I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
