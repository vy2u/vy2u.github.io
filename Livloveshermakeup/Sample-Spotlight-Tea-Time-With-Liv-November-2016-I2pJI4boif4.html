welcome back to sample spotlight for
November 2016 and of course tee time
would live if you guys did not know what
the series is or the two of these series
are on my channel the first one is where
I share with you guys my sample empties
for the month this is a monthly
collaboration so that I do with my
friend Meg Bernardo here on youtube so I
will go ahead and leave her video as
well as her channel down below so you
can check out her sample empties because
she used up a whole lot more than i did
this month but I also do come on here
and share with you guys my tea favorites
if you follow me on snapchat you
probably know I am T obsessed and tis
the season for drinking tea so I'm going
to share with you guys those at the end
so anyway let's go ahead and start with
sample spotlight I only used up three
samples this month like what normally I
use up about 10 to 15 so this was a
really really weak month I'm gonna make
sure that in December I go ahead and I
use at least 15 maybe even 20 samples so
that I can kind of catch up because I
have a lot of samples I literally have
like a five-pound bin of samples which
is very disturbing I know but anyway the
samples that I used up were the Sephora
instant moisture cream with hyaluronic
acid i also used up the amazing
cosmetics anti-aging a face primer and
the bozhe Tsubaki oil infused
exfoliating powder so let's go ahead and
start with the oil infused exfoliating
powder I'm not really into this whole
exfoliating powder trend I've tried this
one now I have tried the josie maran the
only one that I really do like is the
Tasha one it's like the rice enzyme I
think that one's pretty good basically
what like oil infused or just
exfoliating powders are for is for those
of you who do have sensitive skin who
want to get a nice like scrub going
without irritating your skin so not
really meant for me I have somewhat
sensitive skin but not super sensitive
skin I can go ham with like a really
strong scrub and it doesn't bother my
skin but this was just okay nothing is
special it did have a little bit of a
fragrance to it which I thought was
strange because normally exfoliating
powders don't have too much fragrance to
him because again they are made for
those of you with sensitive skin but
yeah this was just okay i would not
personally purchase a full size of this
and i wouldn't recommend purchasing a
full size if you do want to get a good
exfoliating powder go ahead and check
out the tasha one they have two
different variations one that's for like
regular skin in the one that is for
sensitive skin the amazing cosmetics
anti-aging face primer was just okay I
think that you can totally do this out
at the drugs
or the Maybelline instant pore eraser is
pretty much the same exact thing it's
just a really thick silicone dometic own
sort of primer so not impressed with
this would not purchase a full size of
that and then the final item is the
Sephora instant moisture cream
hyaluronic acid booster this is really
really good this is a wonderful day
cream I actually am considering going
ahead and purchasing a full size of this
it is highly fragrance so if you do have
very very sensitive skin I would stay
away but it's beautiful it has a really
wonderful consistency to it it's not
like so whipped it's just kind of like
liquidy but then it goes on to the skin
and really really sinks in quickly
hydrates nicely and really makes your
skin look nice and plump and fresh so I
really do like that all right let's go
ahead and jump into a tea time with live
so my first T favorite for the month is
definitely these celestial seasonings
Nutcracker Suite this is a black tea
obviously as you guys can see this is
adorable little packaging here and this
is basically just black tea with honey
vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon so
you would think that it would taste like
chai but because it doesn't have like
cardamom and tons of spices in it it
really doesn't it's just a really nice
honey vanilla black tea it just tastes
amazing and this is something that I
have really really been enjoying I do
put about a tablespoon of honey in this
and I just think it tastes amazing so
that is my first T favorite for the
month the second is a loose leaf tea
that I purchased on Amazon this is from
tea forte this is the exquisite loose
leaf tea in white ginger pear so this is
a white tee and I have really gotten
into white tees I think the White T's
are the least offensive tasting out of
all the teeth you know how black tea has
like a very strong taste green tea has a
very strong taste and like rooibos tea
red tea has a very strong taste to it as
well I feel like white t really lets all
the other flavors come through so this
you really really taste that pair in
ginger and it just it smells amazing it
tastes amazing so that is what it looks
like I've really been enjoying that and
I like to have this hot with a little
bit of rock sugar it also tastes really
really good iced I only drink the black
tea one hot it does not taste good iced
just throw that out there alright the
next one I have been loving is from
twinings this is the honeybush mandarin
and orange tea oh my god this is
caffeine free it is an herbal base tea
but you guys this is like a dessert tea
it is so incredibly sweet
the first time I tried this it was
because my friend Trina actually sent me
a few little tea bags thank you so much
tarina she knew that I would love this
and I'm absolutely obsessed i have this
with about half a tablespoon of honey
and i literally will have this for
dessert it is that sweet and delicious
tasting so you get a lot of that
mandarin and a lot of that like orange
flavor in there mixed together with
honey and it just tastes incredible so
this is one that I would highly
recommend especially if you do have like
a little bit of a sweet tooth and the
final one that I have been loving this
month is from tazo this is the organic
baked cinnamon apple this is a Roy bus
blend so it's red tea so it is herbal
infused and it says spiced apple
Nestle's with rich rooibos for a sweetly
indulgent herbal infusion with other
natural flavors so this is obviously
caffeine free and I mean tis the season
rights for apple and cinnamon I just
feel like it tastes amazing they do come
individually packaged as you guys can
see and I actually don't do any
sweetener with these really am this just
tastes so good on its own i really like
that sweetness from the apple and the
cinnamon gives a little bit of spice so
really have been enjoying those and then
i do want to share with you guys a
condiment favorite so I purchased this
on Amazon again and this label can you
see that it is so bright but this is
from nature nades I've never purchased
anything from them before this is the
one hundred percent pure raw and
unfiltered honey made by American bees
um I don't know what's so good about
this it doesn't matter by America bees
or what but it just tastes amazing I
feel like a little goes a very long way
you don't even have to use like a full
tablespoon of this you can use like half
a tablespoon and it will sweeten up like
a cup of tea so easily and nicely so
yeah that smells amazing it tastes
amazing it's really easy to stir in so
it's not like raw honey where you do
have to kind of let it sit and kind of
just like dissolve into your tea this
goes in really really nicely and easily
and I do like that it is raw and
unfiltered so anyway that is it guys her
sample spotlight for the month and of
course tee time would live I hope you
enjoyed this video let me know down
below you used up any samples and also
let me know if you have any tea time
favorites that I should go ahead and
check out so that is it and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
