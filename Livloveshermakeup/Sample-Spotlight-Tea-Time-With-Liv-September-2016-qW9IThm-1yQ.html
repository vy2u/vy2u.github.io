am back looking kind of like how I
looked this morning actually let's be
completely real I feel like today has
been a very unproductive day I keep
saying I'm gonna do all these things and
like none of them actually happen today
so I apologize for that I wanted to say
really quickly though thank you so much
for all of your opinions on this
morning's video I asked you guys how you
wanted to see everything play out for
the next couple of days before we get
into my declutter series and I'm going
to go ahead into the lorac and also the
what is it Kat Von D videos separate and
then I will combine the three to face so
hopefully I can get those up tonight not
all of them I'll probably get off the
lorac one tonight and then I'll do the
Kat Von D and the Too Faced tomorrow but
anyway in the meantime I wanted to get
up tea time with Liv and also sample
spotlight for you guys because if you
did not know I have not done tea time
with Lib or sample spotlight for what
feels like literally two months now so
sample spotlight is a monthly
collaboration I'd use my friend Mike
Bernardo here on YouTube
I have all of my samples for the month
that I used up and then I'm going to
share with you guys my favorite teas for
the month so anyway let's go ahead and
start with sample spotlight I'm gonna
link all of Meg's her channel her
Instagram everything you need to know
about her down below I would love if you
went over and checked out her channels
she's lovely she's been a wonderful
friend of mine on this whole YouTube
journey so anyway we do this every month
and it's a lot of fun but yeah one of
the first samples that I used up this
month was from Sunday Riley this is the
Luna sleeping night oil this is a
retinal ester plus blue tanzy oil and
this is what it looks like and if you
guys didn't know I actually went ahead
and purchased a full-size of this I
loved it so much so they had five little
samples right here and basically I
immediately saw results with this and
went ahead and purchased a full-size
look at my hair it's okay forget it
forget it
move on keep going alright the second a
little sample that I used up was
actually a two-step system from Korres
and normally I'm a huge fan of the CREZ
wild rose line I really loved the
overnight sleeping mask I really liked
their oil I'm just really into it but
this is not something I would purchase
this is the step 1 and step 2 activating
peel gel with 10% a Chasen's to the aloe
as well as the brightening and
resurfacing peel mask which has 10% AJ's
natural fruit enzymes and soothing aloe
so you put this one on first and then
you go in with this I didn't see that
big of a difference
honestly I do prefer my Peter Thomas
Roth and wrinkle peel pads so I would
not purchase a full-size of that I also
went through a three-step system from
Olay Hendrickson which again I thought I
would like this this is part of the oil
oily and this is part of the Olay
brightening line and I really do like
the brightening line from Olay Henriksen
however like I said would not purchase
this three-step system the first was the
truth sugar glow polishing mask I've
already gone through a full-size of this
I really do like this particular product
and I would purchase a full-size of this
but not these two this one right here is
step two this is a 25% vitamin C
concentrate you put it on and then you
go in immediately with the pure truth
melting cleanser very strange very oily
didn't like the two of these at all and
I did not see a difference in my skin
alright moving on I've used up a sample
of the nest fragrances citrine ODA
perfume this is what it looks like
really nice packaging I love that matte
black with the beautiful little yellow
flowers I did like this sense and I
would consider purchasing a full-size
one that I already have on my love's
list is the clean reserved this is
blonde rose I can't do it I preserve
blonde rose this is a beautiful perfume
it smells exactly like sandalwood rose
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so if you like
that scent this old sandalwood rose
scent from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works you would
adore this I want to get the little $25
spray perfume a virgin of that I also
used up this Sephora what is this mud
mask and purifying and mattifying mask
this is very similar to what the lamb
glows super mud so if you do want a dupe
I would highly recommend this they don't
smell this thing they don't throw down
the same however they do with the same
thing and they really do help to
decongest the pores of oil and also just
dunk so I highly recommend that I did
not like this super goop city sunscreen
serum this has vitamins E and b5 and it
broad-spectrum SPF 30 PA plus plus plus
no no no no - - - this is not good in my
opinion super super oily and greasy need
me break out did not enjoy that at all I
did use this up I did it I did use up
this little reluctant lift instant skin
smoothing mask I did not like this at
all either it actually made my skin itch
really really badly so I think I had a
little bit of an allergic reaction to
that I did use up this little sample of
the Sunday
the title brightening enzyme water cream
I do love this I think it's very
beautiful I went through I think six
samples of this I have like a six-day
pack so I did see a difference with
using it I vote I would say about five
to six days I noticed that my skin
looked a little more firm and bright and
it is a nice moisturizing cream so not
like the best moisturizing cream I've
ever used but it does go hand in hand
with the other Sunday Riley products so
if you have a like me nighttime skincare
routine filled with Sunday Riley
products that's a nice moisturizer to
look into and then I did use up two of
these Sephora Express eye makeup remover
wipes this is what they look like they
were junkie they were shitty they
smelled like alcohol and they burnt my
eyes so did not like those alright guys
so that was the info spotlight for the
month now we are going to go ahead and
talk about teas so if you're wondering
why on earth like I talked about teas
every single month it's because I'm a
big tea drinker
I love teas so I do like to come on here
once a month and share with you guys I'm
mighty favorite so the first one is one
that my friend of Rochelle actually
recommended to me she's actually my best
friend if she recommended I try this one
out from Tazo and I think she mentioned
this in her monthly favourites video
I'll link that down below in the
description bar but this is from toss
though this is the apricot vanilla creme
it is a treat of white tea that delights
with hints of fresh apricot in Tahitian
vanilla the caffeine level is pretty
darn good on this and I notice if I
drink this in the morning
it actually can kind of like I don't
know I don't feel like I need a cup of
coffee so this is really really yummy if
you do like white tea which I do I feel
like white tea isn't super strong and
overpowering I think you would adore
this the actual vanilla and apricot in
there are very very slight but very very
yummy tasting so I've been enjoying this
a lot I love this Hawk I don't like it
iced and I do like it with a tiny bit of
agave nectar alright another tea that we
have been loving Tom and I both have
been loving this you gyro kuru green tea
from Teavana this is what it looks like
and it's beautiful it is a loose leaf
tea so let me show you guys what it
looks like it's gonna take a little
pinch out for you guys it's gonna look
like drugs but it's not and that is it
it is beautiful it has really really
nice like long stem and leaf oh my god
it smells amazing absolutely amazing it
smells exactly like matcha green tea
really really good has a little bit of
nuttiness but a little bit of sweetness
to it as well we've just been adoring
this and I like this
client I like it plain I will drink it
iced I don't need any sweetener in this
it just he's so good it has a little bit
of caffeine in it as well I also have
been loving this wild orange blossom
soothing herbal infusion of orange
hibiscus and light floral undertones
from Teavana this is another amazing
loose leaf tea and I'm trying to open it
so I'm gonna show you guys what it looks
like um so this is what it looks like on
the inside as you guys can see you have
some little bits of strawberry some
raspberry oh my god it smells amazing
and then orange peel and it's just such
a nice soothing herbal tea to have at
nighttime I don't put any sweetener in
it at all I just love the way it tastes
it tastes even better ice though in my
opinion and my final tea favorite for
the month is definitely my lemon zinger
herbal tea this is a wonderful tea from
celestial Seasonings that I adore this
isn't K cup version this has been like
my sleepy time tea for the month I
recently got a huge batch of sleepy time
and this one and actually this one puts
me to sleep just like sleepy time so
what I like to do with this is put in a
little bit of raw honey and mix it
together and I drink it hot it's
absolutely delicious that this has been
my other tea favorite for the month and
we do have a tea empty for the month and
that is these Celestials so let's
celestial Seasonings peppermint herbal
tea this is caffeine free I love
peppermint tea it's really nice if you
are someone like me who does sometimes
get like an upset stomach peppermint is
so so so soothing especially in the
morning sometimes I wake up and I feel
slightly sick and that sounds weird not
frightening or anything like that I just
wake up and sometimes I feel sick and I
cannot even like drink coffee or any
kind of like green tea black tea
anything like that so what I'll do is
just have a little bit of peppermint tea
now of course this doesn't have any
caffeine in it but it kind of like coats
my stomach so that I can go in with my
coffee or anything else that I want to
so really really love this and will
repurchase so anyway that is sample
spotlight in tea time would live for the
month of September I'm sorry this is
kind of late I know it's already October
1st I really don't like when people post
like their favorites in the middle of
the next month does that make sense but
I feel like I've fallen guilty of that
this month so I do apologize it's a
little late I'll make sure to be on top
of it for October but yeah that is it
and don't
I will definitely have another video for
you guys tonight I will probably do the
lorac mega pro 3 review and swatches for
you guys and then the rest of the videos
will be tomorrow and then next week
you're gonna start getting into my
declutter series which I'm so excited
about so thank you so much for you know
commenting this morning on the video and
thank you so much for watching so I'll
see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
