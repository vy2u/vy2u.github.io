thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day I am
here to share my samples that I used up
for day one and day to a sample week and
if you're not going to sure what sample
week is or you're confused by my
background and everything that's going
on I will link below the video where I
announced sample week which was my
weekly favorites video that I posted on
Sunday so that will be linked below if
you're curious as to what I'm doing this
week and if you keep seeing videos like
this this week and you're thinking what
are these the link will be below where I
described everything so anyway um yeah
I'm just going to show you guys what
I've used up so I'm going to start with
day one the products that I used up on
day one the first one was from sure leak
this is the skin balancing face oil and
I absolutely loved this you guys I loved
it to the points that I am going to go
ahead and purchase a full size of this
product it's a beautiful beautiful oil
it has a little bit of a tint in it so
actually does kind of make your skin
glow a little bit it doesn't have any
sparkles or anything like that but I
really really love it it has a beautiful
undertone of lucky Rose scent you guys
know that these your league brand has
one of my ride-or-die skincare products
which is the rosewater balancing mist
which is amazing so I was very very
excited to try this out and I absolutely
love it it did not leave me overly oily
on my skin I think if you have
combination skin or even oily skin you
could use this to moisturize so this was
amazing and I am going to go ahead and
purchase a full size of this these are
leaked skin balancing face oil the
second product that I used up was from
Korres or Korres this is the Greek
yoghurt foaming cream cleanser it's for
all skin types I really liked this a lot
however i'm not going to purchase a full
size of it it just didn't really wow me
it does come out in a really really nice
cream consistency and then when you put
it on your skin it does start to foam up
a lot and it's really beautiful it has a
lovely scent if you are sensitive to
fragrance you probably would not like
this one but I did like it a lot I just
didn't feel like it completely cleaned
cleaned my face if that makes sense I
think it's more of just a basic kind of
cleanser so I will not purchase a full
size of this but I was happy to use it
up and it was quite lovely the next
product I used was the origins
original skin renewal serum this has
willow urban it and it's supposed to
help with brightening properties and
helping dullness on your skin I really
really liked the consistency of this
product I thought that it's sunk into my
skin really like previously fast like
literally I put it on my face and then I
touch my face and I felt like I put
nothing on it so it's not extremely
hydrating or anything like that but it
is supposed to help with dullness and
kind of brighten your skin up I don't
know like those aren't really big
battles that I have with my skin I'm not
always trying to brighten it as far as
just like help with acne and also help
with acne scars I guess brightening
properties could be nice for acne
scarring but it just didn't really wow
me to the point where I'm like oh I need
to go out and get a full side of that
serum I did like the fragrance of it I
like the consistency and I did like the
fact that it's sunk in right away but I
will not purchase a full size of this
one alright the next product I used up
was from Sephora this is the Express I
makeup remover wipes these were just
okay they smelled like acetone like
literally pure acetone so a little
strong for fragrance if you are
sensitive obviously on your eyes this
will bother you I actually thought it
really was going to burn or something it
didn't at all it actually did remove my
eye makeup really really well so these
might be nice for traveling but I'm just
gonna go ahead and not purchase so just
because the smell really got to me and
the wifes are really small to you they
were like this big they're not very not
very large and then the last product
I've used up for day one of sample week
was this Garnier clean plus nourishing
cleansing oil this used to be my
ride-or-die cleansing oil for removing
my makeup you can even use it as a
cleanser if you have dry skin however
most people use it to remove their
makeup on their face and I thought you
did such a good job and ah wait I had no
issues with it until I tried a better
product and the one that I use now if
you're curious is the bozhe break up
makeup break up cool cleansing oil I
love that one it leaves absolutely no
residue on my skin and it doesn't have a
harsh fragrance like this one does this
has a very very perfumey fragrance so if
you are sensitive you may not like this
but it is under ten dollars at the
drugstore and if you've never dried the
bow
makeup break up quote cleansing oil you
can try this one first because I'm sure
you will really like it but it's
literally just like the bow she looks
like a step up it just didn't leave any
residue on my skin which this one does
kind of leave a little bit of an oily
residue on the skin but again I think
that's also because it is a cleanser for
dry skin so it is supposed to leave a
little bit of something there but it
does completely remove the makeup
however like i said i have just found
something better so i will not purchase
a full size of that one all right let's
move on to day two so the first thing
that I used up was from fresh this is
the black th delay cream I love the
fresh black tea age delayed I
concentrate and also the overnight mask
however this was not good for me
whatsoever I put this on my skin last
night and I'm telling you I looked like
I put I poured like Crisco on my face it
looked so oily it was really really
really bad I mean it really looked
horrible and um I actually had to go
ahead and take a cleanest Kleenex and
dab it over my face to remove some of
the oil and I'm someone who can handle
oils you know I do oil cleansing I
sometimes will just put oil on my skin
in general like there's your leak one or
like I said that you know josie maran
argan oil i really like marcuzzo oil but
this was so so oily I just couldn't do
it so I would not purchase a full size
of this product by the way if you hear a
dog scratching like you hear a collar my
mom's dog is having like an itching
attack he's like scratching his ear and
the collar is going anyway the next
product I used up yesterday was from
living proof this is actually a hickey
hair care product and it is the prime
style extender this is locks in your
style longer it weighs weightlessly
perfects your hair it has
weatherproofing ingredients and it's
time-saving I did blow dry my hair
yesterday which is something I don't do
often I did blow dry it and I ran a
straightener through it which I really
don't need to do I have naturally
straight hair so it's not really a
necessity but I did go to two different
Christmas parties yesterday so I just
thought you know I might as well just
wear my hair down blow it out it would
look really nice and shiny and i will
say today is the day to and it's
looks really really nice and shiny like
I just blow it out this morning so I
think this product really does work well
i like that it didn't weigh my hair down
it didn't leave any residue in my hair
so i'm going to go ahead and purchase a
full size of this alright i also used up
agar make clean plus nourishing
cleansing oil i have a lot of these
samples so you're probably going to see
them this week like i said they do
remove makeup well they're just not my
favorite so i won't purchase a full size
of that a product i'm going to go ahead
and purchase a full size it full size of
is from nude this is the detox
brightening fizzy powder wash with
vitamin c omega three six and nine and
rose hip see this also has enzymes in it
this is great for in the morning it
comes out in a powder form and it turns
into a paste when you put like water on
it and basically you rub it in and it
really micro dorms the heck out of your
face like it's really really nice I know
Josie Maran recently came out with a
powder like a exfoliating powder that's
very very similar to this one I haven't
tried that one but I love this so I'm
going to go ahead and purchase a full
size of this it feels like pop rocks are
popping on your skin it's really really
cool and then the last product that I
used up that I absolutely adored and I'm
also going to go ahead and purchase a
full size of this it is the j'adore Dior
beautifying body milk this was amazing
it's one of those products I almost wish
I hadn't tried out because I know it's
going to be really pricey but it smells
so good if you've ever smelled these
onto our fragrance it's very very boring
kind of amber like with lots of musk
undertones it's just so so so good I
don't actually have the perfume I need
to get it um but I just absolutely love
this body milk like I said it is a body
milk so it sinks in really really
quickly it's not a body butter it's not
a body lotion it sinks in so so quickly
and I think on a night where you just
want to pamper yourself it's kind of
like a spa night or whatever the last
step after like taking off you know
taking a bath and taking off your face
mask or whatever putting this all over
your body would be amazing the fragrance
really really sticks with you especially
if you want to go out like on date night
or something to it sinks in so quickly
it doesn't leave any residue on the skin
and that fragrance stays there all night
or all day so I am going to go ahead and
purchase a full size of that as well and
i do want to let you guys know
last day of sample week on sunday i will
show you guys all of the products that
i'm going to purchase a full size of so
you guys can get a better idea of what i
really really liked but anyway that was
day one and day two of sample week i
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you tomorrow for day 35</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
