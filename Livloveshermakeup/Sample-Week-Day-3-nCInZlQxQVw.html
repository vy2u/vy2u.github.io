thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day i get
back to share these samples for day 3 of
several week for you guys so basically
these samples that i used up yesterday
and i'm going to let you guys know if i
would purchase a full size of the
product if i liked it what i thought a
bit all that kind of stuff so the first
thing that I used up yesterday was this
little 3-step system kind of thing I
guess you could say it's from oly
henriksen this is the number one truth
serum collagen booster which is a
vitamin c serum basically you also have
these sheer transformation step 2 which
is basically just a really really
lightweight moisturizer and then you
have step one for the PM which is the
invigorating night treatment and that's
what you use at night or in the PM the
other two you can use in the morning so
i had already tried a few of these
products I've already tried the truth
serum collagen booster and also the
sheer transformation cream I had never
actually tried the invigorating night
treatment but i really really really
liked the invigorating night treatment
i'm going to start with that one they
rip off like this so this is what the
invigorating night treatment looks like
i really really liked it had a really
really nice tingly sensation on my face
it's filled with a a chaise it helps to
basically resurface and kind of help
with any sort of texture you might have
on your skin and I put it on and it sunk
in immediately and I did end up topping
it with a moisturizer I'll show you guys
the one that I ended up using but I
really really like this a lot I did
notice I've got a little irritated on my
face my face did get a little red but I
just think it was because of the aaa's
in there and the fact that the enzymes
are kind of eating away on the top layer
of the skin but overall I really really
liked this product and I'm going to
purchase a full-size and I actually got
really really lucky because my mom
recently picked up this little for
little wonders kit from old a henriksen
and it did not work out for her she did
not like it at all so she is going to
let me have these products and it just
so happens that that overnight
invigorating night treatment is in there
so this is a smaller size it's not
completely a full size there is 0.5
fluid ounces in here or 15 ml but still
it's nice to have kind of a full size of
that product um she also in that
it's got a 0.5 fluid ounce bottle of the
truth serum collagen booster this is the
serum that I talked about and I'm kind
of glad because this was about my second
or third time trying out this serum and
I really really didn't like it when i
first used it i thought it was kind of
slimy it didn't really go on very well
it just didn't really feel like i was
doing anything for my skin however i
noticed a big difference um when i used
this sample actually yesterday it's just
it was one of those things i put it on
my skin it smells like a what's that ice
cream called orange creamsicle ice cream
it smelled exactly like that and I just
liked that it it just glad you know it
glides on really really easily it is
like slightly slimy I know that sounds
kind of weird but it slightly slimy but
it does sink in really really quickly so
I just want to say these two products
right here they share transformation
moisturizer and the truth serum collagen
booster serum are really really nice if
you're someone who doesn't like to have
a lot of products on your skin if you
don't want to feel way down and feel
like there's tons and tons of just
products built up like on your face
these are fantastic because they really
do sink in quickly and they're very very
lightweight so I was actually happy that
in that little four wonders kit that my
mom got she did have a little um kind of
bigger than trial size of the serum in
there as well because I was definitely
thinking about purchasing a full size of
this one as well after trying it out so
the invigorating night treatment and the
truth serum I really really liked one
that I'm going to leave for her is the
sheer transformation the perfecting
creme this is just okay i find that um
it works better i actually have like a
tiny little deluxe i sample of this from
sephora that i have actually mentioned
in a weekly favorites video before and I
feel like this works best when I add in
my polished choice resist moisture
renewal drops so it works really well if
you add an oil in here but just alone it
really doesn't um moisturize my skin as
well as I would like it too so I'm going
to leave that cream for her because I'm
just not going to go through it so I
would not purchase a full size of this
the sheer transformation cream there's
something wrong with it it just is so so
lightweight and I do have combination
skin that tends to get drier during the
winter months so it's just not for me
and then what a little thing that came
in that little four wonders kit that she
got I was gonna go like this like four
wonders but I went for wonders the level
four wonders kit is the ultimate lift I
gel I haven't even tried this this was
not one of the samples I use but I'm
excited to try that one alright the next
sample I used up was on the Daisy Marc
Jacobs perfume I really don't like this
perfume I have so many samples of this
and I'm kind of like I don't even know I
may just end up getting a lot of these
away because this fragrance is just not
for me it has a nice kind of florally
like overtone basically it smells a lot
like floral but then there's some kind
of weird sour I always smell something
sour like the undertone is kind of
salary salary do you not I mean it just
smelled a little rancid to me I don't
even know why and I don't think i can
get any more out of here to actually try
and explain to you guys it just smells a
little sour and it's not just the sample
it has been basically every single
sample of this that I've tried so yeah I
will not purchase April size of this
Daisy by marc jacobs i know a lot of
people love that perfume it's just not
for me um another product that i used up
was from belief this is the believe in
truth the true cream aqua bomb it's
supposed to increase your hydration
level by eighteen percent and it says
our belief is to deliver instant
moisture to with lady's mantle which is
a hydrating herb it says this refreshing
gel cream provides weightless yet
long-lasting hydration and I really did
like this however I just want to say a
full size of this is around I think
thirty or forty dollars this reminds me
exactly of my Neutrogena neutrogena
hydroboost water gel moisturizer which
is a lot cheaper at the drugstore you
can get that for a fifteen or twenty
dollars and you get a much bigger tub so
I will not purchase April size of this
but it is really nice it is kind of gel
like and it sinks in very very quickly
it has kind of a cooling sensation i
think it is nice for people with oily
skin and also combination skin so i did
like it i just won't be purchasing a
full size of it alright another sample
that I used up is from urban decay this
is just their original I shadow primer
potion I have this in April sighs so
there's no need for me to purchase it
but it's a very very good primer
your eyes you can even put it on any
areas where you kind of crease
throughout the day it's really nice
under the eyes as well and on any areas
I Reese a little bit around my mouth
because they smile a lot and I play
flute and I'm out with constantly
flexing these muscles here so it is
really nice there too because it really
does prevent and help with creasing all
right another sample that I use up
yesterday is one that's really really
overhyped in my opinion this is the kate
somerville exfoliate and this is
supposed to be basically it says
hollywood's two minute facial it's
supposed to be a microdermabrasion
treatment and I am so not into this you
guys everybody raves about this and says
it's like the best for I'm exfoliating
your skin i just don't really see it i
honestly don't see it i don't think it
did a lot for my skin whatsoever if you
have a sensitive skin you're going to
hate this it really really feels like
you're rubbing sand on your face I have
a lot more exfoliating cleansers or
exfoliating scrubs that do much more for
my skin and honestly don't irritate it
as much as I felt very irritated and my
skin felt very irritated after I use
this so I would not purchase April size
of this alright another sample that I
used up is from origins this is the
ginseng refreshing eye cream i'm going
to go ahead and purchase a full size of
this product it's beautiful everybody
raves about this ginseng line in general
i've heard that the scrub is really
fantastic as well and the regular
moisturizer i think i have tried this
before I wasn't really wowed by it I
think what it is about this product is
that it's not intensely moisturizing if
you're expecting something that's really
going to help you know with fine lines
or just um not necessarily fine lines
but you know when you put a heavy duty
eye cream on if it's really really full
and has a lot of like hydration benefits
to it it will plump up those lines and
this is just not super super
moisturizing if you're someone who deals
with a lot of dryness or again wants to
kind of plump out and fill in those fine
lines this is not going to do it for you
all this does is um brighton &amp;amp; D puff it
has a little bit of a iridescent kind of
tint to it so it really does brighten
underneath the eye area and I do find
that it does help to deep pop a little
bit i don't know if it's just because
the eye gel is a little um it's like a
little cold it's very very refreshing i
don't really know how
see how to describe it but what I
noticed is that it definitely brightens
up my under eye area and it definitely
helps to deep puff so I would recommend
only using this in the morning since I
don't know you don't really need those
benefits at night when you go to bed but
i will be purchasing april size of this
origins ginseng refreshing eye cream
alright another product that i used up
yesterday was the bamboo water lock mask
this was nothing special in my opinion i
have a lot of masks and i have used a
lot of masks and I just didn't think
this was like the most amazing thing
I've ever put on my skin it did help to
retain moisture I noticed that yesterday
after I had removed my makeup my skin
was a little raw and I put this on and
when I took it off I felt like there was
more moisture like when I washed the
mask off I felt like there was a little
more suppleness a little more softness
and moisture in my skin however on I
have tons and tons of masks that can do
that this is from the brand um herb
Orion by the way er be 0 rin it is a
Korean skin therapy brand and I'm
guessing that you can get it at sephora
because i think that's where i got the
sample but anyway um I have a lot that
are comparable to this a lot of masks so
I will not purchase a full size of this
vamp of water lock mask and the last
sample that I used up yesterday that i
will be going ahead and purchasing a
full size up as well is the it cosmetics
number 50 serum collagen veil anti-aging
primer it says it has hydrating
anti-aging peptides essential lipid-rich
oils of vitamin extracts and botanicals
innovative technology if you guys have
been watching me recently within the
past I would say month or so I recently
hauled from it cosmetics um there what's
it called they're like pink primer it
comes in like basically the same exact
bottle as this one except it's pink and
it's supposed to be their sensory
awakening hydrating primer I love it to
pieces I think it's fantastic and this
one is not actually very similar
whatsoever this has a lot more of a
silicon II texture I feel like it really
does fill in your pores and things like
that whereas the pink one really just
has that nice sensory awakening smell to
it but it also just leaves a lot of
moisture on the skin it doesn't
necessarily have a silicone e pour
filling sort of thing going on so this
one does I thought
was fantastic i really enjoyed it so i
will be going ahead and purchasing a
full size of this so anyway that is it
to those are these samples that i used
up and um those are the samples i used
up yesterday and this is day three of
sample week so make sure to join me
tomorrow for day 4 and i will share with
you guys um the products values up for
that so i love you guys so much thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
