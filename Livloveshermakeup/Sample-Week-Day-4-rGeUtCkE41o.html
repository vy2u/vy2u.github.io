thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having a fantastic day oops
I'm grabbing other samples over here but
anyway welcome back to sample week we
are on day four and i am showing you
guys the products that I use yesterday
so the first two that I used up our the
moisturizing shampoo and a moisturizing
conditioner from the brand husk these
came together i believe i got these at
Ulta these are part of their macadamia
oil line and they are supposed to help
hydrate and protect your hair they are
free of sulfates and parabens I really
really liked the conditioner I'm going
to get a full size of this one it had a
beautiful beautiful send it had a really
nice texture and I used it as a pre
shampoo treatment before I got in the
shower yesterday and it worked really
well to help detangle my hair and just
like make it more manageable basically
however the shampoo was just a little
too basic for me I like something that
really really lathers up usually on my
scalp and this kind of didn't is just
was like me it was just okay so i'm not
going to purchase a full size of this
however those are really really well
priced like the hospital in general is
really really well priced they make some
wonderful wonderful deep conditioners
that you can get in little like sachets
or packets and they also have um you
could get like a full-size would seem
like a squeezee 2 for 4 99 Altos so
definitely check out the line because
they are pretty good um the next thing
IV stuff was from strivectin or stream
ekdin this is the advanced retinol day
treatment with SPF 30 i was really
excited about this because normally if I
were retinol during the day I really
make sure that i have an SPF on because
retinol can make your skin sensitive but
it can especially make your skin
sensitive if you're wearing it and
you're out in the Sun so I was really
excited to try this unfortunately it was
just really really greasy it smelled
like sunscreen it felt like sunscreen
and it actually made my foundation break
up a little bit yesterday so I did not
like it I will not purchase a full size
of this product just a little too greasy
from us can another kind of hair product
that I was not into at all that was this
little duo here this is from Rita Hazan
and you're supposed to use step one and
then step two this is a two-part weekly
remedy for color-treated damage fried
and frizzy hair I just don't like when
they have like adult
treatment like this because I'm like
what's the difference of between this
and putting like a deep conditioner in
my hair laying it sit for five minutes
you know um I feel like two steps is
just two steps too many I'm sorry do you
guys know what I mean like I already
have a like it takes a lot of time to
wash my hair and conditioned my hair
because it is very long and I'm just
like I don't want to have to do a
two-step system so that was the first
thing I didn't like about it the smell
was um a little too much it was a little
too perfumey for me it was nice but just
it was overbearing and I just didn't
feel like it did very much for my hair
even so I will not purchase these Rita
Hazan weekly treatments the next product
I you stuff was from sephora i love this
i'm gaining full size of this blush this
is the colorful blush in number 5 sweet
on you this is an iridescent finish they
also have ones that are in glitter
finishes and matte finishes their
supposed to be ultra thin texture long
lasting they really were a very
blendable beautiful beautiful apricot
kind of peachy shade this one was I got
about three uses out of this and I just
thought it was fantastic it was gorgeous
it was so blendable so pigmented so
creamy I'm super impressed and I feel
like I never would have tried those
luscious out unless I got in a sample so
I'm really really happy that I did um a
primer that i use yesterday was from
amazing cosmetics this is the line
smoother plus primer this was just okay
kind of had an overbearing smell again
sort of like the marina has on it wasn't
a similar Center this one was a little
more like eucalyptus minty but you
really really made my eyes water so any
cut any time like I get a product that
just makes me feel a little sensitive
around my eye area or something I can't
put around my eye area I usually just
kind of steer clear of those products so
anyway it was ok I'm it did have a very
silicone e texture to it which probably
makes sense since it's a smoother and
smoothing wait what does it call lime
smoother primary a smoothing product but
yeah it's supposed to basically smooth
out any sort of fine lines pours all
that kind of stuff and it did that
really well but i would recommend this
one instead this was another sample that
i use down my t-zone this was the
perfect little amount here they had like
this little bubble right here and this
is the perfect amount for your t-zone
this is the Porefessional this is from
benefit it's just a
minimizing bomb that you can put down
your t-zone anywhere they up large pores
I recommend this over the amazing
cosmetic amazing cosmetics one it has a
better sent it kind of smells like lemon
and it just goes on really really nicely
like it doesn't ball up on my skin it
doesn't overemphasize any dry areas it's
just perfect so I love that and I
already have a full size of it so I
don't need to purchase it and then they
last sample that I used up was the extra
moisturizing balm from Bobbi Brown I
ripped off the top part so I think
that's what it's called but I really do
like this I like the center has kind of
a botanical sent to it but i'm not going
to purchase a full size because if you
guys saw my 2016 makeup use up a video
which i will link below if you guys
haven't seen that on this basically just
products i'm going to try and use up
this coming year um but i actually have
a full size of this product in a tinted
version so I like that better because I
can wear it during the day it gives me a
little bit of coverage and I still get
the same oyster icing benefits so it's a
really good product if you want to wear
it at night you can get the one that has
no color to it but if you wanted you
know where during the day you can get
the one that is tinted so those are the
samples the IV stuff yesterday I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching I will be back with
sample weekday five tomorrow so yeah see
you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
