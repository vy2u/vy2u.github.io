thank you so much for joining me i hope
you're all having a fantastic day and if
you celebrate christmas i hope you're
all having a very very wonderful holiday
today i am here to share a day five of
sample week with you guys so i'm just
going to show you guys the samples that
i used up yesterday and yeah let's get
right into it the first thing I used up
was from the brand fresh this is the
black th delay I concentrate this has no
need fruit juice in it it helps firm and
illuminate I'm obsessed with this eye
cream I has like a little pot of it from
Sephora it was like a hundred point perk
and I absolutely loved it it lasted
forever i am going to go ahead and
purchase a full size of this cuz it's
just amazing it smells like black tea it
really does help to kind of firm up the
under eye area but it has a lovely
lovely texture to it it's very very
thick and i find it very moisturizing
without being greasy so i will be
picking up a full size of this product
that is what the sample looks like the
second product that i went through the
second sample i went through is from
hourglass this is the veil mineral
primer with broad-spectrum SPF 15 it is
oil-free this is really really lovely
this reminded me how much i used to love
this primer i had a full size of it and
it's just beautiful it does leave a
little bit of a white cast on your skin
so you might want to be careful i am
quite fair skinned and i was surprised
to see that i had a bit of a white cast
but it literally just glides on like
silk it makes your makeup lasts all day
it is absolutely lovely so i'm going to
be purchasing a full size of this one as
well the next product that i used up i
will not purchase a full-size that i did
not like this at all this is from the
brand lumene which i believe is a
norwegian or swedish brand this is the
time freeze instant lift serum it has
intensive lifting firming properties in
it and it also has um wild arctic lingam
berry in it and it's supposed to be
magic drops this was a really really bad
serum I didn't notice that it did any
tightening or firming on my skin I used
it last night and actually had a really
really unattractive on silvery cast like
on my face I think they were trying to
go with like the illuminating effect but
it really just kind of went wrong
because it was so so um it just looked
like literally I painted my face silver
it was very very strange and I can't
imagine
that I would even like that during the
day like it was a bit too illuminating
so I didn't like it also smelled really
really funky so I would not pick this up
um yeah definitely not purchasing equal
sides of this one I did not like it
whatsoever a product I did like but I
won't purchase a full size of it's from
the brand nude this is the Omega
treatment rescue oil it is supposed to
be an ultra sheer facial oil I don't
really know about that that's the first
thing that I'm kind of like it I don't
really know I feel that it is quite
heavy on the skin if you're really
really dry skin you would absolutely
love this I don't think it sinks in
really quickly and I don't think it's
very sheer it does say it has um it
helps refine and smooth texture on your
skin it has coleus route that clarifies
it has just a ton of like Omega rich
acids in it basically it's got omega
three six and nine that is what the full
size looks like it's not that this is a
bad product it just doesn't smell
relatively wonderful I find it very very
thick and quite greasy on my skin so
I'll you know stick with the other oils
that I like like the josie maran argan
oil or even the maracuja oil from Tarte
I find is a lot thinner than the
consistency of this one so it's just a
little heavy weight for my skin if you
have very very dry skin or aging skin
that is like dehydrated you might really
like this though so yeah the nude Omega
treatment rescue oil it was good I just
would not purchase a full-size oh and
then the last product that I used up for
the last sample I used up was from
benefits this is the puff off I love
this little look at this little card how
cute is that they always had the cutest
packaging this is the puff off um what
is this even called it's called the
objective to do I gel to help smooth the
look of puppies so I actually have a
full size of this product you guys are
probably seen you mention it in weekly
favorites I love this it basically it
looks like this in the full-size you
can't really get like a feel of the
full-size in this sample because it
comes with like this little bubble here
and I think the best part about this is
that it has a cooling tip applicator
that is really really precise and small
like a little triangle it really gets
underneath the eye area beautifully so I
feel like you do get like a nice little
sample but of course you don't get like
the actual applicator with it so I think
the best part of this eye cream is the
applicator because this day's really
really cold and cooling you guys can
probably see it a little picture of it
right there but anyway I love this
product I do already have a full size
and I will repurchase it when I'm up
with it it has a wonderful wonderful
kind of tint to it is a little pink like
pink toned i would say which really
really does help brighten up the under
eye area i only use this in the morning
because it does have that tint but it's
basically an eye gel which is another
really really fun and like alternative
to an eye cream I feel like I gels
really do kind of wake you up in the
morning they help with puffiness and
that little polling tip applicator with
this particular I gel really helps a lot
so anyway I already own this in full
size I love it and yeah so anyway those
were the samples that I used up for day
5 of sample week I hope you guys will
join me tomorrow where I show you guys
day 6 and then sunday will be the last
day and i will be showing you guys the
products that i am going to purchase a
full sizeA from all the days i'm just
going to combine them all together and
let you guys know which ones I
participants eyes up so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you my next one
