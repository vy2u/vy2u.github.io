thank you so much for joining me as
always I hope you guys are having a
fantastic day we are on the
second-to-last day of sample weekday six
so I am sharing the samples that I used
up yesterday with you guys so let's get
right into it the first sample I used up
was from the brand fresh this is the soy
face cleanser it's for all skin types
it's rich in amino acids and it says it
gently cleanses eyes and face so this is
what it looks like um I did really
really like this I think it's a very
very gentle cleanser it's very
comparable to like cetaphil the cetaphil
gentle cleansers or things like that
however it just has a really really
interesting funky smell to me and I feel
like all of the soy products from the
brand fresh have kind of like a sour
weird smell to them I'm not quite sure
why also some of their what are the
other ones that they have they have like
a Greek yogurt one or something like
that that also smells a little funky to
me as well so I will not purchase a full
size of it because of the smell it just
really really bothers me but it does
cleanse very very well and I know that
that probably shouldn't be something
that bothers me like it's just a
cleanser you know what I mean but I'm
someone who's really really big on sense
so something is disturbing my nose then
I'm not going to want to use it so
anyway it is a really good product I
just did not like the scent so I will
not purchase a full size of it alright
the second product I went through was
also from fresh this is the soy
conditioning I makeup remover with
soothing malo extract it removes
waterproof makeup again it had that
funky funky kind of soy whatever sent
and it just smelled kind of sour to me I
just don't know how else to describe it
other than like a sour smell it just it
was very strange and I don't like it at
all and I feel like all of their soy
products smell like that so I'm just not
a fan and also this stung my eyes like
crazy so I would not purchase this in a
full size alright so the next sample I
went through was from Smashbox this is
the photo finish foundation primer this
is the original one the one that's just
a clear silicone sort of primer I feel
like there are so many products on the
market now that you can get that are so
similar to this so there's
no point to spend I think it's
thirty-six dollars for a full size of
this so I will not purchase but you know
like monistat chafing gel so many
different baby skin primer from
Maybelline these are all like literally
duplicates for it this particular primer
so I will not purchase this in April
sighs all right moving on i also used up
a sample or two samples from clinic they
are the number two exfoliating toner or
the clarifying lotion and the step
number three which is the moisturizing
dramatically different moisturizing gel
I like both of these I used to use this
whole 3-step line from clinic so I
really did enjoy it a lot I think that
the toner is really really nice if you
have any active breakouts it does have
it does have alcohol in it so if you
have dry skin you're not going to like
it but i would consider purchasing a
full size of the toner just not anytime
soon i haven't been dealing with super
super bad breakouts lately mostly just
hormonal acne which is something that I
always get you there's a little bit
looking out and just as a warning it
does kind of smell like acetone are like
nail polish remover it's really not a
great scent but anyway that is the
clinic clarifying lotion I will not
purchase a full size of that and then
the other product that I used up is from
Clinique this is the like I said
dramatically different moisturizing gel
sorry if I'm looking at but one of our
neighbor dogs is outside so cute but
this is the dramatically different
moisturizing gel it looks like this this
is a really nice product I actually have
a I don't want to say it's a full size
but I have a larger size of the
dramatically different moisturizing
lotion which i think is fantastic as
well but I really like the moisturizing
gel because it is a little more
lightweight and it just sits really
nicely on combination or oily skin so it
is nice but I will not purchase a
full-size all right I feel like I didn't
like a lot of the samples i use
yesterday but there was one in here that
i really did like so let's see here this
is from the brand did you do husk yes
husk I showed I think two days ago um a
shampoo and conditioner that were from
the macadamia line of husk products this
is the argan oil one so it doesn't have
a very good sent it smells very very
like a reminiscent of lemons which I
think it's fine it's not
a fantastic sent like the macadamia one
but it does smell good and it was funny
because in the video two days ago I said
I didn't like the shampoo but I was
going to get a full size of the
conditioner in the macadamia oil scent
and it's the exact opposite with this
one I am going to get a full size of the
shampoo and not the conditioner the
conditioner just didn't do much for my
hair and um this one's supposed to help
like strengthen and restore your hair it
is free of sulfates and parabens and if
you watch the video from two days ago I
said you know oh yeah the shampoo just
didn't give me enough of a lather and
that's probably because it's sulfate
free well I don't know what is different
between these particular products but
this one oh really really laugh it up
nicely for me so I'm going to get a full
size of this argon oil repairing shampoo
I think it was a really really fantastic
and I really liked it again the smell
wasn't like the best thing on earth but
it was just fine alright another sample
that I used up yesterday was the clinic
Moisture Surge extended thirst relief
gel cram this is what it looks like I
used to have a full size of this I
really really enjoyed this but I have
found duplicates at the drugstore now
neutrogena came out with a hydro boost
water gel which is really really similar
they have the water gel and then they
have the gel creme which is very very
similar to this one as well so I think
you can get comparable products to the
clinic one at the drugstore so there's
snow you know no need to purchase
something that's more expensive if you
can get it at the drugstore for cheaper
all right and then the last product that
I used up I really do like this is from
marc jacobs this is the decadence
perfume um yeah this was just super
super powdery smelling it just had a
very very I don't even know how to
describe it it just had a very powdery
scent and I'm not into that so I will
not purchase a full size of this so
anyway those were these samples that I
used up for day six of sample week I
hope you guys enjoyed this please tune

final samples basically all the products
