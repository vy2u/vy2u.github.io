thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day as
always we are on the last day of sample
weekdays seven right yes day seven thank
you to everybody who join me this week I
really had a lot of fun filming these
videos for you guys going through
products I have a lot this whole little
baggie worth which has about definitely
more than 10 samples in here of
basically products that I'm going to
purchase a full size of i will show you
guys those at the end of the video but
in this video um well in this at the end
of this video i will be showing you guys
that but at the beginning of this video
i will be showing you guys the products
or these samples that i used up
yesterday so let's get right into it the
first product I used yesterday was from
the brand nude this is the Omega
treatment milk this has omega-3 five six
seven and nine in it I really really
liked it because instead of being like a
thick kind of moisturizer it was very
very very very thin liquidy and sunk
into my skin immediately I've really
really been enjoying this brand nude in
general so I'm very very excited that I
have found some really really fantastic
products that i can use from there and
products that you know i never probably
would have picked up to be completely
honest i never was super interested in
this brand until i started using up some
samples so i'm really really excited and
i will be getting a full size of this it
just sunk in really really quickly it
does have a bit of a natural smell it
doesn't smell fantastic however it also
doesn't smell horrible so I do like it
the second product that I've used up
which I'm also going to purchase April
size of is from drunk elephant this is
the Virgin marula luxury face oil it
helps hydrate and has anti-aging
properties in it also has vitamin e in
it Omega 6 and 9 and it also has
antioxidants in it so really really
fantastic product it is a very luxurious
facial oil it collide on like butter and
I mean I know any kind of facial oil
kind of glides on like butter because
it's well an oil um but this really
really has kind of a thicker texture to
it but it sinks in you know your skin
drinks it in it doesn't just sit on top
of the skin I would say the consistency
is similar to the tarte maracuja oil if
you like maracuja oil this is very
similar however it really really does
sink into the skin so I
be purchasing a full size of this
product the next one that I used up was
a sample of the product candy perfume
this is what it looks like and the
actual bottle looks like this as well
it's pink black and gold which i think
is adorable I didn't like this at first
when I first sprayed it on I smell a lot
of powdery overtones and I don't like
that with fragrances at all however
after I let it sit in for a little bit
or sink in um you know everybody's skin
responds differently to perfumes and it
really really just started smelling good
on me like vanilla and caramel and candy
and it's just right up my alley so i
will be purchasing a full size of this
and that is what the bottle looks like
how beautiful alright the next product I
used up i will be purchasing a full size
of also oh my gosh i feel like i'm
purchasing a full size of everything
this is the first aid beauty ultra
Repair a hydra firm sleeping cream it
helps hydrate firm and smooth your skin
and it is safe for sensitive skin I was
able to use this everywhere on my face
around my eye area it was very very
luxurious and thick it had a beautiful
texture and I'm so happy that I finally
have found a product from first aid
Beauty that I actually like I don't like
their cleanser I didn't like their toner
they had a very musky weird scent to it
I don't know if I just got a bad batch
um but my friend hailey is probably
watching thinking like oh my gosh
finally she found something that she
likes from the brand because she loves
this brand and I never really did
however now I have found something that
I really do love so i will be purchasing
a full size of this night cream alright
the next product that i used up was from
josie maran this is the Argan
exfoliating cleansing powder this is a
gentle gentle daily skin renewal powder
basically what you do is wet your face
you pour the powder on and you start um
you know massaging it into your skin it
is nice i will be purchasing a full size
of the nude one i showed you guys two
days ago the brightening i'll show you
guys at the end of the video it's in
it's in this little bag it's like the
brightening fizzy wash it feels like
there's like pop rocks going off on your
skin it's really really cool but anyway
this is similar however this one was a
lot more gentle and honestly my skin
could take a little more scrub than this
so i will be getting the other one this
one I'm going to pass on but this is
what it looks like it would be a really
nice option if you have very sensitive
skin and you still want to get that nice
exfoliation in the
running alright the next sample I used
up was from by beauty this is the agave
lip mask trio so they had three
different samples in here of the
champagne natural and smashed shades the
natural one is the middle one and that
is just the clear one I have a full size
of that at home I love it it is my
favorite favorite lip product of all
times as far as moisture moisture
ization goes um it's a very very thick
it tastes good and it just really really
glides on beautifully and um the
champagne one this one right here this
was a no-go for me and it had a peachy
pinky color to it but with an overcast
of like a silver iridescent to it it was
very unflattering on my skin tone it
just looked very very strange I think if
you have medium to deep skin tone it
would look really really pretty but it
was very very ugly on me and it looks it
just made my teeth look more yellow and
things like that I did not like it at
all however the bottom shade right there
smashed please excuse my nails my little
holiday nails are starting to come off
but that color down there smashed was a
beautiful cherry kind of pinky color
beautiful on the lips absolutely going
to purchase a full size of that one
alright the next product that I used up
was from stope and Gloria this is the
righteous body butter we've probably
heard about this I know a lot of soap &amp;amp;
Glory products are kind of facing out
right now on a lot of different websites
however this body butter is really
fantastic has an amazing amazing smell
to it if you never smelt this you really
really should I will not participate
full-size though it is a little heavy on
my skin I always prefer a body milk or a
body moisturizer before a body butter
even though I have a lot of body butters
um but the scent is identical to a hand
cream that I have from them called hand
food so I don't need to purchase a full
size of it but they sent is amazing you
guys very very fresh and clean really
really good so I do recommend it however
I'm just not going to purchase it I
don't like the heavy feeling on my skin
alright let's see where though oh I
think that was all of them right yep
those were all the ones I used yesterday
so now i'm going to show you guys this
little sample baggie of the products
that i will be purchasing a full size up
so let's get right into it all right
now you guys have already heard me talk
about all of them in depth so I'll just
be going through them and showing you
guys the first thing I'm going to get a
full size up is the argan oil of Morocco

wearing on my face this week and
kind of stuff but thank you so much for
everyone who has enjoyed sample week I
really have enjoyed it a lot I'm in the
talks with my friend Meg right now Meg
Bernardo here on YouTube about kind of
incorporating this into a monthly sort
of thing um we haven't really talked in
detail and how we're going to do it if
it's going to be a week lawn or just a
day like each month where we show you
guys samples and kind of give you little
mini reviews on the products but this
will be a continuous thing on my channel
I'm like I said I probably won't be
doing it i'm not going to do it every
single week you know but definitely once
