channel today I have a fun in quick
little video for you we're going to be
talking about samples that are nothing
like the full-size I don't know if you
guys have noticed but I have seen a lot
of discrepancies between a little paper
samples a little packets deluxe pie
samples and full-size items and these
are all samples I've tried multiple
times so I definitely have a good
understanding of what is different from
one another sometimes the sample is
better than the full-size and sometimes
it's the other way around so let's go
ahead and sum right into it and the
first one I want to talk about is the
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray
I think the sea salt size is much better
than this little guy right here there's
something about this one that just
smells like alcohol like really really
strongly of alcohol every single time I
get it I do know that the full size does
have alcohol in the ingredients list but
I have gone through four full sizes of
the full size I've gone through I think
16 of these but yes I do tally them up
I've gone through 16 deluxe sized
samples of this and every time I use it
I just noticed that the full-size you
use to keep my makeup on a lot better
even though this is filled with more
alcohol which you would think would
making your makeup last a little longer
but yeah there's something about this
smells a little off every single time I
get one I don't notice that it sprays
out as nicely like the actual mister and
then on top of that I just feel like the
full-size makes my makeup last a lot
longer
so if you have to write out this in less
size and you're like oh it's not that
good it cost me the full-size is a lot
better alright next we have narcy's
orgasm blush I actually think that the
sample is much better at than the
full-size blush I did recently go ahead
and invest in the full size which is
about thirty or thirty two dollars for
this baby right here and honestly the
reason why I prefer to the sample over
the full size is because I feel like a
cat author card color is concerned now
this one definitely has a rosy hue to it
with a little bit of peachy informe
undertones and some gold Sheen running
through it but the sample that I tried
out three different times definitely had
a lot more of a rosy hue to it I have a
cool undertone I thought it looks much
prettier and honestly it was a lot more
blendable when you do get it in the
full-size these are very very firmly
pressed in here so honestly I preferred
at the sample if you have tried out the
sample IV both sides is a little
different it's not really a product I
regret purchasing but I will say the
sample is much better alright next we do
have some products from a glam glow I
feel like the glam glow samples are
completely different than the full sizes
and I know that
because I bought pretty much everything
from Gleb glow in full size in the past
I don't anymore because glam glow does
tests on animals but here we have the
super bug clearing the treatment and
then right here I have the much to film
you cleanse daily exfoliating cleanser I
don't really love this in full size but
this one is completely different than
the full-size and then this guy right
here
I think the reason why these don't do
very well in little deluxe sizes
100-point perc form or even in the
little packet form is because they are
mud and they get even more dry okay you
really need that nice little table where
you can like seal it if you have tried
this out and you're thinking what the
hell is everybody talking about this is
not that good and go ahead and purchase
one of the little mini ones they're like
$22 $22 you can get them at the front of
life Sephora lines like when you're
about to check out I would highly
recommend checking them out they have
some really good products but honestly
the samples are nothing like the
full-size alright next we have the
belief the true creme aqua balm and now
I know that this is nothing like the
full-size because this is actually my
boyfriend's favorite moisturizer and
sometimes I stick my fingers in there
and I used up of it okay and this is
really really slimy feeling I noticed
that the moisturizing balm one is
completely different it's very much like
the full-size which I've gone through a
full size of the moisturizing balm but
the actual full sizes it has a negative
buoyant texture it's got a really nice
aromatherapy sort of like I don't know
it sort of smells to it kind of smells
like a Veda haircare products this has
no scent to it every single time I get a
little pouch of this it's a lot more
slimy and honestly it doesn't hydrate my
skin at the same way so I just wanted to
give you guys a heads up the Belize true
creme aqua balm is an amazing
moisturizer but the sample really is
nothing like the full-size alright next
we have the ambient lighting a powder
duo here from hourglass this is actually
a sample that I think you can currently
pick up at Sephora I've gone through two
of them and I will say this one right
here which is mood light is exactly
identical to the formula that you would
get any full-size I know because I'm
obsessed with the ambient lighting
powder formula I've gone through
multiple multiple full sizes of a cereal
like this guy right here which is called
a diffuse light and I have gone through
a full size of those lights so really
really enjoy those this diffused light
shade right here you buy every single
time without fail I go in with my brush
and I don't even know if it's going to
show up on camera there are chunks of
glitter in this one and if you have
tried out
ambient lighting powder formula use the
formula there as you know that they
absolutely do not have chunks of glitter
and it's a very very seamless a really
light areas beautiful formula it goes
onto the skin with the beautiful Sheen
is this has glitter that is not this is
not a true representation of what this
product is like in full-size so I have
to say if you have tried this out and
you've been like what the is that
trust me the full-size is much much
better and finally guys that we have
these two guys right here so these are
both skin care items the first is the
bare minerals corrective so I haven't
tried the brilliant future age defense
and renew eye cream or the age defense
renew serum but I've gone through two
full sizes of the skin longevity vital
power infusion which is an awesome
awesome serum the reason why I haven't
repurchase lately is just because I had
been getting more PR like skin care
products and I want to make sure I get
through those so I don't have as much of
stuff going that in my collection but
this is an amazing serum and the sample
does it absolutely no it just it doesn't
smell the same it's a very thick which
if you have tried out to be full-sized
even know that it's super super liquidy
serum I mean I'm talking like water
light okay and it just doesn't do it any
justice whatsoever this is these
beautiful beautiful serum insults I
highly recommend you just go ahead and
purchase the both sides I think it would
be great for all sorts of different skin
types but yeah I have to say the sample
is really really crappy and then right
here we have the Burberry fresh glow
luminous fluid base so I do not actually
own at the full size of this and my
friend does though and I tried it at her
place and I was like what what this
sample is so much better you guys I've
gone through like 12 a little minis of
these and then I've gone for three full
size deluxe is not full size but like
the less sizes and this is so much
better than the full size but both lines
actually has this really really sticky
formula to it and this one again is kind
of similar to like the vital power
infusion in full-size this is very very
liquidy very beautiful on the skin and
it does make your makeup last pretty
much all day long and it gives a nice
Sheen to it the full-size was completely
different I asked my friends to nor I
said give me I was like did you as you
are just sitting around in your
collection for a while when she goes no
I just purchased it why and I was like
try the sample and she was like oh my
god it's so much better so anyway guys
those are sample
that are nothing like the full-size
whether they're better or they're worse
than the full-size let me know if you
have tried out any products that you've
noticed this with as well and definitely
let me know if you guys want a part too
I feel like I can definitely talk about
life you know some mascaras as well I
feel like a little bit less size
mascaras are never as good as the full
size so if you guys want me to do a
mascara addition or a second edition let
me know down below but yeah that's it
for today's video thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
