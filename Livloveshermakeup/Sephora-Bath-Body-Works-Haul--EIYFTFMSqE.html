today I have a little collective haul to
share with you guys I have been so into
collective hauling recently I don't know
if you guys have noticed I know some of
you do prefer when I do Hall separately
but honestly I've just been loving
combining them so anyway today i am
sharing with you guys a hall from
sephora and also from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
i will have time stamps down below if
you would like to skip ahead to the bath
and bodyworks section or segment but we
are going to start with Sephora so the
first item that i purchased from sephora
was the elizabeth and james nirvana
bourbon perfume if you watched not my
last Sephora haul but the Sephora haul
before that one you know that I got a
little deluxe I sample of their new
sense so they have bourbon and they also
have rose and I fell in love with this
one the Rose scent is also very nice but
it only smells good if you mix it with
this one and if these are kind of made
to mix but this one smells like really
good by itself so i thought i would get
this one because i don't want to have a
perfume that i have to mix with other
perfumes to smell good the rose one did
not smell good by itself so anyway I did
pick up the one fluid ounce container of
this one I love the packaging like it's
so sleek and so beautiful perfect for
fall and this scent is perfect for fall
it literally smells so woodsy and so so
so delicious so I was super excited to
get that and they second item that I
picked up was from Tarte this is the CC
colored clay CC eye primer my favorite
um I primer stick recently just like
tried out like crazy so I thought I
would pick this one up and it seems
pretty promising the packaging came and
it looked kind of like gross like it's
kind of like all muddled up and was kind
of smushed in there but I don't mind I
really just like having I primer sticks
because they're so easy to use this is
slightly dark but I think it will be
nice for cancelling out darkness on my
eyelids so anyway that is the next item
that I picked up I also picked up
something from nest fragrances Tom and I
have really been into this brand
recently we like their liquid truffle a
lot liquid truffle woodland truffle
liquid hand soap a lot especially Tom
and I saw that this was on sale it is
the nest fragrances beach room spray and
right now we just like to have like
little like aerosol cans that spray out
like nice smelling things in each
bathroom obviously but I thought this
would be really really pretty in the gas
thrown so yeah it's basically just a
room spray and that is what it looks
like let's go ahead and take a whiff oh
yeah it smells really good very very
beachy and I just thought it would be
pretty because it's also kind of like
decoration for the actual guest bathroom
which we don't have tons and tons of
products in the guest bathroom and then
they last item the I picked up from
Sephora was the Urban Decay electric eye
shadow palette this was recently on sale
for twenty-four dollars I have wanted
this forever you guys I cannot even tell
you I did end up finding a palette that
was quite similar it is the NYX ultimate
eye shadow palette but when I saw that
this was half off I was like I needed so
anyway that is the outer packaging
really really pretty and this is what it
looks like a few of you are asking if I
would do a it's on sale is it worth it
for this particular product but
unfortunately it looks like this already
sold out which I'm not surprised about
so that's really cute to look at the
brush it has like little purple bristles
on it I love that so anyway yeah I
picked that up super super excited to
play with that I will definitely have a
follow up for you guys soon and I won't
be doing a huge follow up for all of the
past Sephora halls the past for support
halls that I have done all right i typed
in a little code for clinic this is the
acne solutions acne plus line correcting
serum and I don't know what the code was
it was something like line smoothing or
something so I thought we would try this
out it does have salicylic acid in it
which I do enjoy on my skin and then
also maybe that was a hundred point /
because I think this was the code this
was seven days worth of the clarins
serum or something like that yeah the
younger looking firmer radiant double
serum so seven samples worth of that to
try out so i will have those and then
the three samples that i picked out word
the Korres um black pine active firming
sleeping oil I also got the Lancer the
method polish which is just a face
exfoliator and also the what is this
hair care green and olive lavender scalp
oil I've picked that up a few times in
the past couple of weeks alright so that
is everything that I got at sephora
let's go ahead and move on to Bath and
Body Works the first two items that I
got worthy pumpkin pie three wick
candles so I got two of these to go
ahead and burn in the living room
pumpkin pie is my all-time favorite
scent that ah they released this time of
year
I will say this one smells a little
different it's a little more spicy this
year but basically they describe this as
they blend of let's see here creamy
pumpkin vanilla creme fresh ground
nutmeg and graham cracker crust last
year I feel like it smelled a little
more sweet but it still does smell good
don't get me wrong the next three but
candle we got to was pumpkin cupcake and
this is one that I purchased every
single year oh just smells amazing
absolutely amazing this is a fragrance
of let's see here whipped butter cream
pumpkin spice and vanilla cupcake you
know it's weird you know how they used
to like write this whole like paragraph
on the back leg smell the delicates and
blossom whatever cupcake nah I don't
know um but now they just put literally
fragrance notes and they give you the
notes so anyway I'm always like used to
like reading a paragraph but this time
it just says whipped butter green
pumpkin spice and vanilla cupcakes Oh Oh
smells really really good and look at
the lids on these look at those lids
that is so so so cute so really happy to
have gotten that one and then I also
picked up this one it is new to me it is
called pumpkin french toast oh it smells
like maple syrup and again a cute little
lid here and this one is let's see here
the fragrance notes are warm maple syrup
pumpkin spice and caramelized brown
sugar this is new this year super super
cute packaging love the package on your
bed love it and then it the last one
that we got wait that's not it sorry the
last one we got is pumpkin pecan waffles
which is 1 i've been getting for like
two years now i love this scent it is
amazing it is a blend of maple syrup
golden waffles pumpkin spice and brown
sugar I just smelled a whole lot of
golden waffles and pumpkin spice yes
smells so good so that one is going to
be in the beauty room so those are the
candles we got and then we also picked
up two little refills of our Wallflower
packs so we got kitchen spice which I
already plugged to these into the
kitchen and then we also got pumpkin
pecan waffles for the living room and I
already plugged those in as well so
anyway that was my little collective
haul I hope you guys enjoyed this video
