video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Sephora collection
blush bronzed and ready to glow face
palette this is exclusive it is new and
it is a limited edition obviously I
purchased mine on the Sephora calm
website since this is the Sephora house
brand I purchased it for $32 but it is a
$96 value this will be available for
everyone to pick up on September 23rd I
got mine a few days early because I was
a VIP Rouge member or ma vib Rouge
member this does include a stand-up
mirror to tutorial look books a cool
toned blush a warm toned blush a bronzer
and also a highlighter you are getting
for 7 point 5 gram pan sizes so each one
has seven point five grams of product in
it which is amazing for $32 if you are
someone who is looking for a really nice
valued you know holiday kit for this
season I would highly recommend checking
this out this is what the outer
packaging looks like very nice I like
this little design here I think it's
very pretty it says Sephora and then on
the back you are getting the ingredients
for all four of the products that you
get in here the actual packaging is
really gorgeous as well it is made out
of cardboard but if you guys can see it
has like a little raised glitter surface
here some dark pink and also some light
pink on the back it shows you your cool
toned blush your warm toned blush your
bronzer and also your highlighter they
don't have names for these products
that's just what they call them my only
really big complaint with this is the
fact that it is quite flimsy this is
cardboard packaging and I do think that
I will end up going ahead and D potting
these particular products so when you
open it up you do have a mirror here
it's one of those mirrors that kind of
makes your face look a little funky so
it's not completely like even I don't
really know how to explain it but it
does make your face look a little
strange in some area so that is the
mirror it's kind of a cheap one you do
have this little flap here that you can
open up and it does have two little
tutorials here to show you guys how you
can apply these particular products but
this is what you guys want to see look
at these absolutely stunning the second
that I saw these hit the Sephora website
I was like look how beautiful and I have
to
I am incredibly impressed if you are
looking for a nice face palette for the
holiday season and you don't want to be
spending 50 60 70 dollars this is a
great great value and these are really
nice quality I have been a fan of these
Sephora collection for a while now I
really like like they're so for a wipe
you guys know one of my favorite
mascaras of all times is the outrageous
curl mascara from the Sephora collection
and I feel like they have been stepping
up their game as far as like formulation
is concerned on their powder products
last year I got some sort of a kit from
them I can't remember what it was I
returned it it was some sort of like a
blush kit I didn't end up liking it I
felt like everything was really firmly
pressed in there and they just weren't
very nice on the skin however this year
I have to say incredibly impressed with
the formulation on these they are very
silky very buttery and they apply it
beautifully if you guys are curious I am
wearing it as the bronzer shade today
the cool toned blush and the highlighter
right here you have the warm tone blush
like I said the highlighter the bronzer
and the cool tone blush I feel like
these colors would show up on the
majority of skin tones I'm not gonna say
they're gonna show up on you know every
single skin tone because obviously there
are certain products in here that would
be better for different kind of skin
tones this highlight down here is not
exactly amazing if you do have fair very
like fair complexion like me just
because it does darken up a little bit
on the skin I do have it on today but I
feel like that is the one part of this
palette that isn't exactly the best the
other three products right here I
absolutely adore and I do feel like they
would show up on the majority of skin
tones this particular bronzer probably
won't show up on those of you who do
have a very very dark complexion but for
the most part I feel like this is very
good for all sorts of different skin
tones I like that they put in a warm
tone blush in a cool tone blush I am
wearing the cool tone blush today since
I do have a cool undertone in my skin I
think they're very flattering on the
skin and they look very beautiful if you
look up close you guys can see that each
one has a little bit of a sheen to it so
these are not completely matte on the
skin I would say they have a very satiny
texture and look to it and finish to the
skin if that makes sense
but they are very soft and creamy and
buttery they feel a lot softer when you
swatch them than say like my Tarte
holiday on blush kits but I will say
when you put your brush in here you are
getting a lot of kick up because they
are so soft and silky I think that the
Rays
texture doesn't really ruin anything
sometimes when you do have like a raised
texture like that it can be hard to pick
up an even amount on your actual brush I
feel like I don't have any sort of
problem with that so it's really a
really a nice kit right here so anyway
let's go ahead and do some swatches also
I do want to touch on where time really
quickly I do find that these wear a
little longer if you do pair them with
like a nice setting spray the one I've
been using this week is the dewy finish
long-lasting setting spray from NYX this
is what it looks like I feel like these
do last longer on the face if you do
pair them with a setting spray if you
rain a nice primer and also kind of like
a sticky foundation they stay on even
longer but I would say these we're about
eight to nine hours which is pretty darn
good
so anyway let's go ahead and start
watching shall we we're gonna start with
the bronzer which is up here again they
feel so soft and silky to the touch even
with that raised texture I'm just so
surprised and look at the pigment on
these this particular bronzer definitely
has more of a warm tone but I don't feel
like they skip when you swatch them or
when you apply them on the actual face
as you can see they do have a little bit
of a sheen to them and I think that
bronzer is just absolutely gorgeous it
definitely leans more on the warm tone
but I can still wear it and I still
really enjoy it now we're gonna go ahead
and swatch that highlighter which
obviously has like three different
shades going on in here when you do
actually put it on the face it comes off
as sort of like a champagne color like I
said I'm wearing it today it's not my
favorite out of the palette it's
probably my least favorite but I still
think it is pretty it is darker than my
skin tone but it has a little more of a
chalky consistency to it than the blonds
the blonds are the bronzer and the two
blushes so there is the bronzer there is
the highlight not as pigmented as the
bronzer or the other two blushes but
still it is quite a good one and then
they last you that we have here are
obviously the cool toned blush and then
the warm tones blush the cool tone is
just absolutely stunning on the skin
that is what it looks like it comes off
a little more mathy once you mix
everything together and then the warm
tone blush has a little bit of like a
bronzing effect in it so here is the
cool toned and here is the warm tones
again I think both of them are really
stunning and they go on so beautifully
you see that one swipe so there we have
all four of the products that you get in
this particular kit like I said if you
are looking for a good value and
something that's not extremely extremely
high-priced this time of year I would
HIGHLY
and checking this out you can use this
and gift it to someone during the
holidays pop it in you know your
Christmas stocking if you celebrate
Christmas whatever you celebrate I feel
like this would be a really really nice
palette to gift someone so there is the
cool tone blush there is the warm toned
blush there is the bronzer and there is
the highlight very very impressed with
this kit you guys so anyway I hope you
enjoyed this review and swatches on the
new Sephora collection blush bronzed and
ready to glow face palette I will link
