I'm doing a review on a newer product
that I saw recently on the Sephora
website I have you guys as these guys
can see from my past couple of videos
I've been picking up a lot of new
products recently but immediately I
wanted to get this one right after I saw
it because it looked like it could be a
dupe to a high-end product this is the
Sephora brow enhancer this particular
shade is in 0-1 matte light pink and
they have one two three four five six
different shades that you can get so the
thought is that you can take this and
put it right underneath your brow brow
brow bone for some lift and definition
for your actual brow I like to
personally take it either on the back of
my hand color in a little bit on the
back of my hand and take a little bit of
that and Pat it underneath my brow or
even take a little bit on my finger and
then Pat it underneath I don't like to
directly go like this I think it just it
skips a little bit it just it looks a
little chalky it just doesn't look good
that way but my favorite way is to apply
it on the back of my hand or to take it
on my finger and Pat it in I am wearing
it today and I really think it just
gives really really beautiful lift
underneath the eyebrow and I'm really
impressed and I love it now as I said I
think this could be a dupe for the what
is that benefit has a product similar to
this that you just put right underneath
the brow bone is really supposed to lift
it that's why I really wanted to pick
this up so like I said I purchased this
for $12 in this four website they have
six different colors the first one is
0-1 matte light pink which is the one I
have the second one is 0-2 beige shimmer
the third one is 0-3 Maps and the fourth
one is 0-4 matte beige the fifth one is
0-5 mapped spice and the sixth one is
0-6 pearly opal so I really really love
that they went ahead and they took a
wide range of skin tones um like this
one this really really light one is
great as a highlight for my skin tone
which is pretty fair and then the deeper
ones also can compliment darker skin so
I think that's really really great good
just for us let me brief you guys a
little bit what it says on the website
it says it is a jumbo jumbo highlight
pencil for defining and enhancing the
problem what it does inspired by the
contouring trend this Brown answer was
designed to make eyes look bigger and
brighter the creamy texture helps the
formula glide on softly so it's easy to
work with and provides natural results
the pencils jumbo size allows for quick
and convenient application and a variety
of tones in matte or shimmering finishes
flatter all skin tones for any occasion
this product is ideal for concealing any
redness associated with eyebrow removal
so say you were plucking or waxing this
can really lighten up that area and it
says um it was tested on 32 women for 14
days 91% found that the pencil was easy
to use 82% found that the pencil hid
redness from eyebrow removal 82% found
that the pencil provided even coverage
and delivered consistent results and 82%
found with the pencil brightens their
eyes so I'm really really happy with
this I have been going and looking at
that benefit pencil for quite some time
now what it's called but I do think it's
a little more expensive than this and I
was so happy when I saw this come on on
Visa for our website and I thought oh my
god that's exactly what I want so I went
ahead and picked this one up instead for
less money so really really happy with
this again they have shimmers they have
maps they have all different ones that
will fit your specific skin tone so I
highly highly recommend it as you guys
can see it really gives some nice lift
to the brows I'm sure you can also kind
of put it on the inner corners of the
eyes maybe even use it as a highlighter
I feel like this is a multi-purpose
little crayon so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review I will link below where you
guys can pick this product up and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
