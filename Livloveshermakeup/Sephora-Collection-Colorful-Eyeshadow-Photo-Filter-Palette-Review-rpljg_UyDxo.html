hope you guys are having a fantastic day
today I will be doing a review for you
guys and it is on a new product from the
Sephora collection or like yes sephora's
name brand collection that based out
obviously at Sephora and it is the
colorful eye shadow photo filter palette
in sun-bleached filter it comes in a
cute little box like this it's really
really nice little packaging you can see
that it's like this peachy color with
like a girl with balloons like just
really really pretty packaging and
actually the actual palette looks like
this too so let me show you guys what
the actual palette looks like like I
said it's really really similar to the
box packaging really really beautiful
packaging um again you have that kind of
like topi peachy I don't know like color
and then you get these really nice
pastels and the girl with the balloons
again and it's kind of like a little um
it's not like a tin but it's definitely
um like durable you only mean like it
could take a lot it's got like the
plastic topping and then it opens up and
inside you get a huge mirror that's
really really beautiful and then you get
the shades so this is what the Sun
bleached filter palette looks like they
also have another one which is more like
cool smoky tones and I think what they
were trying to get by this whole like
release of these palettes is that they
are part of their I believe their
colorful eye shadow shades so some of
them are like bestsellers and then some
of them are just added into the palette
but they're trying to get into that
whole like filter thing you know like
everything it's so popular nowadays to
have like a filter on everything and you
know recently two faiths came out with
the selfie powders and I think that this
was kind of sephora's way of jumping on
that kind of bandwagon but four eyes so
like I said they have like a smoky one
and that one is called let's see here
overcast filter cool and breezy and then
they have the one that I have which is
Sun bleached filter which is soft and
Sun inspired and this one just really
spoke to me because I thought the colors
were just so beautiful and very warm
and they just seemed like those kind of
colors that you could just pop on in the
summer and it will look gorgeous with
everything really glowy beautiful
whatever those kind of colors so I have
to say I do like this palette I don't
love it I don't think pigmentation is
completely there with this product I
would say it that it has these nice Oh
Lily no ripping up the carpet sorry my
cat what are you doing um I will say
that the pigmentation like I said is not
completely there with this palette um I
think it has something to do probably
with the shades if you were to get the
cool and breezy or what's it called
overcast filter one I feel like maybe
the pigmentation would be a little
different because it is darker shades
but because I got those ones that are
really Sun bleached you know really
really light and just like barely there
almost kind of shades I think that that
probably has something to do with it but
then again those are the kind of colors
that I just was like feeling um
sometimes I do I mean I could see myself
purchasing the overcast filter palette
and really really liking those nice cool
smokey kind of tones but I was just
really feeling the warmer ones I thought
it was really beautiful reminded me a
lot of like that rose gold trend that
kind of went around for a while but also
just being very very neutral and I think
that that's something that a lot of
people look for during the summer time
whether it be for the skin for the face
you know like minimal kind of makeup and
I think that these um shadows do get off
a very like minimalistic look I am
wearing um three shades today um for my
eye look on the inner corners I am
wearing swan song
swan song which is one of my favorites
is this beautiful beautiful color right
there it's like a pinky um I think I
would describe it as like a pinky almost
light lavender almost white color it's
very like opalescent and beautiful and
iridescent and I have that on my inner
corners I think it brightens so
beautifully and then I also have it
underneath my brows on my brow bone and
I think that it is a beautiful beautiful
kind of highlight color if you guys are
wondering I
rang mary-lou manizer on my cheeks
though that's what's giving me the
golden kind of glow but the light
reflecting you know like kind of almost
purplish I don't know it's crazy this
this this some colors almost like
purpley can you see that
that is what I'm wearing on the inner
corners and then underneath the brow
bone and like I said I just really
really love this color I think it's so
beautiful and it's so glowy and it kind
of reminds me of what is it the
hourglass ambient lighting powder the
one I have which is like the cool white
toned one in Athey real light it almost
looks like that it's really really
gorgeous so I am wearing that and then
on the lid I also have swan song and
then I worked later Graham which is this
gorgeous like peachy sort of color I
worked that into my crease just as kind
of like a starter color it got a lot of
gold in it as you guys can see it's that
one right there it's got a lot of gold
in it and it also is just like really
really nice and peachy I work that into
my crease and then I went in with sandy
toes which you guys can see is this
gorgeous kind of rose gold color right
here I went in with that and I kind of
work that into my crease and this is
when I started to notice that some of
these colors really they're really
blendable and nice and the pigmentation
is like so kind of light that like I
felt like the shades kind of started to
look very similar when I was blending it
into my crease you can't see all those
shades you really just see kind of one
color and when I worked into the outer
crease was this color right here which
is called selfie and this is a nice kind
of deeper color but then again you know
it looks so similar to the other shades
that I had been working in to the look
they're just so similar when you swatch
them out they don't look similar in the
palette but the minute you swatch them
they look really similar and I work that
into the outer corner of my crease and I
just felt like it looked like I really
just worked one color to my crease so I
don't really love that um the colors are
so similar and they just kind of blend
away at it I'm not a huge fan of that um
but I do think it gives a really nice
soft look appearance even the darker
shades in here
just give a really really nice like soft
appearance to the eyes and it's very
summery and very glowy so I do like that
I will say pigmentation wise like I said
not so great
however the textures of the shadows are
really really beautiful you get a lot of
colors in here that are can be really
great like you know I don't know just a
very very neutral again if you can see
that they look very similar but very
very neutral easy to work into the
crease as like a transition color lots
of great transition colors in this
palette I'm not even gonna lie I mean
just some really really nice matte um
transition colors like whitewash Desert
Rose secret boudoir and walking in the
sand those kind of colors that you see
they're all matte really really great
for transition shades um but overall I
think it is a nice palette do I think
it's worth $32 by the way that's what
the price is $32 I'm not quite sure um I
don't think I am know that I mentioned
like you know I might get the overcast
filter palette I I meant um if I was
feeling those kind of colors you know
maybe they have better pigmentation
maybe I'll go in and swatch them first
before um if I do want to get the other
one but based on this one I'm not quite
sure I would get the other one but like
I said beautiful packaging great for
beginners and makeup who I don't know
who just kind of want to throw on a wash
of color and you really can't mess it up
with these shades they really just don't
have that kind of pigmentation that is
going to allow you to mess up um so you
know yeah I do want to point out here on
the back Sephora collection best-selling
colorful shades it has the little hearts
over the ones that are already in the
permanent collection and secret boudoir
walking in the sand and Desert Rose I
guess are some of the best selling
colorful shades so that's kind of cool I
do like that they made a palette out of
it I think it is um beautifully packaged
great mirror beautiful colors I love the
the thought process that went into the
colors and I like the thought concept
but I think the pigmentation is just
kind of lacking and they all kind of
blend into each other a little too much
so maybe a little more diversity in
shades would have been better so I'm
going to read you guys a little bit more
about what it says on the Support
website
so a
as the Sephora collection colorful
eyeshadow photofiltre palette like I
said you can get some bleached filter or
overcast filter and they are both $32 um
it says a palette featuring 10 wearable
shades inspired by photo filtering
effects what it does photo editing
software is a huge trend in social media
for that picture-perfect professionally
lit look these palettes were inspired by
popular photo filters um and they let's
see here ooh
I just lost my last 9 line oh yes the
palettes were inspired by popular photo
filters putting a fun spin on the
technological trend the overcast palette
contains cool breezy tones for more
smokey looks while the slum Beach Sun
bleached palette includes soft light
filled shades each features brand-new
hues as well as a few best-selling
colorful shades the packaging showcases
gorgeous artwork and each includes a
large mirror and it is formulated
without parabens it says what else you
need to know mix and match shades using
one or both filter palettes which are
sold separately for a fun inspired look
or smoldering smoky finish so anyway
that's a little bit about the pallid and
that is my review on the Sephora
collection colorful eyeshadow photo
filter palette in sun-bleached um i
think it is like I said um well packaged
really really beautiful packaging a lot
of thought went into the whole concept
in my mind
um but definitely maybe just
pigmentation wise need to step up the
game so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this I will link below where you can
purchase the palette if you are
interested and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
