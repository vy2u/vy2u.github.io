super super excited to be doing this
review for you guys today
it's actually a review and I'm also
going to do a demo for you guys on how I
actually use the product but today I am
reviewing the new Sephora I masks they
come like this they come in really cute
little packaging color-coded super
adorable different kind of like slavers
or different kind of recipes I guess you
would say of the actual product and
these go for five dollars a piece on the
sephora.com website or in store so I'm
really excited about these because I
really like the Sephora sheet masks um
they basically are fiber sheet masks
that you put over your face and I always
really liked those I like the
pomegranate one I like the Lotus one I
just think all of them are really really
nice they look really good on the skin
they feel really nice and I think that
they do make a difference I'm someone
who really believes in masking I think
masking is really important and it does
um make a difference for your skin so
when I saw that they came out with the
fiber eye masks I was like I have to get
my hands on those because basically I'm
a so really really um in right now I
guess you could say but they're also
very expensive so to get like a single
eye mask for five dollars actually a
good deal I know that kind of sounds
crazy because it's like that's really
expensive you should get like one or two
or I mean you know what two or three for
that price but actually if you look at
some of the other brands like Shiseido
and dr. jart things like that they're
actually a lot more expensive so the
fact that sephora came out with these
cute little discs of one time use a
fiber sheet mask I thought was really
cool too $5 so anyway I they have seven
on the website and like I said they're
each five dollars apiece I picked up
every single one and I have used three
out of um the rest so basically yeah
right yeah three out of seven of them so
the first one I used was the honey I
mask and I actually feature that are not
featured but I used it up in my last
empties video if you guys go to my
February and March empties video you'll
see that I use that one I've really
loved it it was the first one I tried
out of all of them and it was just
lovely I was really really happy with it
um the other two that I have already
used are the Lotus eye masks which looks
like this
and this one is for moisturizing and
soothing I really liked that one I used
it yesterday and then a few days ago I
use the pearl eye mask which is
perfecting and brightening I also really
really liked that so I've already used
those the only ones I have left now are
the lingzi eye mask which is this orange
one I have the pomegranate I mask I have
the ginseng I mask and I have the Rose
eye mask so I use 3 out of 7 so I have
four left so basically um I'm gonna pop
one of these on I'm going to show you
guys right now how I use it so we can
kind of get started and I can put them
on my eyes and start reading to you guys
a little more about the actual product
and explain what I like about it and
what I don't like about it so basically
I'm just going to pick one of these I
think I'm going to go for the
pomegranate I mask I'm going to show you
guys how I do this so basically it comes
in this little um like cardboard kind of
carton and what you do is you break it
open at the top or wherever you want and
it supposed to just kind of unlatch open
and you get this little pouch right here
and you pop it out like that and you
discard this you know piece and heating
in here basically is the fibril I mask
so you get one for each eye so it's just
like a one-time-use kind of thing and
they suggest ripping right here or
cutting I'm going to cut it so I just
cut it right along that line and then it
opens up and inside you can see it's
really really moist what I really really
like about this product is that it stays
really moist it's really beautiful
I'm just I'm totally into you know
having the product really stick to your
face it requires that it's very very
moist and filled with you know natural
products so I'm gonna bring my bangs
back quickly okay so you take these out
they're super super slimy feeling got it
feels weird I'm going to put a little
paper towel out here so basically you
get these two pieces like so and they
are attached to this plastic thing so
you're going to undo it like that and
you can see you get this little sheet
mask that looks like this and basically
on one side it's textured and on the
side it's just completely flat I like to
put the flat side down first and the
textured side you know so that it's
facing upwards and when I first did it I
went like this because I thought this
was higher sister do it it's not so how
you're actually supposed to do it is
like this so you apply it so that the
long part is going underneath your eye
and this part is wrapping around the
actual orbital bone which definitely
makes sense so you just kind of place it
right under there it doesn't sting I'm
not like allergic to any of the
ingredients in any of these so far um so
I just kind of Pat it in to make sure
it's completely surrounding the eye and
like that I'm going to do the next one
again same thing take it off of the
plastic wrapping go like this and pop it
on and it recommends leaving these on
for 15 minutes I like to leave them on
and tell they're basically dry if that
makes sense because once they're
actually dry I feel like that's the time
that my eye area has completely taken
the product in and completely soaked it
in so that's why I like to leave it on a
little longer than 15 minutes I would
say probably about 30 minutes because
it's really pushing the product into
your skin and you just want to leave it
on there till it gets dry and what they
tell you to do is after it's completely
dry it by the way
when you apply these you need to have
completely bare skin I am not wearing
any makeup I'm not wearing any serums no
moisturizers completely clean skin I
just washed my face with a scrub and I
came in and I'm doing this now so you
really want to make sure that all the
good ingredients that are in these eye
masks are completely penetrating the
skin
so basically oh my Kitty's crying don't
cry it's okay um so basically like I
said you want to let it completely dry
and they recommend leaving on for 15
minutes
I recommend 32 however long it takes for
them to dry because that will mean that
it's really pushing the products into
your skin now the thing about these is
that sometimes like if I move my face
like the use you can see it starts to
get a little like balled up and you just
want to make sure that like you kind of
replace that I have dealt with
worse I'm asked before I've dealt with
eye masks that are really really bad
that move around that don't actually fit
the contours of your face so with a lot
of shape maps like the whole sheet mask
thing that doesn't really fit the
contour of your face but these actually
really do stick really nicely like I
said they are really really saturated in
the product like this one is pomegranate
it's very very saturated in you know the
ingredients so if they really really do
kind of cling nicely but if that you do
feel them moving around for whatever
reason just kind of set them again
replace them in the area you want and
then just let them you know stick so
basically I'm going to read to you guys
a little more on the website about each
mask and what they do so that you know
you can pick the mask that you think is
going to be best for you so let's go
ahead and read on the Sephora website so
let's talk about the one I'm wearing
right now which is the pomegranate I
mask
it says the pomegranate I mask reduces
signs of fatigue it awakens and tones
the eyes for a rested energetic look
which is great because I didn't sleep a
lot last night so really really nice
it's anti fatigue energizing this is one
if this is the one you're going to want
to pick up if you are a rush in the
morning and you need to go and throw
something on because you got those dark
under eye circles or you're just feeling
puffy underneath the eyes I think this
would be really good
so the pomegranate I mask very good the
next one we're going to talk about is
the rose eye mask and that is this one
it comes in beautiful rose packaging of
course because you know obviously has to
um and it says the Rose eye mask
replenishes the delicate eye contour and
gives an immediate radiance boost for a
plumper fresher and brighter look and um
anything that I know about rose like
rose oil rose hip whatever anything that
I know about Rose is that it is very
pampering and it's very soothing and
very delicate and very very very highly
moisturizing Rose properties have very
highly moisturizing properties which is
why you're going to see a lot of um you
know like spray facial toners with rose
in them or you know like I said rose hip
oil or just rose oil in general so I can
definitely see why this would be ultra
moisturizing and brightening so that is
the rose
ask the next one I'm going to talk about
is the pearl eye mask and that is one
that I have already used and I really
like this one
it says the pearl eye mask evens out the
eye contour minimizes irregularities
irregularities and illuminates the skin
for eyes that appear more uniform
radiant and fresh and I totally agree
with that
when I board this um it really really
when I took it off and you know I rubbed
the excess in it really really had a
brightening effect around the eye area
it was really really wonderful so that
is the pearl eye mask by the way I want
to add right now because I forgot to say
earlier these are any kind of sheet
masks that you may have or eye mask you
know fiber masks whatever whether it be
for the eye or the face when you are
done with the product and you discard
them you do rub the excess in to the
skin you do not wash your face you do
not wash it after you rub it in you rub
it in and you leave it because the point
of the sheet mask is that you're not
directly putting a product on your skin
the product is in the actual fibers so
it's pushing into your skin and so after
you want to rub that wonderful product
in but I will show you guys that when I
remove these patches um the next one I
want to talk about is the ginseng I mask
and that's in this bright yellow
packaging super super cute um and it
says the ginseng ms provides a
tightening effect on the skin around the
eyes while stimulating and revitalizing
for toned and energized look engine
Singh is known for toning you know
whether it be I don't know you but or
you cellulite like I've used products of
them before where like cellulite
products that have ginseng in them or
things like that it's basically like
almost like Cathy you know it's like it
stimulates blood flow to that area so
really really good for toning so this is
the toning and revitalizing one next
um the lingzi eye mask which is in this
cute little orange packaging like so and
it says it helps minimize the signs of
aging by creating the look of plump or
smoother skin for a more youthful
looking eye contour so that is the anti
aging and smoothing one
we good for those who have more mature
skin or days where your skin is feeling
really parched and maybe your fine lines
are sticking out a little more than
usual it'd be good to use this one the
next one I'm going to talk about is the
Lotus eye mask that's also one that I
have already used and it looks like this
cute little pink packaging and it says
the Lotus eye mask it locks in water to
reduce the signs of fatigue and strain
for fresh stress Theory traveling
stress-free stress-free and rested eyes
let's read that one again locks into
water to reduce the signs of fatigue and
strain for fresh stress-free and rested
eyes so very very moisturizing you know
immediately you're going to think oh it
locks in water it locks in you know um
it will boost that area's moisture level
which in you know return will basically
make for better looking eyes you know
more well rested eyes less fine fine
lines less wrinkles so that's
moisturizing and soothing I really liked
that one too I have not tried any of
these yet that I didn't like so now I
have used four out of the seven of them
I like the way this feels on my eyes
right now and of course the last one is
the I already read for the pomegranate
I'm asked so the last one is the honey
I'm asked which I did use if you see my
February and March 8th February March
and April No February and March empties
you'll have seen that I used it up and
it says the honey I'm a sinner nourish
ha's and soothes the fine delicate skin
around the eyes for instant relief and a
velvety soft replenished and balanced
eye contour so I definitely felt that
way it smelt really good it was like it
just was so moisturizing and nourishing
I was really really happy with it so I'm
going to read a little more it said what
else you need to know these masks are
dermatologist tested and are quick and
easy use I absolutely agree with that
and of course if they are dermatologist
and tested indeed then they should be
you know safe for your skin and not
cause any irritation um
research results rose eye mask it's at
100% found that they had more luminous
look 100% found that they their eye you
know their eyes appear brighter and 100%
found that the eye contour skin was
moisturized in the pearl eye mask 90%
found
the mask evened out skin tone 97 90%
found that the mass had a perfecting
effect on the eye contour and 90% found
with the mask had a brightening effect
in the ginseng I'm asked 100% found that
the look was toned a 100% found the skin
around the eyes looked more youthful and
100% found that the skin around their
eyes was tightened so these are like
awesome statistics on all of them and
none of them go below at 90% so you know
it's just really really great that you
can actually see a difference
immediately after applying the product
I'm going to read for you guys they had
to use section just so I can touch up on
that it says remove the protective film
from both white fiber patches like I
showed you guys position the patches
under each eye as shown in the diagram
on the package leave them on for 15
minutes then remove and gently massage
any excess product into the skin no need
to rinse like I was saying before
anytime you have a fiber or sheet kind
of mask or eye mask when you do remove
them which I'm going to do right now
because um you know I want to at least
show you guys how I'm doing this so I'm
going to remove these and immediately I
feel like my under eye area is a little
more um like there's a little more can
you see it's a little red there it just
looks a little more plump and pretty and
so what you're going to do is you're
just going to take you know your fingers
and you're just going to rub the excess
in all around the orbital bone and I
know I did not leave these on for 15
minutes but I can already see a
difference in the amount of time that I
did have them on which was about 10
minutes so these are also nice if you
are in a rash in the morning and you
don't actually have time to you know
spend a whole 15 minutes or like I
recommended 30 until they're completely
completely dry as you guys can see
there's a lot more moisture in these I
think I'm gonna pop them back on after I
film this video but I wanted to show you
guys after I completely tapped the
product in or rub it in tell us
completely moisturized it's already
looks more refreshed and bright under my
eyes I really really love it so again
that one was the pomegranate eye mask
love it just as much as I like to be
other three that I had tried
anti-fatigue and energizing I think it
looks really nice under the eyes I don't
look super tired even though I can get a
lot of sleep but um yeah so basically
that was my demo and my review on these
new eye mass from the Sephora collection
really really liked them five dollars
piece you really actually can't get
better I know that sounds crazy because
it's like five dollars for one mask but
to be completely honest when it comes to
fiber masks were just like sheet masks
in general you probably won't get a
better deal than that
so I love that they have so many options
to choose from seven different masks
that you can choose from I think that's
awesome it hits all the different areas
whether it be anti-aging whether it be
moisturizing whether it be smoothing
whether it be you know soothing all
those different kinds of things you're
heating up those areas and you can
specifically pick which mask is the most
suited for your skin tone so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did give
this video a thumbs up and I'll see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
