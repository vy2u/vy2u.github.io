of these videos with me wearing this
outfit today it's just because um on the
days where I actually have time to film
I like to just do like lots of videos in
a row um so today's one of those days
anyway um have another palette I want to
review but this time I thought I'd
change it up instead of just going
eyeshadow I shadow um this is a cheek
palette this is from Sephora this is
called the beauty of giving back face
palette and it's adorable packaging it
has that nice secure like magnetic thing
here and let me show you what's on the
inside so on the inside you get three
cream blushes one ombre bronzer one
ombre blush and then you get a
highlighter a peach blush and a magenta
blush and these are powders so I did
swatch them I right away knew that I
prefer this my Tarte Amazonian clay
blush palette over this but um this was
cheaper and I think it's more affordable
for people and also i don't i don't
think it's like a limited edition thing
so this is nice to have again there were
a few shades where pigmentation was a
little weird i'll show you the swatches
um I wanted to see if they had names for
these but yeah I don't think they do
anyway so let me just show you so this
is the cream blush the three cream
blushes are very pigmented and very nice
i'm very impressed especially that color
right there i like that cool tone pink
this ma b 1 is nice too this is the
bronzer and most people would be
disappointed with this because it's suit
for shimmery i would use it as a bronzer
and highlight but also people would
probably be disappointed at how light it
is i am not because i am very pale I'm
very fair and a lot of the times bronzer
just looks way too muddy and dark on me
so I'm actually okay with this bronzer
this peach peachy ombre one what it is
nice this highlight was kind of weak and
then this peach one was not that great
and then
21 was nice so overall I do like it I
think they had some nice pigmentation in
there i would say the best of the bunch
in this palette are definitely the cream
blushes which is really surprising
normally it's something like this you
know something that would be you would
think would be super pigmented but i
would say the cream blushes are really
the standout the stars in this palette
so I do like it and um I think it's
really cute packaging I like having you
know I these are really the only two I
think blush palettes that I have and I
do prefer this one the Amazonian clay
just because um I like really good
pigmentation like I like to just dip my
brush in and you know no it's gonna go
on like really well I don't like to work
my way up sometimes so um you know yeah
but I I mean it's good and I would have
bought it anyway just for those three um
cream blushes those are really really
pigmented and beautiful and I don't
actually wear a lot of green blushes so
I think this was good i also think its
cool the idea of the ombre I really
think this is truly just a highlight
going into a bronzer that's why it's so
light looking but it's perfect for fair
girls like me so if you're pale you'll
like that bronzer um yeah I mean I
really have no complaints I wouldn't say
you know if I ran out of this I would go
and buy it again um but I think it's a
nice little palette it's very very cute
and it is handy to have and you know I
brought my Amazonian clay blush palette
with me over thanksgiving and it was
great I had every single blush shade
that I wanted and it was all in one you
know setting so maybe I'll bring this
one for Christmas and play with it a
little more I think these are really
nice to have blush pants are really
really a nice thing to have so I do like
this again this is much cheaper than the
tart one um i believe i bought this for
like twenty or thirty dollars and the
chart one was like 40 50 or something so
better deal and yeah i would say it's
good and i actually prefer the packaging
over the turf packaging so I think it's
durable and I like that little snap
closure so
I would say this is a fair palette I'm
if you don't want to splurge on the
Tarte Amazonian clay blush palette go
ahead and get this this this is fine
it's good so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and i'll see you next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
