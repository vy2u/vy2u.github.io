welcome back to my channel exactly we
could go in my channel I did a large
Sephora haul featuring holiday 2017
makeup and skincare so today I am here
to give you guys my first impressions
and final thoughts on those items but
let's go ahead and jump right into it we
will start with me by beauty the perfect
bite to holiday 2017 set so in here you
are getting four deluxe sizes of the
amuse-bouche lipsticks did you get a
little metallic size tin right here with
a large mirror which i think is awesome
I really feel like you guys should pick
up this particular set during the
holiday season I just think it's really
incredible so they bite Beauty a mousse
Busha lipstick formula it's really
moisturizing they are cruelty free they
are food grade and they are just
absolutely beautiful on the lips if you
cannot stand a dry lip product you are
most likely going to like a lot of
products from bite Beauty in general so
the first week we have over here is
called Cayenne it is a bright red shade
it's gorgeous on the lips this was the
shape that I was wearing in the
thumbnail for the Kat Von D scene
consider of review if you guys were
curious in the middle we have the shade
honeycomb which I also do own in a full
size it is like a perfect nude color
with a little more of like a neutral
base so it's not too warm toned it's not
too cool tone it's just absolutely
perfect especially if you do have a fair
complexion over here we have sugar cane
sugar cane isn't my favorite I don't
know if I'll hang on to it I'm not
really the kind of person that looks
amazing and those really light pink
pastel II kind of lilac lipstick so it's
not really my style but I do love this
shape down here which is called rhubarb
now you have to be very careful with
these I would recommend wearing them
with a lip liner and also don't push the
bullet all the way up and put it on your
lips these are very very fragile so Olli
is a little bit at a time but honestly
this is a great set definitely worth the
money would highly recommend all right
up next we do have the beauty liquefied
lipstick set to get four little
liquefied lipsticks hear they have great
applicators a really long wear time I am
wearing the shade whip today however I
would definitely recommend you get the
perfect bite set over this one I just
feel like these are very heavy on the
lips and they're really not my favorite
formula now a lot of people said that
this particular formula was very very
similar to the NARS Velvet lipslides
I definitely disagree I have a lot of
the NARS evolve it applies I won't
just sending further any market and ours
is not cruelty free anymore but they
feel incredibly happy and I feel like
they rub all over my food head joint
throughout the day I am a music teacher
and constantly playing my flute Anna I
feel like I can wear the bite Beauty
lipsticks but I cannot wear these
they're just very very heavy on the lips
it's kind of like when you have on a
very heavy foundation like maybe Estee
Lauder Double Wear or like the Beca
complete coverage creme or even I don't
know cap on D lock-it you know you can
feel that you have makeup on your face I
feel the same way about these little
liquefied lipsticks right here I feel
like I can feel them on at my lips now
they do not drag down so they are not
transfer proof I wanted to let you guys
know and that right off the bat they're
not my favorite formula and honestly I
would not purchase one of these in a
full-size I still do like them but it
would not purchase in a full-size
alright moving on we have the Marc
Jacobs velvet whare and mascara this is
 amazing this has quickly become
one of my favorite mascaras you guys it
has the Too Faced better than sex sort
of hourglass shape to wand
however this is a really really wet
formula not overly wet it's kind of like
the perversion mascara from Urban Decay
it's like the perfect amount you know
how to face better than sex is kind of
on the dry side this is just right in
the middle and it's just honestly
amazing if you have the money to spend
on this I would highly recommend you
guys go ahead and do so it's definitely
one of those trifecta products that
really kind of linked into your lashes
it volumizes them and also gives them a
lot of definition so I love this baby
right here would absolutely repurchase
all righty up next we have the Kat Von D
Saint and sinner eyeshadow palette I
know this is not everybody's personal
preference and a lot of people are not
enjoying this particular palette but I
am I really do love it I love the
packaging I love the concept I love the
overall layout too there are really only
a few shades in here that I think are
duds overall I love the amount of
finishes you're getting in here in the
color selection is bomb so for me I love
the shade martyr I love devil I love
stick of Mota I absolutely adore
Cathedral and having the urges the most
beautiful kind of silvery shimmery
shades on the lid gorgeous I
also loved worship immaculate is
gorgeous and rosary and these are it's
just beautiful beautiful colors I feel
like if you want a good colorful palette
for the holiday season you would go with
this cap on de Saint and sinner palette
right here
I did do a full review swatches and
comparison video that I'll go ahead and
throw up in the cards but overall this
is a palette that I would recommend for
the holiday season
are you moving on we have to come see
about me and drunk elephant skin care
set I have been enjoying every single
product in here except for one so inside
of here you are getting DC from a day
serum in a full-size you are getting a
at deluxe of the bestie jelly cleanser a
small sample of the upper sheer physical
daily defense of moisturizing a broad
spectrum SPF 30 zinc oxide sunscreen and
a deluxe of the bee Hydra intensive
hydration gel so the Hydra intensive
hydration gel is actually something that
my boyfriend Tom is currently using he
really like says but honestly it's just
not moisturizing enough for me I have
tried this out before and I was a little
skeptical when I went ahead and
purchased this because I was thinking I
wouldn't like it and I really just don't
like it it's not for me it's not
moisturizing enough I don't feel like I
can mix it with other oils and things
like that it just has a really
interesting kind of sticky gel like
consistency too and it's not that great
at mixing so and this is something that
I would not purchase in a full-size
however my boyfriend wants in their
full-size so that's good at least we
tried it out over here we have the
bestie jelly cleanser you guys know I
have recently gone through 2 or 3 full
sizes of this cleanser I absolutely love
it I'm gonna go ahead and let my
boyfriend have this little deluxe here
to see if he likes it as well the Umbra
physical daily sunblock this does have
20% zinc oxide in it I prefer physical
sunblock for sure I love it be a little
applicator here that you could just kind
of squeeze it out right here it is
absolutely fantastic this is definitely
a product that I have been enjoying I
feel like it layers very nicely with you
see from add a serum you do need to
follow up with a sunscreen if you are
using the serum add a serum so the two
of these together are great now please
keep in mind physical some blocks are
definitely a little more greasy and
heavy on the skin so if you are coming
from a chemical sunblock to a physical
sunblock you're not gonna like it at
first but it really you can work it into
the skin make sure you're really really
massage it in so you don't have a white
cast on your skin and so it doesn't feel
too heavy but it works really well and I
never break out from physical sunblock
so really have been loving that set to
right there absolutely fantastic the see
if I'm add a serum is just great it's
got a little bit of marula oil mixed in
there and I usually take about 2 or 3
so that in the morning I massage it all
over my face and it just feels nice and
moisturize you know and never feels like
it's stripping the skin which is awesome
I just had to put a bunch of stuff down
and then pick up a whole nother box so
I'm sorry if there's a bunch of cuts in
this video I just can't fit everything
in front of me but let's move on to the
OLED below and this is there 12 days
skin care advent calendar and now
obviously I already broke into mine I
did like some products I didn't like
some others and I still have three more
I need to try these are all deluxe sized
skin care products so let's go ahead and
start with the ones that did not work
for me so there were a few from the oil
control line obviously I have more
normal to dry skin so these don't work
for me but my boyfriend does like that
the first one is the Port balance facial
sana scrub and the second is the
counterbalance oil control hydrator this
is really nice it does have like an
exfoliating kind of particle bead thing
going on and there does heat up on the
skin but I definitely stripped my skin
it's just not moisturizing enough where
it took too much oil off my skin so that
is not a product for me but I would
recommend if you do have convert to
avoid loose skin and also if you do have
very problematic skin and you can't find
a moisturizer that won't break you out I
think you would really like this one and
this is the counterbalance oil control
hydrator with green fusion complex neem
seed oil rosehip fruit extract and ahs I
loved the way this went on it was like a
really nice kind of jelly it smells like
eucalyptus it was very invigorating very
tingly on the skin it does have a pump
everything was very sanitary but
unfortunately it just didn't have enough
moisture in it for me so I would not
participate besides of that all right up
next we do have the pure truth oil this
is the activating oil I do like the
truth line in general I love the truth
serum but I don't feel like this oil is
anything special I have gone through a
deluxe size of this before and I didn't
like it either
again I think you would like it more if
you do have convert to oily skin it's
just not hydrating enough from my normal
to dry skin anymore so we're not go
ahead and purchase a full site for that
and then finally we do have the
invigorating night transformation gel
again it better for those of you with
more competent wavy skin it does have
glycolic acid in it I believe it has
some a Jason that there's just a bunch
of stuff in here that's really really
great for me texturizing the skin
however my skin just can't handle it
even when I follow up with a moisturizer
so that was not for me alright let's
move on to the products I did enjoy the
first one was the force of nurture to
get it like force of nature
in
the Handa creme it has blackcurrant and
echinacea extracts in it it really
really smells good in fact the nurturing
meal I'm kind of smells like the truth
line which is kind of like an orange
orange creamsicle sort of scent so I
really did like this but I don't know I
would purchase a full-size I mean this
is a very very pricey hand cream and I
feel like I can get the same sort of
thing for cheaper so I did like it but I
probably wouldn't purchase a full-size
however this guy right here the nurture
be moisturizing creme I definitely would
purchase a full-size of this so it kind
of reminds me of the glossier extra rich
creme that kind of has like that
lavender scent I recently got that
recently I really got that for PR and I
really really do enjoy that create it's
a very very thick and moisturizing but
it actually sinks in completely and it's
really really nice before going in with
makeup I felt the same way about this so
this is definitely a very very beautiful
beautiful cream if you do have mark
Humbert to oily skin it's probably gonna
be a little too heavy for you but if you
have dry or normal skin would highly
recommend I use that baby up and I
really enjoyed it
another one that I've already used up I
know I go through a lot of people
always ask me how you go through powder
so quickly and how do you go through
skin care so quickly I think it's
because I am very adamant with my skin
care I use it every single day twice a
day and I wear makeup every single day
so I think that's how anyway this is the
truth serum I love the truth serum it's
really beautiful there have been a few
little rumors that they actually what I
had it and reformulated this I don't
really notice a difference between the
old version and the new version I have
gone through several full sizes of this
side this is the great everyday serum if
you are comparing this to the drunk
elephant Seifer mo which one would I
recommend if you have more problematic
skin lots of breakouts lots of texture
that you need to deal with or leftover
hyperpigmentation I would go with the C
Verma if you have pretty normal skin I
would go with the truth serum really
enjoy this and it smells amazing all
right up next I have a product that I
want any full-size for sure this is the
transforming walnut scrub it says well
that powder and ginseng extract it is
just fantastic and I
really had never looked into the blue
line from Ole Henriksen but it smells
great it really does smell like
blueberry it's very very gritty so you
don't want to go like crazy or go hang
out in your face you definitely only
want to use this probably once a week
but I feel like this is very similar to
like luscious ocean salt as far as like
microdermabrasion is concerned or as far
as exfoliating is concerned so I really
like this I am going to go ahead and put
a full-size of this on my loves list at
Sephora and then finally we have the Ola
Henriksen uplifting transformation eye
jela I think this is just okay however a
mister Tia my boyfriend wanted me to go
ahead and feature this in the video
because he said he really really likes
it I have recently got him into skincare
like I will go ahead and show him
products and he actually uses that which
is amazing he doesn't use like skincare
in the morning but he doesn't night time
which is good he used to not look at all
you you know how guys are like wash
their face with shampoo but he really
does like this so he wanted me to go
ahead and mention it to you guys it
really kind of firms up the eye area and
definitely gets a little bit of like a
miniature eye lift or so he says alright
guys and finally I want to share my
thoughts on the 500-point perk that I
picked up from bare minerals and I'm
usually not a huge fan of bare minerals
but I wanted to go ahead and step
outside my comfort zone and pick up some
of these items so the 500-point perk
included a full flawless face brush a
little mini you also get this little guy
right here which is mineral veil we have
the prime time original foundation
primer one of the generation new to
lipsticks and infamous and then this guy
right here which is the lash domination
mascara I love the last combination I
think it's great this is definitely a
mascara I would personally purchase in a
full-size Bare Minerals is the
cruelty-free brand their parent company
does test on animals but they themselves
do not as you guys can see it has a
really really interesting kind of twisty
wand I actually like to twist it as I
put it on to my lashes it's not as good
as the Marc Jacobs velvet noir but it's
pretty damn good so I enjoy that as far
as the infamous shade is concerned for
the liquid lipsticks it's a beautiful
color I can see why a lot of you like
these full on pigmentation for sure but
these are just too drying for me I mean
you guys can take a look at my lips you
see what I deal with
I feel like I was a flutist I just have
really really dry sad lips and I can't
wear a lot of liquid lipstick so this is
just not for me a little too dry and a
little too emphasizing you know my
texture and my dry spots already which
are there all the time so that's not for
me but I can understand why a lot of you
like them as far as prime time original
foundation primer is concerned I was
pretty concerned with this I was very
concerned special it really is like
every other um you know silicone based
primer on the market reminds me the
toosha clock reminds me of Smashbox
photo-finish it reminds me of the baby
skin I was gonna say baby doll baby skin
foundation primer from Maybelline it's a
very very simple and basic very basic
bitch kind of primer and not a huge fan
would not purchase it both sides with
that mineral veil is just okay I prefer
using a loose silica powder to do my
buffing technique and then this little
brush right here is a little on the
scratchy side so didn't really love at
the 500-point part but I do enjoy the
set right here which is the lash
domination mascara and I probably will
purchase a full size so that is it to
you guys for my Sephora follow-up haul
thank you so much for joining me I hope
you enjoyed this video and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
