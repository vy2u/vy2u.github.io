thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are all having a wonderful
wednesday today's video is going to be
issa for a follow-up also about a week
ago actually i think exactly a week ago
on my channel i did a Sephora haul and
i'm here to share with you guys my first
impressions and also just what i think
of the products so far so let's go ahead
and jump right into it the first two
items i had purchased we're from these
sephora collection I do like these two
for collection quite a bit I think some
other items are hid somewhere amidst but
these are definitely hits these are
these Sephora cleansing wipes the first
ones are the revitalizing and toning you
do cleansing wipes which look like this
they are lemon scented and then I also
picked up the ultra moisturizing and
brightening Rose cleansing wipes so I
actually use these already which is
crazy like in one week but I use these
for swatches I use them to remove my eye
makeup and my face makeup I feel like
they are really really good white and
they smell exactly like rose they smell
absolutely heavenly so one thing I do
notice about these is that they do leave
a little bit of a residue on your face
kind of like the Neutrogena makeup
removing wipes especially the hydrating
version so if you don't like that you
probably would not like these but they
are really really good and then these
usually ones I feel like these are very
very toning they don't leave any sort of
residue behind on your skin and they do
remove my makeup and face makeup very
well and they do cleanse really quickly
so I enjoy those I've been loving both
of them next I had purchased the bite
Beauty a creme lip gloss in the shade
gold so I'm liking this I'm not saying
that it's like the best thing that's
ever happened to me i know i didn't get
to reviewing this for you guys but I'm
just gonna give you a mini review now i
will say i feel like the wand is kind of
oddly shaped and it never really pulls
out and it cooks likely even product
basically it doesn't distribute evenly
onto the actual lip brush so that's my
first complaint second complaint is the
fact that i think this is a little too
pigmented and i thought i would never
say that about a lip product but i just
find that this one is a little too
pigmented if you're going to have like a
straight-up gold lip gloss on i feel
like it should be slightly sheer and
more of like a lip topper and i feel
like when i put this on this is what I
ends up looking like on my lips and i
literally just feel like a stripper or
something like I'm sorry I don't mean to
be rude but seriously I feel like a
stripper it's just so like I don't know
like 80's 90's I'm not going to
but it just looks really really kind of
cuckoo and crazy and even if I try
sharing it out you can still see areas
where it started to cling to certain
patches on my lips so not quite sure
about this one will continue to try and
use it up a little bit but yeah it is
very very opaque and I think that's the
first time that I've ever said i don't
like a lip product that's super opaque
are you moving on it the next item that
i had purchased was an illuminator this
is from let's seek your makeup forever
this is the prolite fusion undetectable
lou manizer this is what the packaging
looks like i am obsessed with this this
has quickly become a new favorite of
mine it is very very similar to the
glowing Gardens illuminator that
released from dior last year around this
time which i loved i was obsessed with
that facial a formulation this one is
pretty much the same exact thing i do
prefer the dior because they do you feel
like it has a little more of a white
undertone and also i do you find that
when I put my brush into this particular
product it does start to pick up
unevenly so you do need to really kind
of build it up in there but this is what
the actual color looks like it's a
beautiful milky white color and it's
just absolutely stunning if you do have
a cool undertone in your skin I think
you would really really enjoy this
highlight I think it's beautiful it is
very much cool toned and when you look
at it at first you think it is a little
more golden tone but it's not it's
straight up cool toned in my opinion and
I think it's absolutely amazing so I
will be going ahead and purchasing the
gold one as well in the future the next
item that I have really been loving is
the NARS a velvet lip glide the shade
that I picked up is called bound and
this is literally my lips but better
this color is my lips but better this is
what the shade looks like and basically
this is just a really comfortable creamy
lip glide it feels great i love the
actual applicator that is what it looks
like i feel like it gets on really
really nicely you happy flat side to
really get like the bigger part of your
lip and then the little tip to go in on
the inner corners and I just think it's
great my only complaint is that i don't
like the NARS like um Matt packaging
here I feel like it gets really dirty
easily but besides that you get a whole
lot of product in here at this shade is
absolutely beautiful and I feel like
these just stay on really nicely they
definitely don't wear like a long red
liquid lipstick and they don't feel like
a liquid lipstick they feel like just a
very very creamy bomb on the lips but i
would say they last probably about three
to four hours and then you do need to go
ahead and
apply but really been enjoying these
they did recently released a little kit
of five or six of them for forty five
dollars for the holidays so I may have
to pick that up but I do up to other
shades that I have my eye on so really
enjoy those and then let's go ahead and
oh wait we have one more item this is
the Sephora I'm asked this is the LG
version this is what it looks like I
really enjoyed this quite a bit I do
like these Sephora I'm ass I find that
they are very very very saturated with
product and one of my biggest complaints
with like sheet masks or I sheet mass or
whatever is that sometimes they're not
very saturated with product and it just
doesn't feel like anything is there so i
really like these because they are
heavily saturated with product i was a
little worried about this particular one
is supposed to tone and detoxify the
under eye area I was worried about the
scent because I am a little bit of a
sense snob and I was like LG like that's
gonna smell like but and I should
smell really good kind of like perfumey
so anyway that is what it looks like i
did enjoy that and i enjoy pretty much
all of these sephora i'm asked my
favorite are definitely the rose and the
pomegranate though and now we'll go
ahead is it now go ahead and get in
system of my 500-point perks I only
broke into one of them technically let's
see here it was the Murad I forgot what
this little kit was called but it's a
500-point perk so it had a step one
which was cleanse and tone this is the H
a a bj exfoliating cleanser and this is
just okay I remember somebody commented
on the original haul video last week and
was saying like how can a chaise and be
a chaise be like working if they're just
on your skin for about 45 seconds to a
minute and I completely agree I feel
like you just can't keep this on your
skin long enough for it to work so I'm
just gonna say that's just okay I did go
ahead and use the rapid collagen
infusion which is kind of like an
essence lash serum again just okay and
then this product was just okay as well
this is the Narada hydrodynamic ultimate
moisture cream and that is what it looks
like the one thing in the kit that
really did impress me was this Murad
professional eye lift firming treatment
so you have a two-step system in here
the first step is that this little I'm
lifting firming treatment you take about
five pumps of this tap it in underneath
your eye area and then it comes with
these little past here and it's kind of
like an eye mask so these are completely
dry and you put one of them underneath
your eye and it really helps to push the
actual product into your eye you leave
that on for about 10 to 15 minutes and
then you
get off and then you tap in the
remaining product so out of everything
this is something that I probably would
purchase a full sizeA but everything
else wasn't too impressed I do like this
herbivore moonfruit superfruit nights
treatment this is what it looks like the
other day my skin was really red and
kind of irritated I'm slightly allergic
to my pet ferrets so I do get like some
kind of like skin hives on my face if I
cuddle him too much into my face so I
did use this the other night and I
thought it was quite nice um it seems to
like mold back in it's kind of a cool
consistency because it molds back into
what it was before but as you guys can
see it definitely has some indigo or
something in there because it really
helps to cool down the redness and the
skin so I've been enjoying that quite a
bit to the smell is strange it smells
like a blueberry and like baby powder I
don't really like it um the next item I
had tried to use up or I not try to use
that but I did try out was the SD edit
by Estee Lauder pink peony overnight
water pack I think this is such a waste
of money do not purchase this in full
size it basically is just a gel
moisturizer and water packs are nice if
you do have combination or oily skin
because it's kind of like using a
overnight sleeping mask but it won't be
too like much for your skin it won't
clog your pores because it is a gel
consistency but first of all it doesn't
even really smell like peony and I'm a
peony a holic okay that sounds so bad
but I love viennese you guys I
absolutely adore penes they are my
favorite flower and I don't smell
anything in here i literally just smell
chemicals second of all I feel like it
just didn't really do anything for my
skin even my cheeks still didn't feel
very well hydrated and I just really
don't think it's worth the money because
this is like forty or fifty dollars for
a full size now an item that I do really
like is the tart to drink h2o hydrating
boost this is a nice little gel
moisturizer and I would say this
definitely has some DeMatha cone or
silicone in it because it's got a lot of
slip but that is what it looks like it's
very beautiful it does have a little bit
of a citrusy smell to it but I really
enjoy it and I would purchase a full
size of that so anyway guys that is my
little follow-up all i really hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me i'm sorry if i seemed a
little rundown I've been doing a lot of
pre filming today so anyway I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
