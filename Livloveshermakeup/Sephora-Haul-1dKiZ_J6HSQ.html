hope you guys are having a great day I
have a Sephora haul for you guys today I
picked up some body care some skincare
some makeup um basically everything
except for hair care and nail polish so
I'm going to share with you guys what I
got so the first two things I am going
to start with our two hand creams if you
guys watched a video that I posted maybe
about two weeks ago I did a brave review
on the tony moly peach hand cream and I
absolutely love it obviously rave review
um I love it I love the texture i love
the scent I love the formula so I went
on to the support website and I decided
to get all of the hand creams that tony
moly offered um I believe that there is
one that I couldn't get my hands on it
was either sold out or out of stock I
think it was a blueberry yum cream which
sounds amazing and I will definitely
keep my eye on that but I've got the
other two that are like in the little
collection I think they only have four
so um like I said I have the peach one
so i asked you picked up this one this
is the red apple hand cream super cute
little packaging and all of the hand
creams are shaped like a little piece of
fruit that you know if they're described
after so basically um it's just a little
red apple it's adorable and and i heard
that the formula is the same with all
things the only differences the
packaging was sent so oh it smells
really really good not as good as the
peach one but still really really good
if you'd like to send to Apple you would
probably really really like this I
highly recommend these just because the
formula of amazing and I'm all of that
moisture I've in my hands so I got one
in the whole container and i also got
one in tangerine and this one is a
brightening hand cream so I think it has
maybe a little vitamin C or something in
it right sure but again shaped like a
little tangerines so cute and it smells
amazing oh my gosh if you guys are into
citrus scents like lemony kind of really
bright orange sense this you would
really really like it and I'm not really
detecting any shimmer but it looks like
maybe there's a little bit of vitamin C
in there for you know brightening
purposes so anyway
super super excited to use these hand
creams like i said i love a peach one so
i know i'm gonna love these ones because
i heard that the formula is basically
the same exact payment so okay i'm not
going to be reaching over there every
single time i put the stuff down I'm
just gonna pile it back in the box
anyway so those are my hand creams next
I picked up some makeup in the sale like
section on the support com website um
they had a bunch of tart stuff on sale
and if you like stock those of our
website like I do I frequently go on
there and I always want to look under a
new arrivals so i can give you guys you
know fresh reviews but also i like to
look at the stuff that's for sale and
usually it's like half off and sometimes
you get good really good rams like tart
so this was half off this is the tart
high-performance naturals the tart of
giving what's inside is five Amazonian
clay skinny smolder eyes in onyx bronze
a cage or a gate smoky quartz peridot
green and plum tanzanite so skin and
also a skinny smolder eyes sharpener so
basically you get five eyeliners in here
and like i said it was half price though
it was such a good deal um you know i
would definitely go on to the support
website I don't know if it's they might
be sold out by now but definitely stop
the support website like I do I kind of
recommend that but at the same time I
don't because you're going to just want
to buy a lot of makeup but sometimes
they have some really great deals and
this stuff is like last season tart but
doesn't mean it's not a good product so
anyway um these aren't the really nice
eyeliners that actually um like it you
know they're like the typical kind of
pencil you and they're like very very
soft you know they're not like a harsh I
don't know you know like you go to let
the drugstore or something you pick up
like a one-dollar eyeliner and it's just
really really like when you first start
using it it's like super pointy like
these are nice and soft and creamy and I
believe I have tried this formula before
so I'm excited to you know give this a
go you get a nice green shade hunter
green some Plumbing's
and gold and black and yeah like I said
it was half off and I had to get on that
girl so not that next I got the soap &amp;amp;
Glory sit tight super intense Ford
affirming plus smoothing body serum I've
been picking up a lot of these recently
i am trying to UM get rid of some of the
cellulite on my five and the butt okay
and um there-there have products that
really do work um so I thought I would
just you know in conjunction with of
course being healthy and trying to work
out more I thought this would be kind of
fun to try out on everything I don't
know if soap and glory is like going out
of business on the support website or if
they're not going to be selling them
anymore because everything is like half
off so literally everything on the um
you know oops Oh ripped appease my hero
um basically everything if you look
under soap &amp;amp; Glory everything is like
half off so definitely go check that out
maybe they're not going to be selling
soap in glory anymore i'm not quite sure
um if that's true i'm kind of
disappointed because i love Sophie glory
but anyway so I got this for like $19
it's originally around 40 so I'm gonna
try I I'm excited to try it out
basically it's got these little like a
beads at the bottom they look like
they're nice and cooling and you just
squeeze the product out and rub it all
over your bum and hopefully it will get
rid of some you know texture so we'll
see about that one um i have used one
from mario badescu that was really
really nice it was like a firming body
emulsion and I really really liked that
so that worked and it kind of got me
into purchasing products like this so
anyway we're gonna try that out midland
time time today sorry guys the next
thing I picked up is something that I've
wanted since it came out I don't know
why I didn't pick it up um but it is the
Smashbox step-by-step contour stick trio
it looks like this and you get a contour
a bronze and a highlight and these just
look like and I did swatch them already
just so you guys know the previous
creamiest pencils easiest thing to you
know contour with ever they're much
premier and softer than the clinic
chubby stick ones that I reviewed and
I'm really really excited to use them so
basically like I said you get a bronze
you get a highlight and then you get the
contour a
they're just nice creamy pencils and you
know you basically put them on after
foundation and you can just blend in you
know with a sponge or your brush
whatever you gonna do and um sorry
they're like falling off the table
uh-huh so basically you just blend it
however you want to you and you set it
with powder and that's kind of an easy
way like a foolproof way of contouring
because sometimes I find that I really
load up on the powder and it could look
a little unnatural or you can tell that
I contoured so um yeah so I was like I'm
really excited to try this yeah I know
it's gonna be great I already watched it
and just feel so clean and luxurious I
don't know why didn't get it running off
I think it was because there were so
many different contouring kids coming
out and I wanted to find the ones that
were like the best in my opinion to
review for you guys but I really think
I'm gonna like this next I picked up the
peter thomas roth a clinical skincare
glycolic acid 3% facial wash it is oil
free anti aging cleanser with alpha
hydroxy acid pro vitamin b5 and alan
along t'en duong a long time Alan Tom to
help stop in and exfoliate the skin for
all skin types comes in this big case
here and it's just a gel type of left a
gel cleanser hold on guys hang up san
pellegrino right here it's sparkling
water don't worry I don't just you know
sit here and fill my videos and be you
know drinking wine just that would be a
grand ol time but no sparkling water um
anyway I have been using gel cleansers
lately to cleanse my skin at night I
like the way they feel during the summer
they just don't really strip my skin as
much as um I don't know like I haven't
really been going for like benzoyl
peroxide things like that which is
really really drawing right now i'm
using the tea tree clearing one from the
body shop and i really like the gel
formula so i thought i would pick up you
know something to use after that one's
almost out which it almost is so I'm
anyway yeah this is basically just like
colic acid 3% really really good for
anti-aging and also for acne of glycolic
acid is good for that and
I'm excited to try it out you get this
really really big tub of it and peter
thomas roth has a great brand their
unwrinkled peel pads i use those every
night those are amazing so um yeah not
much to say about this i have used
glycolic acid before some people
recommend not using it on a daily basis
however i am used to like tea tree oil
I'm used to salicylic acid benzoyl
peroxide really really heavy duty like
acne medication so I can handle it every
night and I have combination skin so
anyway we'll see how this goes and yeah
so got that next I got the bullsháá
makeup breakup cold cleansing oil and I
could not stand it I broke this out and
I used it yes I used it last night i
love it i can't believe i got the small
size basically it's like that Garnier
oil what's that called that oil
cleansing oil what you do is you
basically just take a few pumps of this
onto dry hands you don't want your face
to be wet you don't want your hands to
be Wed and you rub it all over your skin
you massage it in it feels really nice
it's a little cooling um not super
cooling but it's very very you know easy
you know it's an oil so it just glides
all over the skin and it's so easy it
just takes away all the makeup all you
have to do after is just wash your face
with water and it does come off it does
not leave an oily or sticky residue you
do not have to use a washcloth and it's
just great so um anyway really really
happy i picked this up i'm a little
unhappy that i didn't get the bigger
size because i know i'm going to end up
purchasing the bigger size but you know
it was a new product i wanted to see how
it went first so anyway that is the
bosha makeup breakup cool cleansing oil
could not wait with that one I was just
like I need to use the rim of my makeup
right now so really really like that um
next I got the touch golden days and
sultry nights Amazonian clay collector
shadow palette I wanted this forever
this I came out I think that last summer
I want to say this collection came out
and i thought the packaging was adorable
which it is and like i said tart was on
sale recently on these 24 website and
this was also had price so i was like i
have no excuse not to buy this now
um because I wanted it before and it was
on sale for like fifteen twenty dollars
so this is what it looks like you get
three shimmery eyeshadows and then to
matte shades you get kind of like a nice
topi transition kind of color there and
then you get a nice matte highlight
shade a nice golden II kind of satiny
color at turquoise and then a bronze and
I just think it's great like that's
going to be beautiful for the summer can
get your pop color in there and
everything you need so really really
excited for that and I'm happy that you
know i got it for such a steal yay so
anyway moving on I picked up the josie
maran argan infinity intensive cream eat
oil um this is basically just a oil in
the zoo is that all I wanted to know
this is her you know this is the
original josie maran this has the argan
oil in it but it also has other
ingredients on it has let's see here to
do um usually she writes like in-depth
stuff nothing on here so here we go
infused with Josie is one hundred
percent pure argan oil this therapeutic
creamy blend of essential fatty acids
and vitamin E since they C vitamin E can
be used in an infinite number of ways
this targeted multi tasker multitasker
Suze and a smooth rough dry or you know
tired skin while eliminating the
complexion and leaving skin a glow so um
I you know I love oils I love the josie
maran argan oil I was going to pick that
up but then I saw this and I thought I
want to get this instead it just leaked
into the box that's kind of gross but
basically it's like a cream to oil kind
of formula and it just seems like it's
going to be extra extra moisturizing
because um it's also got those essential
fatty acids in there and of course the
vitamin E so anyway pick that up and I'm
excited for that even got oil everywhere
negative missed next I picked up the
peter thomas roth anti-aging cellular i
repaired gel this was also on sale it
was half off again and i was attracted
to it because peter thomas roth makes a
really nice gel mask it's like the rose
stem cell Joan
ask and I thought that this might this
might be similar in texture so I picked
it up and it says it is it has a firm to
sell for powerful PTR anti-aging peptide
complex for deep wrinkles fine lines
under eye puffiness hexapeptide vitamins
a c ee a low cucumber orange orange
lemon sugar cane sugar maple and
botanical extracts so anyway it's just
this tiny little jar and I think that
gels are just so nice during the
summertime whether it's a gel mask or at
the gel you know I cream I just think
that would be really really fun to use
it's nice and cooling and you know you
can pop it in the fridge if you want and
even better you know pulling sensation
I'm throwing everything on the floor so
if you hear things rolling that's a
fragment um so yeah excited is that the
next thing I got was another tart half
off kind of thing and this is the tart
just cheeky deluxe cheek stain set so in
here you get five of the little tart
cheek stain so you get this one in
desired you also get one in the shade if
I can find it joyful you get ambition
and also destiny so basically I won't
open all of these but i'll show you guys
what they are they're just like the you
know ah clean cheek stings that you just
pop on you know you can either dab your
brush in it or just put it straight onto
your cheeks really really nice for
summer and again like I said these were
you know really really cheap for the
whole set so I was happy to purchase
them for they very very low price anyway
that's what they look like with this
almost a little crooked but that's okay
but um basically they're just a cheek
stain and like I said you can apply it
with a brush you can you know apply it
with your fingers it just gives kind of
like a sheer nice amount of color oh it
just fixed itself that was weird but
anyway so yeah you get five of those in
there and I think that was a great deal
if it was like 10 bucks so yeah those
nine one two three four and five alright
moving on we're getting through guys
we're getting through there's so many
boxes everywhere I feel overwhelmed God
ok moving on ok those are samples will
go through those at the end

sent two of the benefits puff off

course they can't put the look like the
actual like product is supposed to be
special because of applicator but you
