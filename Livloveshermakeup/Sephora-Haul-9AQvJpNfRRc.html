today I have another Sephora haul for
you guys so let's just jump right into
it the first thing I picked up was this
Sephora uh what is it Carl the beauty of
giving back face palette so I thought
this was really pretty on the website
and I absolutely adore the packaging I
think it's so cute it has that nice
little snap like magnetic thing here the
magnetic closure but this is what it
looks like on the inside and you can see
that that blush and the bronzer are
ombre so I think that's kind of cool I
don't know I've never seen anything like
that so you get cream here and then you
get powder blusher as highlight and then
bronzer and another blush so I thought
this was pretty I really like the colors
and I like that it's different textures
you know you have cream and then you got
powder so I'm gonna give that a try and
I will review it for you guys another
time the next thing I picked up was this
little makeup pouch I just needed
another makeup pouch this is called the
escapade err and it just says designed
from the inside out to house all of your
beauty products versatile separate pouch
and easily fits into your carry-on so
this is what it looks like it's kind of
like that quilted texture and I thought
it was really cute
the next thing I got was a Sephora
what is this detangling brush and I
think you have a lot of brushes lately
you don't know why but I think it's
because my other one just got really
yucky and I decided to toss it it's got
worn out so this one's really nice it's
kind of like a matte texture and it's
got the detangling bristles so I am
excited to try that out the next thing I
picked up was the Josie Maran winter
dreams whipped argan oil body butter duo
this was one of their little holiday
gift things and so you get two of these
whipped argan oil body butters so you
get them in the spirited which is a
sweet citrus scent delicious I want to
eat it and then you also get it in be
joyful which is vanilla apricot so smell
that oh wow that smells absolutely
delicious so I thought these were nice
they're kind of like portable you can
bring them like on the plane with you
I'm going to be doing a lot of
doubling in the next like month and a
half so I thought those would be nice to
bring along with me let's see here the
next thing I picked up or two of the Too
Faced mascaras one of them is the better
than sex mascara I absolutely love this
mascara I recently ran out and it has
not been the same without it so I picked
another full size up this is what the
wand looks like and I just get great
volume and length with this mascara so I
really love it and then the other one I
picked up is actually a new one I
believe this is called two-faced size
Queen I this was new on the website I
believe so
I think Too Faced just came out with
like three new mascaras besides the
better than sex so this was really cool
check out this wand look how big it is
that's crazy
so um I am excited to try that out I
really really love the brand Too Faced I
love their eyeshadows I love you know
their mascaras I love basically
everything about that brand so I am
excited to try this out the next thing I
got was something that kind of matches
this little case that I got it's called
the Sephora high roller and it's
designed from the inside out to house
all of your beauty products for
removable mesh pouches and label
compartments for organization and
traveling so this is what it looks like
you open it up here and then it swings
open and you have all these pouches so
this is really really great for
traveling you can hang this on the
doorknob and then you have a little
section here for toiletries face-i and
then down here it says lips and I guess
that you can actually just undo them
like that they're velcro so you can take
them out you can use them at their own
little travel pouches but that's really
nice I think that that's gonna be really
easy to travel with I actually go out of
town very early tomorrow morning as long
as we're having some bad weather coming
through Manhattan so hopefully I'll be
okay to fly out tomorrow morning but if
not I'll be find out on Thanksgiving Day
but I am going to bring this with me so
very very excited I pick that up the
next thing I have and okay this is a
palette that I have been looking at for
I want to say
a year and a half or maybe more this is
the two-faced
what is this called again the return of
sexy palette this has been out forever I
never picked it up because I kept saying
I don't need it I have those colors blah
blah blah
guess what I needed it and I picked it
up and I loved it so let me open it up
for you guys and show you what's inside
so the first thing you get is an eye
liner from Too Faced and I told you guys
I love Too Faced I love their brand and
I especially love their little box
shadow like their shadow boxes so this
is the Too Faced perfect eyes waterproof
eyeliner and it has a smudger stick on
one end and then the color on the other
looks like it's black and that these are
the shades beautiful guys look at those
look how gorgeous so you get some warms
you get some nice purples and then you
get some Smokies and I'm in love I'm so
happy I bought it I should have gotten
it a long time ago I know I'm gonna
absolutely love this I think I'm gonna
take this with me when I go out of town
tomorrow and I'm so excited to play with
it and by the way i swatched a few of
these these are so soft and so creamy so
I am absolutely extremely excited to be
using this so I will give you guys a
review you know when I get to you know
using this a little more I guess be like
for you guys so the next thing I have
here let's see here that's called the
what is this a bun net so this is like a
little device that you use to I guess
foam like like form this is phone but
you form it into a bun on your head and
it's just like a little foam piece and I
think you just turn it like inside out
or something
it says quick and easy to use create the
perfect bun for all hair types
lightweight and comfortable your bun net
will hold your bun all day so we'll see
about that I mean I don't I have a lot
of little devices fun devices so I'm
excited to do that next I have this but
these are more like samples now so this
is the support I think this is the VIP
Rouge little thing that you got with
with your order in the past couple of
weeks they gave out either a bag
you've got this little pouch that has a
bunch of samples in it so I picked this
instead of the little tote so in here it
looks like you get a origin sample you
get a high potency night a night immense
like vitamins mineral enriched renewal
cream and the orange and ginseng energy
boosting moisturizer two little samples
of those you also get let's see a fresh
rose hydrating eye gel cream and a
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
I like this line that's nice
then you get let's see here the Olay
Hendrickson Hendrickson sorry what is
this vitamin C brightening serum and
reparative anti-aging oil two little
samples of that and then you also get a
sample of the versace bright crystal
perfume cute little pink too I like that
by the way those things are great for
travel just taking like a few of these
with you for travel are really really
good
next thing you get is they may be okay
if her friends are flaky but a lady's
leg should never be so this is the
smoothie star lightly whipped body
butter cream from soap &amp;amp; Glory that
looks cute the next thing you get is a
sample of the professional after that
you get a ub moisturizing skin cream
sample mmm
this luck ten creme plus use which is
this so precious cream so that looks
like it's a face cream dr. jart premium
BB beauty balm with SPF 45 sample and
then you get a Clinique Moisture Surge
extended thirst relief moisturizer
sample and you also get the Clinique
stay matte oil-free makeup in neutral
which probably is going to be too dark
for my skin
so that's what you'd get an a cute
little pouch and then you get to keep
the pouch so I think that's actually
kinda cute and then let me show you the
other samples I got oh oh also this some
little eye primer the two-faced eye
primer you get that with the Too Faced
is this the return of sexy palette for
getting it you get a little too faced
shadow insurance primer which is a good
problem but let me show you the other
samples I picked up that were just like
my free like pick three or whatever I
got the glam glow super my clearing
treatment I got this Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion it has four
samples of all of the primer potions
they have so you get original Eden sin
and anti-aging formula nice for travel
probably I'm going to take and then I
got this Sephora outrageous curl mascara
and check out this wand cut tiny it is
and it's plastic I like ones like that
but look how tiny it is I feel like it's
so different because the two-faced one
is huge in this little wand it's tiny
stuff you know the next thing I got was
this little whatsapp from benefit this
is their little cream highlighter it's
like a champagne color I already have
one of these but I like it a little size
it's nice it's actually very portable
thank you some other samples I got the
hourglass mineral veil primer I love
this I have a full-size of this so love
that and then I also got the skin
perfecting gel with smart color
technology ingredient which is probably
going to be too dark for my skin I don't
have to give that to my friend and then
I got a sample of HD high definition
primer from makeup forever I love this
it's kind of like the moisturizing gel
karma and then I got the boat bullsháá
it's a bow shot oh this is the
detoxifying black cleanser so gonna try
that and then also from soap &amp;amp; Glory oh
they came out with a six in one super
serum so it will be nice to try it out
so that is my other haul from Sephora I
hope you guys enjoyed this like I said
I'm going to be going out of town too
but I do have a box coming in from Ulta
which is mostly like drugstore things I
picked up so I will definitely do a haul
when that box comes in after I get back
