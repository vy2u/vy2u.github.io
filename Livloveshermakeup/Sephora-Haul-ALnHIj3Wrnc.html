welcome back to another video yes I
still look like something that may or
may not have crawled out of your sewer I
really don't look cute still I'm still
not feeling good the last thing I want
to do is put makeup on so I'm not gonna
come on to camera just to put makeup on
just so that you guys can see me with
makeup on when I'm not feeling well that
makes sense because that makes sense to
me not gonna do that anyway in this
video I have another Sephora haul for
you guys and I know that i did a Sephora
haul like a day ago i'm well aware i was
going to go ahead and do those reviews
for you guys on the tarp products but
i'm still not completely like to gather
up there still feel like a little bit of
lupus fog it's kind of coming over me so
I thought it would be better to go ahead
and do a Sephora haul I think you guys
can probably tell I'm actually feeling a
lot better so hopefully by monday i will
be back to all of my scheduled videos
i'm sure i will because that is when i'm
going back to work but anyway I did a
Sephora haul I'm gonna share it with you
guys I know I've been doing a lot of
Sephora halls but I do a lot of shopping
like leading up to the beginning of fall
for whatever reason I think I just get
really excited as a beginning of fall so
let me share with you guys what I picked
up they first item that I got or the
first two items that I picked up or some
more she sado facial Cotton's I am
obsessed with these I've talked about
these quite a bit they are amazing
they're just little pieces of cotton
they're super expensive you get like a
hundred weight 165 sheets of a hundred
percent pure cotton for like nine
dollars and fifty cents which is kind of
ridiculous I would highly recommend just
stocking up on this when they do their
fifteen or twenty percent off sale but
this is amazing so good for applying
toner for removing especially like your
eye makeup it just doesn't pull and tug
at your skin so I highly recommend
checking these out those were the first
two items i got the next item I got with
another pack of these two for Rose
cleansing wipes so if you guys watched
my empties video yesterday you saw that
I had a pack of these in there I did
another Sephora haul that I denied it
actually share on my channel I hauled a
bunch of stuff and I chose not to share
with you guys just because like I said
I've been doing a lot of halls and I was
feeling slightly guilty I don't know I
spent a lot of money at the four of the
past couple months so I did not show you
guys datums that I got in that Hall I
got a few kat von d items and then I
picked these up but these are so good so
so so good so I did go
and pick another pack of these up and
because they were so good I went ahead
and picked up the other ones that they
have as well so the first one is the
charcoal wipes these are purifying and
detoxifying and by the way the rose ones
are ultra moisturizing and brightening
and then I also got the green ones and
these are mattifying and anti blemish
which will be perfect for my combo to
oily skin and then we have let's see
here the yuzu ones and the you are
revitalizing and toning and then the
last ones we have are the coconut
cleanse avoids and these are soothing
and relaxing so I'm really really
excited to try these other ones out like
I said I really really love the rose
ones and you guys know I just like to
use wipes in the morning if I'm in a
hurry and I don't want to do my skincare
or for a moving makeup or just wiping my
face down really quickly so very very
excited for those i also went ahead and
picked up a sephora avocado hand mass so
if you watch my empties again yesterday
i'll link that video down below if you'd
like to check it out but i did go ahead
and purchase one of the lavender foot
mass from these sephora house brand and
i really enjoyed that like quite a bit
they were very very nice so i went ahead
and picked up the avocado hands mask and
this one is supposed to be nourishing
and repairing and you just put them onto
your hands this is the kind of like that
guess this is the time of year well not
really this time of year we're still
technically in summer but tomorrow is
September first and usually like in the
middle of September towards the end of
September it starts to get a little more
cold and I can start to get really dry
and chapped though I'm going to save
this little guy for that special
occasion when they start to chop up and
then the next item I purchased was a lip
oil you guys know I've been obsessed
with lip oils recently and I've been
I've had my eye on this for a while this
is the Clarins instant light comfort lip
oil it says it enhances and nourishes
the lips the shade that I got is number
02 raspberry and I've just really been
into lip boils I tried out the Lancome
juicy shakers I don't think I'll
purchase any more of those but I'm going
to keep the one that i have i love the
YSL lip oils so we're going to see how
this holds up i also have a few from
physicians formula and i know you guys
were asking for a battle of the lip oil
video i will definitely definitely do
that so here is the shade 02 raspberry
really really kind of pretty color let's
see what the applicator looks like okay
okay it's huge this is huge do you see
that wow it's huge all right so it looks
like it smells pretty good like a nice
light kind of perfume and it just goes
on obviously clear and then it starts to
kind of darken up mmm excuse me and then
it starts to kind of dark and apps so
really really excited to go ahead and
try this out and I will be doing a
follow-up all but I am going to take all
of the past 2 40 halls that I've done in
the past couple of weeks and put them
all into one so it will be like a
four-in-one follow-up home all right and
then they last item that I picked up you
guys was from nest fragrances I have
purchased this a while ago for Tom he
loved it this is the woodland truffle
liquid soap and this is what it looks
like it is on sale for fifteen dollars
right now which I know fifteen dollars
for so quite what though yeah so
expensive but Tom really loves this end
he loves anything truffle now this
doesn't smell like truffle oil or like
truffle salt but it does smell very
woodsy and manly and he really really
enjoys it he has a simple human soap
dispenser where you just put your hand
under and it like squirts it out
automatically and he can't use those
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works soaps that had the
beads in them because they get stuck in
the actual apparatus so he likes this
one a lot because there are no beads and
the scent really is good you guys like I
don't know how exactly to describe it
but yeah really really does smell good
so I went ahead and picked that up for
him and then let's see here I got some
samples the first one is he missed your
a mess tiorin misty or oda perfume i
also got to the emollients pretreatment
this is a coupon coupon with coop paco
butter cocoa butter cool Paco Paco
butter and caster oil idea what this is
um it says medium to thick straight to
kinky dry what okay this must be for
your hair huh I was like what the hell
is this it says we're gently through dry
hair and leave on for at least five
minutes for extra conditioning wrap with
plastic and heat under a dryer for 15
minutes so it looks like it's just one
of those treatments that you put on your
hair I also went ahead and got another
little estee lauder revitalizing supreme
global anti-aging creme thank you to one
of my subscribers who wrote down below
to me in my last on Sephora haul and she
told me that they are reformulating this
so it's not off the market they are just
reformulating it she actually works at
estee lauder so thank you so much for
letting me know because I was really
worried I wasn't going to be able to get
size of this and then I typed in a
little code and this is the elizabeth
and james these are there two new
fragrances they have bourbon and rose I
was like yeah I need these so these are
big deluxe sized perfume whoa these are
big deluxe sized perfume sprayers so
let's go ahead and spray these on the
first one we have here is bourbon and he
likes a little bit than James you can
mix their sense together Oh God oh dear
Lord oh I'm gonna need that in a full
size oh my god let's go let's go on to
those so far website right now if we
have another Hall coming our way guys
seriously that smells amazing it just
smells woodsy and really really nice and
I feel like if I like the Bourbon 1 i'm
gonna love the rose because you guys
know I love everything rose so let's
spray this one over here and like I was
saying these are like meant to be mixed
together like you can mix nirvana white
and black together you don't have to but
they can be okay the roast smells pretty
good I prefer the Bourbon but I feel
like if you mix these together it's
gonna smell amazing so oh my god super
exciting i'm definitely gonna have to
get the bourbon one though so yeah all
