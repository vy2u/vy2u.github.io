thank you for joining me I have a
sephora.com hall for you guys I just
picked up some stuff that I wanted to
share with you and yeah let's just get
started the first thing I picked up was
this little facemask trio I actually got
this last year as well this is like a
little holiday kit that you can get from
origins and I still have the clear
improvement a charcoal mask that I need
to go through but i did use up the
rescue one i think it's called i know
the sticker is right over it i think
it's called the rescue one for like oily
skin and the drink up intensive
overnight mask is amazing and smells
amazing so I really got this kit so that
I could have another one of those but
these are bigger than last year's and I
can't remember if like I got like the
little trio that was like ten dollars or
if it was $22 but this is 22 dot fifty
cents and I highly highly recommend
checking this out if you want to try out
some good masks so let me show you guys
if I can open this let me show you guys
exactly like the size of what they look
like ya bees are way bigger than last
year's which is great so you get one
fluid ounces 1 fluid ounce in each of
these this is the origins out of trouble
ten-minute mask to rescue problem skin
and that is kind of leaf kind of like
kinda late huh kind of like um for oily
or combination skin and then you get to
the origins drink up intensive overnight
masks to scrunch skins thirst this one
is like the reason I bought this kit it
smells really good and it really really
does moisturize your skin overnight and
then you have the origins clear
improvement which is has active charcoal
in its to clear pores so this is also
for oily skin so all three of those are
really nice size I still have like all
of the charcoal one from last year but
they came to smaller little tube and I
can't remember if the price was the same
or if it was cheaper but this is a
really good deal so definitely check
that out on me
our website it's under the little gifts
section the next thing I picked up was
also kind of like a gift set I think
this is the Sephora sleeping mask
discovery set and it is a twenty-dollar
um yeah twenty dollars and a $24 value
so you do get like four dollars off if
if you had like purchased all of them
separately rather than get them in the
kit you would pay twenty four dollars
but because you bought the kids you get
four dollars off so this is what it
looks like if you have tried the Sephora
like face mask I really like those
little sheet masks but they have so I
thought that this would be fun to try
out because I do love sleeping asks and
i like to use those when i'm too lazy to
put my skincare on at night or if I've
had a long night and you know like I get
home and it's super super late and I
can't be bothered to do anything for my
skin I always pop on an overnight mask
so in here you get the Sephora lotus
sleeping mask you get the Pearl sleeping
mask the green tea sleeping mask the
ginseng sleeping mask me honey sleeping
mask and the Rose sleeping mask so these
will be really really fun to try out I
have tried all of these in the sheet
mask formula and a lot of them in the
eye mask formula um but I'm excited to
see how they work for you know overnight
mass it looks like they're like a jelly
kind of formula so that is really cool
and I am very very excited to try those
out alright the next thing I got was in
the sale section this is the naked on
the run palette from urban decay it's
been like a year since this released I
think this released around this time
last year right or was it like around
Thanksgiving maybe I never got it
because you guys know um I have some
beef with the naked formula like I
shadows um I gave away all three of my
naked palettes I just didn't like the
formulation and I can I told myself to
buy this because first of all it was
fifteen dollars off i believe it's $39
right now on they sephora.com website in
this sales section so it was a great
deal and I also just have been impressed
lately with Urban Decay I palette so
we're told myself to go ahead and
purchase this it looks like this you get
a mascara and eyeliner a lipgloss five
eyeshadows in here a blush aight bronze
or any highlights
so I think it is worth it for the thirty
nine dollars and if I don't like the
eyeshadow it's okay there is other stuff
and other goodies in there so I picked
that up the next thing I picked up with
a brush cleanser this is a instant
no-rinse quick drive formula this is
from make up forever I've never tried
this one I like to try different brush
cleansers the one I'm using right now is
the cinema secrets one I think that's
what it's called it's in like a blue
tube or like a blue little bottle and I
got it so far as well and I like it and
I don't like it I like it because it's
very quick drying and it really does
clean my eye makeup brushes and after
they are completely dry it smells like
buttercream cupcakes like your brush
your brushes smell like buttercream
cupcakes are like frosting or something
it smells so good um but I do notice
that they don't clean or that cleanser
doesn't clean my like face brushes very
well so I was hoping you'd try a
different one this is nice because it is
a spray bottle um and yeah we will see
how bad news the next thing I picked up
was the Bliss aloe leaf plus peppermint
foot patrol aaha exfoliating and
softening foot cream it looks like this
the Bliss line is like on sale like
every single one of their products is on
sale right now at Sephora I'm not quite
sure if they're discontinuing this brand
or what but um yeah I picked that up my
fields have been dry lately and my feet
have been dry so I like to put that on
put some socks on go to bed um next I
picked up another toner this was
actually on sale as well this is from
the nude skincare brand which is
actually normally quite expensive I
believe this was like $36 toner and i
got it for like 20 and this is the
purified toning water it has um
probiotics in it ginger and cinnamon and
I heard cinnamon and ginger are very
good for inflammation if you have oily
combination skin however I also heard
that if your skin is sensitive it can
make it burn or whatever so I need to
try it out first we will see it comes in
this nice little Matt lavender bottle
and it looks like it is one of those
like pump things so you can pump it onto
the cotton pad which is nice because the
toner i'm using right now it's the
l'oreal hide refresh which i really
really love
literally I get it absolutely everywhere
because I dumped it out and just goes
all over the place all over the cotton
pad and all over my whole like bathroom
sink area so anyway excited to try that
out the next thing I picked up where the
Bliss labs nutri cosmetics total bliss
give me strength hair and male boosting
bites in pomegranate blueberry I have
been into nail and hair supplements
lately I've noticed a difference in my
hair not so much my nails yet
unfortunately but I have noticed a
difference in my hair with the stuff
that I have been taking if you guys are
interested I can do a supplement video
on beauty supplements that I take
because I do take a lot of different
supplements for like beauty purposes I
guess you could say like hair and skin
and nail kind of stuff so if you guys
are interested in that let me know in
the comments below but I was excited to
try these like I said the Bliss line is
on sale right now i'm at sephora and i
found this in the sale section for a
really good deal so I'm going to try
those I believe you eat one shoe a day
and it should help your hair and so
really really nice and your nails the
next thing I got was the Urban Decay
24-7 glide on lip pencil and this is in
ozone which is their clear 1i have just
been having a hard time matching my
lipsticks to lip liners that I have I
don't really have that many lip liners
and honestly right now is this season to
wear like a dark lip and I just haven't
been able to match a lot of lip liners
with like that dark lip are the dark
lipstick that I want to wear and um I
noticed that it starts to feather
outside of my lip line so i picked this
up this is a clear lip liner so you can
use it with any color that you want and
it should help with feathering and
making sure that your lip color stays on
longer so hopefully this will be a good
one i do like the formulation of the
24-7 glide on lip pencils and the
eyeliners so we shall see and it looks
like that was oh no that's not it sorry
um I also picked up the Sephora ultimate
oil in gel lipstick remover I thought
this would be nice for swatches this was
on sale as well and also for long
wearing lipsticks to get off because
sometimes my makeup wipes don't take it
off and eat even my oil cleansers
take it off so i thought i would try
this baby out and that is it but now we
have samples and like weekly specials
all that kind of stuff so they were
having a weekly special where if you
typed in the code you could get one of
these Hungarian water essences I don't
know why I got to but I did I don't mind
him this is the belief believe in truth
Hungarian water essence and this is an
aqua based formulation that increases
hydration level by and ninety-eight
percent so that is what those little
babies look like and I also typed in a
code for Kota Lee one of my subscribers
let me know I've talked about the
receiver at all night cream in one of my
favorites videos and one of you let me
know that they had this as one of the
codes that you could type in thank you
so much because my boyfriend i have been
wanting to try the serum as well so this
is dakota lee resveratrol firming serum
so i got that and then i got a hundred
point perk this is the lancome advanced
genifique this is a serum i have used to
full sizes of this two full-size bottles
of this product up before but i just
thought oh i have a lot of points
sitting here i minus well get another
sample remind myself how much I liked it
and maybe I need to purchase a full five
again got a sample of the viktor and
rolf flowerbomb love this perfume is
amazing and let's see here these your
league skin balancing face oil with it
says it's a deeply moisturizing
treatment oil I'm excited to try this
out because um I love the roast missed
like the Rose facial mist that they have
these your league Bram so I thought it
would be fun to try that oil out about
two of those and i also got two of the
hourglass mineral veil primer samples i
used to have a full size of this primer
it is really really awesome and then i
got two samples of the black th delay i
concentrate some fresh I love this eye
cream so good so I definitely got two of
those actually I got three of those and
then I've got the skin
prep your skin with skin Inc pure
revival peel so it's a peel and it says
ready to reveal smooth beautiful skin it
gently removes dullness and dead skin
cells non-abrasive peel that exploits
and repairs your skin so I'm excited to
try that out I have tried the skin Inc
um they had like a soothing serum that I
really really liked so when I saw that
they had that sample I was excited to
try it and that is it I'm digging in
you're looking any more samples know so
that is it I hope you guys enjoyed at
