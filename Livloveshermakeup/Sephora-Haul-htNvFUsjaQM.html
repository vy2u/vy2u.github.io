happy saturday i have a Sephora haul
this morning to share with you guys i
ordered a few things on the sephora calm
website because a few days ago you guys
for whatever reason everybody was
posting about it on Instagram basically
what happened was Sephora took all of
the holiday not all of them but most of
the holiday collections from last year
and they put them half on sale so like
all of them were on sale for half off so
I did pick up some goodies I'm gonna
share with you guys what I got and if
you are curious yes I do have a face
mask on it is a glam glow power madam
alright let's get started the first item
that I picked up was the starlet
deodorant trio this is from la vanilla
if you guys didn't know i recently
picked up my first lab vanilla deodorant
i wanted something without aluminum and
i have been loving the lemon vanilla one
that I got so when I saw that you could
get a set of three of these for like
twenty eight dollars I was like oh yeah
I'm gonna get those so I did pick this
up and in here we have vanilla Snowberry
pure vanilla and also vanilla amber and
if this was at the beginning of summer
then obviously I probably wouldn't get
this because hello those scents are like
very very fall and winter like however
we are approaching the fall time so I'm
super super excited this one is the
vanilla amber and I really really adore
this lot vanilla brand they are free of
like any sort of chemicals they do not
have aluminum petrochemicals fatal AIDS
prop line profit propylene glycol
mineral oil silicon synthetic dyes
sulfates or parabens they are made in
the USA not tested on animals and one
hundred percent recyclable so a really
really good trusting brand in my opinion
all right and then I also got to the
pure vanilla one in the kids and then
the last one I'm super excited about I
think this will be my favorite this is
the vanilla Snowberry so that is what it
looks like so that is the first thing I
got again that was such a good deal
because those are full sizes is the same
exact size is my vanilla lemon 1 and y
am super excited to get that all right
moving on the next item that was on sale
for half off that I picked up was the
josie maran be comforted whipped argon
oil ultra hydrating body butter I
usually get the little trio and they did
have that on sale as well the one that
has like the sweet citrus and also the
vanilla bean and
vanilla apricot which is one of my
favorites but this time I decided to go
ahead and just pick up the big one this
is in the scent apple crisp and I have
never had this one before I was like um
yes I need it so anyway here is what the
packaging looks like a very very holiday
asked but again I don't mind since we're
going into fall wow that just like came
out oh my god oh my god it smells so
good I was not expecting that for some
reason I was not expecting for it to
smell that good her other body butters
do not smell this good that is an
amazing scent it literally just smells
like Fuji apples or like Gala apples or
something like that or like apple pie I
don't even know you guys there I got on
the lid but it smells so but it
literally just smells like Christmas and
the holidays I love that super super
excited to try that out I do already
know what the formulation is like a very
very very moisturizing and if you want
something very similar from the
drugstore I would check out the tree cut
line alright moving on i also got a
korres lip butter gloss trio and
normally I don't haven't been picking up
tons of lippies this year however this
was right up my alley because I love
really comfortable stuff for the lips
and I have never tried these lip butter
gloss trios I do have the lip butter in
the little odd jar in the Jasmine sent
yeah I do like it a lot and in here we
have juicy bright color they're supposed
to be moisturizing in pink peach and
neutral so let me show you guys what
these would look like if I can open it
up what is this it's like someone can I
trickery of this sorcery all right open
oh how is very difficult all right so
here is the first one this one is called
let's see here I'm guessing that this is
an unusual one or natural is it called
oh it's called the natural so here's
natural let's go ahead and do some
swatches oh pretty that looks nice I
like that so here is the shade natural
very nice it smells really good and
caress is a pretty natural brand i would
say for the most part to their
dermatology mythology the
dermatologically tested paraben free
royal free propylene glycol free and
ethinyl omen I'm afraid I don't know I
don't know how to say those things but
they are a pretty good brand and then
the second one let's see here is I'm
guessing that this is it doesn't say on
that which I don't like this one is
probably peach I'm guessing so let's
open that one up and do a so watch our
minute ooh I like that oh my god these
are really actually very pigmented I
mean please excuse my shitty swatches
but look at that that looks like a juicy
papaya shade I really really like that
one and then the last one is obviously
pink so here is the last one and yes
this was obviously like a holiday stat
since it came in a little trio and it
was a good deal i feel like this was
around twenty eight dollars as well
which is pretty good for korres they're
like lip products are quite pricey so
yeah natural we have peach and then pink
very very excited to try those out those
look quite promising alright and then
the last item no I'm sorry I have three
more items the next item that I got with
the Sephora what is this outrageous
volume too dramatic volume mascara and
now this was really funny you guys
because this was three dollars however
for some reason I thought it was a full
size I just got super excited but it is
a tiny little travel-size but anyway you
know that i love the outrageous curl
mascara so i really want to try this one
out and yeah this is outrageous volume
same sort of packaging packaging I
cannot speak today you guys I'm filming
this really late at night anyway this is
the same packaging as the outrageous
curl and yeah I'm super super excited to
try that out alright moving on the next
item that I got was from Tarte this is
the energy noir lipsurgence skin
intuitive lip gloss I'm getting really
like products like this like the jonas a
claw from a cosmetics that kind of just
like change color on your lips this is
what it looks like and I probably I'm
hoping that this is going to be really
really like nice and moisturizing so it
literally comes out like gray charcoal
but then it starts to change color so
you guys can see it changing color and
I'm very very excited to try this out
let's go ahead and
really really nice mm-hmm would taste
like cupcakes oh girl it tastes like
cupcakes and I do like that color it's
like very kind of like powdy pinky
purpley so yeah very excited for that
that was only ten dollars and then I
also got the energy one which is
supposed to be a little more pinky and
this was also ten dollars so such a good
deal i love when all the goes on
sale because it's awesome i do not
recall this happening last year so i'm
quite excited alright and this one goes
on pretty much clear and this one still
looks like dirty charcoal this one goes
on pretty clear but it's probably going
to turn pink and i like the little
applicator very very cute they actually
have different applicators which is
interesting but yeah that is everything
that i picked up but let me show you
guys what I got as samples I got a
hundred point perk of the Estee Lauder
revitalizing supreme global anti-aging
creme I went through a sample of this
like six months ago and I tried to get
my hands on this a bajillion times but
it was saying that it was no longer sold
at Sephora or in the US this is an
amazing cream amazing so this is what it
looks like if you can get this as a
hundred point perk I highly recommend
going ahead and doing so and then also i
typed in a code for the sunday riley
this is the immersion mattifying melting
water gel toner it says it has
marshmallow in it and it absorbs oil it
clarifies it minimizes the appearance of
pores and yet cuz it's tantly I cannot
speak like I'm just stumbling all over
my words instantly transforms for a
cooling gel to water toner as it
clarifies removes oil and visibly
tightens the pores so a very very
excited to try that out sounds very very
promising and very innovative and then
the three samples that I got worthy milk
anti-frizz leave in nourishing treatment
for your hair I also went ahead and got
to the 50 mineral moisture defensive
body sunscreen from md solar sciences
and also the bushes Tsubaki oil infused
exfoliating powder so anyway guys that
is everything that I got let me know if
you saw this sale going on and if you
picked up some holiday stuff as well
from last year and yeah I will see you
guys in my next video fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
