you are watching this I am flying back
to milwaukee right now so all of my
videos starting tomorrow will be back in
my beauty room with me good camera and
all that kind of stuff I just wanted to
say that but I did want to come on here
and post a video for you guys today
since I do like to try and post every
single day so I thought it would be okay
for me to post on my laptop forgive me
but I think you guys won't forgive me
because it's a Sephora haul and who
doesn't love us so for all right so yes
I did some damage at sephora i want to
share with you guys what I picked up and
yeah let's just get right into it so the
first thing I picked up was a full size
of the bare mineral skin longevity vital
power infusion I wanted a full side with
this forever I have gone through like I
don't know six or seven deluxe I'd
samples of this product it's amazing it
is a serum and you use it in the morning
and at night it just helps so much with
the texture on your skin I do have an
active break out right there i'm going
to use this tonight this helps with
breakouts it helps like just the texture
on my skin hyperpigmentation it just
helps smooth everything out i love that
it comes with a pump and i think this is
around 48 or fifty dollars and you get a
nice amount of product in here 1.7 fluid
ounces so yeah I've heard to stay full
slide with this I cannot wait to get
into it I already know I love it so that
is the first item i purchased he's like
an item i purchased was actually on
recommendation of my lovely subscriber
Connie here on YouTube hi honey um
Connie recommend did I go ahead and try
out the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation + concealer she has a very
similar skin to me like she has lupus
just like I do and she outside the
things sort of skin tone as I do so I
was like all right I got to get my hands
on that if she loves it as much as she
does I really need to try it out so I
did pick up the shade 0.5 breeze which I
believe is the lightest one the girl who
was like working the clinic area said it
was so let's hope it matches my skin
because if you guys watched a review
that I did a while back on a what was it
like the clinic perfecting stick or
something like that it was way too dark
and don't get me wrong I love the clinic
brand I love their skincare items but
sometimes their foundations are just
like two copies so hopefully this will
be okay if it matches Connie it will
probably match me and I thought this was
a really really good price for a pound d
Jen and I think it is a it's yeah it's
got this weird like huge doe foot
applicator I don't know it's kind of
like an interesting product I know that
this is not new or anything but let me
know if you guys would like to see a
first impressions on this I have not
even cracked it open yet I haven't even
swatched it on the back of my hands but
it's supposed to be basically a
foundation and concealer in one it's
supposed to have amazing coverage and
I'm super excited to try it out because
it really was a nice price you do get to
one fluid ounce in here which is the
standard foundation sighs and I feel
like this was around what like 27 or
thirty dollars which is a really good
deal for a high-end foundation so that
is the second item i picked up the next
item i picked up oh my god i but i'm a
bum the sephora website forever this is
the origins Maximizer yes this is like a
right up my alley this is a skin
optimizing mask primer and it says take
masking to the max I'm priming missed
with marine algae complex helps hydrate
soften and optimize skin conditions so
it's fully prepped to enhance your mask
experience just a quick spritz gets Kim
primed and ready to bring your skin to
the most flawless potential so basically
you spray this on your face before you
put your face mask on and it's basically
supposed to take your excuse me supposed
to take your face masks to the next
level like let all of the good benefits
that are in your face mask sink into
your skin properly it's supposed to just
make it like 10 times more potent and
i'm so excited like this is right up my
alley so i cannot wait to try that out i
will of course be doing a follow-up all
exactly a week from today on all of
these products so don't worry i will get
back to you guys on how all of them work
out for me but yeah the next thing I
picked up was a cap on date metal crush
eyeshadow single so my friend Mellie
here on YouTube I believe she
recommended that I try out some of these
shadows because they're really really
good deal you get like this huge ass
show like you see the size of this this
is a huge I shadow single and she also
said that they're just really really
creamy and beautiful and easy to use so
I was like okay and I got the shade
let's see here doe sandals it's not
Dolce it says do Cee I thought it was
called copper
anyway um it looks amazing and I believe
this was around 20 or 22 dollars but you
get so much oh my god oh my god oh dear
lord that literally feels like a little
baby but oh my god she was not kidding
these aren't amazing holy crap do you
see that just pure pigment gorgeousness
wow I am so impressed already wow thank
you so much Mellie I know that I'm
definitely going to like this product
I'm literally trying to wipe off the
excess all over my hands now but yeah
this is in the shade doce do doe shady
oce or copper and it looks like this
super beautiful and oh my god so soft
and buttery cannot wait to try and play
with that a little bit alright and then
the next thing i got was this skincare
item that i have heard so many people
talk about this is the shiseido ibuki
multi solution gel it's supposed to help
with roughness and texture on your face
and also like visible pores fine lines
everything basically it says it has
salicylic acid in it and it says to
clean the skin thoroughly before
applying this product cover the entire
affected area with a thin layer 1 2 3
times a day so I don't know if you put
this all over your face or just on
certain areas I thought you put this all
over but i have heard such good things
about this so yeah i thought i would try
this out see what it can do for the
texture on my face the breakouts on my
face and also my fine line so we shall
see let's take a look at it wow it
really is like a jealous it actually
smells really good not like salicylic
acid products at all but it literally is
just like a gel and I'm very very
excited to play with this and try it out
I'm guessing because it does have cell
is feel like acid in it i will probably
only use it at night i'm but i'm excited
to try that little guy out alright and
then the next thing I got to award two
of the tony moly tea tree face mask I
normally don't really like the tony moly
face mask that's funny I love the brand
tony moly I think they have fantastic
hand creams and things like that but I
was just not a fan of I think it was
their coconut mask I had tried out if I
just didn't like it but I've heard I
think her name is Siri or sorry Rihanna
sorry Rihanna here on YouTube I love her
and she was saying that she really loves
the tea tree ones they're very soothing
and nice on the skin she does have
company prone skin and I have been
breaking out lately so I thought I would
try them out and I love tea tree I love
the scent I love everything about it so
I thought this would be right up my
alley so I got to those for about I
think seven or eight dollars please
excuse want to I just don't have a towel
to wipe em off on all right and then
let's talk about some of the hundred
point perks I got so the first one is
from marc jacobs the fine liner ultra
skinny gel eyeliner crayon in the shade
black or noir and this is what it looks
like if i could get it out so this is
what it looks like and i think i may
give this to my mom I mean it looks
amazing because it's so tiny it's like
Micro Micro little thing right there
about I have so many eyeliner pencils
and she loves a really really nice black
eyeliner I don't let's just put it on me
wrong end so I thought maybe I would
give heard that to try it out and then I
also picked up the Armani this was the
fluid shear is supposed to be like a
lumen ating highlighting product um and
yeah let's see oh yeah it's like all
over the place but yeah this is supposed
to be a liquid illuminator or
highlighter I think oh it's pretty is
very very pretty can you guys see that
so very very beautiful and I picked that
up as a hundred point perk as well in or
know if this lighting is really showing
it but it's a very very subtle smells
amazing love that and then I also picked
up the Bobby Brown vitamin enriched
facespace this was also a hundred point
perk and it literally is just a nice
like a really really nice amount of
product right there it's just a primer
or a face base before you put on your
foundation and then I also got a sample
of the fresh lotus youth preserve face
cream probably shouldn't have I'm not a
huge fan of this one I don't know the
girl just like slipped it into my bag
but yeah I don't love the way this smell
so I don't know I'll try and use it up
though and then I also got a 100-point
perk of the ultra Repair Hydra from
sleeping cream from first aid beauty I
love this I don't like a lot of products
from first day beauty but I remember
trying to sample at this and bean like
who that is bomb like I need a full
size of that so because they had it as a
hundred point park and I do have it on
my loveless at sephora right now I just
thought well I guys look at the hundred
boy Burke and then the last thing I got
with my little vib rouge like
congratulations you're I don't know vib
rouge all the way through 2016 or
something like that or 2017 and this is
the little gift that they gave this year
i love how to give this huge ass box and
it's just like this tiny little thing
right here I think that's so funny but
um the gift this year is a NARS blush in
the shade goal glue Golu I don't even
know I don't know but it's a beautiful
kind of plummy rose color yeah I've
never been a huge fan of Nara splashes
does anybody else feel like they are
just really like packed firmly in there
like they just don't feel very soft and
buttery I never thought they were very
easy to blend either so it's a gorgeous
raspberry shade like i'm gonna wear this
but I I don't own a full size of a NARS
blush so and by no means is this a
full-sized but still hi just wanted to
throw that little tidbit in there but
anyway that is the color really really
be a folk or just kind of raspberry
shade and yeah alright guys that is my
Sephora haul I will go more in depth
obviously when I have like my better
camera when I do my follow-up hall I'll
let you guys know how these products
worked out for me and yet I will see you
guys tomorrow in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
