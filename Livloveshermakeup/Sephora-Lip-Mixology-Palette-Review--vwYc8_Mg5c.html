I'm going to be doing a review for you
guys today this one is going to be on
the new Sephora lip mixology palette the
box looks like this and the actual
packaging looks like this it's a really
nice like sleek palette and you get a
magnetic closure it opens up like this
and you get I believe 25 um cus to like
customize the little customizable is out
a word anyway you get 25 mixtures of
glosses and lipsticks really really
beautiful you get some nice purples some
pink some nudes some reds and then you
get a primer up here and even a base so
i really really love this palette also
comes with this dual ended brush let me
show you guys um it is pink right now on
one side because i just applied this lip
color i wanted you guys to be able to
see how nice and pigmented be shed on
these shadows these lipsticks actually
are so i used it this shade down here
and I just kind of habit it on and it
gives just really really beautiful color
I noticed that all of them basically all
of them have extremely extremely
wonderful pigmentation I like the fact
that it's like in mixology palette so
you can actually mix together you know
the lipsticks to get a certain shape
that you want and you can even mix
together the lip glosses and get a
different shade that you want they
recommend that you use one side of the
brush to apply the primer over here and
then go on with lipstick and then top it
with a glass however you can do whatever
you want with it since you know it's
just a customizable palette so basically
um I think that this is going to be best
for people who like to travel um it's
just so awesome because you can get all
your nudes all your pink squirrels
berries and even a primer built-in and I
just think that it's going to be awesome
for travel I really noticed that all of
them have really good pigmentation they
come off almost a little like they look
a little goopy however they're really
not sticky and all they feel really good
and just a few little swatches and it's
like full-on beautiful color so I'm
really impressed I really like it I
think it's totally worth it for the
twenty eight dollars that you get it for
on the Sephora website I will of course
link below where you guys can pick it up
but I really think it's worth it I'm
going to read a few things about what it
says it says the Sephora collection lip
mixology palette is twenty-eight dollars
it is a 25 pan featuring a mixture of
mini lip glosses and lipsticks in pretty
pink red and purple hues and many lip
primer and a double into the lip brush
and three custom look tutorials on the
back of the box I would show you guys
that right now I almost forgot about
that but it shows you how to get an
ombre look a pouty look like how to get
fuller lips in the ocean shows you a
classic look which is like a red lip so
that's kind of fun it's always nice when
they have little tutorials on the back
that you can go and look at it says this
must have 25 pamphlet mixology palette
offers an array of beautiful wearable
shades from pale pink to fuchsia to true
red and encourages mixing matching and
shade layering so combine the lipsticks
and glosses together or we're alone for
a custom look use the double-ended lip
brush to apply a thin layer of the mini
lip primer layer on color until you
reach your desired shade and complete
with a glass for a lustrous finish the
back of the palette features three easy
to follow custom custom tutorials
including how to achieve the trendy
ombre look a fuller lip look and a
classic lip look so in the set you get
25 mini lipsticks and glosses mini lip
primer double-ended lip brush and a
custom book tutorial so for $28 I really
feel like that's worth it because
they're giving so much product and it's
like there's not one shade in here
that's like oh that's such a shame it
doesn't really come off well or it's not
very pigmented all of them are really
nicely pigmented so anyway so I'm really
really excited I think this is going to
be great for travel it's nice and sleek
I don't have to worry about anything
like I don't know like a lipstick and
melting or something I guess these could
melt I will say the only thing i don't
like about the packaging is that it just
gets really like I'm worried that
they're going to start to like seep into
each other if that makes sense and also
I kind of worried like a
like little like hairs and stuff like
stuck in the product they're kind of
like they're goofy they don't feel goofy
on the lips but their kind of goopy
textured like in there so like stuff
gets stuck in there a lot but other than
that that's really my only complaint I'm
really really happy with this little
palette am I definitely recommend so
that was my review on the Sephora lip
mixology palette I hope you guys enjoyed
it if you did give this video thumbs up
and I'll see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
