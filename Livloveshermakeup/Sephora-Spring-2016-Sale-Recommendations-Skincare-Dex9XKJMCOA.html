recommendations for the Sephora of the
IV or v rouge sale we are talking about
skincare in this video so let's just get
right into it it took a lot of energy
for me to narrow it down because I love
skin care just as much as I love makeup
so this was pretty difficult for me to
narrow down but I feel like I have a
nice amount of products I want to share
with you guys and the first one we're
going to start with after you watch this
you're probably gonna go put this on
your list cuz it's so den luxurious this
is the Laura Mercier honey bath and this
is the crème brûlée sent yes creme
brulee get amazing absolutely amazing
these are so brightly on the website but
I mean if you have been I these for a
while oh my god no skansen just knows
get them okay I mean is it smells so
good it literally smells just like honey
and creme brulee but if you have been
eyeing these beautiful luxurious glass
containers like that are her bubble bath
or bath products on the support calm
website now would be a good time to go
ahead and use your fifteen percent off
or ten percent off code to go ahead and
purchase one of these because these are
freaking expensive and I try not to use
this that often because i only use it
for special occasions it makes beautiful
soft bubbles it's very very fragrant its
luxurious and he even comes with like a
little like honeycomb stir till I put it
into the water it's amazing the whole
experience is very limp sure is I highly
recommend all right now let's talk about
some mass so the first you will want to
recommend are from peter thomas roth the
first one is the pumpkin enzyme ass this
is an enzymatic dermal resurfacer love
this is really really well-liked
microderm the hell out of your face i
really really enjoy it if you have
sensitive skin definitely stay away but
if you have combos kids Oh smells so
strongly of like pumps and pumpkin pies
I literally just got it on my nose I've
been getting everything on my nose today
well I've been filming these videos hold
on a minute let me make sure that I
won't look like a freaking hot mess okay
you can kind of knocked out sort of you
can cut it out whatever anyway it smells
really really good literally
pumpkin pie if you do have sensitive
skin this is going to be too much for
you because it is a physical exfoliator
and I also has like acids in it and you
have that pumpkin and the natick sort of
peel going on so we're really really
lovely if you do have congested skin
oily skin combo skin I think you would
love it if you have dry skin you would
also like it because it's going to take
off that top layer of that dead skin
that is on your face just stay away if
you do have sensitive skin now if you
have sensitive skin you can totally use
this map anybody can use this mask this
is a beautiful beautiful mask oh this is
the rose stem cell by repair gel mask
one of my all-time favorite masks peter
thomas roth does it right this is
absolutely lovely it has cutting-edge
plant biotechnology that isolates and
replicates five perfect reparative rose
stem cells really smells amazing is
beautiful on the skin you can put this I
cannot open it okay you can put this in
the refrigerator and kind of put it on
your skin cold it literally just
moisturizes soothe it feels amazing on
your skin and any sort of skin type
could use this really really enjoy this
mask all right another one that's kind
of like an exfoliating mask that I've
recently really fall in love with is the
oly henriksen truth sugar glow polishing
mask this is part of his truth line or
his vitamin C brightening line if you
have skin that has discoloration or you
just want to brighten your skin up and
make it not look so dull this is an
amazing amazing mask highly recommend
has manuka honey in it and it really
explains the skin it's absolutely
beautiful you leave it on for about five
to 10 minutes rinse it off and you just
have glowing gorgeous skin highly
recommend all right another one that is
new to me but I've really been enjoying
for oily or combo skinned people is the
origins by all greens foaming deep
cleansing mask with green tea spirulina
and spinach this can be used two ways it
can be used as an actual cleanser or you
can use it as a mass or treatment really
really lovely I feel like it pulls all
the gum out of your skin definitely stay
away if you have dry or aging skin or
even sensitive skin you're not going to
like this but oily and combo skin
especially for the spring and summer
months this is a really really nice
product and you can get fifteen percent
off go ahead and do that I mean I think
it's a good deal alright moving on let's
talk about some glam glow products i
love glam glow i have had a full size of
all of their masks right now the only 2
full sizes that
are the flash mud and grab any bud but I
just want to talk about if you have been
eyeing glam glow for a while they're
treating us are what $69 sixty seven
dollars apiece very very expensive if
you have an eye in the brand for a while
I highly recommend just going ahead and
taking the plunge and purchasing one of
their treatment mask um during the vib
sale because you are going to get you
nice chunk of money off of that and
you're not going to be feeling guilty
about purchasing a seventy dollar mass
they are worth it in my opinion I'm
gonna tell you exactly which one you
should get for your particular sin type
so if you have aging skin or dry skin I
would recommend gravity mud which is the
purple one if you have combo skin or I
want to stay dry skin combo skin aging
skin I would also recommend flash flood
this is very nice for brightening up and
dullness in skin if you have dry skin I
would recommend thirsty mad which is the
blue one if you have combo skin or oily
skin I would HIGHLY highly recommend
dual cleanse this is my all-time
favorite one it comes in a little green
container and then if you have aging
skin and if you have pretty much
actually a lot of different skin types
could probably use this one if you have
aging skin if you have a dry skin if you
have combo skin or oily skin I would
recommend youth bud which is the black
one so for combos or not combo skin for
sensitive skin I think the only one that
you really could get away with using is
probably power mud or thirsty mind I
know that's kind of difficult but glam
glow tends to put a lot of like
peppermint and things like that into
their products so they are heavily
fragranced and you just might want to
stay away if you do have very very
sensitive skin but I feel like there is
a glam glow mask for everybody out there
and i would go ahead and now would be
the time to purchase a full size because
these little ones that are like twenty
dollars are not worth it it's only going
to last you about a week so i highly
would recommend going ahead and
investing in a large one hopefully you
can find one that you're interested in
and sephora have the great return policy
they'd gone so that's always good all
right
talk about another mask is this an
overnight mask from origins that I think
it's amazing for all different kinds of
skin type it's smells so good to this is
the origins drink up intensive overnight
mac i love this just for replenishing my
skin overnight you put it on you leave
it overnight you wash it off in the
morning beautiful smells amazing and it
doesn't leave any sort of sticky residue
or any sort of color on your face you
can sleep with it and it just looks like
you're wearing a moisturizer all right
you guys probably know what I'm going to
say off when it comes to serums I
narrowed it down to two and then I was
like no if I had to pick one it would be
this one the bare minerals King
longevity vital power infusion has just
like blow me away in the past six months
I am obsessed with this serum this is
the best theorem I've ever tried in my
life it was between this one and the oly
henriksen truth serum which is like the
orange one that one is also really
fantastic I have a full size of that as
well but this one is so amazing any sort
of skin type could try this you will
love it it is beautiful you get a lot of
product in here you get 1.7 fluid ounces
which is quite a bit for a serum it is a
little on the pricier side which is why
I'm recommending you pick it up during
the sale because you really could get a
nice chunk of money off of it and I just
feel like this is an amazing amazing
serum that really hydrates the skin
replenishes it it's just a beautiful
beautiful product highly recommend for
any sort of skin type alright moving on
let's talk about some oils because oils
are expensive and there are three that
are sold at Sephora that are like a big
deal we have feet josie maran we have
the karez wine which is more for combo
skin and in the maracuja one so Markos
oil from tarts this is a little tiny one
I have currently I've gone through these
three full sizes of this this is amazing
if you look really really dry or aging
skin this is also very nice to say
anti-inflammatory if you do have combo
skin or things like that it can help
with redness it can have help with like
antimicrobial antibacterial properties
in it kind of like coconut oil so it can
actually help with breakouts and then we
have josie maran argan oil just the
hundred percent pure virgin the argan
oil light go ahead and get the lite
version ethio copper or oily scan that
the regular version is great for those
who
dry skin aging skin beautiful beautiful
products I also want to go ahead and
recommend her Josie Maran um milk this
is the intense hydrating treatment milk
this is amazing this is really beautiful
if you have extra extra dry skin or
aging skin I think you would really like
this it's got that argan oil in there
but you're also getting a little bit of
an actual moisturizer so really really
good product right there and if you have
severely dry skin the josie maran argan
infinity intensive cream oil is going to
be your baby this is amazing anytime I
literally have like straight up like
psoriasis on my skin this is what I go
to it has a very nice light sort of
lemony scent it will leave you an
absolute oil slick if you have oily skin
I high Lee would not recommend and
especially for me during the spring and
summer I stay away from this that
anytime I get really really dry crusty
skin during the winter time if you have
severely dry skin all year long highly
recommend checking out the infinity
argon oil treatments this is literally
10 times better than the argon oil milk
or just the pure argan oil this will
moisturize you even more they just have
so many wonderful things in here they
have essential fatty acids vitamin E and
you have the hobo and argan oil so a lot
of oils in here very very moisturizing
and then as far as oils go for those who
have Combusken or oily skin I would
highly recommend this korres wild rose
oil this is a vitamin C vitamin C active
brightening oil this is not a serum a
lot of people think this is a serum it
is actually moisturizing oil it's not
going to be moisturizing enough for you
if you have dry skin or aging skin but I
think you could get away with this if
you have oily skin or combo skin like me
you could use this as your moisturizer a
really really beautiful product I
believe one fluid ounces this is about
$62 so good time to go ahead and
purchase it while it is on sale the next
thing I want to talk about is a
treatment this is the only henriksen
invigorating night treatment with
overnight resurfaces and an H a complex
this is fantastic as well as the peter
thomas roth unwrinkle peel pads they're
just two different ways that you can use
them the unwrinkle peel pads you put on
your face and then you wash them off
this you leave on overnight same kind of
concert
really really wonderful it basically
just eats off the top layer of your skin
highly recommend for pretty much every
single skin type except for sensitive
really really enjoy this and I think
anybody would really really enjoy using
this product it helps with fine lines
pours all that kind of stuff all right
oh I forgot oh my goodness how did I
forget it it's in my bathroom right now
is the shiseido a bookie multi solution
gel if you have a big pores or rough
texture on your skin that is amazing it
also helps with acne because it does
have a point five percent salicylic acid
in it that is another one I'm like oh my
god I can't believe I forgot that all
right let's talk about a really really
nice overnight sleeping treatment this
is the sleep tight from pharmacy I love
this it is a firming night balm it's got
the coolest like texture to it it's like
an oil it's a gel to oil sort of
consistency and I just really like it it
is an innovative renewing night
treatment it has a lightweight bomb
transforms into a gel oil you know sort
of formula and it had echinacea in it so
it really kind of opens up your sinuses
highly recommend I feel like a lot of
people could get use out of this if you
have been curious or interested in the
pharmacy brand i highly recommend trying
this particular product out alright the
next thing i want to talk about are some
old a henderson cleansing wipes if
you're one of those people that you
don't like to cleanse your face in the
morning or you go to the gym and you
don't like to cleanse your face after
that these are really wonderful for
those who have oily in combo skin these
are the only henriksen grease relief
cleansing cloths these do not remove
makeup these are simply just cleansing
cloths I would recommend these ones for
oily or combo skin and then the
cleansing truth cloth which with the
orange who orange ones are of the
vitamin C Line those are really
wonderful for sensitive aging and also
dry skin all right and then the last
thing that I want to talk about I know I
kind of got into a little bit of glam
glow is that everything just making sure
yes that's everything I know I kind of
started talking about glam glow but
something that is kind of recent and new
to me are the glam glow cleansers these
are not as expensive as their treatment
mask that are like you know sixty seven
sixty nine dollars but this is
really really wonderful wonderful
product honestly I tried it out to the
thirsty mud not thirsty I'm thirsty
clothe thirsty cleanse I tried all these
thirsty cleanse one really really
enjoyed that that would be great for
those who have dry skin and I did
purchase but I cannot speak I did for it
to say both sides of this super cleanse
which is a daily clarifying or clearing
cleanser it's great for problem skin
skin imperfections poor we find
mattifying clarifying really really
enjoy these if you would like to try out
the formula of the glam glow mass but in
cleanser form these are pretty much the
identical it's leaking all over my hand
right it was in the shower but anyway
really really love this product as well
if you are curious about the glam glow
line and you don't want to invest in a
$67 mask I would highly recommend
checking out their cleansers alright
guys those are my skin care
recommendations for the vib and the ivy
bridge sale I hope you guys enjoyed
these recommendation videos tonight I
will be back tomorrow with my 21 days of
beauty haul from Ulta and I will see you
