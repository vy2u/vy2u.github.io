I am here to share what is on my love's
list for the spring 2016 vib and vib
rouge sale so i'm going to show you guys
what is on my wish list currently so the
first thing i have on my wish list is
the juno sunday riley hydroactive
cellular face oil this is ninety dollars
and I pretty much want all of them so I
have the Juno I have the Artemis I have
the flora and I also do have let me see
if I can scroll down hopefully this
video is not too shaky I also do have
the Luna sunday riley sleeping oil on my
list as well so i'm really interested in
those i would love to pick those up and
i feel like my wish list isn't q out of
control i usually do a haul from sephora
every two to three weeks anyway so my
wishlist isn't crazy out of control but
i do have a few things on here alright
the next thing is this little kota leaf
favorite set this is $39 it comes with
like the face sorbet you have like the
nice facial spread so you get like all
these different things beep Lumia clue I
cream like all this kind of stuff and I
just thought it sounded really wonderful
alright the next thing that's on here is
the laura mercier baked radiance powder
compact and i recently reviewed in the
New laura mercier Ausmus a laura geller
laura mercier highlighters that i really
wasn't a fan of and everybody was
recommending that i try out the mat
radiance one so i have that on my love's
list i also have the tard to BB tinted
treatment 12-hour primer with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 on there this is
wonderful i had a little sample of this
product in the shade fair and i would
love to get a full size of that i missed
it on the 21 days of beauty event for
alta by the way my 21 days a beauty haul
will be up tomorrow for alta because i
did pick up a few things but i missed
that one I was so pissed alright the
next thing I have on here is the Cary
Grant whip whip do this is forty dollars
and these are two different shades that
I personally do not have I have a few of
them i have one in naked i have one in
radiant i have one in what's it called
marsala so i really like these i think
the formula is fantastic and I just
really really enjoyed these so I want
that and then the Kota Lyra spiritual la
lift night infusion cream is actually
for Tom let me move this so that it's
not on my leg so it's not so shaky ok so
this is for Tom I want to pick that up
for him he really really enjoys this
face cream so I'm going to pick up
another one of those for him
and then I also have the tart
rainforests of the sea marine hydrating
boost missed I tried this out in a
little the 500-point perk that was
recently on these sephora.com website I
tried it out i really liked it if you
have sensitive skin or you are very much
not into strong fragrances you probably
would not like that and you definitely
would not like the rainforests of the
sea deep cleansing dive gel either but I
feel like for $25 you do get a nice
amount of product in here and I would
also like to try that one out i really
like the way it made my face feel it had
a little bit of like an oily residue but
then it just rinsed completely clean it
was really cool alright and then i have
the tarte amazonian clay BB tinted
moisturizer with broad-spectrum SPF 20
on here as well because they think that
would be very nice during these summer
months the next thing i have is the milk
makeup cooling water this is like
basically just like a cooling water
stick I thought it sounded amazing for
the spring and summertime and I have not
tried anything from the milk brand yet
so I want to try that out my friend Amy
recently has been talking about these
new a moose boosh lipsticks from by
beauty so I want to try one of those out
particularly that really bright pink
shade also the YSL blew up tin tin oil
these are amazing i have tried one of
these labels smaller size I want a full
size of that and then one of my
subscribers recommended that I try out
the shiseido UV protective liquid
foundation with SPF 42 so I have that on
my list I also have the milk makeup
hydrating oil stick I thought that that
sounded quite promising I really want
this chlorine mango oil this is a spray
for your hair I love the chlorine mango
butter shampoo like it's amazing so I
also want to get the mango mask it looks
like this is currently out of stock i am
doing my shopping tonight for the sale
so hopefully that will be back by the
time I come back but the mango butter
mask looks amazing and then also I have
tried out the chlorine dry shampoo with
oat milk I think it's great I would like
a full size of that I also want a full
size of this drunk elephant be Hydra
intensive hydration gel it is $52 drunk
elephant is a very expensive brand
however I really I tried out a sample of
their virgin marula oil and I was like
damn like this stuff is good so I would
love to pick up this hydration gel it
sounds like it's a very lightweight its
cross salicylic acid B vitamins and it
sounds amazing and
I saw this Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana dolce rosa
excelsa I think that's what it's called
and this is a perfume and if it smells
anything like Rose I'm going to need it
I should probably go in store for this
one to kind of spray it first to see if
I actually like the scent but I mean I
love anything rose so hopefully that is
like rose and then i have the peter
thomas roth 24 karat gold pure luxury
lift and firm hydrogel I patches very
very expensive for these babies but i
love the peter thomas roth 24 karat gold
pure luxury lift and for a mass so I
wanted to try those out also they only
henriksen the clean truth cleansing
cloths these are the brightening ones I
really really enjoyed those and I want
this last one this is the last one that
will complete my collection of the
two-faced love flush long-lasting
16-hour blushes this shade is called
Baby Love and they are currently sold
out and that's the last one that I need
to complete the whole collection so I'm
like come on get back in stock all right
here is the drunk elephant virgin marula
luxury facial oil you guys can probably
tell by the price that is why I have not
purchased it yet $72 for like 1 fluid
ounce of oil that is a lot of money all
right the alterna haircare moisture
intense royal creme pre shampoo
treatment this was nice I got like a
little sample of this and it was just
very very nice on my ends I felt like it
helped to detangle my hair before I got
in the shower so that's on the list also
a bow shud detoxifying black cleanser
this is one of the smaller sizes i
thought i could use that for travel by
the way i just want to say right away
i'm not going to be buying all of this
stuff this is just what is on my wish
list and i just want to make it clear
that i probably won't even buy like half
of the stuff but you guys will see when
i do my hall what I got alright and then
I also have the hourglass ambient strobe
lighting powder I want the pink shade in
here I did it review the brilliant shade
I really like these I think they're
beautiful during the summertime gorgeous
highlights so I mean just like during
the warmer months I feel like they're
not heavy on the skin they're very
lightweight but very beautiful so I want
to get the pink one the Tsubaki
deep hydration sleeping mask Ashgad I
try to sample this and I'm like in love
I need that and also the cover FX custom
infusion drops in the Jasmine sent I
have heard these are amazing anti-aging
drops to really want to try those out
and also this peter thomas roth perfect
health I cannot speak professional 3%
retinoid plus this is an 82 dollar
retinol treatment but that is probably
the next treatment i will be purchasing
alright i recently got the laura mercier
creme brulee hunting bath so i really
want to try out this fresh fig body wash
they are sold out of these two babies
and I understand why i love the tony
moly peach hand cream and the apple hand
cream I want those I need refills on
those I used to have a full size of the
estee lauder CPR wrinkle lifting firming
serum it's really nice it's like a serum
plus primer in one so I really want to
get that I've been wanting to try out
this josie maran nirvana hydrating
treatment mess for a while and I've been
waiting on this to come back in stock
this is the estee lauder revitalizing
supreme global anti-aging creme it is
freaking amazing i need a full size of
that i have put these two babies on my
list as well these are the estee lauder
advanced night repair eye synchronized
complex I've not tried this one but I've
gone through many bottles of this it's
just a really nice serum to have around
and then the last thing I have on my
list as you guys can tell it's mostly
skincare to be completely honest I've
been buying a lot of makeup lately so I
pretty much just want to get skin care
but this is the fresh black tea over
night firming mask which is $92 so I'm
thinking that one might be a good one to
do while i have this twenty percent off
code so that is currently what is on my
wish list or my love's list for the
Sephora sale like i said i won't be
purchasing everything on here but i do
want to get a few things and once i get
everything i will show you guys what I
haul all right I will be on later
tonight with my recommendations for the
sale so i'll be doing one for makeup and
then one for skincare so i'll see you
guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
