I'm going to be doing a review and demo
on the new Sephora Tom infusion which is
a ethereal natural finished foundation I
purchased mine on the sephora.com
website for $24 and it says that this is
supposed to be a beautiful lightweight
moisturizing foundation with a natural
barely-there finish reading it right off
the beige for you it says the ultra
fluid texture of this formula flawlessly
melts on to scan for buildable light to
medium coverage and the feeling of
wearing no foundation at all the formula
glides on for foolproof application and
moisturizers to create a visibly
smoother skin and I have to agree with
all of that I really really love this
foundation um it kind of reminds me of
the what is it these positions formulas
spotless serum foundation I didn't like
that one
just because I loved everything about it
the texture the way it went on my skin
but the fact was was that their lightest
shade was too orange on my skin so I'm
really happy that before I came out with
something similar to that and um I'm
just really really happy with this it's
beautiful it has a beautiful finish
really nice color range I think they
have like probably 20 shades on there
really really nice and the color I'm in
is 10 ivory so I'm just gonna show you
guys how I put this on right now I'm
dealing with some like um it's not even
rashes you know I started using the
derma roller so I've been using that at
night and it really just like pumps the
blood to these surface of the skin I
just did that right before this video so
if I seem really really red in the face
that's why I also did on my neck so it's
a little red but I want to show you guys
just how beautiful the application of
this is and I'm doing it on a bare skin
I have found that it is beautiful with a
primer but you can even use it without a
primer just make sure you moisturize
first actually you don't even have to
moisturize it is like literally just the
best formula ever it really feels like
there's like serums in there helping to
lock in moisture it's really great um I
like applying with my fingers but my
favorite way is with the Beauty Blender
so I'm going to show you guys how I do
that I'm just going to take this and has
a dropper application but I'm just going
to start putting that on my skin I like
to do one section of
so once it's there I like to start
blending it in all I'm writing right now
if you're wondering is I make up and I
base so I didn't even put moisturizer on
I really wanted you guys to see how
beautiful the finish of this is and now
I'm going to apply to the other areas
you can of course apply this you know
with your hands whatever you want to do
but I like the dropper it feels really
classy so I'm just taking that and
tapping it into my skin and you can see
it's leaving this coverage that's like
truly ethereal they got it right with
that word it's not like it's covering
big spots like I do have a pimple right
there but it's covering redness and it's
not making my skin look oily at all it's
covering just enough and I actually find
with this foundation I sometimes don't
even need to set it with powder which is
crazy because I always have to set stuff
with powder use a little neck I've been
really into the thought of just having
light wearing foundations lately I'm not
really sure why another way you can do
this is just apply it onto the Beauty
Blender this will soak it up a little
more into the sponge which you don't
really want but it is another way you
can do it
I do find this it just blends
beautifully with the fingers - it's just
so smooth and if you guys can see you
really can build coverage it's really
nice so I'm not even gonna set this with
a powder I just want to show you guys
what it looks like once it sets you see
how beautifully that builds it's really
covering up that redness that derma
roller won't really beat your face
it's just so silky and wonderful you
guys like oh so good um on the makeup
social accounts someone was saying that
this is also we do for the new Mars
foundation I'm not sure I haven't really
tried any NARS foundations but I love
this so that's a good two layers right
there and you guys can see I'm gonna let
it just sit for a second so it can set
it sets to a really beautiful satin
finish on the skin
I don't even find that I need to I'm
gonna do apply powder but for right now
I'm not going to just so you guys can
see the exact finish of it so make it
give it a few seconds take a little
makeup wipe here so I can break my hand
foundation off as you can see it really
evened out any redness on my skin even
though I am breaking out right now and
you know obviously the derma roller
pushed all that blood to the surface
right before this video um I just think
that like a light wearing foundation so
beautiful during spring summer and this
is just like the epitome of naturally
flawless so you think you guys can see
now that it has started to set and it
just even though it's not covering these
kind of things you know you can always
just go over it with a concealer that's
what I've been doing but as you guys can
see it really just gives a glow and it's
almost like a BB cream but better it's
not as greasy I have combination skin I
always always set my foundation but I
actually find that I don't have to with
this one so I really really really love
this foundation I highly recommend it
like I said it is $24 on the sephora
website they have a great color range it
sets to like a demi matte satin finish
really really beautiful on the skin this
is from somebody who has very like
hambo oily I always always set my
foundation and this looks really
beautiful when you set it - it really
looks super super flawless but this is
without setting yet and yeah what can I
say I love it again this is the Tom
infusion on the phones it's home use
with him in that time I'm butchering it
whatever ethereal natural finished
foundation and it's just beautiful
bottle beautiful finish I just I love
having coverage foundations but this one
just it's my favorite light coverage
foundation at the moment you really can
just wake up wash your face and if
you're in a hurry you don't need to
waste ur eyes you don't need to prime
you can just put this on and actually
you know what I'm going to show you guys
just for the fun of it really quickly
how even more buildable it can be but
I'm gonna do it with my fingers this
time so watch house and this is do you
see that just blends right into the skin
I mean it just doesn't even feel like
I'm tugging or anything like that it
just glides
it's beautiful and I'm so happy that I
found a color match Thank You Sephora
for making a foundation that's really
pale I think this is the lightest shade
this one that is in ivory number 10 but
anyway I'm gonna probably be using this
and get ready with me videos coming up
soon
I'll probably set it with powder there
you guys can see that but um how
beautiful is that without powder you
went no wait I want it come on moment I
have my ELF powder right here just for
the fun of it this is turning into like
a long video put my hair back I'm going
to set it so you guys can also see that
finish I'm using my tone correcting
powder and one of these little bulky
brushes that came in that gift set box
from it cosmetics do you see when I said
it it's just still so smooth looking it
really makes you look poreless even
without wearing a primer
I prefer its SATs like this but it's
really up to you
I think gorgeous either way this is fit
scent really likes beautiful coverage I
just I can't say enough good things I
love it go and purchase it it's only $24
purchase this instead of you know the
NARS sheer glow or that new NARS
foundation which is up there in price
trying this out first see what you think
it's almost like there's a beautiful
like face product built into it like a
serum or something even on my bad skin
base like today it looks great so I hope
you guys enjoyed this review and demo
for the Sephora - infusion tends to tea
infusion it's beautiful I feel ethereal
when I wear even when I'm having a bad
skin day go figure
you get let's see here 20 ml in here or
0.67 fluid ounces that's good and you
know the dropper makes you feel all like
mmm I'm so you know feel like a pretty
fast so anyway that is it I hope you
guys enjoyed I'm actually done this time
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
