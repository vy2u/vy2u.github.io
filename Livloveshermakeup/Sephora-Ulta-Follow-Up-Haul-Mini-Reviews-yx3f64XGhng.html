to my channel I'm really sorry if my
hair looks a little funky in today's
video and probably tomorrow's video if
you didn't know I am going in for some
scalp surgery on a Friday I have some
lupus scarring on the back of my scalp
that never really got taken care of so I
am going in and I'm going to have them
clean it out and kind of make sure
there's no infection
so I'm not able to wash my hair until
Friday so this is what its gonna be
looking like in the next couple of
videos I apologize if it's gross
anyway I wanted to share with you guys
today in my Ulta and Sephora follow-up
haul now originally I was going to be
posting a video all about the new
Tuesday's I showed a palette of the
natural love collection unfortunately I
lost the footage for that well basically
what happens is it corrupted so if you
have worked with like SD cards and
camcorders and cameras in general before
and you know that if you pull the SD
card out too quickly sometimes the
footage is not actually read onto the
file or onto the disk that is exactly
what happened I am just one of those
people and fast when I do everything and
I pulled it out too quickly and I lost
the footage I had filmed that yesterday
when I did it the highlighter review so
I will have to go ahead and refilm that
for you guys tomorrow I don't have time
to go through all of that again today
with all the swatches and everything so
that will go up tomorrow at 6 p.m. but
yeah let's go ahead and get into the
follow-up haul if you don't know what a
follow-up haul is this is basically
where I come back a week or two after a
do a haul which I will go ahead and
throw up in the cards the original
Sephora haul and also the original Ulta
haul I come back a week or two later and
I share with you guys my mini reviews
basically so my final thoughts or first
impressions on these products that I had
picked up and this is just a nice way
for me to be able to give you guys
reviews on them without having to do an
in-depth review on every single product
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
and the first item that I had picked up
was from cover FX this is the custom
enhancer drops in the shade halo so this
is what it looks like it is a really
really beautiful liquid highlight if you
haven't watched in the thumbnail and it
comes in dropper form like this now it
will be doing a battle of the duo
chromatic slash holographic highlighters
for you guys I believe that's coming up
next week next Tuesday and I'm really
excited to share that with you guys
because I'm gonna talk about this one as
well as the next highlight I'm gonna
show you guys in this video this is
actually a super super strong like do a
chromatic or holographic highlighter you
guys can see it has a little bit of
light aid
or blueshift to it I would say actually
a very strong blue or purple shift to it
I think it's beautiful if you do go
ahead and put your foundation on take
this tap it on to your cheekbones with a
damp sponge and then go in with your
powder I think it makes it look very
natural but I also want to try this out
by mixing it into my foundation I did it
one day with a foundation that leans a
little more warm toned and it really
helped to kind of cool down the
foundation if you guys didn't know I do
pull a very strong cool undertone so
sometimes I get these foundations that
are just way too yellow for me and this
was really nice for mixing in with it so
if you do want something that you can
mix into your foundation something that
is going to look actually pretty natural
once you get it onto the skin this is
really nice if you want it to be like
straight-up purples flash of blue on the
face you just have to go ahead and apply
it with a damp sponge on top of all your
makeup and you will get a really nice
dual chromatic holographic effect so I
even enjoyed that I also have been
enjoying the Stila
what is this magnificent metals glitter
and glow liquid eyeshadow in the shade
is what I have on my lid today as well
as on my lower lash line
I love these you guys I want every
single shade I know that they recently
released some holographic shades as well
and I'm gonna look into those a lot of
you have been requesting that I check
those out but here is the shade smokey
storm it is a beautiful kind of topi
pewter shape with a bunch of gold
glitter in it and I love the way that it
sits on the eyes these are so incredibly
easy to use I feel like the eye looks
that you can come out with it look
really really pretty like you spent a
lot of time on them but in reality this
took me like 10 minutes to create I just
think that's so incredibly cool I do
notice that sometimes I do start to get
a little bit of glitter that falls down
on my face throughout the day and also
travels above my eye even when I'm
wearing a primer so you do have to be
careful with that but these wear an
incredibly long time and they are quite
hard to get off at night so I would
highly recommend using like a waterproof
eye makeup remover but overall would
really recommend these you guys and they
are just really awesome in general
alright I also had picked up the Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion in the
anti-aging formula this is currently on
sale for I believe $8 on the Sephora
comm website I would highly recommend
picking it up it is a full-size eye
primer for basically drugstore price
it's really really good Urban Decay is
cruelty free it's I know that they've
been swishing around their new like
primer formulas and from what it seems
like a lot of people are not impressed
with those but I am very impressed with
this I think it's a good product I'm the
only thing you have to know is that the
does have a retinol in it so you do have
to pair it together with a sunscreen but
overall really good product all right I
also had picked up the honest Asti of
Beverly Hills Nicole Guerrero glow kit
and this is what it looks like and a lot
of people are loving this a lot of
people are hating this my two favorite
shades in here are kitty cats and
Forever Young I know a lot of people
thought I would really love this forever
let shape I actually think this is the
glittery astound so I really do enjoy
kitty cat and Forever Young this one's
just a little more chunky this one here
but I have not been having issues with
applying this now I wanted to tell you
guys how I personally apply it to my
skin so that if you are getting a lot of
like chunks of glitter or just like lots
of patchiness on your skin it maybe you
could try it out this way and it would
work a little better I go in with a
sigma f-35 a tapered highlighting brush
I deposit the color on and then I go in
with a buffing brush you can go in with
any sort of like foundation buffing
brush or any sort of blush brush
anything that you really can like you
know blend it in I guess you could say
just really buff it in and what I do is
I'll take like uh what was that using
this morning I think it was the Lexi 522
small contouring and what I do is I
really just buff it in circular motions
on to my skin I have this layer together
with the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills what
is that Sun dipped glow kit today and I
think it looks beautiful on the skin I
really love the way these look on the
skin the shade that I do have on today
is Forever Young and also moonstone from
the other glow kit so if you are having
issues with this I would highly
recommend just getting something that
you really can buff into the skin or
maybe applying it and then going in with
a fluffy brush so you can pick off the
excess glitter I haven't been having any
issues with glitter but I just wanted to
tell you guys that's how I've been
enjoying it and that's how I have been
using it and not having any sort of
problem so I've been loving that I also
have been loving my one-step facial
cleanser from philosophy this is the
purity made simple I use this to clean
up my makeup brushes I think it's really
really nice the only problem is I found
out the philosophy does test on animals
which is so weird because there's such a
natural brand you would think that they
wouldn't but they do unfortunately but
yeah this is a really good one for
cleansing your makeup brushes a lot of
you have been recommending I check out
the dr. Bronner's next so I'm gonna do
that let's see here I've been loving at
the Sunday Riley title brightening
enzyme water cream I've been using this
all week in the morning and at nighttime
and last night I walked in on Tom using
this and I was like oh my god yes I love
when he takes care of his skin
really gotten into skincare since he's
been dating me and he really does take
good care of his skin so I love that I
walked in on him using this he thought I
had a really nice gel consistency to it
it's very nice and hydrating he's
definitely a little more dry than I am
but even with my oily combo skin I don't
feel like this ever gets too greasy I
think it's beautiful it helps to
exfoliate because it has like papaya and
enzymes in there and then also it has
hyaluronic acid so it binds in the
moisture it's just a really good product
and I'm thinking of doing a video for
you guys on skincare products that
actually work so please let me know down
below if you would like to see that
video but yes very very excited and
happy with that two items that I am
returning are the Urban Decay Naked skin
highlighting fluids I will go ahead and
throw up in the cards my review on these
my very disappointing review on these I
got the two shades aura and luminous
they are back in the box and since they
are going back just a for now but this
is what they look like I do not think
these are good at all you guys I think
it's just one of those very hyped up
things they thought they could get away
with going ahead and marketing these and
putting them on the market because
everybody loves that me naked skin line
but yeah these are very very weak
highlighters in my opinion they don't
even really strobe your face I think I'm
strobing as being a more like docile way
of highlighting your face so it's not as
noticeable or a more subtle way these
don't even like stroked my face they're
just really crappy if you are someone
who has absolutely perfect skin and you
just don't have any texture or any pores
or anything like that and you want like
the lightest slightest amount of
highlight I think you would like these
but overall I'm not impressed at this is
the shade luminous which is the cool
toned white shade with gold shimmer and
then this one right here is aura which I
have in powder highlight form and I'm
much I prefer it in that form but this
is a cool toned pink shade with silver
iridescent alright the next item that I
had picked up was the Becca what is this
shimmering skin perfecter press initiate
prismatic amethyst beautiful beautiful a
little lavender a flying saucer I have
been adoring this you guys this will be
in the Battle of the holographic
highlighters or dual chromatic
highlighters as well it has a wonderful
nice of a lavender pinky shift to it and
I just think it's so pretty if you are
someone who does have more ID cool
undertone I think you would love this I
feel like it would work for a lot of
different skin tones it's just gonna
look a little different on each skin
tone so if you are very very deep this
is definitely to show up more of like a
whitish color on your skin if you do
have a tan complexion it will probably
show up more pinky and if you do have a
very fair complexion you are definitely
going to get that lavender shift so I
really like it
it's beautiful and honestly the formula
on this one seems to be a lot better
than some of the other shimmering skin
perfecter press that I do own I noticed
that I don't get as much kick up when I
put my brush in there which I really
appreciate and it works for a lot of
different skin types these particular
highlighters are really really nice and
if you're oily if you're dry I feel like
they don't really emphasize too much
texture unless you put too much on so
you just want to apply it with a nice
fluffy brush they're really beautiful a
typical kind of powder formula but yeah
very very beautiful and I feel like they
can be built up to like an extreme
highlight or you can wear them very
naturally so love that and then finally
I did want to talk about the little
500-point perk since I've been talking
about Too Faced so much recently this is
the chocolate bar 500-point perk it came
with a liquid lipstick as well as a
little chocolate bar chocolate bites
palette right here and then also a
better than sex mascara I did want to
let you guys know if this is still
available I would pick it up these are
exactly what you find in the chocolate
bar palette these three eyeshadows and
then this is like identical to the
full-sized chocolate Soleil that I have
and no like the one that I know and love
basically so I would recommend picking
this up if you guys can I think that
these swatch beautifully they're very
very smooth and creamy super super
pretty even on like my dry mu posse
hands you can see it goes on nicely so I
do like this little 500-point perk and I
know a lot of you wanted me to keep you
updated on that
alright let's go ahead and get into the
stuff that I had purchased from Ulta the
first one was from Burt's Bees this is
the cleansing oil with coconut and argan
oil
oh it just like it yeah I think about
two oil just like flew onto the floor
anyway I have used quite a bit of this
up as you guys can see I feel like I'm
almost halfway through which is pretty
darn quick I did get six ounces of
product in here I took this when I
travel they used up like a whole little
mini of that and then also I've been
using it every single night to remove my
makeup I am loving this this is by far
one of the best cleansing oils I've ever
used I think I like this just as much as
I like my beau shove makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil I feel like that says a
lot it has a very very liquidy it's thin
consistency but it washes off all of
your makeup which is awesome so thank
you so much to my friends Darlene who
recommended that I try this I think it's
fantastic now I have been seen a lot of
you commenting saying that you don't
know if Burt's Bees is cruelty free or
not I'm honestly kind of confused at
this point to a lot of you are saying
they are cruelty free a lot of you are
saying that they're not so I actually
wrote to Burt's Bees I'm waiting a mime
on my response from them but I will keep
you guys updated on
cruelty-free status you would think that
they would be cruelty-free but I believe
they were bought out by like Clorox or
something a year or two ago and they are
selling in China and distributing there
so they do tests on animals but I'm
still confused if like they switched
back I don't really know I looked on
logical harmony looked on cruelty-free
kitty it's very very like indecisive
nobody can really make their minds up
about like what's going on so I did
contact them directly I will let you
guys know when I hear back from them but
yeah this is fabulous I also have been
enjoying the Pacifica happy essence
Hydra mist it says it refreshes and it
fights the look of fatigue with coconut
water green tea and very happy extract I
think this is quite good it's not my
all-time favorite facial mess I did have
one of you who have lupus tell me in the
comments on the original alcohol that
this did not work for you it really
really burnt your skin and you were
saying that you had like an active I
think butterfly rash at the time I've
not used this when I've been in a flare
because I have not had a flare for six
weeks thank goodness but I didn't really
notice any sort of like stinging or
burning things going on with my skin and
please let me know if you want a video
on what kind of skin care I use when I
am in a flare-up this is not something
that I would necessarily use when I'm in
a flare-up I try and use very very
natural and minimal products on my skin
like coconut oil very very natural based
products but yeah this was fine for me
it's not amazing I saw that Mario
Badescu has a new of facial spray out
with green tea in it so I think I'll try
that one next but it's definitely like a
good product so I've been enjoying that
I also have really been loving on my uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills glow kit in the
Sun dipped version like I said today I
have on the shade forever lit from the
Nicole Guerrero glow kits layer together
with their shade right here which is
called a moonstone and I love it I love
the glow you guys I don't think it looks
chunky or yucky it just looks beautiful
and foiled and very like impactful
impactful is that even a word it just
looks beautiful like I am like a beacon
of light for the astronauts in space
okay and I like that I'm one of those
people either I wear no highlighter or I
wear too much highlighter like there's
just no in-between for me but if you are
a fair complected and you're worried
about this being too dark for you this
guy right here works has a great bronzer
if you do go in with like a very fluffy
brush and apply it around the outer
perimeters of your face I actually did
that today I don't know if you guys can
tell I did it yesterday as well and
somebody was like what is that glow
coming from your skin and I think it was
this one so I think three out of the
shades in here I really
three out of the four I really can use
and really get a lot of use out of so I
think that's great and then this shade
right here tourmaline tourmaline
tourmaline one of you told me how to say
this and I already forgot Turo line Turo
line I'm gonna go with tourmaline it is
a beautiful purple II kind of silver
shade and it's gorgeous but I do have to
layer it with one of these to really
pull it off but yeah this one I can
definitely use as well so if you are
fair complected and you wanted to try
this out I would go ahead and give it a
shot the formula is super smooth and
gorgeous absolutely no glitter in here
by the way and then also I have these
two halves products the first one is the
white peach rose a and peony herbal
shave gel it is limited edition and also
the blushing grapefruit and raspberry
creme a shower hydrating herbal body
moisturizer I am obsessed obsessed I
need to see if hemp's is still buy one
get one 50% off because they are vegan
they are cruelty free and this
rocks okay this stuff is so good I love
this it's like the Nivea in-shower body
lotion what you do is you apply it when
you're in the shower so you're like all
wet okay you turn off the water you put
this all over you wait a couple of
minutes then you rinse it off and you
get out of the shower and you towel dry
I never feel like at least residue on my
skin but it really does hydrate so that
I don't have to use an actual
moisturizer when I get out of the shower
so I've been loving that and then this
guy is just like the best shaving gel
ever it's really really close it comes
in a close second to my tree hut shave
oil which is my all-time favorite
shaving product it is beautiful it
smells amazing and it is a gel so if you
don't want a foam and you want to gel
something a little more cooling this is
awesome all right I did also let's see
here I don't know where the other one is
but I did purchase two sponges the first
one is the miracle complexion body
sponge from Real Techniques this is what
it looks like it's not even damp right
now this is that dry it expands so big
when you do use it wet but as you guys
can see I actually use this today and I
am obsessed with this you guys using it
on my face I've not even tried it on my
body yet but when it is damp it's like
this big and it literally will blend
your foundation in like two minutes and
I am somebody who does not like to spend
a lot of time on my makeup so that was
amazing really really have been enjoying
that and I'm sure I can use it for
self-tanner this summer as well and then
I also did pick up the miracle diamond
sponge which I am also really enjoying
that one is being cleaned right now so I
don't have it here to share with you
guys but that is wonderful as well the
only thing I don't like about it is the
really really tiny little tip at the top
I just feel like it's very useless so I
kind of turn it on my stop on the side
when I want to get around my eye area
but the flat bottom of that was really
nice for stamping on foundation and then
the last item is the Burt's Bees gloss
the lip crayon in the shade Pacific
Coast pink this is beautiful I was
wearing this in a video last week and a
lot of you are complimenting my lip
color I think it's a beautiful berry
color for summertime it's more of like a
muted of fuchsia and I just think it
looks really nice it smells pretty good
it tastes pretty good and it's easy to
put on so I've been enjoying that
alright guys so that is it for my follow
up haul I hope that you enjoyed these
little mini reviews on these products
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow for that
review bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
