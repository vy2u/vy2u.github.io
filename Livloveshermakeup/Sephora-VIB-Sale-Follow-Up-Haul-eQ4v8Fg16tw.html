channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you were all having a fantastic
day as always in today's video I am
giving you guys my follow up all on the
items that I got from the div sales so
the first thing that I had purchased was
the milk makeup cooling water stick and
really enjoying this a lot I would say
if you have oily or combination skin you
would enjoy this a lot if you have dry
skin or aging skin you probably want to
stay away from this it really has a very
light texture to it I have been using it
in the morning and what I do is after i
put on my serum i will put this all over
my face and then i will follow up with
an oil because it does have
moisturization to it like moisturizing
properties but it's not that
moisturizing so if you do have aging or
dry skin i would highly recommend
looking into the other product that they
have that is similar to this and that is
called the oil stick i think that that
would definitely hydrate a little better
but so far i really have been enjoying
this these that an item i picked up from
the sale was the bike beauty a most
boosh lipstick in the shade sorbet i'm
loving the new formulation of these I
find them very very moisturizing they
smell like lemon cake so I really love
the scent on them these do rub off onto
my flute head joint so I can't really
wear them when I'm kacta Singh but I do
find that these are a lot more
moisturizing than the old lipsticks like
the newer formulation is a lot better
however I have quite a few of the older
formulation and I think that those state
on the lips a little better which would
make sense because they're not as
moisturizing so I do prefer the new
formula I like a really really
comfortable lipstick so I'm join that a
lot the next item I had picked up with
the Kota Lee um this is the of their
little $39 beauty set in here you get
little deluxe I samples of the eye cream
the moisturizing sorbet the beauty
elixir the instant detox mask and they
micellar water so I'm really happy ended
up getting this kid because two of the
items that I had planned on picking up
in full size I actually do not enjoy
that much so the two that I'm not that
crazy about are they micellar water and
also the vitalSource creme sorbet I
thought the creme sorbate was going to
be a lot more like a gel consistency it
actually comes out a very thick cream
but I did not find that it really
moisturized my face very well I do have
combo skin so I'm
in my t-zone and dry on the outer
perimeters of my face and I felt like it
actually left my cheek area point dry so
I do not like this product at all I also
think it has quite a funky sent to it
you will be seeing that in my fails and
holy grails at the end of the week and
then the second item in here is the
micellar cleansing water I don't really
like this that much i think my simple
and my Garnier with the pink cap I think
those are much better than this I
believe a full full-size full price full
size full size for a full price is
pretty much like twenty to thirty
dollars so i personally would not
purchase this in eight both sides i
don't think it's anything special and
again it has kind of an off-putting sent
to it not item that i bought in the kit
that i really love is the coda leave you
t elixir i feel like this tones your
face a little more than actually like
nourishing or moisturizing it they did
go ahead and change the nozzle on these
so if you were like me and you bought
the old one that has like the little
silver nozzle that like literally it
would spray out in spurts all over your
face and you got annoyed they did go
ahead and change the nozzle so now it
comes out really really evenly I like to
set in my skincare in the morning and at
night with this product and I really
enjoy it and then in the kit we also got
to the instant detox mask and also the
eye cream I like the I preme a lot it
reminds me one of my all-time favorite
eye creams which is the yes to
grapefruit dark circle correcting eye
cream has the same sort of consistency
it also has a little bit of a yellow
tinge to it so it does help with
under-eye circles i have been using this
at night time however because it is so
lightweight i would definitely recommend
it for oily and combo skin but also i
think that it would be nice underneath
makeup so i think i will try that next
week and then it also had the detox mask
like I said this is really lovely it
does have a little bit of big pink color
to it so when you first apply it to your
skin it kind of looks like you have a
bad sunburn but it does dry down to you
know a typical sort of clay mask feeling
it feels kind of strange on your face
like you can't really move your face or
have any expressions it hurts to smile
it still is really really good I felt
like it really detoxified my skin pulled
out all of the gunk and the debris so I
did enjoy that quite a bit alright
moving on the next thing I purchased
which I have on my face today is the
Tarte Amazonian clay BB tinted
moisturizer with SPF 20 sunscreen my
shade is ivory this is oil-free
antioxidant rich and it is formulated
without parabens mineral oil fatal
eights triskele goats from the left
Driscoll and Driscoll and sodium lauryl
sulfate and gluten you know tarts they
have really really good ingredients and
I really do like the shade it does a
pull a little bit of a warm undertone I
personally have a cool undertone in my
skin but the ivory shade is a perfect
really good match for me should save
perfect it's a very good match very
close um I really have been enjoying
this if you are expecting this to give
the coverage of like a BB or CC cream
likea cosmetic CC cream it's not going
to like I said I do have it on today I
have tried applying it with a brush my
fingertips and also a damping beauty
sponge I prefer it with a damp Real
Techniques sponge I think it goes on
really really beautifully i love the
finish it gives this does last all day i
love that has sunscreen and it is
however it gives very very minimal
coverage so if you are someone who has
just really really like a good
complexion to begin with you would
probably like this every single day for
me i've just been enjoying wearing very
very light products on my face this week
so i have an even layer of this all over
my face and then i went in with my hard
candy glamma flage concealer today and
went underneath my eyes and on my
eyelids and that is so you still can see
my acne scarring through this product
you can also see a few little areas
where I have some spots but for the most
part I love it very lightweight very
very comfortable on the skin it's not
extremely moisturizing but it still
gives a nice amount of moisture that
won't make you greasy if you do have
copper or oily skin alright moving on
the next I know I had picked up was the
peter thomas roth 3% retinoid plus high
potency retinoid serum i am loving this
this is probably the highest like
percentage of retinol that you can get
over the counter it's really lovely it
has a wonderful consistency it feels
like an oil when you first like to posit
it into your hands however it has kind
of like a dim ethicon feel to it which
is nice because it doesn't really weigh
down your skin it almost feel
learned like hobo oil it really really
sinks into your skin quickly and my
boyfriend has actually been using this
this week as well he is a doctor who has
a prescription for like it you know an
actual like prescription strength
retinol product and he said that he
prefers the consistency and the results
of this a little more so we've been
using this for about a week now and I
really really enjoy it I had a bad
reaction to the polished choice 1%
retinol treatment that was just too much
for my skin and it's interesting that
this is three percent but it doesn't
irritate my skin so it really shows that
there are moisturizing properties in
here as well so that's really nice if
you do have combo or oily skin all you
need to put on your face at night is
this product I will be doing a video on
retinols because a few of you have been
asking I will be 24 in three months and
i have been using retinol since i was 18
and I don't have any severely like deep
set wrinkles I do have fine lines but
for the most part for someone who moves
their face as much as I do I have a very
expression to face I think that my skin
has done relatively well for being 24
years old alright moving on and the next
item I picked up was the YSL of a love
skint skint a lot tintin oil this is
amazing you guys to smell so good the
shade i have is cherry michelly and it's
a beautiful look at this little
applicator everything about this makes
me happy but the send it literally
smells like a watermelon like laffy
taffy or something really really love it
it gives a beautiful tint to the lips I
have been wearing it I have to ring in
for about three hours so all that you
can probably see right now is the tint
but when you first put it on it's very
glossy and plumping on the lips gorgeous
love the formulation of these I will
probably pick up more and then the next
I am I had purchased was the Laura
Mercier Matt radiance baked powder
highlight in 01 thank you so much to
everybody who recommend that i picked
this up i am absolutely in love and
obsessed i will be doing a video on
highlighters for fair skin tones like
which ones are the best the ones that I
like to use for my fair skin so this
will probably be in there it's beautiful
I do have it on my cheekbones down the
bridge of my nose out so on my Cupid's
bow and my chin today I think it's
beautiful it gives a very like wet
appearance to the skin very easy to use
a little
a long way you do get a lot of product
in here so thank you so much to
everybody who recommended this one it is
a gem and then the last product I picked
out was the chlorine or the second to
last product one of them is still in my
shower it probably should have left this
one in there as well because it's
leaking anyway this is the chlorine
mango butter hair mask i did use this up
completely you guys know if you've been
watching me for a while that I use a
deep conditioners as my everyday
conditioner so this didn't go very far I
believe there's only what like five
ounces of product in here yeah 5.07
fluid ounces of product in here which is
actually not that much that is not the
standard size so there wasn't a whole
lot of product in here it smelled
absolutely heavenly if you love the
scent of like tropical fruits or mango
you would enjoy this I really like what
he did for my hair I am very much
overdue for a coloring at about two to
three inches off of my ends my hair has
gotten pretty much out of control I
measured it the other day it's almost
down to my belly button you guys
probably can't tell right now but you
can see I got my hair in a ponytail and
it's way past like my bust area so my
hair has gotten very very long and I do
need to take off at least two to three
inches but my ends were starting to look
really really ratty and now I can't
after using this for a week I can't even
find any split ends if I try so that's
really good as far as color goes I mean
it didn't really do anything for that I
feel like it did strip a little bit of
color out of my hair but again I just
need to get my roots done but I think
it's a wonderful product it has kind of
a slippery consistency it's a little
fluid like not so much like a thick
butter like I thought it would be but
it's really lovely I would repurchase i
believe it was around twenty dollars
with the 20 or with the fifteen percent
off code so normally i think is
twenty-five to thirty dollars originally
but it's a really nice product i will
repurchase that i'm going to save it for
special occasions and then they last
item is in my shower and is the charge
rainforest of the seed deep dive
cleansing gel loving it so much i use
about two pumps of it at nighttime I put
it on my face and then I go in with my
clarisonic really nice for combo skin it
definitely clears out the oil in my
t-zone but leaves the outer perimeter of
my face nice and balanced if you're
sensitive to fragrance you will not like
it the tour de force that the sea
skincare line is very heavily fragranced
of citrus grapefruit stuff like that so
if you know
like that stay away from the marine
boosting miss did the am what is that
the night cream while the nine curve is
not as bad or the date cream they have
like a lotion or a create face Corey
basically it doesn't smell as bad but I
would say that the deep dive cleansing
gel is very very strongly fragranced as
well as the marine boosting mess I like
the smell a lot of people are like no
it's too much but yeah if you have
sensitive skin I would stay away so
anybody those are all the items that I
picked up from the vib sale I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
