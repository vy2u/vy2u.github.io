thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be my so far a vib
sale of video so I'm sharing with you
guys what I picked up from the Sephora
vib or vib rouge sale I did share my
wish list and my recommendations videos
if you guys are like I think the vib
members and the beauty insiders the sale
is still going on for you so I will link
those videos down below if you're
curious if you would like to see that
but yeah I picked out a few things from
my wish list and i purchased them so
let's just get started the first thing i
purchased is actually in my shower it's
the tartrate force of the seed deep dive
cleansing gel i purchased a full size of
that i really really like it i did use
it last night which is why i still in
the shower oh but anyway it's really
really nice I like the way that it goes
onto my skin of course I will be doing a
follow up all on all the items that I
show you guys here but I didn't want to
grab that cuz it was all gunky and wet
in the shower but anyway I really really
am enjoying that I will see right away
if you have sensitive skin or if you are
sensitive to fragrance I don't think
you're going to like any of the products
from the rain forest of the sea skincare
line they have a very strong citrusy
smell to them I personally really really
enjoy that but I know some people don't
but anyway that is the first item i
picked up the second item i picked up is
also from the tart brand this is the
tart high-performance naturals and with
sony and clay BP tinted moisturizer with
broad-spectrum SPF 20 this is what the
outer packaging looks like and the shade
i picked up is called I braids I just
want for the lightest one I thought that
would probably be the best color match
and it looks like this is going to be
really good so this is just an oil-free
like tinted moisturizer kind of like a
BB cream it says it has an antioxidant
rich formula and it is formulated
without parabens mineral oil fatal aids
triskele in sodium lauryl sulfate and
gluten so I'm going to put a little bit
i haven't even opened this yet i'm going
to put a little bit on the back of my
hand so that we can see what the actual
color looks like it seems like it's
going to be a really really nice skin
match for me and it was i was like going
between this one and the what is that
the BB tinted primer i was having such a
hard time because i really like that BB
primer as well I got a sample of that
this one I've never tried a sample oh
look at that color match that looks
really beautiful this one I had never
tried before but I was just really drawn
to it I don't know why I just really
really wanted it hold on a sec let me
grab a little paper towel I just really
really wanted it and I thought it would
be beautiful and it looks like it's
really nice on the skin kind of like
luminous and dewy and I really wanted
something nice and lightweight for the
summertime so that was the first thing I
picked up the Amazonian clay BB tinted
moisturizer next on my list will be the
BB tinted primer because that is a
really good one alright next I got this
little milk makeup cooling water stick
and this was just I don't know this
really really just drew my attention in
I have no idea why I think it's because
it's basically like a hydration stick if
I can open this damn packaging all right
so it looks like this and I haven't
tried anything from the milk line yet I
know that that's kind of like a you wear
brand on these two for our website this
is what it looks like and this is a
cooling water stick so basically it's
supposed to be like a moisturizer in
stick form that you basically can just
rub onto your face and I know that that
might be kind of weird like some people
who are germophobes might be like what
the hell but it really feels nice look
on the back of the hand it actually
reminds me a lot of my stila aqua blow
primer which I love that basically comes
in stick form in its out so cooling but
this is actually like a moisturizer and
it feels really nice it doesn't smell
like anything so I think I'm gonna like
this I just thought during the summer
time this would be nice for my
combination / oily skin maybe it won't
like way my skin down you know what I
mean so yeah I picked that up the next
item I got was a little kid from Coley
and it looks like this and this was like
thirty nine dollars I thought it was a
really really good deal because you do
get quite a few products in here and
then you get the little packaging as
well which i think is cute and nice for
travel so the first things that you get
in this little kit is the code lee
micellar cleansing water and i am all
about my seller waters and i am going to
be doing a video I'm like the Battle of
micellar water is the good the bad and
the ugly because i have come across like
quite a few now that I really like and
some that I really hate but anyway I was
really curious to try this out I
going to purchase a full size of this so
i thought this kids would be nice to try
out so that is what the cleansing water
looks like and then it also has this
product in here which is an instant
detoxifying mask and you guys know i'm
all about masking i'm asked pretty much
every day every other day probably every
day um so i felt that this would be nice
to try out i have never tried and masked
from kota lee before it also comes with
a little small size let's see here you
get one fluid ounce of the beauty elixir
which i really really like it's
basically just like a setting miss you
think use it to set in your makeup but
mostly to set in your skin care like I
feel like that's what people usually use
it for just to kind of freshen up your
skin throughout the day or to actually
set in your skincare at night or in the
morning and I really liked this I
remember this like leaving a really cool
like tingling feeling on my skin and I
really really enjoyed it it says it
smooths your skin for a glowing
complexion so that is what the beauty
elixir looks like and then you also get
a little eye cream in here and i'm all
about that so this is the clumbia clue I
cream and yeah this looks really really
nice I've actually heard quite good
things about this particular eye cream I
still like on the fence on if like I
craigs even really work because i feel
like i can just use my moisturizer go
underneath my eye area as long as it's
not too heavy i can just go underneath
my eye area without any problems and I
get just as much much hydration but I
thought this would be nice to try out
and it came in the kit anyway so I will
let you guys know on that one and then
the final thing that was in here I was
super super excited about this is the
vinyl source moisturizing sorbet yes how
nice does that sound moisturizing sorbet
like yes it says apply morning evening
to face a neck by itself or after your
serum so yeah I'm going to try this out
and I will let you guys know like i said
i'll be doing a follow up all on all of
these items so yeah that was thirty nine
dollars and then you to get this little
bag as well which i think is nice for
travel and then they next
I thought was from YSL this is the left
tint in oil this is a nourishing lip oil
color enhancer and the shade i got was
number five cherry my Shelley and this
is what it looks like i did have like a
small little sample size of this at one
point and i was like i need a full size
of that so basically goes on kind of
clear it has a really cool little
applicator and then it starts to like
actually well no you can kind of see it
right away so it goes on kind of clear
and then it turns into this beautiful
kind of pinky color and it's a longer
it's on your lips the more colorful it
becomes I really like this I think it
warms up with the actual like the I
don't know what do they call like the
peach of your lips I think it's kind of
like the it cosmetics what's it called
um Oh what's it called you know the one
that like heats up the shouldn't say
QWOP goodness it's too early in the
morning it's kind of like those unis
aquatic it heats up on your lips and
then it leaves a beautiful kind of pinky
fleshy color and then it actually stains
your lips so i really like it it stays
very very glossy for a while and then it
just dries down to a stain so I picked
that out which I'm very excited about
and then the next thing i got is another
skincare item so it was between this one
and the sunday riley luna oil which is a
retinol product as well this is the
peter thomas roth clinical skincare pro
strengths 3% retinoid plus high potency
retinoids serum and i have heard who was
it Marlena from makeup geek talking
about this I really really love retinol
I think no matter what like you are
never too young to start taking care of
your skin and retinol is amazing like it
really really does turn back time in my
opinion so I was debating between this
one and the sunday riley luna oil
because the luna oil is a retinol but in
oil form and i thought that was so cool
but then I was starting to hear that it
is heavily fragranced and that some
people didn't really like the feel of
the oil on their skin so I thought it
would be better to go with the peter
thomas roth one i have a lot of
experience with peter thomas roth
products i really really enjoy them so I
thought I would start with this one it
they were both like let's see the Luna
oil is like
five this was like 88 so they were
around the same price and I was like oh
which one should i get i think i'll just
start with the peter thomas roth so
anyway this has three percent retinoid
anti-aging overnight treatment in it
with a super lipid complex and atheist a
staple retinol and it also is a serum
which is different than like an oil or
like a moisturizer sometimes retinol
moisturizers can be really heavy on the
skin so I'm super super excited to try
this out i will be using that at
nighttime as my treatment and then i
will go in with a moisturizer on top if
I need to and then the next item I got
was from Laura Mercier and everybody was
telling me to pick this up because i did
not like those new laura mercier they're
not new they were the UM you don't look
really really pretty illuminator they
had new shades and i did not like those
at all so everybody was recommending
that i pick up the laura mercier matt
radiance baked powder and the shade i
got was 0 1 which i believe is the
lightest one it's called highlight 201
this is what the outer packaging looks
like and then it looks like this on the
inside I think it's super beautiful it
looks like a beautiful little moon so
this is what the actual product looks
like let me go ahead and swatch it I
feel so soft and buttery and creamy oh
yeah I'm gonna love that oh my god
that's a beautiful color you guys were
not kidding do you see that Sheen
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so I'm
excited to use this because like i said
i did not like the laura mercier
illuminators i felt like the texture was
really off with them they were kind of
crispy and hard I just was not a fan so
I think this one is beautiful I can
already tell that I'm gonna love this it
looks like it's gonna be great for my
skin tone sorry I just looked at my
lipstick in here making sure it's not on
my teeth um but it looks like it's going
to give my skin a beautiful glow and it
looks like it's gonna be a nice match
for my skin tone so I'm excited for that
Hey and then I also picked up let's see
here the chlorine mango butter hair
masks so I love the chlorine mango
butter line I have one of their what is
it is it there moisturizing shampoo I
tried their moisturizing shampoo and the
moisture as you can
sioner didn't love the conditioner but I
do love the shampoo so I thought I would
go ahead and try out the hair mask so
this is what it looks like you do get
let's see here 150 ml or 5.07 fluid
ounce was a product in here but this was
around like fifteen dollars normally I
use hair mass as my conditioner so I go
through them pretty quickly normally I
wouldn't purchase like a hair mask for
fifteen dollars of kind of pricey just
because I go through them so quickly but
I knew this was gonna smell heavenly and
it really does and I want to see how
well it does for my hair so it's just a
really thick kind of mango butter
looking texture I smells exactly like
mango if you like like citrusy tropical
fruity scents you would love this you
would love this line in general and yeah
I hope that this will be nice for my
hair it says it is supposed to help
replenish and moisturize your hair so
that is the chlorine mango butter mask
and then the next thing i got was one of
the new bite Beauty a moose boosh
lipsticks my friend Amy recently did a
whole review on a bunch of these and I
really wanted to get this particular
shade called sorbet it looks like a
gorgeous sort of like nudie pinky a
little bit brighter sort of color I
don't know it's like a your lips are
better but kind of bright and this is
what sorbet looks like and I've heard
great things about this new formula so
let me go ahead and swatch this smells
really good it smells like citrus there
it is sorbet it looks beautiful it did
look a little brighter on these
sephora.com website but then I did look
up swatches online and it looked a lot
darker so kind of like a mob sort of
your lips but better sort of color
really really like that and look at the
new packaging so sleek I mean by beauty
I always have sleep packaging but that's
extra sleep all right now let's talk
about some of these samples i got so one
of my hundred point perks was the AL
Genest genius ultimate anti-aging
vitamin c serum this has Al Gore onic
acid and micro algae oil in it I don't
know I've never really liked these
algenis products to be completely honest
but i will try this out vitamin c is
really really good for your skin so i
will try
that and then another 100 point perk was
the st edit to dissolve the drama two
and one makeup remover plus cleanser it
looks like this and then I also got this
little sample of the tortoise torte
artiste mascara which I'm a little
nervous about because a lot of I have
had two of my friends now tell me that
tart mascaras have been making their
eyelashes break out like break off not
break out break off like literally like
they're they're shedding so I've been a
little nervous to try out some of the
tart mascaras but i don't know i will
try this one out and i'll let you guys
know and then the three samples i got
were the UROD invisible or perfecting
shield which is a seven screen / primer
the mirror and hydrodynamic ultimate
moisture cream and the boscia purifying
cleansing gel alright guys that was my
vib sale haul I hope you enjoyed this
video I will be back in exactly a week
to give you guys an update and I will
see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
