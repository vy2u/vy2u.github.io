a haul for you guys I stumbled into
sephora today and also I got a few
things at Victoria's Secret I went into
sephora because i was looking for a
foundation that i could match to my neck
because i'm really silly and I for a
million bajillion years and until last
night when I actually looked up the best
way to color match foundations is to do
it on your neck not your arms so I was
likes watching before this I would
swatch foundations on my arm and either
the foundations would turn out to pale
or too dark when I got home and put it
on my face so last night i was reading
awesome blog that you should match it to
your neck which obviously makes sense
because you want your neck and your face
to match you know um like my arm is
usually paler than my neck actually know
that sounds weird so anytime I would get
a foundation like that it would be too
late for my face so you really wanted to
match your neck and I did not know this
until like last night I don't even know
what's wrong with me but um I wandered
into sephora looking for a foundation
that i could match to my neck I was just
like I didn't matter what brand I just
wanted one foundation and of course I
ended up coming out with a few more
things than just one foundation and then
at Victoria's Secret they were having
having a 74 35 when it came to like
their love and beauty which is like
their perfume and like body products
kind of section they were having seven
for 35 which is five dollars piece and
normally stuff like that is like well
this one is like fourteen dollars
originally like by itself like a lot of
the stuff is more expensive usually yeah
around like fourteen dollars a piece so
you definitely want to pick it up when
they have sales so everything was five
dollars a piece and I got seven of those
kind of items and yeah let's just get
started and i'm going to do sephora
first so like i said i wandered into
sephora today and i will tell you right
away did get a foundation that I matches
my neck and I think it's going to be
pretty good we'll see I ended up giving
the tart high performance naturals
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
broad-spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen and
shade I matched myself to automatically
went right to like the first shade
because i thought i'm always the palest
in every single foundation however that
one was honestly um a little too yellow
like the undertone was just too yellow
so I went for the second one which is
fair beige and assess its for thier skin
with pink undertones and this one's need
to match and just like blend into my
neck really nicely so we will see how
this goes once I put it on my face I
will wear it tomorrow and we'll see but
um it looks promising and I had a really
interesting like texture the texture was
really nice and kind of like um like a
cream amo this is kind of cool so anyway
I'm gonna try that out and of course I
was just gonna get that one thing but I
ended up getting more like usual I can't
help myself in Sephora um I really
really love the brand tony moly I don't
know if you guys have tried anything
from them but they have these awesome
lip balms that well these are I've
already purchased these these were
purchased way before I went and
purchased this product obviously I
picked this one up today but I really
love their lip balms and it's like a
Korean brand and they make great like
skin care stuff and I thought I would
try out one of their hand creams came in
this really cute little packaging this
is the peach hand cream and I think the
girl said like the store i was at which
is right next to columbus circle in
manhattan she said that it's the only
one that sells the hand creams that's
not online so if you are looking for it
go and look online unless you lived
close to columbus circle but anyway this
is what it looks like it looks like a
little peach and it's just got a great
really nice hand cream in there oh it
smells so good you guys smells exactly
like peach and it feels like butter oh
my gosh um they also had an apple one
and like a blueberry one and if I like
this which I definitely think I am oh my
god I smell so good which I definitely
think I am I'm gonna go and pick up the
other ones too because they do love me
some hand cream lip balms so anyway got
the tony moly peach and cream really
cute
like I said I mean you guys really
really should sorry I'm reaching over to
get these but these BB bow or like bow
bow bow lip balms these are amazing
these are come in honey and blueberry
they smell so good they're really
moisturizing and they're super cute like
it eat it anyway um so yeah I picked up
that hand cream next I got this boscia
uh konjac comb comb jack cleansing
sponge with deep hydrating clay it says
a deeply hydrating sponge for normal to
dry skin types you guys know I have
combination skin but lately i've been
using a really really strong um face
product that has tea tree in it and also
when they have benzoyl peroxide like
cleansers and it just feels like a lot
like when i combine it with my
clarisonic every night it feels like a
little too much on my skin like it
pulled a little too much moisture out so
i was thinking i could alternate this
sponge with my clarisonic and it says
that you know this one is a hydrating
sponge so basically what you do is you
open this up let's take a look at it
they have different ones they have one
for oily skin one for normal skin run
for dry skin like I said I got the dry
skin one for the purpose of just helping
my skin with some of the acne
medications I've been putting on it
lately the cleansers but anyway so has
little string so you can hang it to dry
but basically you just run it under warm
water and I guess it turns into a really
nice soft sponge hopefully it's really
soft because this feels very hard I
don't want to be rubbing this on my face
but the girl who was there who was
helping me today said that it really
really does get nice and soft and then
you just hang it to dry so I thought I'd
you know kind of trade off with my
clarisonic and try that it does say it
is preservative-free artificial
fragrance and color free gluten free
ethanol alcohol free and dermatologist
tested natural deep cleaning pH balance
one hundred percent natural vegetable
fiber and it says made from one hundred
percent Asian konjac konjac root and
infused with hydrating red clay boshi
pillow soft cognac cognac cognac I don't
even know if I'm say that I think it's
konjac cleansing sponge with deep
hydrating clay cleanses exfoliates
anhydrase to deliver smoother softer
brighter looking skin gentle enough for
even the most sensitive skin types the
konjac cleansing sponge can be used over
the face neck and even the very delicate
under eye area red clay penetrates with
deep within the skin to increase
hydration levels while cleansing dirt
and debride to help rejuvenate and
nourish the skin it says to use rinse
the konjac sponge in warm water before
each use after cleansing apply cleanser
to the sponge so you literally put your
cleanser on the sponge and then it says
and gently massage in circular motions
over your face to remove dirt makeup and
impurities rinse thoroughly after use
and hang by the attached cotton thread
in a well-ventilated area to dry
probably hang out on the back of my
doorknob or something replace every two
to three months so I know I just thought
it'd be interesting to try out I love my
clarisonic I absolutely do it's just
that you know sometimes it's like to see
these different face kind of scrubs or
like um like this is so cool I just love
the thought of this and I mean I do use
my clarisonic out once a day every
single night but I thought it'd be fun
to trade off like this because you see
so many new brushes coming on to the
market for the face and different kind
of exfoliator zand the thought that like
is to go like a little loofah sponge for
your face I just thought it was really
cute I'm gonna try it out I'll let you
guys know about that one anyway moving
on next I picked up a little mini one of
the glam glow youth mud tingle exfoliate
treatment I love this particular mask
this one is like so nice it's got like I
think green tea leaves in it and it just
feels amazing like it leaves your skin
so so soft so I thought I'd pick this up
I have like a bunch of the tiny little
ones now I have the dual cleanse one the
hydrating one and not this one and I
just love them in the small packaging
and I think the small ones are only
eighteen dollars compared to 67 for the
full size so anyway that is the glam go
hello youth mud tingle exfoliate
treatment
and then I got this lip liner this is
the no bleeding lips secret lip liner
this is a clear lip liner I saw this
while I was in the checkout and I just
thought well I don't use lip liners very
often because I just I don't know I
don't I just don't so I thought it's
weird like with the colored ones they
don't really know like I mean I know
that you're supposed to like fill your
lip line in but sometimes I can't match
it with the lipstick I want to wear so I
thought a clear one would be perfect so
that I don't have any bleeding or
feathering so this is just a clear lip
liner and I'm going to try it out and I
guess we'll see how that goes it's great
for any time you're wearing a bright
lipstick or just an everyday lipstick
anytime you're wearing a lipstick it's
good to wear a liner alright moving on I
picked up a few skincare items I got
more of the tony moly products I told
you guys I love this brand so I got a
little package um you get to in here up
to tony moly i'm real lemon face mask
these are sheet masks so you get two in
here and they are for brightening so i
thought that that would be fun and it's
just a sheep mask normal and yeah it's
lemon infused and it's supposed to make
your skin nice and radiant so got a
little packets two of those are two
common wanted a little packages i should
say then i got two more other different
masks that i wanted to try um from dr
jart he recently recently came out with
hydrogel masks and i have been
experimenting with a few hydrogel mass
from bozhe so I thought it'd be fun to
also try the ones from dr jart this is
the brightening infusion hydrogel mask
good for dark circles dullness dark
spots are not even tone so it looks like
this and it basically just comes in two
parts and you put it over your face
looks like you're like Scarface and you
have like a like a mask on your face but
it's really it's it's nice and it's a
cool sensation the hydrogel ones are
very awesome sensation I
about the dr jart all that lift and firm
hydrogel expansion stretch mask it's
good for wrinkles loss of elasticity
large pores and sagging my mom's
visiting me in a few days so I thought
that we could try this one on her and if
not i will use it and then i got this
little pouch i guess they were giving
out like little clutches I don't know if
this is like yeah it's empty but it's
just cute little sephora fudge can throw
some stuff in there and then as a
hundred point park i got the Amazing
Grace philosophy in the end it all comes
down to one word grace and this is a
firming Bobby emulsion thought that
would be nice to try out and trying to
get my stomach and butt and thighs I'll
firmed up before summer time and then um
I got some little samples the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer and also
the Dior capture totale global age
defying skincare perfect skin creator
that's like a moisturizer or something
but anyway that is what I got at sephora
I'm going to move on to the other
portion of this hall and that is for um
Victoria's Secret like I told you guys
they were having seven for 35 so five
dollars a piece on there people loving
it's not love and beauty I think I said
love and beauty at the beginning isn't
that like the forever 21 brown oh my god
my hand smells so good you guys that
peach and cream though mmm yeah anyway
sorry 11 beauty is for our 21 so it must
just be their beauty I forgot what the
name is for the Victoria's Secret beauty
section but this is where I got these
products so they were five dollars each
and like I said seven for 35 so the
first thing i got was the coconut
passion um Oh de toilet and I have a few
of these and you guys lip listen
Victoria Secret makes some amazing sense
and yeah I this one is no exception I
smelled it in store and I was like yes
ah this smells like coconut and vanilla
and it says it is vanilla and coconut so
there it is and originally these are
fourteen dollars a piece so when
get them 45 pretty awesome so this is
coconut passion and it literally just
smells like coconuts and vanilla really
really nice so what that is what that
looks like then I got the Eau de
Toilette in passion struck which is Fuji
apple and vanilla orchid I'll see smells
amazing ahead and spray that Q I'm going
to smell like so good oh yeah yeah it
really just smells like really lightly
of apples and just vanilla like
deliciousness so that's passion struck
and then that cute little box and then
the last Oh de Toilette tag apt is total
attraction which is cherry orchid and
lot lily blossom comes in that bright
coral box and it looks like this it's
just this one's a little more subtle
kind of like cherry blossom it's just
it's really really beautiful I don't
even know how to describe it I will just
tell you guys exactly what it says on
the box Cherie orchid and lily blossom
and it smells like that so that's total
attraction then I picked up two of the
body scrubs I've never actually tried
body scrubs from victoria secret but one
of my favorite scents that they have is
mego temptation i have over there in the
back where I have my perfumes I have a
big body spray that I'm almost out of in
this sense this is an amazing scent
first summer it's just so good it's so
good so this is the mango temptation and
the scent is mango nectar and hibiscus
and this is the smoothing body scrub
thought I'd try out their body scrubs
see what all the fuss is about oh you
guys are smells so good it smells like a
really really sweet ripe mango so really
nice and then of course i have to get
love spell which is one of their like
more like cult favorites like really
really a classic um it really smells
good and men really like the weight of
smells then i have been wearing this as
I was probably in high school like I
have the little eau de toilette of it
and i've gone through tons of body
body butters and guys I just have to say
guys love the way this smells I'm not
quite sure what it is but it really is
like a love spell and it's cherry
blossom and peach and it's just so
different like you'll never smell
anything like this that's all so this is
the smoothing body scrub and then I also
picked up two of the body mess because I
do love the body mess and they come in
really big bottles and they take me
forever to go through so I got
strawberries and champagne which is one
that I've had before it smells awesome
it smells literally like strawberries in
a champagne glass and it just smells
like really really just pretty nice I
can open this I can show you guys cough
cough open up alright so you get this
big big bottle I've got I'm not smell so
good or hot mess because I mixed
everything but yeah it's just really
lightly of like champagne bubbles and
strawberries and it says wild
strawberries and champagne and that's
exactly what it smells like it's so
funny like the scents are so like not
complicated that they have however it's
like I've never smelled something like
that but anyway that is the strawberries
and champagne and the last thing i got
was the pair glass a which is like a
caer kind of scent I just love the scent
of hair I like the taste of hair I like
everything about hair so we have
terrible way back so I thought it was
appropriate that I picked this one up
I've never had this one and it did smell
good in the store mm-hmm yes I just
sprayed it on my face I don't care
smells good oh it does it smells like
Paris in just delicious pneus so it says
sugared pair and casaba melon and I do
smell a bit of melon in there so really
really nice fresh scent there so is that
all the one two three four five six step
and yep that's it so that was my hall um
