a haul for you guys I stumbled into
Sephora today and also I got a few
things at Victoria's Secret I went into
Sephora because I was looking for a
foundation that I could match to my neck
because I'm really silly and I for a
million bajillion years and until last
night when I actually looked up the best
way to color match foundations is to do
it on your neck not your arms so I was
like swatching before this I would
swatch foundations on my arm and either
the foundations would turn out to pale
or too dark when I got home and put it
on my face so last night I was reading
on some blog that you should match it to
your neck which obviously makes sense
because you want your neck and your face
to match you know like my arm is usually
paler than my neck actually no that
sounds weird so any time I would get a
foundation like that it would be too
light for my face so you really wanted
to match your neck and I did not know
this until like last night I don't even
know what's wrong with me but um I
wandered into Sephora looking for a
foundation that I could match to my neck
I was just like I didn't matter what
brand I just wanted one foundation and
of course I ended up coming out with a
few more things than just one foundation
and then at Victoria's Secret they were
having having a seven for 35 when it
came to like their love and beauty which
is like their perfume and like body
products kind of section they were
having 7 for 35 which is $5 piece and
normally stuff like that is like well
this one is it's like $14 originally
like by itself like a lot of this stuff
is more expensive usually yeah around
like $14 a piece so you definitely want
to pick it up when they have sales so
everything was $5 a piece and I got 7 of
those kind of items and yeah let's just
get started and I'm gonna do Sephora
first so like I said I wandered into
Sephora today and I will tell you right
away I did get a foundation that I
matched to my neck and I think it's
gonna be pretty good we'll see I ended
up giving the tarte high performance
naturals Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation broad-spectrum SPF 15
sunscreen and
I've matched myself to automatically I
went right to like the first shade
because I thought I'm always the palest
in every single foundation however that
one was honestly um a little too yellow
like the undertone was just too yellow
so I went for the second one which is
fair beige and SS it's for fair skin
with pink undertones and this one seems
to match and just like blend into my
neck really nicely so we will see how
this goes once I put it on my face I
will wear it tomorrow and we'll see but
it looks promising and I had a really
interesting like texture the texture was
really nice and kind of like um like a
cream Olmos is kind of cool so anyway
I'm gonna try that out and of course I
was just gonna get that one thing but I
ended up getting more like usual I can't
help myself in Sephora um I really
really love the brand Tony moly I don't
know if you guys have tried anything
from them but they have these awesome
lip balms that well these are I've
already purchased these these were
purchased way before I went and
purchased this product obviously I
picked this one up today but I really
love their lip balms and it's like a
Korean brand and they make great like
skincare stuff and I thought I would try
out one of their hand creams came in
this really cute little packaging this
is the peach hand cream and I think that
girl said like the store I was at which
is right next to Columbus Circle in
Manhattan she said that it's the only
one that sells the hand creams
that's not online so if you are looking
for it go and look online unless you
lived close to Columbus Circle but
anyway this is what it looks like it
looks like a little peach and it's just
got a great really nice hand cream in
there oh it smells so good you guys it
smells exactly like peach and it feels
like butter they also had an apple one
and like a blueberry one and if I like
this which I definitely think I am oh my
god it smells so good which I definitely
think I am I'm gonna go and pick up the
other ones too because they do love me
some hand creams lip balms so anyway got
the tony moly peach hand cream
really cute and like I said I mean you
guys really really shouldn't sorry I'm
reaching over to get these but these
bebe bow or like bow bow bow lip balms
these are amazing these come in honey
and blueberry these smells so good
they're really moisturizing and they're
super cute anyway um so yeah it picked
up that hand cream next I got this
bozhe uh konjac cone cleansing sponge
with deep hydrating clay it says a
deeply hydrating sponge for normal to
dry skin types you guys know I have
combination skin but lately I've been
using a really really strong um face
product that has tea tree in it and also
when they have benzoyl peroxide like
cleansers and it just feels like a lot
like when I combine it with my
Clarisonic every night it feels like a
little too much on my skin like I pulled
a little too much moisture out so I was
thinking I could alternate this sponge
with my Clarisonic and it says that you
know this one is a hydrating sponge so
basically what you do is you let's open
this up let's take a look at it they
have different ones they have one for
oily skin one for normal skin run for
dry skin like I said I got these dry
skin one for the purpose of just helping
my skin with some of the acne
medications I've been putting on it
lately and the cleansers but anyway so
has little string so you can hang it to
dry but basically you just run it under
warm water and I guess it turns into a
really nice soft sponge hopefully it's
really soft because this feels very hard
I don't want to be rubbing this on my
face but the girl who was there who was
helping me today said that it really
really does get nice and soft and then
you just hang it to dry so I thought I'd
you know kind of trade off with my
Clarisonic and try that it does say it
is preservative free artificial
fragrance and color free gluten free
ethanol alcohol free and dermatologist
tested natural deep cleaning pH balance
100% natural vegetable fiber and it says
made from 100%
Asian konjac konjac root and infused
with hydrating red clay both Shias
pillow-soft con cognac cognac college I
don't even know if I'm saying that I
think it's konjac cleansing sponge with
deep hydrating clay cleanses exfoliates
and hydrates to deliver smoother softer
brighter looking skin gentle enough for
even the most sensitive skin types the
konjac cleansing sponge can be used over
the face neck and even the very delicate
under-eye area red clay penetrates with
deep within the skin to increase
hydration levels while cleansing dirt
and debris to help rejuvenate and
nourish the skin it says to use rinse
the konjac sponge in warm water before
each use after cleansing apply cleanser
to the sponge so you literally put your
cleanser on the sponge and then it says
and gently massage in circular motions
over your face to remove dirt makeup and
impurities rinse thoroughly after use
and hang by the attached cotton thread
in a well-ventilated area to dry
probably hang out on the back of my
doorknob or something replace every two
to three months so I know I just thought
it'd be interesting to try out I love my
Clarisonic I absolutely do it's just
that you know sometimes it's like to see
these different face kind of scrubs or
like um like this is so cool
I just love the thought of this and I
mean I do use my Clarisonic once a day
every single night but I thought it'd be
fun to trade up with this because you
see so many new brushes coming on to the
market for the face and different kind
of exfoliator Zand the pot that like
it's like a like a little loofah sponge
for your face I just thought was really
cute I'm gonna try it out I'll let you
guys know about that one anyway moving
on next I picked up a little mini one of
the glam glow youth mud tingle exfoliate
treatment I love this particular mask
this one is like so nice it's got like I
think green tea leaves in it and it just
feels amazing like it leaves your skin
so so soft so I thought I'd pick this up
I have like a bunch of the tiny little
ones now I have the dual cleanse one the
hydrating one and not this one I just
love them in the small packaging and I
think the small ones are only 18 dollars
compared to 67 for the full size so
anyway that is the glam go glow youth
mud tingle exfoliate treatment
and then I got this lip liner this is
the no bleeding lips secret lip liner
this is a clear lip liner I saw this
while I was in the checkout and I just
thought well I don't use lip liners very
often because I just I don't know I
don't I just don't so I thought it's
weird like with the colored ones they
don't really know like I mean I know
that you're supposed to like fill your
lip line in but sometimes I can't match
it with the lipstick I want to wear so I
thought a clear one would be perfect so
that I don't have any bleeding or
feathering so this is just a clear lip
liner and I'm gonna try it out and I
guess we'll see how that goes it's great
for any time you're wearing a bright
lipstick or just an everyday lipstick
any time you're wearing a lipstick it's
good to wear a liner alright moving on I
picked up a few skincare items I got
more of the Tony moly products I told
you guys I love this brand so I got a
little packet um you get two in here up
key Tony moly I'm real lemon face mask
these are sheet masks so you get two in
here and they are for brightening so I
thought that that would be fun and it's
just a sheet mask normal and yeah it's
lemon-infused and it's supposed to make
your skin nice and radiant so I've got a
little packet two of those or to come in
one of the little packages I should say
then I got two more other different
masks that I wanted to try from dr. jart
he recently recently came out with
hydrogel masks and I have been
experimenting with a few hydrogel mask
from bozhe so I thought it'd be fun to
also try that one from dr. jart this is
the brightening infusion hydrogel mask
good for dark circles dullness dark
spots and an even tone so it looks like
this and it basically just comes in two
parts and you put it over your face it
looks like you're like Scarface and you
have like like a mask on your face but
it's really it's it's it's nice and it's
a cool sensation the hydrogel ones are a
very awesome sensation I also got the
dr. jart all that lift and firm hydrogel
expansion stretch mask it's good for
wrinkles loss of ls
to city large pores and sagging my mom's
visiting me in a few days so I thought
that we could try this one on her if not
I will use it and then I got this little
pouch I guess they were giving out like
a little clutches I don't know if this
is like yeah it's empty but it's just
cute little Sephora clutch can throw
some stuff in there and then as a
hundred point perk I got the Amazing
Grace philosophy in the end it all comes
down to one word grace and this is a
firming body emulsion thought that would
be nice to try out I'm trying to get my
stomach and butt and thighs all firmed
up before summer time and then um I got
some little samples the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer and also the
Dior capture totale global age defined
skincare perfect skin creator that's
like a moisturizer or something but
anyway that is what I got at Sephora I'm
going to move on to the other portion of
this haul and that is for Victoria's
Secret like I told you guys they were
having seven for thirty five so five
dollars a piece on there loving it's not
love and beauty I think I said love and
beauty at the beginning isn't that like
the forever 21 brown oh my god my hand
smells so good you guys that peach hand
cream though mmm yeah
anyway sorry love and beauty is forever
21 so it must just be their beauty I
forgot what the name is for the
Victoria's Secret beauty section but
this is where I got these products so
they were five dollars each and like I
said 7 for 35 so the first thing I got
was the coconut passion um Oda toilet
and I have a few of these and you guys
lip listen Victoria's Secret makes some
amazing sense and yeah this one is no
exception I smelled it in store and I
was like yes ah it smells like coconut
and vanilla and it says it is vanilla
and coconut so there it is and
originally these are $14 a piece so when
you can get them for five pretty awesome
so this is coconut passion and it
literally just smells like coconuts and
vanilla
really really nice so if that is what
that looks like
then I got the Eau de Toilette in
passion struck which is Fuji apple and
vanilla orchid I'll smell amazing and
spray that too I'm gonna smell like so
good oh yeah yeah it really just smells
like really lightly of apples and just
vanilla like deliciousness
so that's passion struck it's in that
cute little box and then the last Oda
toilet I got is total attraction which
is cherry orchid and lily blossom comes
the next bright coral box and it looks
like this it's just this sounds a little
more subtle kind of like cherry blossom
it's just it's really really beautiful I
don't even know how to describe it I
will just tell you guys exactly what it
says on the Box Cheri orchid and Lily
blossom and it smells like that so
that's total attraction then I picked up
two of the body scrubs I've never
actually tried body scrubs from
Victoria's Secret but one of my favorite
scents that they have is mango
temptation I have over there in the back
where I have my perfumes I have a big
body spray that I'm almost out of in
this scent this is an amazing scent
first summer is just so good it's so
good so this is the mango temptation and
the scent is mango nectar and hibiscus
and this is the smoothing body scrub
I thought I'd try out their body scrubs
see what all the fuss is about you guys
it smells so good it smells like a
really really sweet ripe mango so really
nice and then of course I have to get
love spell which is one of their like
more like cults favorites like really
really a classic it really smells good
and men really like the way this smells
that I have been wearing this since I
was probably in high school like I have
the little older toilet of it and I've
gone through tons of body mass and body
butters and guys I just have to say guys
love the way this smells I'm not
sure what it is but it really is like a
love spell and it's cherry blossom and
peach and it's just so different like
you'll never smell anything like this
that's all so this is the smoothing body
scrub and then I also picked up two of
the body mess because I do love the body
mess and they come in really big bottles
and they take me forever to go through
so I got strawberries and champagne
which is one that I've had before it
smells awesome
it smells literally like strawberries in
a champagne glass and it just smells
like really really just really nice I
can open this I can show you guys open
up all right so you get this big big
yeah it's just really lightly of like
champagne bubbles and in strawberries
and it says wild strawberries and
champagne and that's exactly what it
smells like it's so funny like the
scents are so like not complicated that
they have however it's like never
smelled something like that but anyway
that is the strawberries and champagne
and the last thing I got was the pair
glasses which is like a care kind of
scent I just love the scent a pair I
like the taste of hair I like everything
about pair so we have terrible way back
so I thought it was appropriate that I
picked this one up I've never had this
one and it did smell good in the store
it does it smells like pears and just
deliciousness
so it says sugared pair and casaba melon
and I do smell a bit of melon in there
so really really nice fresh scent there
so is that all one two three four five
six seven yep that's it
so that was my haul I hope you enjoyed
it from Sephora and Victoria's Secret um
yeah
everything you know I purchased myself
obviously it's disclaiming that right
away and so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'll see you my next
