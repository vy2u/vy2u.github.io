today I have a sephora.com hall that I
am just going to jump right into so
let's get started the first thing I
picked up were two of the bite Beauty
luminous creme lipstick duo's they look
like this the first one I got is in date
and fig let me show you guys the colors
so this is date and on the other end we
have fig beautiful beautiful mixed nudes
like those and the other little one has
the colors with Cena and musk in it so
red Cena looks like this and musk looks
like this you may be thinking these look
really similar but the thing is is that
they have different undertones which I
like so because I get to try those out i
love the formula of the lipsticks from
by beauty especially their luminous
creme ones so I know I'm going to love
those also from bite Beauty I got there
agave lip mask and a lot of people rave
about this and it had you know tons of
great reviews on this for website so i
thought i'd pick that up they now do
have ones that have i believe different
colors but since I'm gonna be writing
this at nighttime I don't need to have
color next I got the philosophy Amazing
Grace whipped body creme it looks like
that um the reason I got this is because
I'm obsessed with body creams or body
butters and this seemed right up my
alley so let's take a whiff and let's
see what it looks like mmm so it's super
super super creamy and it smells pretty
damn good so that is
at excited to try that out Wow if you
pee whoa that was my cat running at the
speed of light hira here's someone crazy
running around not me okay all right
next from Clinique I got their best of
clinic set it looks like this and in
here you get the clinic rinse off I
makeup solvent the seven-day scrub cream
the dramatically different moisturizing
lotion the all about eyes and moisture
surge and a chubby stick so here is the
dramatically different lotion next you
get that seven-day scrub cream after
that you get the eye cream which is the
all about eyes it says it reduces
circles Huff's reduce his circles and
pops I guess helps with puffy eyes
everybody could use that underneath
thoughts is the big Moisture Surge
extended thirst would leave a gel cream
I try to sample of that that's why I
went on to the actual sephora website
and i was going to order that but then i
saw that they had this hit and i thought
you know what might as well get the kit
and try out a few things from clinic
next is the clinic chubby stick intense
this is in grandis grape just a nice
pretty purpley color and then the last
thing you get is the rinse off I'm
makeup rinse off I'm makeup solvent that
looks like that making a lot of eye
makeup remover slightly um next I got to
the two-faced semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette it looks like this people have
done reviews and swatches on this
already but I would also like to do my
own thoughts and swatches and maybe some
tutorials that's what the outside looks
like and opens up very easily smells
like chocolate and here are the colors
so really really gorgeous i do not own
the first chocolate bar palette
and I picked this one instead just
because I thought that these colors
looked warmer in my opinion and I don't
know what I feel like it's easier to
wear warmer colors on your eyes so that
is why I picked that one up really
excited to try it out oh goodness guys
are really small side uh-huh next I got
another little clinique trio this is the
lashes top to bottom kit and wow my cat
is going crazy in here you get another
one of the rinse off I makeup solvents
I'm going to have so much eye makeup
remover guys so much and then you get a
mascara this is the high impact mascara
the wand looks like this really really
nice Lily you're going crazy what are
you doing oh my god she going crazy okay
um next you get the a bottom lash lash
mascara and it has the it is Vidya swine
look at that little thing oh goodness
gracious I love it this one also has a
really cute packaging it's got like
little flowers on it let me see that
love it so after that I got to be urban
decay so urban decay yes Urban Decay
smoked palette this has been off for a
while now but it's like twenty dollars
on the website right now so I thought
I'd kick it up you get let's see here
well I hear something back here so first
let's check ok yeah so at the bottom you
get the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion in the original form this is a
really good one and then you get the
smoked palette which is not coming out
there it is okay you also get a little
booklet so the first thing you get is
this little booklet and I'm guessing it
shows you yes different looks that you
can use for the palette here's the
palette itself it's really nice and
lightweight and actually zippers clothes
and shots are but they like that
it's different and kind of cool and
these are the shades you get really
really beautiful dark smoky staff I love
it and you also get a full size of the
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on pencil in
perversion so I'm really excited to try
that I'll go on to your support website
and pick that up if it's still for
twenty dollars I think that's a total
steal um let's see here next I guess
I'll show you guys my 100-point perks
the first hundred point perk I got was
the fresh black th delay I concentrate
um and this is with Nani fruit or noni
fruit juices it firms and illuminates it
comes in this little package like so and
open it up and I think this would be a
nice size because I creams go you know
it takes you a long time to get through
eye creams so that's what it looks like
and that is what you get on the inside
I'm excited to try this out because um
fresh like eye creams and face masks are
usually very expensive next I got the
clinique happy with a little spray thing
which is nice and I love this scent so
excited for that then I got the my new
york DKNY the only reason I got this is
because I'm from New York and I thought
what the heck I'll probably smell good
because they're be delicious apple or
whatever are always super good so that's
what this looks like it's actually a
rollerball which is kind of cute I like
that this smell pretty good I prefer
their apple one but the smells good then
I got three samples I got to the origins
plant scription anti-aging power serum
looks like that I got the diva curl
styling cream I got this for when I do
like curly hair or something and I want
something to really hold it in if i
braid my hair and then I got the nude
overnight repeater mask which looks like
that so that was it for my sephora calm
hall i hope you guys all enjoyed this
and i'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
