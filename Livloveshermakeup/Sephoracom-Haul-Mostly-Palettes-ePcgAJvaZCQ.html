let's just dig in first thing i got was
this tart high-performance neutrals a
band beautiful Amazonian clay I shadow
palette open it up and see what it looks
like um super cute packaging can you see
that adorable it just has four shades in
here I thought they were really
beautiful I'm tart really does like
those kind of nice rosy purpley tones
well so I thought that looked nice with
a nice highlight right there of course I
will do reviews on all of these pallets
separately I also got the tart
quintessentially travel chic five in one
eye shadow palette it looks like
something if I can open it up it looks
like this so so cute it looks like a
little wallet or something like a little
leather wallet it comes with a little I
look little I look card and on the
inside you get the names and the colors
are right here gorgeous I thought they
were really neutral and beautiful love
that green shadow there wow so it looks
like there's a bronzer a highlight and
three eyeshadows I don't know if that's
a bronzer it looks a little gray for a
bronzer but um very very pretty next I
got the Stila um in the moment palette
looks like this I already have two of
the other in the lighter in the garden
pallets so this one is purple very very
pretty and it looks like this on the
inside it comes with an eyeliner as well
beautiful beautiful shades of course i
will do a review and it comes with kind
of a purpley eyeliner the next thing i
got was the tart high-performance
neutrals Amazonian
sorry amazon escape Amazonian clay eye
and cheek palette I think this was from
last year's collection but they had it
on the website for like two hours before
all of them sold out but it looks like
this so it kind of looks really similar
to the arm the blush palette from this
year it's like that little clutch style
and on the inside you get one two three
four five six shadow colors and two
blushes so really really beautiful
really great for travel I will do a
review on that next I got the bare
minerals two for the show it's two for
the show kit and it pops out like this
so you get a metallic wonders five
best-selling metallic eyeshadow shades
so I always look like this those are the
shades you get really really pretty
those are the metallic ones and then you
also get the two for the show five
best-selling neutral shades love the
packaging tape super cute so these are
the neutral shades you get five neutrals
and five metallics those are nice I want
to get used to using more like mineral
eye shadows just to kind of change
things up and next I got the benefit
three scoops of sexy looks like this
super super cute packaging love it
adorable um and let's see here how does
this open this so it pops out and there
are three little things as you can see
and each one contains a tint and a lolly
ball so the first one you get is this
light pink almost purpley shade you get
the lolly bomb and the lolly tint and
the colors look like this pop them out
of here really really pretty kind of
pinky purple II really excited to try
these lolly balls next you get to the
more like red size or I mean red color
and the Benetton's
and then you get kind of I want to say a
peachy one with Posie tint and Posey
ball and that's a little more peachy so
really really excited to use those I do
have full sizes of like the Benetton's
and I love them they can be used on the
cheeks or the lips but I have not tried
any of the bombs yet so super excited
