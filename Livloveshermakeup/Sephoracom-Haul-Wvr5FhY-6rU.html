have a Sephora box that KD in and I
probably do a haul for you guys so let's
just dig in the first thing i got was
the hourglass modernist i shadow palette
this is just one of them they have quite
a few of these right now that are on the
sephora website they're kind of new and
i believe they are only for VIP rooms
right now on the online store but
basically i got mine in the color
obscura and this is what the packaging
looks like I'm really really gorgeous
and when you open it up you get a cute
little mirror and these are the shades
this is the shade for obscura so what
I'm going to do is do a first
impressions video tomorrow on this eye
palette I'm super excited and the reason
I want to do that also is because i
purchased a new camera at best buy today
so I want to see um I believe it has
like 180 whatever it is HP or whatever
you know for even higher standards just
for you know to view my videos so i
thought that that would be really fun so
i thought i'd do that will be my first
video with that camera tomorrow so that
will be the first impressions coming at
you tomorrow the second thing i got was
the philosophy just released me and I
makeup remover it looks like this this
wasn't really the smaller one they had a
really big one but I just wanted to try
it out i've never tried this it says
from caked onto baked on from lid lock
to gridlock from dressed up too stressed
out from high shoes to win lose from
bread fast to slow down it's time to
release your eye makeup and set your
sights free it sets a dual fries dual
phase oil-free eye makeup remover so I'm
really excited to use this I think that
it looks good on the reviews for
excellent ona people said it doesn't
seem your eyes it's not greasy so I'm
excited to use that the next thing I got
was this little kit of bite Beauty bite
lush lip wipes so this is basically just
for when you want like a quick change of
lipstick and you need to get it off
really quickly or if you were really
long wearing lipsticks throughout the
day and you need a really good lip like
remover like a makeup remover it also
comes with this cute little thing that
has
you're on the back and I got this
smaller set he's just have 10 now
because I wanted to try it out first um
the next thing I got to put the NARS a
light-reflecting setting powder it looks
like this let's open this up actually
this is what it looks like and I heard I
believe he was Sam Sherman here on
YouTube she was talking about this and
she was using it actually in a tutorial
and it just looked gorgeous on her skin
it really covers up pores and things
like that and I thought I definitely
want to try it out so this is the
translucent crystal light reflecting
setting powder from NARS I think this is
more like a finishing step than an
actual setting powder that's why I'm
going to use it but I guess we'll see
about that the next thing I got was the
Dior creme de rose lip balm this is like
a thirty-dollar lip balm but people rave
about it and I absolutely love the smell
of rows so I thought I would be a good
person to get this because I love the
smell I really can't justify it you guys
are just yeah anyway it's really cute
packaging it says CD Christian do you
are it's really heavy and waited it's
amazing you guys most just like rose and
it's nice and light pink like so I can't
wait to use this tonight I think it
would be really nice and moisturizing
let's see here the next thing I got was
this sephora kiss me balm in soda pop um
it's like a dark I would you call that
like a purpley color i SAT emilynoel83
on here on her beauty broadcast
expressed channel talk about that and
she really loved it so I'm excited to
try that out and let's see here the next
step is all samples and point perks from
Sephora um I am vib rouge and so I think
that they do give you extra samples I I
don't know but I always seem to get
millions of samples in my support box
for some reason um but let me just start
out with my point perks per 100 points i
got the dr dennis gross alpha beta peel
extra strength formula just a little
sample pack of those I've heard a lot of
things good things the next thing I got
400 points was the cores Greek yogurt
nourishing primer site to try that out
Thunder point perk I got was the clinic
take the day off makeup remover I
thought this was nice for travel um the
next thing I got for another 100 point
perk was the bozhe luminizing black mask
this looks like a really nice deluxe I
sample and I love masking if I
absolutely love it so I know I'm gonna
like that um next um you know I always
pick what I meant by like I get extra
samples is you know they let you pick
three free samples and I always get more
than I put in so I ordered three but I
ended up getting two of the Tom Ford
velvet orchids I only ordered one of
those that they gave me too they also
gave me this amore Pacific duel defense
future response age defense duel eye
cream too little sachets of that can
they gave me the philosophy miracle
worker overnight age resetting
anti-wrinkle moisturizer and then I got
two little samples of the dolce &amp;amp;
gabbana perfume cute little boxes and
then I also got a sample of the Anthony
wake up call hydrating treatment gel so
it is more than three they always put
extras in there I think that's so sweet
and then the last thing this is actually
just one of those things you can get I
think belief for anybody you don't have
to be VIP VIP rude or anything like that
for anybody on the site they have little
things like codes that you can put in
and one of the codes on the day that i
ordered this happen to be a free little
bag with samples in it so i put it in
and it was free so you get all of these
samples and there and I'll go through
them with you guys the first sample you
get is the first aid beauty face
cleanser sample the second thing you get
is the peter thomas roth rose stem cell
bio repair gel mask and i absolutely
love this mask I've gone through a full
sized have a guitar at age awesome the
next thing you get is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
face soap and clarity three and one
daily detox of vitamin C facial facial
wash basil Rachel good um next you get
the Tata Harper next-generation beauty a
hundred percent
natural and non-toxic regenerating
cleanser lots of cleansers in here next
you get to the purity made simple
cleanser three-in-one cleanser for face
and eyes that's really interesting
because I have always wanted to try that
cleanser and next you get the nude detox
brightening fizzy powder wash with
vitamin c omega three six and nine and
rose hip so that's kind of interesting
never heard of a physio to this
brightening fizzy powder wash whatever

soy face cleanser multitasking cleanser
for all skin types i think this is just
a little pointer thing i don't know i
took but I left some skin here right
next to get the Olay Hendricks in pure
truth melting cleanser 3 and 1 jul a so
that looks cool if you need to use dry
hands and massage this into your skin um
next origins you get to the energizing
mask fortified with caffeine so the
origins ginseng refreshing face mask
nice little size of that perfect things
about that and the eye cream next you
get the Bliss multi-faceted or face it
in all in one anti-aging clay mask spot
powered with ten percent glycolic acid
ports and haha so that's nice and love
masking so love to see those little
samples in there oh we get a sample of
the glam below which I love the super
mud that's also a mask and the last
thing you get is the thermal cleanse
bomb from Omar oh so Budapest I cannot
say that you guys can say that good job
this is a cleanser so you get to having
that little bag and again that was free
so i really love when they have little
deals like that also if you shop through
ebates which i do they always list all
of the little things that you can add
into your cart like on the ebates
website if you click on to sephora and
you look down you can see it they'll
automatically add it into your cart so
you don't have to look like the coating
so anyway that was my hall stay tuned

first impressions of this hourglass
modernist I shadow palette on my new
camera so I hope you guys enjoyed this
and i'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
