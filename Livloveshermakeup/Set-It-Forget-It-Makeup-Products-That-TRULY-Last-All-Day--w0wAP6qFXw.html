welcome back to my Channel today I have
a video all about makeup products that
truly lasts all day long I feel like I
get asked a lot about longevity and wear
time especially now that I have more dry
skin when your skin does go from like
combo oily to dry you notice that your
makeup products will just wear on your
face a little better because there's no
oil to kind of slip and slide all over
your face so I do feel like when I come
to you know choosing out products for
this particular video when I came to
choosing out products for this video
obviously some of this is going to be
personal preference depending on your
skin type but I tried it to keep in mind
that products that worked for me when I
did have more combo oily skin as well as
products that work for me now now I can
wear all day long at work so anyway
without further ado I think we should
just jump right into it I want to start
with a lipstick formula that I feel like
I really don't talk about very often on
my channel but I should and that is the
lippie stix formula from a color pop I
have quite a few of these in my
collection I love them and you know what
if you want a typical kind of bullet
form lipstick and not a liquid lipstick
or not a gloss or lip oil just a regular
lipstick that's going to last a nice
amount of time on the lips I would
absolutely hands-down recommend this
formula these go for about 5 or 6
dollars a pop and there are all sorts of
different finishes you can get there are
matte finishes you have hyper glosses
you also have statins this one right
here is called raw and it is obviously a
very very bright turquoise kind of color
and this is one of the statins I love
the way these go on to the lips I find
that they're not overly drying
especially the matte ones as well but I
feel like the Caedmon tation a level in
it these lipsticks it's kind of what
helps them to last all day long here we
have a Mac called tutu which is just a
beautiful beautiful deep kind of berry
plummy color this is great for the
holiday season I mean all of these are
really phenomenal and I just feel like
if there's one lipstick formula in my
collection that I can put on at the
beginning of the day and it's there at
the end of the day even after teaching
and practicing my flute it is the
colour-pop lippie stix formula the hyper
glossy is tend to wear off a little
faster throughout the day but the mass
and the statins are absolutely fantastic
so that is the first thing I want to
recommend it now you guys know I'm picky
when it comes to liquid lipsticks but
recently the balm cosmetics did send
over some of their meet back heel liquid
lipsticks and
have to say this is a great formula this
is a great formula they really do last
all day long this feels like a mixture
of the tarte lipsurgence like the smell
the peppermint smell mixed together with
the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks as well
as a mixture of the Stila stay all day
liquid lipsticks they have the where
time and where power of these Stila they
have that lightweight feel kind of like
the Kat Von D and then they do have that
kind of peppermint tea smell to them
sort of like the tarte lipsurgence I
really do enjoy the color selection
because they kind of lean a more in the
neutral category like a vampy lip as
well as kind of neutrally kind of your
lips but better colors so if you are an
everyday friendly kind of girl and you
just want something that's very very
neutral on the lips but that's going to
last all day long definitely be meet
Matt hue a liquid lipsticks from the
balm are absolutely fantastic alright
let's talk about some mascaras I have
two here they're both from the drugstore
that I think are fantastic and last
absolutely all day long on my lashes the
first one is a waterproof mascara
obviously if you pick up a waterproof
mascara it's gonna hang in there a
little longer than other mascaras but
this is from Catrice cosmetics it's
called the rocket or extreme volume
mascara and this is their 24-hour volume
mascara I brought this with me to Hawaii
and let me tell ya I went in the ocean I
went in the pool this shit doesn't move
anywhere it is incredibly hard to take
off at night but it really does wear all
day long so I would definitely recommend
you guys look into this mascara I
believe it retails for three dollars and
forty nine cents on the altar dot-com
website and then also the lash renegade
from wet and wild I really do enjoy I
feel that a lot of wet and wild products
are actually incredibly long wearing and
this has a great little wand in a very
dry formula but it's sticky so it's not
going to flake throughout the day so if
you're looking for a non waterproof
mascara I would definitely recommend you
check out the wet and wild a lash toe
renegade
alright guys let's move on to some
foundation shall we foundations are a
touchy subject because I feel like
obviously everybody has a different sort
of skin types but I will say when I have
more combo oily skin and even now that I
am more dry I have to give full credit
to the Urban Decay all nighter
foundation this really does have an
incredible incredible wear time to it I
have a little more difficulties with
this foundation
now that I am NOT combo oily skin but I
still wanted to recommend it for those
of you who do want to go ahead and test
it out now they don't have a very good
at color selection going on here and
these do oxidize like crazy so my
biggest recommendation is to go in store
so watch them out on your arm leave them
there walk around the store check out
different products come back and see
which one it matches you because these
go incredibly dark throughout the day
but you know what at the wear time on at
the Urban Decay all nighter foundation
is phenomenal I mean these really will
stay all day on the skin so I would
definitely recommend that guy up next I
have one that I feel like it's gonna be
a little controversial it is the wet and
wild photo focus foundation this is
actually a product that I recently tried
out because so many of you were
recommending it to me now I have heard
really bad things if you do have dry
skin with this particular foundation so
I have been avoiding it for a while but
I do have the Wet n Wild photo focus
foundation in the shade porcelain it's a
little too late for me currently I do
mix it together with my NYX HD warmth
mixer but for those of you wondering how
I make this work on my dry skin I always
go in with the it cosmetics feel at the
moment primer this is a smoothing and
hydrating primer and if I put this on
and then I finish it off with a setting
spray I swear to you this doesn't budge
on my skin at all and I know that this
is a foundation that definitely people
with competently skin prefer but if you
do have dry skin and you do have it this
particular primer or something that's
very smoothing and very hydrating might
I suggest you pair them together because
this has a phenomenal wear time from the
drugstore as well and then finally the
last one I want to recommend is actually
the Becca ultimate coverage complexion
creme at least we're also sent to me for
a PR and I really like them the first
shade I have is sand and then I have
shale I mix the two together I do about
half a pump of each this is definitely a
full coverage foundation and for me and
I find that full coverage foundation
sometimes start to look really shitty on
my skin at the end of the day I kind of
get like these big looking pores and it
starts to rub off around my nose area
but with this foundation you know it
looks really good at the other day it's
not amazing it's not exceptional it
doesn't look as good as the Urban Decay
all nighter foundation in my opinion but
it still looks really good for a full
coverage foundation
full coverage foundations absolutely
look phenomenal when you first put them
on your skin obviously but at the end of
the day sometimes they don't look as
good but I feel like this is one of
those full coverage foundations that
really does and maintain the beautiful
look of the skin throughout the day so
would highly recommend you guys looking
to the Bekaa ultimate coverage
complexion creme it wears much better
for me don't like the Kat Von D locket
or different products like that all
right up next we have eyeliners so the
first one I want to recommend is from it
cosmetics it is a no tub waterproof gel
liner and you shade black if you guys
follow me on snapchat you know I can't
get this shit off my eyes okay I mean
it's incredible on the waterline but I
also feel like this buxom eyeliner right
here is very similar as well I feel like
I'm showing a lot of PR products in this
video I hope you guys don't mind they're
just there but they're long wearing this
is Roebuck slim it's called they call me
hold the line waterproof eyeliner this
basically does the same exact thing it
is what I have on my waterline today and
I took a little bit underneath my lower
lash line I didn't mean to but you know
how sometimes like you're putting
eyeliner on your fucking miss and then
it cooks like the lower lash line so
that's how I ended up with this dark
dark dark lower lash line today but this
is very similar to the it cosmetics
sometimes this is on sale sometimes the
it cosmetics is on sale I feel like they
wear the same amount in time they're
very hard to get off at night so what I
would recommend doing is taking a q-tip
and very lightly taking like jojoba oil
or coconut oil and running it on your
waterline don't blind yourself but just
be very careful but yeah these wear all
day long they're much better than the
Urban Decay what is it 24/7 glide-on eye
pencils I used to be love with those but
this is much better than it cosmetics is
much better and they are much better
than the Smashbox stay all day
waterproof of the liners in my opinion
so really do enjoy this guy as well as
the it cosmetics alright if you have a
dry skin and you're looking for a powder
that is going to give you a radiant sort
of look to the skin but it is going to
stay all day myname recommend be kept on
the Luckett translucent powder the stuff
is fucking phenomenal it really will set
your under-eye or your whole entire face
I have it on today I'm aware my makeup
for a good six to seven hours without
touching up it really does set
everything in but at least a little bit
of a sheen to this game now if you have
more combo oily skin I would definitely
recommend the essence all about matte
fix and compact powder 399 and alter
absolutely phenomenal as well I keep
saying phenomenal fuck all these
products are great okay
but this really does have a great where
time when I was a little more calm but
oily I didn't love the look of this it
doesn't leave you a little shiny on the
skin but that's really nice if you do
have normal to dry skin so yeah the Kat
Von D lock-it translucent setting powder
is great I feel like it has a little
more of a wear time then the cover FX
perfect setting powder in my opinion
that one starts to crease a little bit
throughout the day or just starts to
dissipate and I have to touch up with
this guy I do not now as far as
highlighters are concerned any sort of
baekchul a highlighter lasts a lot
longer on my skin a 10 a powder
highlighter today I have Prosecco pop on
from the Becca the shimmering skin
perfecter in the powder version and let
me tell you these start to fade
throughout the day they're just that
very very powdery formula when you put
your brush in a pack of highlight it
kicks back a shit-ton of product I mean
it's like a little dust cloud you know
what I mean so I would definitely
recommend you guys look into one of the
Wet n Wild mega Glo highlighting powders
or even at the laura geller make gelato
swirl illuminators and these are
basically the same thing but cheaper
which is why I want to recommend these
the most my favorite shades are
definitely precious pebbles which is a
beautiful kind of rose gold color I'll
go ahead and swatch this since I'm not
swatching everything in this video I
want to do some more swatches but that
is what it looks like I really really
enjoyed this on it my skin tone
currently and then if you do have a
little more of a warmer undertone but
you are a little more fair complected
this guy right here which is called
golden flower crown is stunning as well
maybe just a hair lighter and then the
rose gold as you guys can see and then
if you do have a cool undertone you want
a pinky highlight or any sort of you
know you can use these whatever fucking
skin tone you have I really do enjoy a
blossom glow a lot of people talk about
this because it is a do before and be a
very very expensive Dior highlight in
the shade glowing gardens which I do own
these are almost spot-on dupes but you
know what these lasts an incredibly a
long time okay on the skin so if you put
these on at the end of the day chances
are you're gonna see them at the end of
the day so would highly highly
recommended the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powders now for blushes
finally this last look category we'll
talk about I feel like my laura geller
beach gelato swirl of blushes like this
shade right here which is called plum
berry these lasts a very long time on my
skin
because the colors are so so so bright
they very much stay there all day and
again it's kind of that big show late
texture so it's not like a true powder
that's just gonna kind of flake off or
fade off your face throughout the day
but I have to say if there's one blush
formula that is better than the tarts
it's singles the Amazonian clay singles
are even the love flush blushes from tea
face which aren't my all-time favorite
blush formula if I have to look at it
from an angle of what lasts all day it
has to be the ball blushes you guys
especially if you do go and pick up the
in stain of blushes these are incredible
some of my favorites are bone beech this
one was recently sent over for PR
absolutely beautiful these two I
purchased myself years ago hot mama is
kind of like a little bit of a tube for
NARS orgasm with maybe a little more
peachy tones going on here and then I
also purchased this one years ago called
frat boy this is just a beautiful
beautiful apricot kind of peachy color
and it is completely matte to love this
one on the cheeks but this in stain
blush right here which is called swiss
adopt it's like a hot orange kind of
color this one was also sent to me for a
PR I haven't worn it too much but you
know what these really really do last
all day they have the perfect amount of
pigmentation and I bet you a million
bucks okay if you put on a boma blush at
the end of the day it's still gonna be
on your cheek so anyway guys and those
are products that you can set and forget
I feel like they really do stay on the
face all day long I tried to give
recommendations for combo oily skin as
well as dry skin but these are ones that
really stick on my face all day long so
I hope you enjoyed this video thank you
so much for joining me guys and I'll see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
