going in with my hard candy glama flage
heavy duty concealer in the shade ultra
light and I will be highlighting with
this and covering any sort of
imperfections on my face I did use this

Amazonian clay um tinted moisturizer I
liked the way it looked but I think I'll
start with this tomorrow and then go in
with this all right as far as browse go
this week i will be using my new studio
10 a brow lift perfecting liner i got
this in my glossybox for the month one
side has like a yellow / peach color to
highlight that you put underneath and on
top of your brows and then the other
side is kind of like a topi brow pencil
so that is what it looks like to set in
my base this week i will be using my it
cosmetics bye bye pores poreless spinet
finished airbrush powder in translucent
I normally like to use a pressed powder
to set in my makeup and then use this as
a finishing powder however i did use it
today to set in my makeup and i really
like the way it looks it's very very
natural and skin like and that's kind of
what i'm going for this week as far as
like my face is concerned I wanted to
look very natural so that is what i will
be using to set 8 my makeup as far as
touring goes this week i will be using
my it cosmetics you sculpted Universal

i will be using the top row which has
the soft contour the light contour and
the mat highlights i will be using these
two shades to contour my face and then i
will be going in with the mat highlight
to set my under eye area and then for
blush this week i will be using three
different blushes i have two from the
becca luminous blush line in Tiger Lily
and Snapdragon I am wearing let's see
here Snapdragon today which is this hot
coral shade and these are really pretty
they are basically a like illuminator
and blush built into one and then this
is the same event this is besaid this is
a shade tigerlily which is a beautiful
hot orange and then i will also be using
my Urban Decay afterglow highlighter in

radiance based powder in highlight 01
this is what it looks like and then i

with powder and putting extra powder on
my skin because i want my skin to look
nice and natural and skin life this week
i will be using this product to kind of
blot over the areas like in my t zone
where I tend to get oily and for
eyeliners this week i will be using my
hello kitty charming kohl eyeliner kit

believe Saturday with my friend Katya if
you're on YouTube and I originally was
going to use my Urban Decay reloaded
palette because they want to show you
guys how did you like a nice pop of
color on your lower lash line but I
think there might end up using this
palette instead because that is what i
will be using this week and you really
get some nice beautiful color pops in
here and i think this is a wonderful
palette and i think i told you guys last
week i am trying to go back and forth
each week with like a high-end palette
in the drugstore so that is why i am
using this one this week and then for my
lips i will be using my two new products

boosh a move the boosh lipstick in the
shade sorbet which is a beautiful kind
of base if your lips but better kind of
color that is what it looks like and
then I also will be using my YSL beloved
tint in oil in the shade cherry my chef
Lee and that is what i have on my lips
right now it's just a beautiful kind of
like your lasso i already said your lips
of butter but this is kind of like more
like a your lips of better but more
pinky toned very very pretty and then

and then going in with my ultra flesh
the gold standard black out mascara
which looks like this they both have
different kind of wand the Cobra one is
a natural bristle wand and then the
