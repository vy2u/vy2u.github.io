am filming a video that has nothing to
do with me because I have been home for
the past two a days with a
flu like a really bad stomach flu I
actually feel like it's starting to make
its way into my throat I don't really
know what I have the doctor said it's a
stomach flu but I'm starting to feel
like it's strep throat or something I
have to go back to work anyway tomorrow
and I wanted to go ahead and film a
video today so we are going to do a
animal pics my makeup video if you guys
didn't know I have two different animals
I have ferrets I have mr. badger who was
a four to five year old ferret who I was
supposed to film with on Monday and that
video the miscellaneous Monday that
would go up next Monday since obviously
I've been sick this week and then I have
Khaleesi who is my little nine month old
ferret and she's adorable and she loves
makeup so I thought I'd let her go ahead
and pick my items for shop my stash this
week obviously I didn't get to a shop my
stash video on Sunday and we still have
like four or five days till the end of
the week so I'm gonna let her pick out
all of my makeup I'm gonna go ahead and
put different items in front of her and
then she will choose them like I said
she loves makeup and if you've ever had
a ferret you know that they love to
hoard and take from you so I
think this is actually gonna be a lot of
fun I hope you guys enjoy it let's go
grab clacey alright here are my babies
badger came out anyway I am going to go
ahead and give badger see I told you she
loves taking things so I know she's
gonna love filming this video that
there's my big boy right here like I
said he's about four to five years old
he will be in a video on Monday but I
wanted to give him a treat so he doesn't
feel left out he seems upset that he's
not in the video badger you're gonna be
the baby I'm okay it's okay he's pissed
knock knock would you like one of these
yeah for choosing my makeup so go ahead
and pick one get out of the box which
one do you why
mocchi juice no oh no she chose the
lorac one damnit
alright let's move on to face primer
illuminating primer from dr. Brandt we
have the NYX Hydra touch the Oprah cool
as a cucumber the Maybelline a baby skin
which I'm trying to use up seriously
girlfriend that's not even cruelty free
yeah that's what I thought as well is
the balm cosmetics and she chose the
Maybelline all right we've got some
concealers we have the Maybelline master
conceal the Milani retouch + e race as
well as the amazing cosmetics concealer
she's choosing which one is best
Oh Maybelline again are you for real
homegirl yeah choose again she can't
decide
choose the Milani that's better oh my
god it's not cruelty free
she's such a savage alright for
foundation we have the Smashbox Studios
skin we have the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation the nude liquid mineral
foundation as well as the Burt's Bees
goodness glow which one which one will
it be
Smashbox all right it's time for powder
we have the Too Faced Born This Way as
well as the graftobian professional
makeup in coconut creme Too Faced
all rightie badger really wants in on
this so we're gonna go ahead and let you
choose which blush palette okay he just
walked right over it okay I guess none
of those interest them I'm gonna go
ahead and choose the lorac unzipped next
up we are choosing a mascara so whoever
chooses first will get to pick just love
makeup especially Khaleesi which one
cliche she's I gotta see all of them mom
I gotta see the whole collection that
one I think she's kind of gearing
towards the it cosmetics hello lashes
yeah this one is that the one you want
this one
uh-huh yeah okay all right up next we've
got lip products okay it would appear
that they're really into this buxom
gloss right here it has kind of like a
purple pinky color to it - you like that
why are you licking it is their product
on here still please don't like that
this particular shade is called Claire
and yeah apparently both of them really
like that one all right Khaleesi it's up
to you final one oh they suddenly
licking my makeup I am slightly
concerned all right it looks like we are
going with the B y-yes Berry's palette
I'm actually low-key excited I have
never tried this palette it's supposed
to be a dupe for the modern renaissance
so yay for that all right Thank You
Khaleesi and thank you badger for
assisting me let's go ahead and I will
show you what I'll be using for the rest
of the week as far as shot my stash is
concerned all right so I will be using
the lorac behind the scenes eye primer
as well as the baby skin instant pore
eraser for foundation I'm going with the
Smashbox Studios skin 15 hour hydrating
foundation for concealer I'm going with
the Maybelline master conceal which I'm
currently at project panning I will be
using the it cosmetics hello lash it
what the did she do this what did
she do this in this video I didn't even
see her oh okay this is the it
cosmetics hello lashes mascara I also
will be using the brow power from it
cosmetics and the buxom gloss in the
shade Clair I will be using the lorac
unzipped cheek palette which is so so
pretty I also will be using the BUIS
berries eyeshadow palette as well as the
Too Faced Born This Way powder I'm not
gonna be wearing any highlight this week
cuz I have some real real bad texture
going on and I don't want to emphasize
it but yeah that's pretty much it let me

Khaleesi did at this challenge I think
they did pretty good I definitely can
make this work and yeah that's pretty
