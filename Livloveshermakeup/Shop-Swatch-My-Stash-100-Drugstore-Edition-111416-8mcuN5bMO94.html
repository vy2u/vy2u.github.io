so sorry if I sneeze in this video for
some reason my nose was just super itchy
right now but anyway welcome back to my
channel of welcome back tea shop and
swatch my stash where I share with you
guys the makeup products I currently
have on my face and of course the makeup
products that i will be using this week
we are doing another little special
edition I've shot my stash I think this
is just a fun way to spice up the shot
my stash videos today and for this week
we are going on hundred percent drum
stores so everything is drugstore every
single make a product will be found at
the drugstore and this was really easy
for me to do some of my favorite brow
products setting powders and my
concealer some foundations are from the
drugstore so it was not a problem
whatsoever for me to shop my stash and
only pull out drug store items last week
we did a cruelty-free edition and let me
know if you guys want to see like a
Thanksgiving edition or a Christmas
edition with all like red and gold
colors or even a drugstore cruelty free
edition down below let me know so let's
go ahead and jump right into it shall we
the first two items i will be using this
week are my little mascara duo so this
is the clump crusher with a clump
crusher by lash blast this is from
covergirl is the clump crusher mascara
in the shade at black and this is not
the waterproof version is just the
regular one so I'll be wearing that as
my base mascara excuse me and then I
will be going in with the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara which
looks like this it has a really nice
little dainty wand I do like the way
that my last just came out today they
look nice and define not too clumpy not
too dramatic but they still look pretty
as far as setting in my makeup is
concerned and also foiling any eye
shadows or any kind of powder product
that i want to i will be using my ELF
illuminating distance set so last we
could just use the regular version I
really like the illuminating version as
well so i'll be using that this week for
lip products i will be using two of my
all-time favorite lip butters from the
revlon brand so these are the lip
butters in these shades 001 pink truffle
and also 010 raspberry pi these are some
of my favorite drugstore lip products in
general you guys i love a very
comfortable lip product this is the one
I have on my lips right now this is
called pink truffle these are just very
very humectant moisturizing glossy and
they do have quite a nice amount of
pigment to them so I'm very excited to
be using that this week and then here is
the shade Raspberry Pi which I would say
is probably my all-time favorite it
looks a little more purpley in
too but when you put it on there's like
a really nice pinky iridescent running
through it and maybe even a little bit
of red so if there are the two colors
together I thought they would go really
nicely with absolutely anything that I
want to put on my face for eyeshadow
this week i will be using my covergirl
true naked roses palette I love this
palette I think it is just really really
wonderful quality from the drugstore
these shadows do tend to be a little bit
on the powdery sides of us just
something to be aware of but today I
just have on this color right here I put
that all over my lid I then went in and
use this as my transition and then I put
this into my crease and on my lower lash
line and that's it I think they are very
beautiful very soft very creamy you just
have to again it be careful because they
do pull off a little bit of Fallout and
things like that but here are some one
swipe swatches for you guys of some of
the actual shades i really like that one
up there i need to go ahead and put this
kind of rosy color on my lid tomorrow
and foil it or something i think that
will look beautiful alright for primers
this week i will be using of course my
favorite eye primer which is from
maybelline this is the master pineville
um lasting eyeshadow base in the shade
510 this is what it looks like it has
beautiful nice little iridescent to it
it's very satiny on the eyelids I love
that and then for my face primer i will
be using my Wet'n'Wild coverall primer
so I held on to this and I decluttered
the it cosmetics serum collagen veil
primer number 50 this is that product is
very similar to this one however I do
feel like this helps my makeup to adhere
to my face a lot better so I like this
one more than that now i will be bowling
in one high-end product and that is
because i'm trying to use this up by
december first this is my becca
backlight priming filter I'm about down
to there and I really hope that I can
make it through this by December first
so I'm gonna go ahead and mix these two
together this week I know it's not drug
store but you guys understand right it's
in my current project ban all right as
far as the bronzer is concerned I was
definitely going to reach for my mu
rumor but a bronzer in the shade what is
it I just like the regular bronzer shade
from physicians formula but I thought I
would go for another favorite which is
the elf golden bronzer in my empties
video you guys will see I already went
through one of these it took me like two
years to go through but this is a
beautiful beautiful bronzer so this one
is brand spanking new that is what it
looks like and I just think it's
gorgeous dusted like all over the face
really really nice
light and kind of golden it does have a
little bit of a sheen to it so if you
don't like that you would not like this
but that is what it looks like on the
actual hand so I put that just on the
outer perimeters of my face I like the
glow I think it looks very pretty makes
you look very healthy and this is a
great option if you do have fair skin
for highlighting this week i will be
using the wet and wild mega glow
highlighting golds bar in the shade i
believe it's called Holly Goldilocks or
something like that or just Goldilocks
I'm not quite sure but this is what it
looks like this is a little too dark on
my actual skin to be like hm true
highlight but if you use like a fan
brush or a very light hand you could
definitely can still get glowy skin with
it so I love it I think it's beautiful
let me still watch it for you guys it's
just a beautiful true gold color and
look how metallus eyes this is on my
hand do you guys see that in the swatch
just absolutely gorgeous i think if you
had like a tan too dark complexion this
would be absolutely incredible on your
skin as well but i really like it i
still think it works very well for my um
fair complected complexion so anyway i
will be using that is my highlight to
set everything in this week i will be
using my ELF tone correcting powder in
the shade cool this and the essence all
about Matt fixing compact powders are my
all time favorite setting powders they
are beautiful i love this one a lot
before blushes this week i will be using
to l'oreal true match super blendable
blushes these are great from the
drugstore l'oreal tests very heavily on
animals so i probably won't be picking
any more up but i already have these in
my collection on the first shade i have
here is n a 34 this is an innocent flush
and it is from the neutral category so
this is the one that i have on my cheeks
today very very blendable very silky and
i really love this color it's a nice
peachy apricot ii shade so here is the
shade innocent flush really great if you
do have a fair complexion you really can
go heavy with this you just kind of pile
it on you don't even need to tap off
your brush but with this one you
probably should tap off your brush this
is c-56 rosy outlook and this is in the
cool category so that is the shade right
there again these are very very nice
quality from the drugstore if you do
have them in your collection you
definitely should pull them out and play
with them a little bit because they are
beautiful so there are the two blushes
that i will be wearing this week as you
guys can see they do have a little bit
of sheen to them which i think is
beautiful on the cheeks and definitely
what I'm going forward this way
cake let's see here as far as foundation
is concerned I definitely wanted to go
in with a full coverage foundation this
week it was between the maybelline
superstay and my infallible Pro matte I
chose my infallible Pro matte just
because i love the actual look of my
skin when i wear this i am breaking out
like crazy right now my skin is purging
i have been using the luna for real mini
and its really causing my skin to like
erupt like just pimples all over my
forehead and everywhere so I thought
this would be a great one to use I don't
know if you guys can tell that I'm even
really breaking out that's how good the
coverage is with this so this is in the
shade 101 classic ivory I adore this
very excited to use as this week this is
one of my all-time favorite foundations
for brow products I have not been
filling in my brows for two weeks now so
when I filled in my brows today it felt
very weird but i will be using one of my
all-time favorite products this is the
Maybelline brow drama cran pomade I love
this I'm normally not into the whole
pomade thing because honestly I don't do
much with my brows they're just kind of
naturally thin but they look like right
with my face does that make sense you
know some people have really really
gorgeous full brows I've never had super
full brows but I find that if I filled
them in too much it looks strange so
anyway this is what it looks like um
this is in the shade blonde it's a
little more warm toned and even though i
do have kind of like it actually
undertone in my hair and my brows this
works really well I just like how you
can just fill in the front of your
browser and that's really only the the
area that I fill in is the front for my
brows alright for eyeliner this week i
will be using one of my favorites as
well from maglame this is the master
drama by I studio in the shade midnight
master it is a retractable eyeliner and
it is beautiful this is a very dark
creamy color and very comparable to the
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils
this one is very similar to the shade
zero so I do like that quite a bit i
will be using that as my eyeliner and
then finally I did pick out two
concealers because like I said I have
been breaking out so I wanted to use the
Maybelline master concealed by face
studio in the Atlas she here this to
shade number 10 fair this is what it
looks like I thought I could go ahead
and Spock and seal with that on any
areas on my face that need to be covered
a little more anything that isn't
covered by the l'oreal and then i
thought i would also go in with my
Maybelline instant age rewind in the
brightener version
and this is just the under I couldn't
corrector or concealer i love this
underneath my eyes it gives a lot of
brightness I take it in like the v-shape
on my eyelids down the bridge of my nose
and on my nose as well so I really are
down the bridge of my nose and on my
chin as well so I really do enjoy that
anyway guys those are all the products
that i will be using this week for shop
my stash thank you so much for joining
me i hope you guys enjoyed this video
and i will see you tomorrow for a first
impressions bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
