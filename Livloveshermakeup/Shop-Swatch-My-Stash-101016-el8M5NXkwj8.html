welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products i currently have on my face and
they make a product that i will be
wearing all week it is 545 in the
morning when I'm filming this and it is
freaking freezing and hit the booty grow
okay I don't know what's going on but
it's really cold in here so I'm sorry
for wearing my robe but it's freezing
alright so let's go ahead and get
started the first item i will be using
this week and the one that i have on my
eyes right now is the lorac mega Pro
three this thing is already completely
grungy and dirty as you guys can
probably see it but the shades that I am
wearing our CREP or i guess i should say
crepe when i reviewed this particular
palette i had so many people reaming out
my ass for saying clip but that was how
i learned how to pronounce it my dad is
swedish she's from Westeros Sweden and
when I was growing up but they would
call Swedish pancakes cut at Bayeux clip
so that's how i pronounced it in the
video i know that it technically is
crepe here in america and also in France
but yes right is what I used all over my
lid and then I did go in with the shade
a walnut and I put that in my crease and
then I took the shade eggplant and I
smoke that out on my lower lash line and
then also on the outer via and then I
use this shade Bellini which is a nice
kind of golden eat peach color I put
that all over my lids so let me do a few
swatches for you guys this is a
beautiful palette it's a very very
neutral but I still think it's gorgeous
and the lorac Pro formulation is one of
the best eyeshadow formulations in my
opinion like on the market so there are
a few swatches for you guys so that is
what i will be using a for eyeshadow
this week as far as blush is concerned
i'm going to be using my elf blush
palette and i was watching this on
Instagram the other day and I was like I
need to use this first shop and swatch
my stash this is the elf blush palette
in the lite version you have to kind of
nice ready colors and then like a moppy
color here a cool tone like pink color
which is what i have on my cheeks right
now and then a bronzy color and these do
you have a little bit of kick up kind of
like the lorac shadows but it's just
because they are so soft and silky but
these are really good blushes I feel
like people definitely talk about these
but not enough they deserve more more
hype because it's a beautiful beautiful
blush palette I think you can get this
for what around five six seven dollars
at the drugstore so really really enjoy
that excited to be using that on my
cheeks this week and then because I had
pulled that out I just
need to go ahead and also pull out my
illuminating palette from else and this
basically is like the hourglass ambient
lighting powders you can use them as
highlights you can use them to kind of
set your under-eye area that's mostly
what I'll be doing this week is setting
up my under eye area especially
especially especially especially with
this particular color down here so
they're just really really beautiful
powders like I said you can build them
up and highlight with them but i like to
use them basically for setting my face
so anyway that is what the four shades
look like you have kind of like a
whitish yellow me color here a bronzy
color more pink toned and more gray tone
so really like those next I will be
using a bronzer this week i will be
using my Too Faced baked luminous
bronzer in the shade a sweet tea this is
what it looks like one side is a little
more cool toned one side is a little
more warm toned when you mix them
together you get a little bit of both
and it is gorgeous it has a nice
luminous Sheen to it and I love this
color absolutely love it so it's just
one of my all-time favorite bronzers
behind the Physicians Formula muda muda
butter bronzers so very excited to use
that this week I will be setting in my
face with my essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder and then i will be
using two different lippies from to face
these are from the la creme lipstick
line the first is the shade sugar daddy
which is a beautiful rosy pink or your
lips but better kind of shade I will
swatch it for you guys and then the
second shade is called pink chocolate
that is what I currently have on my lips
right now another really really gorgeous
shade it's a little more deep and has a
little more of a very tone to it so
those are the two that i will be using
this week the darker one is pink
chocolate and then we have sugar daddy
which is the rosy color alright moving
on for mascaras this week I will be
combining these two together so the
first is the YSL babydoll mascara which
I really enjoy and I will be layering on
top of that one the Sephora outrageous
curl mascara love the both of these I
think they're awesome and they really
pair together nicely today I like the
way my eyelashes look alright moving on
I will be concealing but with my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle dark circle remover whatever it's
called I don't even know what that's
called in the brightener version this is
the only one that I like the fair
version is too dark on my skin so I like
this one it is pink based but it's
really nice i like to put it underneath
my eyes
a little triangle on my eyelids down the
bridge of my nose and on my chin
basically for brightening and
highlighting for my brows this week i
will be using the model launcher browse
in the shade taupe so we have a spoolie
on one end and then the actual pencil
retractable pencil looks like the
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer and
I really like the way that this goes on
it is definitely very very very dry but
I still think it's quite nice so there
it is I know it looks super Chuckie and
dry which it is but guess what it's
pretty good for the brow so I have been
enjoying that I also will be using my
next slide on glide on stay on and
definitely a turn on eyeliner if they
shade SL 16 golden bronze I'm going to
be wearing this on let's see here my
waterline and also my tight line I love
this shade I think it's so so so
beautiful it needs to be sharpened but
there is the actual shade just a
beautiful kind of ready bronzy color
it's not super super at opaque on the
actual water lining I'm wearing it today
but I still think it's nice I will be
setting everything in with my elf makeup
mist and such as this has a lo green tea
cucumbers and vitamins a c and e in it
and then for highlighting this week i
will be using my wet and wild mega glow
highlighting powder this was sent to me
by a friend the shade that I where is
called precious petals I know there are
two different shades here but this one
is definitely darker than my skin tone
and I feel like the other one definitely
would not work for me so here is
precious petals it's absolutely gorgeous
you guys see that it literally looks
like your skin is just wet so thank you
so much Britt for sending that to me
that is what i will be using and then
let's see here for foundation this week
i'll be using my revlon colorstay
whipped creme makeup in the shade 110
ivory i put about a layer in half of
this on my face today it's just a really
nice thick kind of like creamy makeup
and i feel like it blended in quite
nicely sometimes i find that this
adheres to dry patches but it didn't
today which is great and then for my
face base i will be using my bobby brown
extra 25 SPF 25 digit moisturizing balm
if you shave alabaster tint there's a
basically a tinted moisturizer and i am
trying to use it up in 2016 so that is
the item that i will be using as my base
or at my face primer and then finally
for my eye primer this week i will be
using
maybelline master prime long-lasting i
shadow base this is my all-time favorite
eye primer and the shade that I where I
believe is called 5 10 or 5 20 so those
are all of the items that i will be
using this week i hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and i will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
