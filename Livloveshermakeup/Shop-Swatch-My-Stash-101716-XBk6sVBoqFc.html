welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products I currently have on my face
right now and also be makeup products
that i will be using all week let's go
ahead and jump right into it I have a
lot to share with you guys and the first
item that i will be using this week is
the two-phase totally cute 9p an
eyeshadow palette I really adore this I
think it's adorable and today I do have
on a little bit of bunny foo foo a
little bit of chocolate donut clover I
hurt to face and a so storm cloud and
then I just kind of mixed everything
together on my eyes originally I went in
and I really wanted to like make sure
there was like a pop of color on my lid
and then stuff in my crease and then I
ended up just blending it all together
and I really like the way it came out I
do love the nine pen pallets from to
face and I think this one is really good
quality so let me show you guys some
swatches right here we have shooting
star here is clover and here is storm
cloud so shooting star clover is that
nice green and then we have storm cloud
which is kind of like max blue brown
pigment so shooting star clover storm
cloud and very very pretty these go on
like a foiled eyeshadow and I do feel
like the actual pigmentation and just
overall formulation in this particular
nine pound palette is the best out of
any nine pan palette I've ever had from
to face which is amazing alright did the
next product that i will be using this
week is the urban decay naked skin
one-and-done hybrid complexion Perfector
I where the shade light which is a
little too dark for me but i will be
using this this week because i'm getting
my lupus shot on wednesday and if you
guys keep up with me i usually at my
lupus shot I'm in kind of like a trial
program it actually actually triggers me
into a flare like it's on purpose kind
of like doomsday like knowing it's
coming um anyway long story short I
don't feel like putting tons of makeup
on when I am in a lupus flare so i will
be getting the majority of my filming
done for the week today and tomorrow you
guys will be seen probably a lot of pre
films videos but that is mainly because
i have no idea if i'll go into a
flare-up so this is an item that I like
to use when I am in a flare it gives
like a nice kind of blurring effects to
the skin but it's not like crazy crazy
pigmented and I it does cover up rashes
and bumps and things like that so i will
be using that but i also will be using
my marc jacobs genius gel supercharged
foundation this is what i have on today
when I
feeling good and I heard that together
with the tart to rainforest Avicii aqua
stealer the shade that I we're in the
Marc Jacobs is 10 ivory light which is a
really nice shade match and then I
warefare in the rain forests of BC aqua
sealer so those two paired together
really nicely today I like the way they
looked I also did go ahead input on this
dr. jar to be teammates contouring 123
kit this is the highlight shade it's a
really nice light cool toned pinky color
and I kind of use this to color correct
before i even went in with my foundation
today as far as setting everything in i
will be using my maybelline superstay
better skin skin transforming powder in
the shade porcelain this week I've been
obsessed with this and I have made quite
a dent in this particular powder so very
excited to be losing that for lips this
week i will be using the Urban Decay
24-7 glide on lip pencil in the shade
naked to let me show you guys what that
looks like here is a little swatch of it
oh my goodness you guys see this it just
flattened out completely but you guys
get the gist of it there is the actual
shade very very nice kind of your lips
but better color and I will be topping
that with the Anastasia Beverly Hills
lip gloss in the shade caramel so let me
show you guys what they look like topped
on top of each other topped on top of
each other you guys know what I mean so
that is what they look like I just
thought those two colors together would
be nice and that would help so that it
doesn't feather outside of the lip line
because these are very very pigmented
and I just want to make sure that they
just stay in my lip line and I also will
be using up my new NARS velvet lip glide
in the shade bound I have this on today
oh my god love at first sight these are
so creamy very very pigmented very very
nice to have on the lips and I did hear
that they have a little holiday set out
right now so I may have to put that on
my love's list but there is the shade
bound alright so moving on to eyeliner
the two eyeliners that i will be using
this week are they let's see here Urban
Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil in the
shade zodiac which is kind of like a
dirty green color with gold shimmer in
it there is a swatch of zodiac and I
also will be using the ombre Lancome
drama liquify pencil this is the one
that I have on my waterline currently
and I love that pop of color I think it
looks so so so pretty so there is
pule and there is zodiac moving on i
will also be using my ELF high
definition under I setting powder to
kind of set in my under eye I also will
be priming with my amazing cosmetics
line smoother plus primer this was sent
to me by the brand and it's tiny tube so
I just thought I'd try and get through
that i will also be using my Becca back
like priming filter and then for my
under-eye another item that's in a
project pan is the Smashbox photo finish
hydrating under eye primer I am almost
completely done with this so I just want
to finish that off this week and then I
also will be using this eye primer here
quite a few primers this is the tart CC
colored clay I primer and that is what
it looks like it does have a little bit
of a pinky or orangie hue to it and it
helps to color correct and then for
those foundations I also will be adding
in my cover effects custom infusion
drops this will definitely help in case
I do go into a flare-up these help to
moisturize and also brighten the skin in
case I do get some discoloration and I
just dropped two little drops I was
gonna say dropper full do a little drops
of this into the Marc Jacobs foundation
today I think it looks beautiful and
very natural on the skin so I do like
this one this is the radiance which has
the lemongrass for let's see here at
mascaras this week I will be combining
my bobby brown smokey eye mascara which
has a really nice densely packed natural
bristle wand together with my Too Faced
better than sex mascara which is another
one in my current project pan this is
like a project pan ah it's kind of like
a project pan of shot my stash and then
we have the Knicks a dewy finish setting
spray that's what i'll be using to set
in my face this week and then i also
have my it cosmetics bye bye pores
translucent airbrush powder as Ali's in
case I want to use that and finally what
I will be using on my face this week is
the Sephora blush bronze and ready to
glow face palette this is currently in
my giveaway I bought one of these for
you guys and I just love this palette so
we have a cool tone blush a warm tone
blush a bronzer and a highlight and I am
wearing the cool tone blush the
highlight and the bronzer today these
are just so beautiful so here is the
cool toned blush and then here is the
bronzer next one we have is the warm
toned blush and then of course the
highlight the highlight is kind of weak
in this palette so it's not something
that I'm just going to be wearing by
itself oops that's watch did not come
off without eyeliner
but here's the cool toned here's the
bronzer here's the warm tone there's a
highlight because the highlight doesn't
really have too much pigmentation to it
and it's not super bambam in your face I
will be going ahead and pulling in my
makeup forever prolite fusion
undetectable Luminizer in the shade
golden pink i recently picked this up
from sephora and i am loving it it is
very similar to the g you're glowing
gardens glowing pink highlights so if
you want something similar this is the
way to go so that is what it looks like
so anyway guys those are all of the
products that i will be using on my face
this week for shop my stash i hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and i will see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
