welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products i currently have on my face and
also they make up products that i will
be using all week if i'm looking a
little more pasty than usual today it is
because last night for the first time i
took my shower like on sundays i take a
shower and then I used my body scrub and
then I put on my self tanner and I feel
like it is that time of the year where I
don't need to be rocking my self tanner
anymore so I did not put any self tan
around last night so we are back to a my
pasty south and it will just get worse
as the winter months go on because I
just get paler and paler but anyway
let's go ahead and get right into shot
my sash is the first item i will be
using this week is the metal matte
palette you guys see that isn't that
cool metal Matt Matt the other way I'm
so excited to use this this is from kat
von d it is obviously what i have on my
eyes today if you are curious the shades
that I used were swayed bone oak and
also flash so here is what the paddle
pet palette died just a paddle this is
what the palette looks like I did review
this yesterday i'll leave a link down
below in the description bar if you want
to watch the review but i have some foil
shades up here on top and then some
matte shades it's not my palate I don't
know what I'm talking about I have some
this is kat von d's palette obviously
and she has some foil shades on top and
some mats on the bottom it's beautiful
super excited to play with that i'll do
some swatches for you guys of a few of
the foiled shades first so here we have
three different shades they're very very
beautiful and i love these foiled shades
i think they're awesome so there are a
few swatches there and then i will
swatch some of the math as well because
why not here is the shade Moss stone and
also a velour yes look at those shades I
feel like this is the perfect valid for
fault I'm really beautiful really really
enjoy this one so cannot wait to play
this week alright so moving on after i
will be using that i will also be using
with seeker this particular foundation
this is from maybelline I've really been
into the better skin line I love their
powder I love their concealer and I
wanted to pull out the foundation so
this is the maybelline superstay better
skin skin transforming foundation the
shade that I where is number 10
porcelain this is what it looks like and
I will be
that obviously is my foundation I also
will be doing some color correcting and
this is my NYX let's take your color
correcting concealer palette so I
thought if I use this this would be
obviously my concealer and color
corrector in one so before I go in with
my actual foundation I'll be using these
we just have some nice shades here this
is one of my all-time favorite color
correcting palettes acid does have a
little bit of a contouring shade there
but this is one of my all-time favorite
color correcting products ever besides
the actual what am I thinking of oh yes
the Urban Decay color correcting fluids
this is definitely second fast and I
will be probably decluttering all of my
color correctors except for the Smashbox
the knicks and also the Urban Decay one
so super excited for that de-clutter
series starts tomorrow on my channel if
you guys are curious that will start at
five pm and I will be doing my first
installment we're just gonna work my way
down my Alex series nine drawer we're
going to start with primers and setting
sprays alright for concealing this week
even though I'm going to be using the
color correcting concealing palettes I
did want to pull out my Kevin a quan
sensual skin enhancer in the shade s
access 02 I thought you know what I
barely reach for this and I'm not quite
sure if I'll declutter it or not but it
really did a nice job at concealing
today it's hella thick and very very
pigmented you can use this as foundation
as concealer and I feel like it went on
a slightly cakey today like not gonna
lie it is slightly cakey but I feel like
if you thin it out with like a nice damp
beauty blender or sponge then it does
look quite good on the skin and I do
like the coverage level I got today so
we're gonna play around with that this
week for setting in all of my cream
products on my face i will be using the
Rimmel stay matte long-lasting pressed
powder initiate number 100 or 001
transparent that is what it looks like
I've had some baby pan on that and then
I also will be using of course my bye
bye pores poreless finish airbrush
powder from it cosmetics and today I did
the buffing technique I like the way it
came out I also will be using this
little guy for my blush bronzer and I'll
highlight this week this is the Bobby
Brown bought me to glow shimmer brick
palette so I use this shade by here
which is called wild rose as my blush i
use the shade of bronze as my bronzer
and then gold is my highlight I love
these I think they're absolutely
stunning and beautiful I had reviewed
these and again I guess I could link
that down below I feel really weird when
I like
I'll link it all down below it feels
kind of sketchy but anyway it's
obviously not sketchy but it's just I
don't know I don't like the whole Shane
was promoting myself kind of thing so
what I will link it down below so you
guys can check it out if you are
interested but those are some swatches
gorgeous gorgeous guard just love these
products and it's amazing that like you
know I feel like they can do anything
these shimmer bricks are ridiculous like
I said I used to just blush today it
wasn't overly shiny but then I put on
that goal to highlight and it was super
beautiful and like in your face it's
just the strangest thing these are like
magical products right here alright
moving on i will be using my smashbox
hours sharp waterproof kohl eyeliner
indeed raven this week which is just a
jet black i have this on my waterline
today i like the way we went on i do
like the smashbox kohl pencil so there
is the shade raven it is a little bit on
the smoky side I don't like when black
colors are like kind of grayish in town
I really just like them to be low on
pigment but that's okay I also will be
using the NYX matte finish long-lasting
setting spray this week love these
settings brace from next they have a
dewy finish at a matte finish and that's
what i'll be using for eyebrows i'm
undecided this week today i used my
flawless brow pencil from bhcosmetics
which you guys know I love but I did get
something in my subscription box I don't
remember which one it was but if you
watch my huge subscription box unboxing
on snapchat the other day I did end up
getting a blonde or taupe I pencil and
on an eye pencil eyebrow pencil so i
think i'm going to use that one just
because i feel like i use this one all
the time so i'll probably change that
out for primers this week i will be
using two from the bomb cosmetics so
first is the time bomb face primer this
is a really nice silicone based primer
really nice and slippery and also the
put a lid on it I live primer which
again is very silicone base and very
slippery and easy to blend stuff on top
all right phora mascaras this week i'll
be using two of these little minis here
the first is the Lancome Hypnose drama
which is a beautiful beautiful mascara
it's a really really wet formulation and
it is a natural bristle wand which
normally I'm not into but it smells
amazing like it felt like roses and it's
just kind of a really nice little curve
to it I feel like it gives a lot of
volume to the lashes and I will be
topping that with my NARS audacious
mascara which I need a full size of this
I got this eating at my little lash sash
get lash lash dash kit from Sephora this
is what it looks like super super soft
and flexible and it
looks like it would kill you like if you
got this in your eye but it's actually
very very let me show you guys very very
flexible one so I like this a lot and
I'm very very excited to use that this
week and then they last for products
that i will be using are these lippies
so i decided to go ahead and use my bite
beauty 2015 holiday set this week these
are the match retractable lip pencils
the first shade we have here is called
cafe which is a beautiful beautiful kind
of nudie pinky color and I just feel
like bite beauty I don't know every time
like it's like a new time of year does
that make sense like I always pull out
by beauty lip products I have no idea
why I feel like they're little kids for
the holiday season are super super
fantastic for the fall and winter time
and then they have like really bright
shades for the spring and summer and
super strange I don't know why ok and
this or particular state is called tort
so there is cafe and tort there is cafe
there is torch torch is just a little
more of like a you are lips but better
kind of berry tone color and then we
also have aubergine and cool eh so cool
a is the one that I have on my lips
right now it's that true kind of reddish
color it's got a little bit of a very
few to it but I love this shade I think
by Beauty does a great read so there is
clay god I can never linked with the
freaking what's it called the viewfinder
I'm like which side is it on and then
the last day that we have is aubergine
and this is like a true kind of purply
berry color so super excited to wear
these this week these are so comfortable
even though they are match retractable
lip pencils they really dry down
comfortably and you guys know I'm a snob
when it comes to my lip products so I
love those alright guys the bows are all
the products that i will be using on my
face this week let me know down below
what you guys chose out for shop and
swatch my stash we're just shot my stash
