and welcome back to shop and swatch my
stash where I share with you guys the
makeup products I currently have on my
face and of course the makeup products
that I will be using it in this week
well let's go ahead and jump right into
it shall we for highlighting this week I
did pull out my to do your highlights
one is from last year's holiday
collection and the others from this
year's holiday collection so the first
one is the Dior and nude air Luminizer
shimmering sculpting powder in the shade
0:01 it looks a little something like
this it's a very pretty peachy nudie
color and I am layering the two of these
this week so this is what the peachy
nudie color looks like and then I want
to go in with my glowing gardens in the
shade glowing pink which was from last
year and this is just a beautiful
beautiful icy cold toned pink shade so
and there is the two of them so watched
they are absolutely beautiful
obviously the nude on top and then
glowing pink on the bottom I want to
show you guys how I layered them today
or the color and that I got when I
layered them so here they are layered as
well because why not right I thought it
would be really nice to layer them and I
really actually like the way it came out
they turn into like a really nice just
kind of silvery I don't even know you
guys tell me what it looks like so there
they are layered together so beautiful
beautiful beautiful love them separately
love them layered I will just kind of
change it up throughout the week alright
moving on the next item that I will be
using this week is my Physicians Formula
Muru Muru butter bronzer in the shade
bronzer I love this this is my all-time
favorite bronzer it smells amazing it is
a beautiful formula and they are
releasing a murumuru butter blush which
I hope to get my hands on very soon you
could get it like as a free gift with
purchase during the Ulta what was it
excuse me cyber fun day or whatever I
didn't pick it up because you had to buy
another one of these and I already have
two of these and two of the other shades
but I believe they will be releasing it
soon but yeah this is the bronzer shade
it's a little more cool tone to the
light bronzer shade which I also have it
is more of a red tone so here is bronzer
so watched on my hands so I love that
as far as setting in my makeup is
concerned this week I will be using my
essence all about matte fixing compact
powder this baby maybe will be in next
month's empties video I have already hit
pan and then I am still trying to use up
this cap
the locket setting powder so I realized
the less I use the more I like it so I
don't like it for baking I tried baking
it was a it was a disaster um I don't
like it for setting in my whole entire
face however throughout the day just to
hit in the t-zone is actually quite nice
so I will be using that as well as far
as my lip product is concerned I wanted
something really really soft and
hydrating my lips are so incredibly dry
right now so I decided to go in with my
Korres mandarin lip butter stick this is
basically just a tinted lip balm and
kind of like a reddish shade and it's
just very very comfortable on the lips
and not a whole lot of color payoff or
anything like that but it does
moisturize quite well so that is the
color that I will be wearing on my lips
this week as far as the blushes are
concerns I do want to use my Too Faced
love flush long-lasting sixteen-hour
blushes in the shades of Baby Love and
also your love is king I have your love
is king on my cheeks right now but baby
love is gorgeous and is just a really
nice peachy golden II kind of color I
really adore this and I thought this
would be really pretty with the nude air
to your highlight so there is baby love
and then your love is king is just that
perfect perfect berry color if you do
have fair skin use a little bit of a
lighter hand with this one so here is
your love is Caine both gorgeous and
yeah like I said I thought glowing pink
would be nice with this one and then the
Dior nude color would look nice with
that particular blush so and that is
what I will be wearing for blush this
week excuse me I will also be using my
NYX do we finish long-lasting setting
spray to foil any shadows or just to set
my whole entire face it as far as
eyeshadows are concerned I will be using
my Too Faced natural matte palette I
just used one color today that color is
chocolate cookie which is this one right
here I just worked it onto my lower lash
line really sloppily and then into my
crease it is beautiful I have like a
love affair with this palette you guys
there are quite a few shades that I have
already made quite a dent on and they
are absolutely beautiful I love the way
they blend they're all masked so they
look very beautiful and kind of
professional I guess you could say there
are a few shades swatch for you guys
they just go on so incredibly nicely and
I am in
with that palette so that is what I will
be using on my eyes I did go ahead and
pull out four of my Urban Decay Naked
skin color correcting fluids there comes
our Roomba this week so I pulled out the
lavender shade I also pulled out yellow
I pulled out peach and I pulled up green
I'm still having a little bit of
breakouts from the luna for real mini so
that is why I wanted to use the green
shade the yellow one is gonna be for
underneath my eyes right now I'm having
a little bit of discoloration underneath
my eyes and on my eyelids and it's a
little a yellow tone so I want to go
with this one instead of the pink
version and this will be for covering
any little acne scars that may show up
from the luna ferio mini like the
aftermath and then the lavender shade
today I just kind of went around my fine
lines and wrinkles and of course I don't
have to use every single one of these
during the week but you know I kind of
probably will be this - isn't quite
discolored alright for foundation this
week I will be using my Neutrogena
Healthy Skin liquid makeup I have not
touched this in a very very long time it
is a little dark on my skin but it is
beautiful the shade that I wear is
called classic ivory number 10 and it
does have titanium dioxide sunscreen so
that will be the foundation for the week
as far as mascara is concerned I will be
using my Sephora outrageous volume
dramatic Volume Mascara this has a
really messy clumpy kind of wand but I
love it I love the Sephora collection
mascaras they are beautiful so I love
that and then I will be layering it with
my Lancome Hypnose drama I really liked
the way it looked on my lashes today and
yesterday when I did it so I'm very
excited to use those alright moving on I
also will be using let's see here these
two primers so I will be using my Too
Faced shadow insurance glitter bonding
eyeshadow primer this week on my eyes
and then I will be using the l'oreal
magic perfecting base as my face primer
i will probably find another face primer
to go in with and then just put this on
my t-zone but i haven't picked which one
i want to use yet paired together with
this foundation and then for eyeliners I
will be using my Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencils in the shade faint
and also glitter rocks so faint is the
one I have on today it has a little bit
of like a cool toned Ashley Brown look
to it so there is the shade faint and
then glitter rock is a pinky my lucky
color with actual glitter in it and it
just looks beautiful on the actual
waterline so there is glitter rocks so
those are
the eyeliners I will be using this week
and finally I did go ahead and pull in a
concealer in case I need it this is the
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer in
the shade ivory this is very very full
coverage I did not use it today but we
shall see if I need it throughout the
week so anyway guys that is it that is
their first shop and swatch my stash
this week I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you again at 7 p.m.
