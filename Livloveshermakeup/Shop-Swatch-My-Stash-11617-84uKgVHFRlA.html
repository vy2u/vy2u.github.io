welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys that the
makeup products I currently have on my
face and of course the makeup products I
am wearing it this week if you are new
to my channel this is a series that kind
of coincides with my series that I do on
Saturdays and also Sundays so on Monday
I shot my makeup collection and I choose
out the products they want to use for
the week on Saturday I put the products
on my face you guys can see how they
apply and they get ready with me for
Matt and then on Sundays I tell you guys
if it was a sale or Holy Grail so that
is how I kind of like to do my series on
my channel just so you kind of get a
better understanding of what these
videos are since I do them weekly but
yeah let's go ahead and just jump right
into it the first item that I will be
using this week is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills a modern renaissance eyeshadow
palette of course have this on my eyes
right now I feel like I can spot people
from a mile away when they are wearing
this palette there's just so many
gorgeous berry tones in there that I
think it's just you can tell it right
away so this is what the actual
eyeshadow palette looks like you have
some nice warm tones and also some nice
cool toned berry colors the shades that
I am wearing today are real core which
is this one right here in my outer V I
have this shade which is called love
letter in my crease bone a fresco right
here which is my transition and then
Vermeer on my lid and also I do have a
love letter which is again that berry
shade on my lower lash line smudged out
so that is what I will be using for
eyeshadow this week as far as setting
spray is concerned I will be using my
pixie skin treats and makeup fixing mist
I used this last week and I've just been
really enjoying it so I thought you know
what I will use it again this week it
does have rosewater and green tea in it
you can use it as a primer spray to foil
your eyeshadows and also as a setting
spray alright as far as primers are
concerned I will be using the Bobbi
Brown vitamin enriched face space as my
actual face primer I love this it smells
a like a lemon cake and it basically is
just this kind of consistency right here
it's kind of like a moisturizer very
very nice on the skin it does have just
a little bit of DeMatha cone so you get
that nice amount of slip but it isn't
too like mattifying or moisturizing it's
just kind of right in between and then I
also will be using on my Maybelline
master Prime a long lasting eyeshadow
base which is my all-time favorite
primer I will not be repurchasing since
this is not cruelty free but I would
love to know if you guys have another
option for this if you have come across
a dupe or something like that I would
love to hear so anyway that is what
we'll be using as my eye primer I will
also be using this Clinique cheek pop
blush in the shade 0 2 pitch pop and
this is what it looks like it is a
beautiful beautiful little blush I have
not reached or this in quite some time I
really do like these I'm cheek pops from
Clinique so Clinique is not cruelty free
will not be repurchasing another item
like this or any more of these blushes
but it still is really really gorgeous I
am wearing it on my cheeks today let me
show you guys what it looks like so it
has a little bit of like a satiny coral
look to it so there is the actual shade
I also will be using this Physicians of
formula blush right here this is called
the Argan wear ultra nourishing argan
oil blush in the shade rose so I really
love the packaging these do have a
little bit of a scent to them very
perfumey but I like it I don't mind
heavily fragrance items so that is what
it looks like I love the little imprint
on there it's adorable and this is just
a really beautiful beautiful color a
nice cool toned pink with again a little
bit of a sheen so that is what it looks
like so on top we have the Clinique
peach pop and on the bottom we have the
Argan nourishing rose I was gonna say
highlighter no blush from Physicians
Formula alright moving on the next item
that I will be using is my lyocell I'm
definitely live this is a pop water
glossy stain this is what I have on my
lips right now I really do enjoy this
particular product sometimes I notice it
goes outside my lip line but right now
it seems to be acting pretty well so the
shade that I wear is called 200 dewy red
and it's basically just a really really
nice red color um it smells really good
like Rose why style is not cruelty free
so I won't be repurchasing but it still
is beautiful and I want to use it up
while I have it
so dewy red looks a little something
like this and it basically is just like
a lip gloss with a little bit of a stain
to it so I really do like that because
it doesn't last a long time on the
actual lips I also will be digging into
this this week so this is the Amanda
steel X color pop weekend warrior
palette so this was recently sent to me
in exchange for an honest review of from
colour-pop and also from Julie so I'm
excited to try this out because a lot of
you have been curious about the new
color pop powder eyeshadow formulation
so this is what it looks like I did go
ahead and swatch this yesterday on my
snapchat I will link on my
snapchat username down below I know some
of you have been saying you've been
having a hard time finding me so I will
link it down below in a comment but this
is what all four shades look like I feel
like they are relatively smooth my
favorite ones are definitely this kind
of topi shade here and this turquoise
shade this one and this one I find this
to be quite sheer and this one to be
quite patchy but I will show you guys
some swatches here not the best eye
shadows in my opinion as you guys can
kind of see they are quite patchy but
again I need to play with them on my
eyes and I have not worn them yet so we
shall see how that goes and I will
definitely give you guys my final
thoughts in my fails and holy grails on
Sunday next I will be using my ELF tone
correcting powder in the shade cool to
go ahead and set in my face this week I
have hit some major pan on this baby so
I'm guessing that this will be in this
month's empties video I also will be
using my by Terry hyaluronic hydra
powder if I feel like I want to like
smooth things out on my skin so if this
is what it looks like and this was sent
to me for PR as well let's see here we
have the it cosmetics bye bye redness
neutralizing cream I put this on today
before I went in with my foundation I
really really like this I feel like it
does cancel out the redness it is
definitely darker than my skin tone but
it is a very nice product so I will be
using that this week for highlights I
will be using my Dior what is this Dior
skin nude air Luminizer in the shade
zero zero one nude air this is what it
looks like
absolutely beautiful they recently
released like three or four new shades
of this they look amazing so this is the
nude air shade and even though this is
like a peachy gold kind of color it
definitely still is a true highlight on
me well not like a true highlight but it
can still give me really really nice
like golden Eve glowy skin if that makes
sense so even though it is darker than
my complexion I still have it on today I
think it looks relatively nice so I'm
excited to play with that I will also be
contouring this week so I did use a
little bit of a soft contour today this
is my all-time favorite contouring
palette it is from it cosmetics it is
called the you sculpted universal
contouring palette for face and body so
this is what it looks like on the inside
you get two different highlighting
shades one has a little more shimmer and
one is more of like a satin finish and
the shade that I'm wearing today and
like the hollows of my cheeks if you are
curious is called soft contour these two
right here are absolutely beautiful I
really love that
and these are so smooth I literally have
never felt such smooth powders in my
life I'm not even kidding you right now
so if you do have a fair complexion I
would highly recommend checking out
these contouring powders they are really
beautiful this one's a little more warm
tone this one's a little more cool tone
that's the one I have on today it gives
you a really nice natural looking
contour so if you are not into that
really really cut out chisel cheekbone
look I think you would enjoy that quite
a bit
alright I will also be using my Revlon
Colorstay brow pencil in the shade
blonde this week I've been using this
for two weeks straight now it has a
spoolie on one end and then it has the
pencil on the other I really like what
this has been doing for my brow so it
looks like that kind of like the
Anastasi of Beverly Hills a brow definer
has a little bit of like a I don't know
waxy kind of feeling to it or waxy kind
of look to it but I feel like when you
actually spoolie it out it's not too bad
so I will be using that and I have this
Maybelline concealer here that I am
trying to use up currently in a project
pan I am about right there as you guys
can see will not repurchase since
Maybelline is not cruelty free but yeah
I'm excited to kind of use this this
week it is a good concealer I like it it
is a little more yellow tone so right
underneath the eyes it is quite nice and
maybe I will use that up let's see here
I also will be using the icon alas mega
volume lacquer at mascara this is from
butter LONDON I think I got this in some
sort of subscription box
mhmmm I can't remember what it was but
this is what it looks like and it is a
really nice kind of cool little wand
here I had some issues this morning
putting this mascara on but I'm excited
to play with it more it does have your
very very wet formulation so we shall
see about that
I also will be using my Clinique skinny
stick in the shade is 0-3 slim sable
this is so nice for getting into the
waterline and basically just going and
getting a really nice precise little
line so let me show you guys the color
it's a really beautiful little chocolaty
brown color so there is a slim sable and
then the last product that I will be
using this week is my NARS Velvet Matte
skin tint I wear the shade Tarun wavy
light to zero and that is what it looks
like so anyway guys those are all the
products that I will be using on my face
this week I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow
