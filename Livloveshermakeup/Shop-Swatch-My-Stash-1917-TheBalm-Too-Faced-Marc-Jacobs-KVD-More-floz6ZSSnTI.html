welcome back to shop and swatch in my
stash where I share with you guys the
makeup products I will be using on my
face this week and of course the ones
that I already have on my face today so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
the first item I will be using this week
is from Too Faced this is the chocolate
bonbons palette I have not reached for
this in probably well over four to six
months so I thought I would jump into
that this week so this is what the
palette looks like on the inside you do
have some nice cool tone shades it
smells like chocolate it's a really
enjoyable pilot one of my favorites from
the chocolate bar line the shades that I
have on today are satin sheets this one
right here on my lid and then this shade
over here called mocha I have that on my
lower lash line and also worked it into
my crease so very excited to play with
this like I said I have not reached for
it in a very very long time so let me
show you guys some swatches so here are
a few swatches for you guys and yeah
I'll show you what they look like I feel
like the satin shades in here really
look amazing some of the mats are a
little patchy and some of the more like
glittery shades are a little patchy but
for the most part this is a really
fantastic little palette so I'm excited
to use that on at my eyes this week as
far as highlighting these concerns I
will be using my Kat Von D holographic
palette this is what it looks like it is
a well it's basically an eye cheek lip
palette whatever you want it to be kind
of pallid and this is what it looks like
in the pan so they look very very
similar in the actual pan but when you
just watch them you really can see the
dual chromatic or really holographic
kind of effect so there are the four
shades the one that I have on today is
the purple shade which is called
amethyst and here they are swatch so
really really beautiful very excited to
play with this as my actual highlights
this week as far as powder is concerned
I will be setting my face in with two
different powders I thought I would go
with more lightweight powder so the
first one that I have here is from
Maybelline this is the better skin
powder this is the super stay skin and
transforming powder in the shade number
10 a porcelain now this is a little too
dark for me right now it's really really
perfect for me during the summer time
but it's a little dark right now so this
is the first one I'll be using and then
I also will be going in with this vie
teary hyaluronic hydra powder so this
was sent to me in exchange for an honest
review from octoly and the by Thierry
brand I wore it today I love the way it
looks on the skin it's really really
beautiful very comparable to the it
cosmetics bye
pores I know that this one is a lot more
expensive but I love the way it went on
I don't feel like it emphasized any sort
of dry patches on my face so super super
excited to be using this this week
because it looks really really amazing
and it does have a little more of a
white cast to it so it helps with the
Maybelline to kind of tone down the
darkness and then as far as foundation
is concerned I will be using one from
Marc Jacobs that I have not reached for
any very long time this is the genius
gel supercharge foundation the shade
that I wear is ten ivory light and I
don't know I really love this it's funny
because you put it on and as you guys
can see it has kind of a thick
consistency that's super thick but thick
enough to the point where it's not
running down my hand and it does have a
little bit of a peachy undertone now
when you blend this in you would think
that it would have medium coverage but I
don't think it gives any more coverage
than say the typical standard water
foundation I really been into water
foundations right now because my skin
has been insanely dry so I'm very
excited to play with that this week and
because it is so natural looking I
thought I would also pair it together
with a natural-looking concealer this is
the Too Faced Born This Way naturally
radiant concealer I'm kind of trying to
get through this right now I don't know
what's going on but I'm kind of getting
sick of it I don't know why I think I'm
wanting something with a little more
coverage I really want to use this up
and then try out the heart shape tape
which I know everybody raves about so
this shade that I wear and this one is
very fair and it's just very very
radiant and natural-looking on the skin
all right moving on as far as primers
are concerned this week I will be using
my amici makeup diamond heart base
primer in the illuminating soft focus
version for my face primer I love the
way that this looks it is absolutely
beautiful you guys umm it does have a
little bit of a peachy or add essence to
it and this is exactly what I wish the
Laura Mercier and also the Becca
backlight priming filter looked like it
gives just the most beautiful beautiful
natural glow to the skin without looking
like fake or plasticky I do feel like if
you put too much of it the Laura Mercier
one on or too much of the background you
get that really fake looking shininess
to the face and this is just really
beautiful it does kind of give a little
bit of blurring like a blurring thing to
the face so it looks really pretty as
well so I enjoyed that and then I also
want to use my balm cosmetics put a lid
on its eyelid a primer so that is what
it looks like it's just one that's a
very very silicone base and very nice on
the eyes it doesn't help with creasing
that much but it does kind of smooth out
your fine lines and wrinkles
so I kind of like it all right as far as
mascara is concerned I would be pairing
together these two guys the first is the
benefit to their real mascara this is
what I am wearing on my lower lashes
today and then you guys were telling me
to try out the balm cosmetics matte lash
this is the black mascara this I got two
in my Ipsy bag last month and a lot of
you were saying it's good so I feel like
they give a very similar look to the
lashes I'm wearing this on the upper
lashes today this only lower lashes they
both have natural I mean not natural
rubber bristle wands so they benefit one
looks like this it is a rubber bristle
one with a little bit of a ball tip at
the end but it's not too big and then as
you can see it is straight whereas the
Matlacha one actually has the same sort
of rubber bristle wand thing going on
but it is curved kind of like the roller
lash from what is it called
ooh benefit right yeah from benefit so
anyway I really like the way that this
one on my upper lashes I didn't like the
way it went on my lower lashes I poked
myself in the eye so I thought this was
good on the lower lashes so hopefully
those will pair together nicely this
week as far as blush is concerned I
would be pairing together too so the
first one is the balm cosmetics down boy
blush this is a really nice cool toned
pink shade this is what it looks like on
the inside I will go ahead and swatch
that for you guys and then on top of
that I'm going to be going ahead and
putting the makeup revolution vivid
baked blush in the shade one for playing
games so that is what it looks like you
do have to blend it out a little bit so
you don't get any sort of chalkiness but
chalkiness I'm chopping this on the
cheeks but these are beautiful if you've
never tried out the blushes from the
balm cosmetics they are incredible and
the insane blushes wear forever on the
cheeks this one's not the insane blush
formulation but it still wears a really
nice amount of time so on top of that
blush I will be going in like I said
with the makeup revolution vivid baked
blush in the shade one for playing games
again has that nice pinky purple equal
tone shade it doesn't look as pigmented
on my hand as it does on the cheek so I
feel like it's a lot more I'm sorry did
I say that right it looks a lot more
pigmented on my hand than it does on the
cheek so this is going to be my blush
topper for the week it's gonna give a
little bit of Sheen to the skin which i
think is great
as far as brows are concerned I'm using
a new product from Revlon this is the
color state brow pencil in the shade
2:05 blonde a lot of you were asking
what I was wearing yesterday on my
eyebrows
and today and or I guess what I'm
wearing today is this product so I like
it so far I think it's really nice to
has a spoolie on one end and then on the
other side you're kind of getting that
like brow pencil that's shaped in a
little triangle sort of like the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills a brow definer so this
is what it looks like it does have a
little more of a moist formulation but I
like it so far so pretty darn happy with
this kind of like my new favorite brow
pencil even though I've only used it
twice all right as far as eyeliner is
concerned I will be using these Smashbox
I'll be sharp watter proof coal liner in
the shade storm this week this is just a
really nice light gray color I've been
in love with the Smashbox always sharp
cold liner so I feel like this is all
I've been using for weeks and you to
definitely shop my stash and choose
something else out next week but this is
what it looks like I love the way these
go on they're truly always sharp which
is awesome and they do have a sharpener
at the bottom and then as far as lip
products are concerned this week I will
be using this lorac highly pigmented
lipstick in the shade beardy guru so
this is what it looks like it is a
beautiful beautiful kind of like cool
toned pinky purpley color and I love the
way this goes on it's a very nice satin
sort of finish so here is the shade a
beauty guru from the ultra eco lipstick
collection from lorac and then I have
some products here from Charlotte
Tilbury that I want to try out this week
so these are also sent to me from
Charlotte Tilbury and octa Lee in
exchange for an honest review I'm so
sorry if I sound like a broken record
like oh it's sent to me from actally
it's been reviewed from actally the
reason for that is just because they do
require you to do a first impressions or
a review within 21 days of receiving the
product so I'm sorry if I sound like a
broken record but I do want to try some
of these items out this week so they did
send me this lipstick right here which
is will honor on my lips right now they
did also send me a lip liner they sent
me this perfume which I'm going to use
this week I want to talk about this a
little bit and then also this brush set
so let's go ahead and start with the
actual lipstick so this is the lipstick
it is a matte lipstick in the shade of
the Queen and like I said I have it on
right now I was a little nervous at
first because I was like oh my goodness
you know it's a matte lipstick but
honestly this is a satin lipstick it is
very very comfortable on the lips I like
the way it goes on super super full
pigment like amazing and I actually did
practice my flute this morning with this
on and I feel like it stayed on
relatively well it definitely definitely
rubbed off on my flute head joint but
the shade is amazing so there is the
shade of the Queen and I just love the
way it goes on so I'm very very excited
to play with
this week they also did send me the
lipliner in the shade pillow-talk which
I share Tara babes talk about all the
time so I was very excited to try it out
I did put it on today I'm not somebody
who usually uses lip liners all that
often but this goes on amazingly and
it's a really really beautiful kind of
peachy color as you guys can see
so that is pillow talk from Charlotte
Tilbury very excited to play with that
this week they did send me the brush set
now I played with this last week and I'm
not very impressed with this so far you
guys I just don't really think like it's
worth it I don't think their brushes are
all about amazing so this is what the
brush that looks like you do have a
bunch of little brushes in here and I
was gonna use it for look at the week on
Saturday with you guys and I forgot just
because honestly they're not that great
so you do get like a blush brush in here
I feel like they're just a little a
little scratchy on the skin so it's nice
because it is a little mini set but I
will probably declutter this to a friend
you do also get a blending brush which
is just okay I feel like it's a little
bit on the long side and when you do try
to blend color into your crease it kind
of goes all the way up to your eyebrow
so this is what the little fluffy crease
brush looks like and then the one that I
do like is this little guy so this is
like a really small little smudging
brush for your lower lash line and then
they have a more precise almost lip
brush or you can use it on your lower
lash line as well this one's very dainty
and I feel like it's just kind of I
don't know it's a little Wiggly I don't
like it on my lower lash line so out of
that little brush set - the only one I
really like is the small smudge or just
wanted to put that out there and then
finally like I said they did also send
me this perfume I know that this is not
makeup related but I thought I'd showed
in this video anyway I did not like this
when I first tried it out last week I
immediately was like oh it smells like
it smells like a grandma perfume but I
have it on today and I have to say it
warms up so beautifully on the actual
skin it's a very very sophisticated
scent it is called the scent of a dream
from Charlotte Tilbury so I love the
bottle I think it's beautiful you guys
know I collect perfumes I'll go ahead
and link my perfume collection video
from last year down below I will be
doing an updated one too but I just
wanted to show it in this video because
I actually love the way that this has
warmed up on my body so I will let you
guys know in my fields in holy grails if
you wears a long time it's starting to
fade a little bit but so far really
loving that as well alright guys so
those are all the products that I will
be using this week I hope that you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me tomorrow's video is going to
be the shittiest makeup of 2016 so I
hope you're excited for that video and I
will see you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
