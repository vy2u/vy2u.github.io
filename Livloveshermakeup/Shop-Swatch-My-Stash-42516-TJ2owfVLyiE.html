thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a fantastic day with
my roots look really ashley looking i
just put in a dry shampoo that i don't
really think i'm a huge fan of i feel
like there's a lot of residue up there
right now anyway in today's video i am
here to shop and so watching my stash
for you guys yes this will no longer be
shot my stash this is going to be shop
and swatch in my stash every single
Monday because I had a few of you ask in
my last a shot my stash video if I will
go ahead and just starts watching the
products because you know I feel like
that makes sense anyway because normally
when I'm shopping my stash eh I'm
swatching everything to make sure that
it like goes with each other you know
what I mean like you want a pair like
your eyeshadows with your blushes and
all that kind of stuff so I really
thought it made sense and I was like
absolutely i will do that so that is
what we are doing today and yeah let's
just get right into it i'm going to
share with you guys what I will be using
on my face this week so the first item
that i will be using is the hourglass
ambient light correcting primer in the
shade luminous light this is somewhat
new to me i recently did a review on
this product I think maybe three or four
days ago this is what it looks like on
the back of my hands and it just is
really really nice I like this a lot I
think the color is very nice if you have
a fair complexion and my favorite thing
about it is that it is great for oily or
combo skin and it really does make your
makeup lasts all day long alright as my
eye base this week i will be using the
NYC City proved 24 hour eye primer that
looks like this this is a drugstore eye
primer and actually have a best
drugstore eye primers video going up
later this week which I'm really excited
about but that is what it looks like
it's just kind of a sandy beige shade
and then you rub it in and it gets nice
and tacky so that your shadows can
adhere to it better really good product
exciting to use that the next thing that
i will be using is this this will be my
base for the week it is the neutrogena
healthy skin glow shears illuminating
tinted moisturizer this has broad
spectrum SPF 30 it's supposed to be
lightweight antioxidant rich and
oil-free I have been so into using like
natural basis I have no idea why because
I'm actually break
now right now like pretty badly and I
still just want to wear tinted
moisturizers the shade i have is ivory
to fair and number 10 and there is on
the back of my hand it does pull a
little bit of like a pinky undertone
actually more of a warm undertone I
would say there it is on the back of my
hand the coverage is not crazy or
anything like that but I don't know I've
just been loving really really
lightweight makeup lately so i will be
using that as my base to set in my base
i will be using the elf tone correcting
powder in cool this is like one of my
ride-or-die powders it's so finely
milled and beautiful I just really
really enjoy that and it does have a
little bit of like a white cast to it
which is nice if you do have a
foundation that is a little darker than
your skin tone all right let's talk
about like concealing and correcting and
contouring I have this little dr. jart
BB made contouring 123 kit this is part
of my makeup use of 2016 collaboration
video and I will be doing an update on
all my project pan video it's probably
the first week of may even either the
first week or the second week of May so
i will give you guys an update on my
makeup use up 2016 products and also my
finish 6 by summer product but you get
these nice little like correctors in
here you get one that is yellow and this
is nice to go underneath the eye area
and these are very very creamy they
remind me a lot of the urban decay color
correcting fluid and then you have a
pink one at which you can just like
highlight your face with and I am
wearing these underneath the base today
so I'm wearing them underneath that
Neutrogena glow shears tinted
moisturizer but these blend off so
easily and so nicely that you probably
could wear them on top so maybe I'll
just bus around a little bit this week
and kind of try them different ways and
then we have the contouring shade so
they're really creamy and blendable and
I feel like this little kick does
everything you get like your color
correcting product for dark circles the
highlight will help to brighten your
skin and then you can contour with that
shade so really really excited to use
those because I'm not doing very well
with using those out that and the blush
I'm like really really behind on
alright just set in my makeup this week
i will be using my ELF illuminating mist
and set I just thought because i'm using
such like illuminating products it would
make sense to go ahead and use an
illuminating mist and set so i will use
this after I apply my primer and then
after I apply all of my makeup all right
let's talk about browse i will be using
my models co more browse this is
basically a dupe for the benefit gimme
brow except this one has a little more
of an ashy undertone to it than the
light/medium shade from gimme brow or
benefit and I just like the shade more I
naturally have like a cool undertone in
my skin and I actually have naturally
kind of Ashton ashy light brown hair you
probably can't tell because my roots
look so so crazy i need to get my er
done um anyway this is what the shade
looks like and it definitely just has
more of an ashy color than the benefit
gimme brow so i thought that would be
nice to play with this week that's all
i'm going to be using i'm going pretty
natural this week so i'm just gonna have
that come through my eyebrows and yeah
all right and then as far as mascaras go
this week i will be using my addy or
iconic / curl mascara i'm still trying
to get through some of my little deluxe
ice samples of my mascaras and i also
will be using the tart lights camera
lashes mascara which looks like this and
it's funny when i use this today it had
a lot more like a wet formula that i
remember it having i have you full size
of this at one point and i remember
hating it because they have with such a
dry formula but i don't know this one's
really good so I don't know that's all
about and then I also pulled in my tart
confidence creamy powder foundation in
the shade fair neutral for the week just
because I am kind of breaking out right
now and I picked out such light products
for actual like my base you know what I
mean so I thought it would be nice if I
don't know I'm going out with my
boyfriend or something like that to have
like a powder foundation like on hand in
case i do want to cover up some of the
angriness that's happening on my face so
that is what it looks like this is i
would say about half a shade lighter
than my skin tone so i would probably
just dot it over areas that i really
need to cover and then form of the next
this week i shall be using my sephora
rouge balm stain so now
bomb sings they're just rude bombs
they're kind of just like a tinted bomb
they're really nice they don't actually
have the shade names on here they just
have the number so the first one is 602
2a and this is like a hot orange red
shade I really like these i reviewed
these I think last week so if you guys
go back you can probably find that video
if you want more information on them and
then I have a plummy shade here and this
one is called 6032 a it's and I like
these because they're just very
comfortable to wear on the lips and like
I said I'm going for like natural makeup
this week so I don't want anything too
fussy like a liquid lipstick or
something and then the shade that I have
on my lips to right now is this kind of
blushing I think it's actually called
blushing rose or something like that if
the shade number is 6015 aids and it's
just more of like a pinky orange colors
so there are the three of them those are
what i will be wearing on my lips this
week and then for highlighting this week
I'm going to be using the wet and wild
mega glow illuminating palette in the
shade catwalk pink and this is actually
a little pig tone so I actually will be
using this over my blush if that makes
sense so i will be using it kind of as a
blush topper to give a little bit of
like a luminescent sheen to my skin and
to my cheeks it's really beautiful but
it's just not light enough to be like a
true highlight on me there it is it's
very beautiful it does have little
flecks of glitter but it's nothing crazy
like oh my god straight up disco ball on
your face alright moving on i will also
be using my Urban Decay 24-7 glide on
eye pencil in the shade mugshot I
thought this would be really nice with
these shadows that I'll be wearing this
week which I will show you guys in a sec
but this is a beautiful kind of topi
light brown color there it is swatched
and i'll be wearing that on my waterline
and probably my tight line or maybe
underneath my lower lash line i don't
know we'll see what I come up with and
then the last thing i will be using is
this little steel appellate this is the
perfect me perfect hue palette i picked
up all four of these i love these i am
obsessed with these these are going to
be amazing for travel but for the most
part i just really like the formulation
on these and so yeah this is in the fair
light shade
and it opens up you have a mirror you
get five eyeshadows and then two blushes
as you guys can probably see I am
wearing that light pink blush today and
then I put the catwalk pink on top here
are what the blushes look like you have
more of like a warm tone blush and then
a cool-toned they're very very pretty so
there they are so watched on my hands
there's the cool tone and then the warm
tone there and then you have five I
shadows in there which I think are nice
and kind of neutral and natural-looking
so let me go ahead and swatch those as
well yeah i'm super excited to use this
because this is a somewhat new kind of
palette to me and i still haven't really
played with them and use them for like a
whole week so yeah that is what they
look like very very pretty that didn't
make sense I haven't used them for a
whole week like consecutively if that
makes sense I had them for over I think
two and a half weeks but anyway um that
is everything that i will be using on my
face this week i'm just making sure you
didn't forget anything nope it doesn't
look like i forgot everything anything
um so that is what i will be using for
my face makeup this week i hope you
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and i will see you guys
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
