welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
for the week I shot my stash last night
and I am here to share with you guys the
products that i will be using this week
again please excuse my hair a few you
were asking if I canceled my hair
appointment no I did not cancel it it
actually got moved which totally bums me
out but anyway I will be chopping my
hair to my shoulders I think at the end
of May or early June and she's gonna try
and squeeze me in earlier but right now
my appointment is at the beginning of
June and I'm just so sick of it that's
why I've been throwing it up in a
horrible button like this every single
day anyway let's go ahead and get
started the first two items that i will
be using this week are these primers
right here this is the Maybelline master
Prime long-lasting eyeshadow base in the
shade of 5 10 this is what it looks like
and let me swatch this quickly for you
guys I really like the color of this
it's really nice if you do have fair
skin so there it is swatched on the back
of my hand that is what i will be using
as my eyeshadow base and then for my
face face i will be using my stila aqua
glow face primer this is what it looks
like and it just comes in a little stick
like this you twist it up and I will not
swatch this one because it just goes on
clear but that is what i will be using
as my base this week alright let's talk
about foundation so i will actually be
using a CC cream this week this is the
cover girl plus ol a CC cream tone rehab
foundation in the shade 105 ivory i'll
do a little pump of this on the back of
my hand so there it is right there and
it's just really really nice i love this
on the skin this is like one of my
all-time favorite products ever and you
no longer can get it which is why i
haven't been using it but i came to the
conclusion a couple of days ago I talked
about it in my fails and holy grails
actually yesterday I came to the
conclusion that if I really like a
product I should just be using it even
if it is discontinued I love pretty much
everything about that particular product
so why not use it alright and then for
concealer this week i will be using my
amazing concealer in the hydrate version
look at this packaging yes how my shade
is ivory and that is what it looks like
and i do like this color match i think
it's quite nice so there it is on the
back
of my hand and then let's talk about
blush for the week so I want to play
with my the balm blushes I really think
those have just adorable packaging and
it makes me want to reach for them so
the ones that I chose out our frat boy
down boy and also hot mama so anyway the
one I'm wearing today if you are curious
is a frat boy so this is what frat boy
looks like it's kind of like a I don't
even want to say like a peachy color
it's more of like an apricot II sort of
color let me swatch it for you guys so
there is frat boy on the back of my hand
very very nice on fair skin tones and
then down boy is kind of like a cool
toned pink color and this is what it
looks like I'm down boy and frat boy are
both Matt so let me swatch this one so
there is down boy and then we have frat
boy very pretty and then the last one is
hot mama this is the one that has like a
little bit of shimmer in it by the way I
wanted to share with you guys I think
using my makeup eraser to remove
swatches this thing is amazing i have
two or three of these and i'm not a huge
fan of using them to remove my makeup to
be completely honest because i feel like
it kind of tugs at your face all this is
is just one hundred percent polyester
and it just removes swatches so nicely
so if you do have a makeup eraser and
you don't like using it for getting off
your face makeup if you feel like it
really tugs and pulls at your face i
highly recommend using it for swatches
that way you're not going through like
multiple wipes it's kind of nice anyway
um the last one is hot mama here it is
packaging right so cute and it is
basically a peachy color with tons of
golden Sheen or shimmer to it everybody
says this is very comparable to Narses
orgasm I don't have Narses orgasm so I
have no idea if it's comparable but
there it is on the back of my hand very
very golden Igor giuse ness I love peach
and gold like combined together and that
color combination is just perfect all
right as far as highlighting goes this
week i will be using my hourglass
ambient strobe lighting powder in the
shade brilliant this is the outer
packaging and the actual color looks
like this it's just a beautiful light
goal
in color this is probably one of the
most gorgeous highlighters that I own
and I feel like on camera it just does
the product like no justice whatsoever
I'm wearing it today and you probably
can't pick it up on camera but it's so
soft and beautiful and luminous there it
is on my hand it's so gorgeous you guys
honestly when I wear this on my skin I
get so many compliments and you
definitely can build it up today I just
have one layer of it on again I don't
know if it's like actually showing up on
camera but it's just one of the most
stunning highlighters that I own so very
very excited to be using that this week
and then eyeliner so it's funny actually
on the photo that you guys see for this
video like the thumbnail for this video
actually has this particular eyeliner in
there um but today I was trying to use
it this is the Stila smudge stick
waterproof eyeliner in the shade
starfish this is actually an item I'm
trying to use up in 2016 and today I got
it and I was like twisting and twisting
and twisting and I'm like what the hell
I want the product come up I didn't do
it completely I'm so happy so I actually
used this up completely so i will be
doing an update on my makeup use up
collab video soon for you guys but it's
so funny how you really kind of focus on
a product and then I don't know where
it's done and it's like oh my god that
was great so i did go into you at my
collection and choose out two different
eyeliners so the Urban Decay 24-7 glide
on eye pencil in the shade zodiac is
very similar to the steel of starfish
and I just really wanted to wear an
eyeliner like this it's kind of like a
muddy dark hunter green color with tons
of gold glitter in it and I just really
like the way this looks I have this on
my waterline and my tight wine today and
I think it pairs really nicely with the
eyeshadow palette that I use today and
then i will be using this week and i'll
show you guys that in a second and then
also i chose that the Urban Decay 24-7
glide on eye pencil in the shade Roche
which is definitely more of like a warm
tone sort of copper color and I have an
idea for these so basically AB the
eyeshadow palette i'm using this week
has cool tones and warm tones in it so
when I'm wearing the cooler tones i'll
be using zodiac and then when I'm
wearing the warmer tones I'll be wearing
a shade Roche so that was kind of my
thoughts on that particular on those
eyeliners basically and then for
stairs this week I'm going to be pairing
to like I always do i'll be wearing the
Physicians Formula sexy booster cat I
collection mascara in the shade ultra
black look at this packaging is that not
like the most stunning thing ever it
literally is like embossed with a velvet
and has a little stiletto on the front
sexiest packaging ever anyway this is
what the wands looks like and if you
were someone who likes to layer their
mascaras like I do I highly recommend
checking this out as like your base
mascara I normally like to use like a
volumizing and kind of like plump a fine
sort of mascara as my first layer and
then I like to go in with the
lengthening mascara so I really like
this as a base mascara anyway that is
what i will be using and then i will be
topping it with the loris yay this is
the extra lash sculpting mascara and you
shade black onyx so that is what it
looks like and this one has a super
crazy huge spiky warned you have to be
really careful not to poke your de mi
out but this is what it looks like and I
like this as like the final mascara
because it gives a lot of length so
anyway that is the mascara duo that i
will be using this week for my eyebrows
i will be using the Maybelline brow
drama cran pomade in the shade I believe
this is blonde and in the photo
thumbnail you guys probably saw that I
had thanking me brow in there as well
but I took that out because today I put
this product on and I just felt like
that was all I really needed on my brow
so I just put it kind of like in the
front of my brows spleen it out and
that's basically all I have on my brows
so there it is right there swatched and
then let's talk about lip colors quickly
i am going to be wearing to this week so
the first one is the Maybelline not in
the shade 670 ravishing Rose that is
what I have on my lips right now and
again I was thinking when I do the
cooler toned I look I will pair it with
this because it's kind of like a cool
toned pink color really really really
pretty color and then the other one that
I chose out is the tarte lipsurgence in
the shade wonder which is definitely
more of a warm color so I thought this
would be nice when I'm wearing a warmer
I look so here they are together we have
the Maybelline mat in ravishing Rose and
we have the charts lipsurgence in the
shade wonder so this is kind of like a
cool tone pink and this is sort of like
a hot coral color and I really like the
formulation on both of these so I find
them very very comfortable to wear and
then let's talk about the eyeshadow
palette so i will be using my violet
boss pro i shadow palette in the
drenched metal I was gonna say the
dredge metal formula this is a giant
metal of Iowa Falls college and the
reason I'm using this is because last
week I used a drugstore I palette and
I'm trying to alternate so this week I
get to use a high-end palette so this is
what it looks like you get a nice
arrangement of warm tones over here and
then cool towns over here today I have
some of the cooler tones on I have the
shade shade right here in my crease I
have bliss on my lid and then I have
slake ation on my outer be and on my
lower lash line so i thought when i was
using the sort of cooler tones in here i
could do the cooler tongue lip and the
cooler tote eyeliner and then when i do
the warmer tones in here on my eyes I
could use the warmer eyeliner with the
warmer lip so I thought that those who'd
go together nicely and let me swatch a
few these because they are seriously so
beautiful like these are amazing you
guys look at those they go on like
completely foiled looking it's amazing
like what like that's just like one
little swipe I isn't that beautiful look
at these oh god they're so beautiful
these are really really beautiful
shadows alright so I think that's about
it I do have one final thing and I was
hesitant to show it's because I may use
it out before the end of the week this
is the pixi by petra makeup fixing this
this has rose water and green tea i will
be using this after i put on my primers
and then also to completely set in my
makeup but again there's only the
smallest amount left so i did also take
out my tasha luminous dewy skin mess
just in case i do run out of this one by
the end of the week i can set in my
makeup with the tacha so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed shop and just watch my
stash I will see you guys tomorrow for
my Ipsy on bagging and
yeah we will talk then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
