happy Monday I know nobody says that but
happy monday anyway I hope you guys are
having a fantastic day so far in today's
video we are shopping and swatching my
stash so I went ahead and picked out new
products for the week last night and I'm
going to share with you guys what I
chose I'm wearing them on my face today
so if you were curious about something
that I have on my face I'm probably
going to be showing it today actually I
will be showing it today so anyway let's
go ahead and just get right into it
shall we the first item that i will be
using this week is the it cosmetics feel
the moment primer this is a face primer
and it looks like this and i am excited
to use this because i will be pairing it
with a foundation that i normally do not
pair this with that makes sense like i
normally when i use this particular
foundation i'm going to show you guys um
i normally use a certain primer but i'm
going to try it with this one this
weekend it seemed to go on like all
right today it seemed to pair pretty
nicely so i will be using the it
cosmetics feel the moment primer for my
face and then for my eyes i will be
using my L'Oreal magic decrease base in
the shade 895 which is kind of like a
yellow sort of color correcting shave I
guess you could say it's got a little
bit of like peach in it a little bit of
yellow that is what it looks like on the
back of my hand and then when you rub it
in it just completely absorbs into your
skin and it will just basically match
your skin tone so I really do like that
and i will be using that to prime my
eyes for setting in my makeup this week
i will be using my ELF magic Matt mist
and set last week i used the
illuminating misted set so this week I'm
using the mat Mon because i have a few
shows this week and I will be going
pretty darn heavy as far as like
foundation is concerned like my base
this week so I really want everything
just you know like state on my face
basically yes I wanted to stay in place
stay on my face and also I want it to be
quite mad except for the areas where I
have highlighted all right let's talk
about some color correcting and also
concealing this week I'm going to be
using my tart wipeout color correcting
palette which looks like this I feel
like I never reach for this honestly and
I really need to start using it so
anyway we have some
crackers in here we have a contouring
shade we've got some concealers so i
will be using you know the orange cream
shade to cancel out any sort of darkness
you know underneath my eyes i'll be
using the mint shade to cancel out any
sort of redness and then these shades
four and five right here i will be using
as concealers because they have this
nice sort of like peachy undertone to
them and I really really really like the
consistency of them so let me go ahead
and swatch one of those as well so there
are a few of those colors on the back of
my hand and I'm excited to play with
this a little bit because like I said I
rarely reach for this I think it's
because i have come across so many
wonderful color correctors in the past
couple of months that I just kind of
neglect that palette so anyway well the
yield is that and then from my base this
week I am using the kat von d lock it
tattoo foundation which is why I was
saying that I need like a really tough
base this week when I'm on stage the
only thing I really care about is how my
skin looks I know that sounds weird but
if you have been on stage I remember the
first time that I played at Carnegie
Hall there were close up photos of me
and I had worn a tinted moisturizer on
stage and I cannot even tell you how
horrible my skin looked underneath those
bright lights just being on stage and
having lights shooting from different
angles it just makes your skin look so
much more textured and horrible than it
actually is so when I'm on stage I
really really like to use a very full
coverage foundation so I mix the Kat Von
D Lite 44 with light 42 I mix these
together to get my perfect match and you
guys have probably seen what this
particular foundation looks like but
it's just very very thick and opaque and
there is light 44 swatched on my hand
and then like 40 I'm sorry that was like
42 and light 44 is this one oh I just
pushed out so much product I wish I
hadn't done that so anyway we have late
42 here like 40 for their you guys can
see there's a big difference between the
shades and I have to mix them together
to get my perfect match so anyway that
is what I will be wearing for foundation
this week and then too
everything in i will be using my essence
all about match-fixing compact powder
and i love this so much and i'm very
excited to be using it because it really
does keep me Matt and I use a lot of
this when i pair it with a kat von d
foundation like that locket at a
foundation I use a lot of this because
this particular foundation is notorious
for slipping off my face personally so I
use a lot of this and you guys will see
how much of it I actually use when I do
look of the week on Saturday but yeah I
use a lot of that and then I also will
be doing the buffing technique with the
it cosmetics bye bye pores translucent
powder now I don't do the bucking
technique every single day but i will be
doing it this week because like i said
i'll be on stage I want my skin and my
base to look flawless so i will be using
that and then as far as high lady is
concerned i will be pairing to
highlighters together the first one is
the illamasqua beyond powder highlighter
in the shade oh my god it looks like
this it's a beautiful kind of champagne
II sort of color and I have a follow-up
of you and um dupe video coming up on
this particular product but there it is
swatched on the back of my hand and
because it's not as pigmented as I want
and when I'm on stage I really want this
area to really shine and be like whoa
I'm going to go ahead and put in the
loreal infallible Pro contour
highlighting and contouring on top in
813 light there's this color right here
that is very very similar it is sort of
a dupe for this particular color and I
will be topping that well i will be
talking the illamasqua with that so
anyway we have the ELA moscow wait yes
the illamasqua right here and then the
l'oreal right there i don't know if you
guys can see that but they're both
beautiful kind of over less into yellow
shades and i will be layering the two of
those together and then for contouring i
will be using this contouring shade here
which is a very very ashy color it's
really beautiful thou great if you do
have fair skin and there it is I have a
little difficulty with this this morning
around my hairline I forgot that I only
really like this for chiseling out my
cheekbones but we'll see you guys will
see if it's a fail of holy grail at the
end of the week
all right as far as eyeliners are
concerned this week i am using cute new
ones to me this is the make up for ever
aqua eye pencil extra large in these
shades m80 and also m10 so m10 is the
black one and m80 is the plum 1 i'll be
wearing these on my waterline and also
on my tight line i have the plum one on
right now if you are curious and this is
what they look like so the plum one is
called an 80 and then m10 is the black
one and I will actually be doing a
review on the little kit that I got I
got four of these eyeliners full size in
a little kit from Sephora that review
will be up tomorrow so stay tuned for
that as far as mascara is concerned this
week hold on let me try and get off
these swatches because these eyeliners
stay like all day but as far as mascara
is concerned this week I will be
layering two bath cares that I know are
really really wonderful together the
first is the benefit they're real
mascara in the black shade and the wand
looks like this it's really nice right
up my alley super super spiky it has
tons of little pokey pokey things poking
out of it and then I will be topping it
with the covergirl the super sizer which
is one of my all-time favorite mascaras
which is also a little pokey but not out
of pokey looking and I'm wearing those
two days like I said I'm wearing all the
items that I'm talking about but I
really love the two of these together I
recently did a video called foundation +
primer soul mates and I was thinking of
doing a video on mascaras that layer
really nicely together let me know if
you guys want to see that video where I
talk about like mascara duo's that go
really nicely together because I almost
always layer my mascaras together
alright let's talk about eyeshadows so
last week and the week before for the
past two weeks I've been using an
eyeshadow palette that was high end and
one of the little things that I'm trying
to be aware of is the fact that I have a
lot of drug store I palette so this week
I am do that i'm doing i am playing with
and I am doing um drugstore I palette so
anyway this is the one that I chose out
well I technically chose this one and
then I'm going to bring this one in as
well so the one that I chose for the
week is the wet'n'wild comfort zone in
738 this is a beautiful eyeshadow
palette this is what it looks like i'll
go ahead and swatch a few of these
shades so here are a few of those shades
watched really love this palette it's
beautiful there it is on the back of my
hand look at that definer shade yes so a
beautiful duochrome and then i will be
bringing in my little Physicians Formula
Canyon classics Matt collection quad
because this particular palette the wet
and wild does not have like a brow bone
color it doesn't even have a matte color
in here and it also doesn't have a
transition shade so I'm thinking of
hearing these together that's what I did
today I really like it and I like this
particular shade here for like the brow
bone and then this one as my transition
so I plan a plan on sharing that with
that particular I shadow palette alright
let's talk about blush this week I have
one that I have had my eye on for like
the past two weeks I don't know why
because this is a very like Christmasy
not Christmas Eve alike wintry sort of
blush but I have been like daydreaming
about the it cosmetics CC radians ombre
blush in the shape sugar plum I was
going to say hugger palm sugar plum this
is what it looks like it's an ombre
blush so you get this beautiful plummy
shade down here but it's unlike any
plummy shade that I have it actually has
a little more like Ashley undertones in
it and then you do get the ombre effect
up here i'll go ahead and swatch it for
you guys um but yeah this is the only
blush I'll be wearing this week because
like I said I've been thinking about
this bush for weeks now I don't idea why
there it is swatched on the back of my
hand it's got a lot of luminosity to it
and it's very very beautiful I like the
way it goes on to the cheeks it's not
like overbearing and it's a very subtle
plummy color alright and then the final
say that I would be using this week
actually the last three things sorry the
last three things i will be using are
the bhcosmetics brow pencil and here we
have the retractable side this is in the
shade ash blonde and then we also have
the spoolie on the other end one of my
favorite brow pencils
and then I will be peering my colour-pop
lippie Stix with this blistex deep
renewal broad-spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen
yes the reason I'm pairing it with this
this week is because hello i am almost
out of this i just want to use it up
also let me know if you guys would like
a video on someone asked me the other
day i have like so many lip balms do you
guys want to see a lip balm collection
video I am very picky about lip balms
like being a flutist I'm just very picky
but I really go through them very
quickly like honestly I go through lip
balms all the time if you see my empties
videos you probably know that let me
know if you guys would like a lip balm
collection video I just didn't do one
when i did my collection videos because
i didn't think people would be
interested but i do have a lot alright
and then a family um yes the thing
lovies died sorry i digress these are
the colour-pop lippie Stix these are
both matte colors and I know that these
are transferred proof on to my flute so
for my shows they won't be an issue I'm
we're in the Buddha I am wearing the
shade cookie today and then the shade
Tootsie is a little more of like a
cooler undertone sorry i was looking in
the viewfinder i thought i was out of
focus my camera has been doing that a
lot lately but anyway there is cookie it
is a matte it is beautiful I really like
the shade and then the shade jesse is a
little more cool toned like i said i
have cookie on my lips today but i'm
excited to wear to say because help seal
so right up my alley it's like a
beautiful your lips but better so cookie
and Tootsie those are from colour-pop
and those are their lipsticks and they
are both matt so anyway those are all
the products that i will be using this
week on my face i hope you guys enjoyed
