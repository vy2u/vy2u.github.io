welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
at where I share with you guys the
products that i will be using on my face
this week so let's go ahead and get
started for my primers this week i will
be using my ELF a one-dollar eyelid
primer in the shade sheer and then for
my face primer i will be using the
Garnier five-second blur skin renew
soother this is what it looks like any
pcs little like ticks on here or
whatever it's because this is in a
project pan video and I'm trying to
calculate how much further I have to go
until I use that alright so for my base
this week I am going very very
lightweight just because it is
summertime and I swear to you the
heavier I go like with my face makeup
the worst my skin looks it just looks so
textured and grow so I haven't been
wearing kind of like lighter tinted
moisturizers and BB creams and things
like that so as my base i will be using
the smashbox camera ready BB water drops
in the shade fair and these do have
broad spectrum SPF 30 in them and let me
show you guys what these look like it
just comes in a nice little applicator
like this like a little dropper form and
i'll just put a little on the back of my
hand that is what the actual product
looks like it's super super lightweight
it literally feels like water on the
skin hence the name and yeah i'm super
excited to use this just because i know
if you really like wait on the skin and
you know it's not oily or anything like
that so i really do like that product
and i will be using that this week and
then for my concealer i will be using
another really lightweight one these are
kind of like water or serum foundations
and concealers this is the tar train
force of the sea aqua sealer in the
shade fair and i'll show you guys what
this looks like as well and i will be
using this to kind of highlight my face
and also go over any areas that i need
to cover if I still have some texture
and breakouts so there is the Aqua
stealer all rights to set everything in
this week i will be using my essence all
about matt fixing compact powder that
probably comes as absolutely no surprise
to you guys i love this stuff and it
really does keep me Matt so that is
what's that powder looks like cants
watch it because it's transparent I know
they're using a bronzer this week I
originally was going to use might artist
contour palette because I really wanted
to do like some nice contouring but then
I realized i had this wet and wild color
icon
answer sitting in my collection and its
really orangie and I don't really know
why I picked this up but I purchased it
so I should use it so this is the wet
and wild color icon bronzer with SPF 15
in the shade 739 ticket to Brazil it's
got a lot of shimmer in it and
definitely like a warm toned yellowy
orange color again I'm like why did I
get this again but i think if i apply
this with a really really fluffy brush i
could get this to work so i can use it
just to kind of warm up my face this
week so i won't be doing any contouring
but i will use that to warm up my
complexion and then for my blush this
week i'm just going to be using one and
it is one that i have been waiting to
get my hands on forever it is the
two-faced love blush long lasting
16-hour blush in the shade baby love so
i will just be using one blush this week
because like i said i've been trying to
get my hands on this forever and it
deserves to be the only one used this
week because I had such troubles trying
to get this so there is baby love
swatched and then as far as highlighting
is concerned I'm also using a little
product that I never reach for kind of
like that bronzer this is the Laura
Geller baked gelato swirl illuminator in
the shade peach glow so you probably
hear me talk about gilded honey and
charming pink all the time this is the
little triplet or the other sister this
is peach glow and it's beautiful but the
reason I don't reach for it as often is
because it definitely is darker than my
complexion but it's okay I'm all about
being bronzy right now and I think this
color is absolutely stunning so if it
doesn't look that great as like an
actual highlight on my skin I'll just
use it as a blush topper will play with
it and see how it goes but yeah that is
the gorgeous gorgeous shade right there
it is darker than my skin so technically
not really a highlighter but today i'm
wearing like a darker high lighter than
my skin tone on my face and i think it
still looks nice it makes it look at
your skin look a little more glowy not
so much like highlighted just like glowy
so yeah i'm gonna try and use that this
week for eyeshadow this week i did use
my lorac pro 3 eyeshadow palette last
week by the way and she's wiping off my
swatches i used my lorac pro 3 eyeshadow
palette last week so i will be going to
rug store this week so i really wanted
to play with some color this week and i
decided to pull out my NYX ultimate eye
shadow
pallet in the brights version which are
just really really bright awesome colors
this is what it looks like and I'm going
to be popping these on my lower lash
line or maybe on my lid I'm not quite
sure yet but I'll swatch a few of these
for you guys they're really beautiful
and very very pigmented so I thought
it'd be fun to play with some color I
haven't reached for this for a while so
there are a few of the swatches on the
back of my hand really beautiful bright
bold colors and because they are so
bright and bold I thought it would be
smart to kind of pair it with a more
neutral palette that has like a
transition shade blending shades so I
did pick out another drug store palette
this is the makeup revolution ultra
eyeshadow palette in the flawless Matt
version it's really big and this thing
is just filled with gorgeous like brow
bone and transition shade so I thought
this was about as neutral as it could
get and this will be really really nice
for blending in those bright colors so i
will be using that as well and I'll
swatch a few of these these are so
buttery and soft and amazing there are a
few of them they probably look like
nothing compared to those are really
bright eye shadows but I'm excited to
use them because I think they will
really blend out some of those colors
nicely so there they are on the back of
my hand alright let's talk about the lip
products because I have to lip parents
that I really want to try this week so
the first pairing is let's see here
these two nics products so the first is
the NYX soft matte lip cream in D shade
Istanbul i'll go ahead and swatch that
for you guys let me see if I can oh
freakin open that's not my hand is all
oily from the makeup remover the thing
is squeaking all right there we go sorry
so here is Istanbul and this is one of
their soft matte lip creams it's a
beautiful beautiful shade and I thought
okay that's really gorgeous but it's
kind of like a fall lip I want to play
up in color so I thought what can I do
to make that even more bold oh my god
this one do get open these things come
on I thought what can we do to kind of
make the lip color even more bold and I
thought you know what I could top it
with a bright coral lip gloss this is
the NYX butter gloss in the shade apple
strudel and i love the NYX butter gloss
formulations so here is what that lip
pair or lip duo looks like paired
together I just have that would be a
really nice
it's kind of summary lip but it's still
subtle especially if I'm going to be
wearing like bright eye shadows I don't
want it to be too in-your-face but I
thought that that would be pretty so
that is the first lip combo and then the
second slip combo is going to be this
Revlon balm stain paired with the
Smashbox gloss so this is the Revlon
just bitten kissable balm stain in the
shade rendezvous which is like a bright
orange and it's not as bright as it
looks it's more of like a balm stain so
it's kind of like a muted orange shade
right there and I'm going to top that
with the Smashbox gloss in the shade
corley Sakura line coraline or core lean
it's a good score line and this is just
a beautiful kind of peachy gloss and I
thought that these would be really
pretty paired together as well and yeah
so i'm going to have one kind of like
you know grapefruit I don't great fruit
what kind of watermelon grape fruity
looking color and then one kind of like
peachy apricot a color and I thought
they both look really glossy and pretty
and I like um I like the glossiness this
week I don't know I'm feeling that so
I'm going to be parried those together
to set all my makeup in i will be using
my ELF magic Matt I'm sorry Matt magic
mist and set and the reason I'm using
this is because i used the touch of
luminous dewy skin miss this week and i
just can't with this I mean my skin is
already super textured and oily this
week so I really want to see if I can
kind of you know use this and kind of
mattify everything if that makes sense
again this is the pre film video so
you're watching this the week before or
I'm filling this the week before you're
watching it that week but i will be
using that this particular product this
week does that make any sense just
forget about it going on the next two
items i will be using are some bright
eyeliners i thought these two urban
decay twenty-four/seven glide on eye
pencils would go nicely with the
eyeshadow palette the next one so the
first one is in delirious which is a
purple and I thought I could pop this on
my waterline it's a beautiful purple
shade with tons and tons of gold glitter
in it that is what it looks like and
then the green shade is called vacancy
and vacancy is actually more in what it
looks so much prettier when you swatch
it then when you look at it but this is
actually more of like a blue sheen kind
of color it's like a I don't know this
looks more green but this is more blue
and it has
tons and tons of silver sheen to it so
I'm excited for that and then the last
but not least no not last but not least
and third but not least i will be using
my own Nastasia Beverly Hills brow
pencil in you she blonde toe bunt dope
dope so this is what it looks like you
have a spoolie on one end and then the
pencil on the other I'll do a little
swatch it for you guys I don't love this
brow pencil it's a little dry but it's
okay so I need to use it so there it is
and it looks very warm in color don't
you think the taupe shellack color
should be like darker than that or like
a little more ashy toned very strange
anyway i'll be using that and then the
last two items i will be using arm a
little mascara peering that i'm super
excited for because I love big clumpy
crazy lashes I just do I like them to
the plague little spider legs I'm all
about that life I'm all about that
spider like life okay so the first one
I'm going to be using is the Smashbox
x-rated mascara and I got this in my
Ipsy bag last month or the month before
and I haven't used it yet it has a big
gloopy gloppy wet formula and I'm super
excited so I'm going to be using this as
the base mascara and then I will be
topping it with an even wetter darker
black or formula which is the what is
this miss manga rock mascara and this is
super gloopy gloppy too and you may be
like oh that's so disgusting but I'm
just like yes love it so I'm going to be
2 i'll carry those two together and that
is it guys so that is that my stash this
week i hope you guys enjoyed this video
and i guess we shall see how these
products look on my face tomorrow thank
you so much for joining me and i will
see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
