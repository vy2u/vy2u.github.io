welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the products
that i am wearing on my face right now
and also the products i will be using
this week so let's go ahead and get
started the first item i will be using
is the emit a makeup diamond tart based
primer illuminating in the soft focus
version i will be doing a video next
week dedicated to rediscovered makeup
items and this is definitely one of them
it's a beautiful beautiful product and i
can't wait to use it on my face all
right as far as I primers are concerned
because we are kind of going with the
illuminating soft focus thing I thought
my Maybelline master prime long-lasting
eyeshadow based in 5-10 would be the
perfect match for this week I have used
this quite a few times in the past
couple weeks I really love it but for my
base this week i will be using two
different foundations so right now i
have on the covergirl clean massive BB
cream for oily skin and i am wearing
this because i just did a first
impressions on this you guys will see
the first impressions tomorrow but
anyway i will be interchanging that out
with the Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid
makeup this week so in the covergirl i'm
in the shade 510 fair and in the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin my shade is
classic ivory so I'm excited to try
these two outs I already know that I
like this one quite a bit it is a little
darker for my skin tone but I'm self
tanned right now and this one I am
liking so far so I'm excited to have
those this week this one definitely
gives a little bit less coverage than
this one so yeah I thought I would
interchange those out for concealing i
will be using my new to face born this
way naturally radiant concealer
underneath my eyes my shade is very fair
and i'll go ahead and swatch that for
you guys it's just a beautiful beautiful
color match for me and i don't really
like it for camouflaging pimples and
things like that maybe i'll try it that
way this week but i do like it
underneath the eyes so that is how i
will personally be wearing this and then
as far as camouflaging pimples goes i
will be using my becca ultimate coverage
cream what is this ultimate coverage
concealing creme in the shade greatly
i'm gonna see if i can open it there it
is right here and this is just a really
really thick kind of concealer and i
will be using that on my acne scarring
and also on any sort of active pimples
to set
in i will be using my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder which looks
like that I'm almost done with this
little guy we'll see if you can make it
into this month empties video my brows
this week i will be using the studio 10
perfecting liner brow one side is the
brow lift which is like a highlight
which is right there and then the other
side has like a topi brow pencil and i
will be using that to fill in my brows
this week I've been having really really
sparse brows lately so I thought it
would be a good idea to go ahead and use
a pencil so I can really really build up
little you know hair fibers if I need
them and then I will be setting those in
with my Milani brow shaping clear wax
and that's just because it's really hot
right now and I want to make sure that
nothing is moving around on at my face
alright let's talk about mascara this
week i will be using the tart like
scammer splashes waterproof mascara i do
have this on right now and i'm not quite
sure about this i just don't really feel
like it gave a lot of definition to my
lashes i think it looks okay but two
layers of this didn't really build very
well so we shall see about that this
week as far as a blush is concerns i
will be using the mac sheer tone blush
in the shade Sun bath which looks like
this and although I'm not a huge fan of
the mac brand in general I do you think
that they have beautiful blushes so here
is Sun Basque it's just a beautiful kind
of golden II dark reddish color super
gorgeous and that is the one that I have
on my cheeks today if you are curious
and then I also will be using one of my
new Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes from
blush brushes 12-hour blushes from Tarte
and this is in the shade seduce this is
part of their new and Dottie nudes
collection and I'm very excited for this
this is a beautiful beautiful kind of
nudie color so there is seduced so those
are the two blushes I will be wearing
this week as far as highlight is
concerned i will be using my new it's
hard to highlight and it is in the
exposure which is absolutely stunning it
gives just the most beautiful glow i
just applied it with a fan brush today
and its really really natural and pretty
but you can build this up quite a bit by
using like a tapered highlighter brush
oh my god is so silky and soft and
gorgeous and there it is swatched on the
back
my hand so that isn't highlights i will
be using to set everything in this week
i will be using my tasha luminous dewy
skin missed again not a huge fan of s
not a fan of the ingredients there's
really not that many good ingredients in
this product a lot of people think there
are but it's actually it's actually this
this is filled with alcohol which is
weird because I'm supposed to give you a
dually effect on your skin but because i
am using a lot of illuminating products
this week i thought it would be nice to
set in my makeup with this and i am
trying to use it up so i will be using
that to set everything in and as far as
eyeshadow is concerned this week i will
be using my two-faced two-faced yes
two-faced I was like wait a minute that
right yes Tuesday's peanut bed today
think of every day peanut butter jelly
yes so here it is I love this little
palette it's so cute smells amazing and
I just thought this would be fun since I
am doing some like needy sort of blushes
this week I thought I could do some nice
warm toned I they do have it on today
and I just love this palette here's a
few squatches for you guys it just goes
on so nicely i love the shades in here
so nice and warm perfect for summertime
there are a few of the shades swatch
those three we're spread love peanut
butter and peanut butter cup yes alright
so i will be using that and then as far
as lips and eyeliner is concerned for
eyeliner i will be using my next slide
on glide on stay on indefinitely a turn
on eyeliner insatiate golden bronze
which looks like this this is one of the
prettiest colors ever seriously i have
it on my waterline today and I'm just
like why are you so beautiful why are
you so beautiful there it is swatched on
the back of my hand isn't that core just
really pretty if you do have blue eyes I
feel like it really makes your eyes pop
like really really problems all right ed
from lip products this week I will be
moisturizing my lips who's my fun top
fun to Todd and don't you on that
one not up my font ellipse mapper
in the grape soda version and then I
believe
thing to Matt lippies this week so the
one that I have on my lips right now is
the Lime Crime felt lik Velveteen a
little electrol the teen in the shade
riot and this is just a beautiful
beautiful like perfect your lips a
better sort of ready color aight like i
said i have it on right now so there is
riot isn't it beautiful oh god yes yes
yes yes and then i will also be using my
Urban Decay Matt revolution lipstick in
the shade in 1993 baybay there it is so
kind of brownie and then this one's a
little more pinky so those are the two
lippies that I will be wearing this week
and then I will be topping them the
reason why it looks glossy on my lips
right now because I do want to top them
with my new to face lip injection
Juicy's so these are supposed to be
basically lip injections but they have
will not lip injection you guys know
what I made their the lip injection
formulation but they have a little bit
of color to them so today I have riots
topped with this shade right here which
is called babe alert there is babe alert
I thought it would give it a little bit
more of a warm quality and then when I
where the mat revolution which is in the
shade 1993 I'm going to be topping it
with the shade milkshake and here is
milk shakes so there is milk shake and
then there is sorry that was it I don't
know what there is no jig and then there
is 1993 so really really excited to pair
those together I do like the feeling of
these two face products although they do
not have that much pigmentation I do
like the way that they plump up my lip
so I'm excited for those and that it's a
guys those are all of the makeup
products that i will be using this week
thank you so much for joining me and i
will see you guys tomorrow for that
