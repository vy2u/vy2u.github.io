happy Monday and welcome back to shop
and swatch my stash where I have some
swatches to share with you guys where
I'm basically showing you guys the
products that i will be using this week
and the products that are already on my
face currently so let's go ahead and get
started and they first two items i will
be using are my primers for the week so
the first is the benefit stay don't
stray light / medium I primer and then I
also will be using my Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer in the lite
version i will be doing some color
correcting this week and i decided to
reach for my becca backlight targeted
color correctors in three different
shades so the first one that i wanted to
reach for is called papaya which is like
a reddish orange color it's like a very
juicy like papaya looking color there it
is and I do have that swatched right
there the second shade that i will be
using it from the becca backlight
targeted corrector is let's see here the
violet shade from the formulation there
is the violet shade and I have that
swatched right there and then the last
one i will be using is called pistachio
which is like a mint green color and
that will cancel out redness obviously
and this is the statio so i'm super
excited to use those i've not used these
for a while so there is the statio
papaya we have violet and then pistachio
I'm very excited to play with those I
want to see how they pair with the
foundation that i'm using this week i
have a feeling that they're going to go
really well together so yeah all right
speaking of that foundation i will be
using the laura mercier candle blow
softly luminous foundation this week and
the shade that I have is shell and i'll
go ahead and do a pump of that on the
back of my hand so you guys can see it
is basically a water or serum foundation
so it blends really easily on the skin
and it's a very very very lightweight so
there is the count of glow soft focus
luminous foundation and shout and then i
will be also using a concealer if I need
to just because some of the color
correctors are a little more pigmented
and because that foundation is so like I
just want to make sure that I you know
cover up all of the color so i will be
using my Maybelline master conceal by
face studio camouflaging concealer in
the shade number 10 fair and i won't
swatch this because you guys have seen
the swatch so many times
swatch my stash I use that a lot i love
it i will also be using my L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte 16 our powder in
the shade let's see here it doesn't say
Oh translucent and this is what it looks
like i will be using this to set in my
makeup this week and then i will also be
doing the buffing tech the list the
buffing technique using my bye bye pores
poreless finish airbrush powder from it
cosmetics i was going to save Real
Techniques know it cosmetics and this is
a brand new one like the packaging is so
nice and smooth and like yes all right
let's talk about some lip colors that i
will be using this week so i will be
using basically liquid lipsticks and i
am wearing one right now it feels
slightly uncomfortable but i'm trying to
get back into my liquid lipsticks so the
first one i will be using is the mix
let's see here liquid suede in the shade
passion rose and i have this on my lips
right now and i do have its watch for
you guys right there i want you guys to
be able to see how it dries down and i
also will be using my Kat Von D um what
is this everlasting whatever ya ever
lasting liquid lipstick in the shade
suspiria which is a beautiful kind of
purple color and I have that swatched
right there and it is completely dry
down so those are the colors that i will
be wearing on my lips this week and then
to moisturize them i will be using the
Maybelline Baby Lips sunscreen SPF 20
lip balm alright moving on i will be
using quite a few mascaras this week so
i will be starting things off with my
Urban Decay subversion thicker longer
stronger lash primer and then I will be
going in with thee emotion allowed
motion yeah emotional loud I co not me
Lana mascara I got this in my glossybox
and it just has a really really basic
kind of wand natural bristle that is
what it looks like and I thought that I
would wear that as the base mascara and
then top that with the laura mercier
extra lash sculpting mascara in black
onyx and i love the wand on this it's
huge it's really pokey but it is a
rubber bristle wand and it gives me a
lot of definition and volume and length
and darkness to my lashes so i love that
let's see here as far as browser
concerned this week i will be using my
Maybelline brow drama pomade cran in
that blonde or taupe shade that I use
pretty much every week and then to set
that in i will be using the brow gel by
Tanya crooks I think I got this in at my
boxy charm this month that is what it
looks like so I thought we'd try it out
to set everything in this week i will be
using my elf makeup mist insecta this is
just the original one with the a lo
green tea cucumber and vitamins a c and
e formula i don't know if they have
those actual ingredients in there but
this does help make the makeup stay on
my face all day and then for eyeliner i
will be using my Sephora crayon I cran
and this is in the shade black and it's
pretty much a used up I really wanted to
get through this i cants watch a few
guys because I just realized hello it
needs to be sharpened but this is a
beautiful eyeliner and it goes on really
really pigmented on to the waterline
from what i remember it does kind of
tend to get into like the tear duct area
and things like that but we shall see
hopefully that won't happen this week
and as far as a blush is concerned i
will be using my Tartus clay blush
palette which looks like this and we
have just a nice selection of gorgeous
colors in here i am wearing this shape
right now on my cheeks it's called live
and i'll just go ahead and do some
squatches for your eyes on those so
those are just like a little quick one
finger swatches really really beautiful
i'm excited to play with that and i love
at that palette i already know i love it
so and that'll be fun to use and then
for highlighting this week i will be
using another palette this is the violet
boss pro highlighting powders college
you have moodley min here's starglo and
unicorn luster I do have moon gleam on
right now the shade right here but these
are just really really nice kind of
foiled pigmented absolutely gorgeous
gorgeous highlighters so I'll do some
swatches for you guys on those as well
there they are really beautiful right
and you can use the others if you are
fair complected like i am you can use
the other two that are darker you can
use that you know for bronzing up your
face like as a blush tapper alright and
then the last thing that i will be using
this week is a drugstore eyeshadow
palettes because they did use a high-end
one last week and this is the elf
palette and literally there is no name
on here let me show you guys there's
just this little sticker and I do not
remember I saw this
like I see this once in a while on the
elf com website but I don't know you
guys I don't know what this is called
but it's beautiful they have some really
gorgeous shades in here some of them
feel really really soft and buttery
almost foiled like this green shade here
that I have all over my lid and this one
that I have in my crease they're just
really really beautiful and then you do
have some nice soft mass as well so let
me show you some swatches these are
really beautiful if anybody knows the
name of this palette let us know down
below so there are some swatches really
beautiful kind of neutral to kind of
play around in like the purple e
Lavender Town which i think is really
really pretty so anyway those are all of
the products that i will be using this
