thank you so much for joining me I hope
you all had a wonderful wonderful monday
i am filming this when i get home from
work i am really high for today I don't
know what's happening so if you cannot
handle this energy you might want to
click out of the video anyway I had a
really good day today and I am kind of
doing a lot of like filming when i get
home this week you guys are going to be
seeing some late night upload so i
technically have a decision so i got
used to for a box in today that i
totally forgot about I'm literally
ordered from them maybe like a week and
a half ago and the box just never came
and for some reason I just never checked
on it when I forgot about it basically
and it turns out that they put it in our
mailbox instead of having like the girls
bring it up we have people in our
building that bring our boxes up so they
left it in our mailbox so I went to have
today to check the veil out of course
there was the Sephora box and I was like
well I need to do a support halt now
like this whole week I will be putting
up videos pretty late in the day
hopefully this is getting up by eight or
nine p.m. but yesterday my fails and
holy grails can go live until like 11 30
or 12 a.m. and that's just because I'm
so busy i'm not able to film in the
morning this week um but what i was
thinking of doing come on Olivia wrap it
up what I was thinking of doing is
basically a pre filming like the Sephora
haul tonight so that it can go live
tomorrow at 6am and then tomorrow I
could film the next day's video so
everything would go live at 6am but I
can't promise anything so either you
will see the Sephora haul at 6am
tomorrow or you will see it at like 12am
one of the two anyway let's go ahead and
get into today's video we are of course
shopping and so watching my stash so if
you are curious as to the makeup that
I'm wearing today or the makeup that I
will be wearing all week I'm gonna share
it with you guys right now so let's go
ahead and get started so for primers
this week I am going to be using this
eye primer right here this is the
benefit Air Patrol baby eyelid primer I
really love this product it has a really
nice soft silicone like tip and it just
has a beautiful yellow correcting sort
of I base it's very very moisturizing
and nice on the skin I'm not going to
swatch it because it can't really be
swatched but it's a lovely I base and
I'm excited to use that
then for my face primer i am using it
this product right here which is in my
finished seven by fall and this is the
Beca backlight priming filter and like i
said i have this in a project pan video
right now it's just a beautiful
beautiful really really yummy smelling
primer that gives a lot of glow to the
skin so I'm excited to use those um as
far as my base is concerned this week i
will be using confirm concerned i will
be using my bare minerals complexion
rescue tinted hydrating gel cream with
broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen my shade
is zln elbow so let me watch it to
madness portrait for you guys i'm sorry
i know i'm really hyper i apologize
alright so if it can just come out a
little bit there we go this is what it
looks like this is the shade opal 01 it
has a little bit of a pinky undertone
but it really blends nicely into my skin
and I have been self tanning recently
i'm not really like building up the
color i've been using the Jergens
natural glow i'm in the lightest shade
for like fair to light skin tones I'm
not really building it up I've just been
using it like once or twice a week and
I've been maintaining a nice sort of
glow I don't know if you guys can see
through the camera probably not but I
swear I've been glowing a little bit so
this is blending into my skin at
relatively well I'm excited to use it
and again this is an item that is in my
current project pan another item that is
in at my current project pan that i will
be using is the l'oreal visible lift
blur concealer in the shade 301 fair i
love the consistency of this i only have
a tiny little bit left so i'm not going
to swatch it but it's beautiful it has a
super satiny luxurious hydrating feel to
it and it looks absolutely stunning on
the skin so you guys will probably see
that as a holy royal at the end of the
week another item that is also in the
project pan I'm just trying to get a
head start okay this is the dandelion
shy beam from benefit i have been using
this to color correct underneath my eyes
and on my eyelids and that is what i
will be doing this week it just comes
out like this and then the actual color
is just a beautiful peachy pink shade
and it is technically a matte highlight
i just like to use it to highlight my
face like on top of my family
asian and that is what it looks like so
I'm excited to play around with that
this week and 47 in my base i will be
using my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
16-hour powder this is new to me it
gives a demi matte finish and this is in
it the lightest shade so i will be using
that to set in my foundation or my
tinted gel cream this is like barely
anything okay this has like no coverage
to it I'm wearing one layer but today on
my face and the concealer definitely
helped to kind of spot treat or you know
like conceal some of the big like
pimples that I have right now which are
just from hormonal breakouts but I will
be going in on top of that powder with a
powder foundation just in case I need a
little extra coverage because this
literally has the coverage of like a
tinted moisturizer if that ok really
really light coverage so i will be using
my tarts confidence creamy powder
foundation in the shade of fair neutral
and today i just use that in areas where
i needed the extra coverage like on my
cheek like bone area not my cheekbone
miss my cheekbone on my jawline area and
on my t-zone and around my nose and
things like that and this is a beautiful
powder foundation I really really like
it as you guys can see right now it is
probably two or three shades lighter
than my skin tone but normally it
doesn't match quite well but there it is
and yeah I'll just be using that to kind
of cover up in spot conceal extra areas
that need the coverage all right for
blush this week I actually will be using
bronzer I don't know if you guys can
tell today I just have bronzer on my
cheeks I've been like dreaming and
daydreaming about like having really
really bronze beautiful cheeks with like
a really nice gold highlight so i'll be
using my lorac take me to tan tango
palette I love this I have a mixture of
tan Antonio and tan diego on my cheeks
right now and the top two are Matt and
then the bottom to have shimmer in them
I just realize have a huge booger in my
nose like looking at that hope you guys
can't see that but anyway the top do you
are mad to the bottom two are shimmer
and they're so creamy and luxurious and
beautiful and I just thought it would be
nice to kind of switch it up instead of
wearing pink or coral or whatever on my
cheeks I could just wear some nice
bronzy bronzers
pretty much I don't know why I was
thinking of that I just thought okay
that would be really really pretty so
anyway that is what I will be doing and
I really like this palette because it
has all sorts of different bronzer sort
of shades in here so you really can make
up your whole entire face or you can use
it just to bronze up your cheeks like I
did today and I like the glow that I'm
getting now so really really enjoying
that so far and I'm sure that that would
be a Holy Grail at the end of the week
and then I also will be using my Josie
Maran sorry just our get enlightenment
in luminizing veil this is what it looks
like it's so beautiful i love this
highlight it's a very very subtle
highlight if you are a very very pale
girl like me and you really want to be
like looking like you're dripping in
gold this is your kind of highlight this
is what you need it does have liked
larger flicks of glitter in here but if
absolutely stunning it's just this
really nice light tan topi gold color
and it's so beautiful on the skin I have
it down the bridge of my nose today on
my chin on my cheekbones let's see how
it's looking after like 10 hours of
where I think it still lost valid oh my
god it's looking pretty the bronzer is
breaking up a little bit around my
cheeks but the highlight is still on
fleek okay it's still pretty alright I'm
going on for eyeshadow this week I'm so
excited I'm gonna be playing with my new
lorac pro 3 palette I did a review and
swatches on this already dirty it's art
be dirty but I really love this it's
just gorgeous gorgeous eyeshadows in
here as you guys can see and today i
just used two shades i used terracotta
in my crease and on my lid on my lower
lash line and then I blended it out with
pink nude and i also used some blanc so
technically three shades but really
really fast I look I love the shades in
here you just got some gorgeous gorgeous
neutral mid-tone shades with lots and
lots of taupe undertones so I'm super
excited to play the cat this week for
lips on my lips right now is the two
face melted liquefied long wear lipstick
in melted peony which is just a
beautiful light pink shade I love this
shade I feel like it's a universal color
it looks gorgeous on literally everyone
I feel like honestly so there is melted
peony that is what I have on my lips
right now and then I also chose out
revlon super lustrous lipstick which is
my favorite formulation from the
drugstore and the shape that i chose is
gentlemen prefer pink oh god it has hair
on it oh look there we go it is so
beautiful it's kind of similar to melted
beanie but definitely more cool toned
pink you know why I should know it's not
similar at all it's a cool tone fig and
it has like tons and tons of silver
iridescent stew it is so freaking
gorgeous you guys this color is amazing
so there is gentlemen prefer pink from
Revlon and then we have and then we hate
you and then we have melted via me right
there come to base all right I need to
wrap this video up I'm too hyper I
probably shouldn't film that so for all
tonight I'll just end up doing it
tomorrow and then let's see here there
are a few items that I have had in my
drawer that I've wanted to use up for a
while now so the first is this
bareMinerals well-rested face and eye
brightener I didn't really use this last
week or the week before even though I
pulled it I don't know I'm gonna try and
use it this week we'll see what happens
and I've been using my Maybelline brow
drama cran pomade for weeks now I'm not
going to switch that up for my brows
this week that will be the same and then
the blistex deeper newell lip balm this
has just been going on forever like
literally please can you just end can
you just be finished so i'm going to see
if i can finish that up this week or
next week or maybe in like ten years i
don't know we'll see how it goes and
let's see here oh the final item is my
eyeliner for the week i will be using my
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil in
the shade of faint and this is a
beautiful matte taupe e color and I was
just like um this is going to look
perfect with that lorac palette so there
it is and I'm going to wear that on my
waterline and on my timeline alright
guys and that is everything that is not
everything there are three more items
the first is my setting spray i will be
using mytouch a luminous dewy skin mess
I'm trying to finish this up this has
been in my shop my stash videos for the
past couple of weeks I don't really like
this I don't I liked it when I first got
it now i don't so i really want to try
and use that up this week or next week
then for mascara i will be using let's
see here my lancome base which looks
like this I'm just trying out a few
different bases honestly I I only like
my Urban Decay subversion lash primer
that's the only lash primer I really
like this one honestly didn't really
work very well today either it's
probably gonna be a fail at the end of
the week but I had it laying around so I
mean is that pair it with my covergirl
super sizer fibers mascara which I will
be hopefully reviewing for you guys soon
and that just looks like this here is
the wand it is identical to the original
