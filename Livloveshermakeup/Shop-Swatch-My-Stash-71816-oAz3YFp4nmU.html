welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products that i have on my face
currently and the ones that i will be
using this week so anyway I don't have
all of the makeup items on my face right
now I will walk you guys through as I go
through them and swatch them I'll let
you know what I am wearing I don't have
too much makeup on right now because I
woke up very very early and I did five
minute makeup but i want to say really
quickly they are drilling and hammering
upstairs in the condo above us so if you
do hear that I'm sorry I apologize there
was absolutely nothing I can do about
that unfortunately but yeah it is what
it is so let's go ahead and get started
alright the first two items that i will
be using this week are my primers i will
be using the l'oreal magic decrease
eyelid primer in the shade 895 which has
a little bit of like a yellow tone to it
which is nice for color correcting and
then as my face primer i will be using
the hourglass ambient light diffusing a
primer I'm sorry that's not what it's
called like correcting primer in the
shade luminous light so this is what it
looks like and I'm super excited for
both of these I did not put these on
today because I was in a hurry and
nobody ain't nobody got time for primer
when you're in a hurry but here is what
they look like this is the eyelid primer
and then this is the face primer and the
peace primer is really nice and it's
very nice if you do have combo or oily
skin and you want a little bit of a glow
on your skin it does sink in really
really really like freakishly fast which
i think is awesome so I'm very very
excited to try those out I will be color
correcting this week and i will be using
my smashbox color correcting sticks i
have all four of them doesn't mean I'm
going to use all four every single day
but i'm going to use different colors
for different kind of things that i need
to conceal or just to color correct so
anyway you guys will be seen these in a
video later this week also called
rediscovered makeup items i have found a
lot of products lately that are kind of
rediscovered that i've been enjoying so
i will be showing these as well so the
first shade we have here is a nice
peachy color this is called don't be
dull light I'm sorry yes look less tired
light that is what it looks like and
this is nice for color correcting any
sort of hyperpigmentation you have on
your face or if you did get like some
sleep but not too much sleep you can use
that to correct underneath your
eyes and then this one is probably the
one i will use for dark circles this
shade right here is called look less
tired dark which is like a true kind of
orange cream color and then the next
shade is called look less red or gets
less red and this is a beautiful minty
green color i will use this on any areas
where i have some breakouts or just
redness in general and then the last one
is called don't be dull and this is the
lavender brightening shade and i really
like this for days where i'm super tired
like today i wish i could have used this
or i should have and i just like to put
this to kind of brighten up any dull
area in areas any sullenness and my skin
areas that are kind of yellow and what
kind of crappy i like to use that color
so those are the four color correctors i
will be using this week I do have a base
that I'm very excited about I do love
this product a lot that this is the
tarts of BB Amazonian clay tinted
moisturizer I have two layers of this on
my skin right now I think it looks
really really beautiful this does have
broad spectrum SPF 20 in it and my shade
is ivory so this is a little lighter
than my skin oh right now I do have to
add two shades to full coats of self
tanner on currently wow I just squirted
out a lot I'm and kissed it is now
because of course I wanted to use that
on my face but a lot came out at once
but this is what it looks like it is a
little lighter than my skin because they
do have some self tanner on right now
but it really can be built up and
probably it has the most coverage out of
any sort of tinted moisturizer I've ever
used so i really like it and then i will
be using a concealer this is the Too
Faced Born This Way naturally radiant
concealer in the shade very fair and i
will be using this underneath my eyes
after i do put on they tinted
moisturizer and that is what the shade
looks like it's a really really nice
color match for me it is a little light
right now because again i am self tan
but when i'm not a self and it's a
really really nice shade match so there
it is blended into my skin very very
pretty really do like that concealer
alright i'm moving on i will be setting
in my
powder with my L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte 16-hour powder in the shade 100
porcelain I have been using this the
past couple of weeks and I recently did
purchase a new one and then I will be
dusting over my face with a little bit
of the it cosmetics / pores that this is
the poreless finished airbrush powder in
the shade translucent just to give a
nice finished look to the face alright
moving on I will be contouring and
highlighting with my wet and wild color
icon contouring palette in the shade 75
a caramel toffee this is the old one so
it has the cool toned ashy powder and
then the cream highlights these are
really soft and buttery and they really
go onto the skin nicely so that is what
they look like really really beautiful I
do like these a lot so there we have the
contouring shade and then there is the
highlighting shade and those i will be
using this week obviously to contour and
highlight my taste i do have two blushes
that i'm very excited to use this week
the first is the palladium at blush in
the shade toasted apricot it looks like
this and i do have this on my cheeks
right now it's a beautiful warm toasty
kind of apricot color and here is what
it looks likes to watch i really love
these palladio blushes they are like
three or four dollars at Ulta really
really well worth the price in my
opinion and I also will be using the
hourglass ambient lighting blush in the
shade diffused heat which is really
beautiful it really does look like you
just went out for a run or something
like that when you're wearing this so
that is what the actual product looks
like and when you swatch it it goes on
really really nicely and has a little
bit of like a peachy horley color to it
so there is the Palais do and there is
the hourglass moving on i will be using
to eyeliners this week i'm quite excited
about they're actually technically
shadow sticks but i like to use them as
eyeliners the first is the jelly pong
pong two and one eyeliner in shadow and
this is what the actual color is it
doesn't have an actual color name but
this is what it looks like you guys have
seen this before and shop and swatch my
stash I really like this it's a
beautiful kind of plummy color and I
like to Rio that on my waterline and
then I have another one here from the
band brand Sunita yes to need to beauty
and this is the
champagne eyeshadow pencil again i will
be using it on my waterline it's just so
pretty and it's going to go really
nicely with the actual palette that i
will be using this week so here is the
jelly pong pong and here is the samhita
beauty and I really liked us to meet two
one because it's got a really really
nice amount of Sheen to it alright
moving on I have two mascaras that I
will be layering at this week the first
is the Maybelline lash discovery mini
brush mascara so this is what it looks
like and the actual brush is so tiny and
dainty very easy to get into those tiny
little areas or those short little
lashes around the inner corner of your
eye or on the outer part of your eye and
then I will be going in with my Urban
Decay perversion mascara which I also
really really adore and this has a
really nice big fluffy brush and it does
have a very kinky and wet formulation to
it so I'm excited to use those to this
week let's see here what else I have an
eyeshadow palette I'm last week i used a
high-end eyeshadow palette so this week
i will be using a more affordable option
this is the Coastal Scents revealed to
eyeshadow palette it is absolutely
stunning and beautiful I do prefer this
over the naked palettes which is why i
went ahead and decluttered my naked
palette and not this one but there's
some gorgeous rosy tones in here and I
thought they would go really really
nicely with those beautiful beautiful um
eyeliners that I showed you guys so here
are just a few swatches right there and
I'll swatch a few more on the other side
really really beautiful kind of cool
toned pinky colors you have some nice
warm colors as well they're all ultra
ultra pigmented and they are quite easy
to blend so I really really do like this
eyeshadow palette I know some people are
like no the naked palettes are way
better but in my experience I like this
a lot more than the naked 3 and I do
think it has quite a few color dupes in
it alright moving on the next item that
i will be using is my highlighting
palette i will be using the glow kids
from anastacio beverly hills in this
sweets version and that is what i have
on as my highlights today if you guys
are curious so this is what these sweets
glow kit looks like and today i have
taffie layered with marshmallow so
here's taffy and here's marshmallow
they're both very very beautiful taffy
is a gorgeous kind of rose gold color
and marshmallow is a beautiful white
color with gold iridescent running
through it so there is marshmallow and
there is taffy and then we have
butterscotch and also sassy grapes sassy
grape is so cool it's just a beautiful
kind of purply color and then
butterscotch is a beautiful warm cold so
there are all four of these swatches for
the anastacio Beverly Hills sweets glow
kit I'm very excited to use that I
really am impressed with the glow kids
from aa Nastasia Beverly Hills
especially this one so very very excited
to use that I do have let's see here a I
thought I had more than one brow product
I was going to use this week I do but I
can't find the other one so the first is
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills perfect
brow pencil in the shade taupe which
looks like this and then I will be
topping that with the BH Cosmetics
what's it called brow gel in the shade
blonde and then as far as lips are
concerned this week the last couple
products i will be using are the Oprah
Manny lip collaborations so the first
shade right here is called charmed and
these are liquid lipsticks but they're
very very comfortable to wear so there
is charmed and then I also will be
wearing Ares which is the one that I
have on my lips right now and then I
will be topping them with lip oils and I
did do that today and I really like the
way they look so here is the shade
charmed I'm sorry Aries and then there
is charmed and then I will be tapping
them with these little lip oils that i
got from physicians formula i'm not
going to swatch them they barely have
any color to them but this shade right
here is called pink and then this one is
called liquid gold so anyway these are
very very comfortable to wear and they
just make any sort of lipstick or liquid
lipstick feel a lot more comfortable on
the lips and I did notice today they
didn't really make any of my liquid
lipstick break up which is really really
nice to know so anyway I think that is
everything yes that is everything that i
will be using on my face this week thank
you so much for joining me and i will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
