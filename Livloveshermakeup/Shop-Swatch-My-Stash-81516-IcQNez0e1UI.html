welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products that i currently have on my
face right now and also the products
that i will be using all this week so
let's go ahead and get started they live
products that i will be using this week
it's from why a salad this is the vac
neon live or pop water glossy stain in
the shade 201 do we read this is what it
looks like i absolutely adore this
product i already know that this is
definitely going to be a holy grail at
the end of the week my only issue with
this particular product is that it does
start to fall up on the lips a little
bit but that is what it looks like it is
just a glossy kind of product that does
turn into a stain after a while so I'm
super excited to try that out or to use
that this week the next item i will be
using is the cella tantalizing taupe
eyebrow color this is a taupe eyebrow
pencil and like i said i am wearing
these products today and when I was
putting this on I noticed that I really
liked this product it reminds me a lot
of the it cosmetics that little precise
like um one color fits all sort of
eyebrow pencil I really do like this so
anyway that is what it looks like it
does have a little more of a warm tone
than like a topi tone but i think it is
quite nice as far as primers are
concerned i will be using my NYC City
proof 24 hour I primer for my eyes this
week this is getting a little bit dried
out so hopefully that will um you know
stick with me for the next couple of
days so that it doesn't completely dry
out I hate when that product like
happens you know with primers especially
um and for my I guess I could call this
like color correcting and also
concealing i will be using my dandelion
shy beam from benefit to this is a
liquid highlight and it's actually
completely matte so it's kind of like a
peachy color and i put this on today
over my foundation and i just put it on
the areas that i wanted to highlight and
also kind of cancel out blue tones so
this is what it looks like it is right
there just really really beautiful and i
am very very excited to use that this
week and that is an item but i'm trying
to use up before September first so
hopefully I can do that as far as
eyeliner is concerned i will be using my
smashbox i'll be sharp waterproof kohl
liner initiate sumatra it's just a
beautiful dark chocolaty espresso brown
and it is a like
wake up or not a click up but it's like
a retractable I pencil I love this and
it we're so so so beautifully on the
water line so that is what I will be
wearing and you guys can see that that
stayed there but that is what I will be
wearing on my waterline or just for my
eyeliner this week as far as blush and
highlight is concerned i will be using
my becca jaclyn hill champagne
collection face palette today i have on
the shade amaretto which is right here I
have that honest my blush and then I
used Prosecco pop to highlight on my
cheekbones and also down the bridge of
my nose and on my chin I think this is a
beautiful beautiful palette you get
three blushes in here two of them are
Matt and then you get Prosecco pop and
champagne pop let me do some swatches
for you guys so here are the two
highlighter so this one is Prosecco pop
this one is champagne pop so champagne
pop has more of a peachy undertone as
you guys can see and then Prosecco pop
is more of like a true golden kind of
yellowy undertone and then the blushes
we have Pomplamoose which is like a
gorgeous kind of grapefruit color which
that is what it's called and then we
have amaretto which is more like a kinky
bronzy color and then we have rose ace
press which is one of their luminous
blushes which is really beautiful as
well so here those are there we have
pomplamoose then we have amaretto sorry
those kind of bad swatches and then we
have Rosie spirits so really really
excited to use those this week I do
already know that I do you know really
really like that particular palette so
very excited to be using that as far as
foundation is concerned this week i will
be using the l'oreal visible lift blur
foundation this has opted to blur
technology and my shade is 201 light
ivory this is what it looks like and i
will be pairing that with this
particular primer this is the it
cosmetics number 50 serum collagen veil
anti-aging primer and this is what it
looks like and i'm not quite sure if
this particular primer is going to hold
up well with this this does not stay on
the skin very long but it gives a
beautiful finish so we shall see how the
two of those do together and then for
eyeshadow this week i will be using my
Kat Von D serpentina eyes shadow palette
which looks like this it's just got a
lot of gorgeous gorgeous colors as you
guys can see and I will do some swatches
here we have a matte red called blue
what is it blood milk yes blood milk
here we have scarab we have venom just
some beautiful beautiful kind of cool
tones oh my god I'm dropping things
anyway they're just some beautiful
beautiful kind of jewel tones so we have
a nice mixture of matte colors we have
some shimmers and what happened there
try to put it over the eyeliner swatch
let me redo that let me go ahead and
write so bad anyway there is that purple
shade which is really really beautiful
so very very excited to use those and
now because those are all very much a
jewel toned and you don't really have
any matte colors or transition colors I
will be pulling in my Urban Decay Naked
basics palette which is just a very
basic level eyeshadow palette this is
what it looks like I'm sure you guys
have seen this before it's really great
for those eyeshadow palettes that you
just don't really you know you don't
have like a brow bone color transition
this is perfect so you have a lot of
nice little colors in here and this one
tends to lean a little more on the warm
side whereas the Naked basics palette
tends to leave a little more on the cool
town side all rights I also will be
using this particular products kind of
is like a primer as well this is the
steel icici color correcting cream it
has broad spectrum SPF 20 in it and my
shade is fair 01 now this comes out
completely like color correcting as you
would think it's kind of like gray it's
got a little bit of purple and blue and
yellow in there and once you do
completely rub it into your skin it just
kind of blends in perfectly my only I
guess concerns so far is just the fact
that it doesn't have a lot of coverage
so i think i'll be using that more as a
primer than an actual like concealer or
not concealer but like foundation you
guys know what i mean because originally
what i wanted to do was pull in these
stila and then also pull Annie L'Oreal
and kind of go between the two of these
but today I ended up layering the two of
these because I just wasn't getting the
coverage that I wanted all rights for
mascara this week i will be using the
Urban Decay perversion mascara which
looks like this it has a natural bristle
wand which is really really nice it has
a very very slick wet formulas you do
need to be careful especially during the
summertime so that it's not smearing all
over your eyes but I'm excited to use
that in that i will also be using one of
my all-time favorite mascaras which is
the sephora outrageous curl dramatic
volume in carle mascara it's got this
amazing tiny little rubber bristle wand
and
it's just me mmm that was just one of my
favorites oh my god i filmed a video
earlier and i felt like i was going to
like burp on camera kind of what I feel
like right now anyway the next item i
will be using is this little tony acrux
this is the brown cow water-resistant
eyebrow gel i've been using this for a
couple weeks now i really really love
this product so this is what it looks
like it goes i'm completely clear and it
really is like glue for your eyebrows so
I sounds really cool I've enjoyed that I
also will be using my it cosmetics bye
bye pores um loose finish translucent
powder as well as my L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte 16-hour powder in the shade
porcelain so i'll be using this to set
in my makeup and then this will be kind
of like a double set or finishing powder
and then i also will be using my elf
makeup mist and set this is just the
original version it has green tea
cucumbers and vitamin cucumbers and
cucumber and vitamins a c and e in it i
really do like these particular makeup
setting sprays from ELF so i'll be using
that one i will also be using the
smashbox photo finish hydrating under
eye primer this is a product i'm trying
to use up in 2016 it's like a really
nice kind of eye cream with a little bit
of a pink tint to it and the final item
that i will be using this week is the
Physicians Formula murumuru butter
bronzer in the shade light bronzer this
is what it looks like and it's
absolutely beautiful you guys it feels
like butter and smells amazing and it
just goes on to the skin so so so so
nicely so there it is swatched I don't
know if you guys can see that but it's a
beautiful beautiful beautiful color so
that is everything that I will be
wearing on my face this week I hope you
