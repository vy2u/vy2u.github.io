channel and welcome back to shop and
swatch my stash where I share with you
guys the makeup products that i
currently have on my face and they make
up products that i will be using this
week by the way do we like what's going
on with my hair i used like texturizing
spray so it's super like right but
anyway I kind of like it okay so let's
go ahead and get started the first item
i will be using on my face this week is
the knicks dewy finish long-lasting
setting spray a couple of weeks ago i
used the matte finish one but i also
really adore this one as far as lip
product is concerned this week i will be
using my new urban decay of ice um black
veil lipstick palette this is what it
looks like and inside you get so many
gorgeous shades the shade that i have on
today is called disobedient which is
that nice like cool toned pink shade i
really really adore this palette and
although i will mostly be using this for
travel i'm very very excited to use it
this week just because it is new to me
and it's a wonderful wonderful palette
so let me give you some swatches so here
are a few swatches of the shades in
there we have some nice neutrals we have
some bright colors and then we have that
beautiful cool toned pink so that is the
shade that I have on my lips today as
you can see we have some sheer
formulations some creams and also some
mats very very excited to be playing
with that this week moving on the next
item that i will be using this week is
this particular foundation which you
guys know is my all-time favorite it is
the josie maran vibrancy foundation
fluid the shade that I where is called
dynamic this is what it looks like and
because this is a little light for me
right now while I unstopped and i will
be going ahead and putting in one pump
of this do the hula from benefit this is
a soft matte liquid bronze for face is
supposed to be like a liquid bronzer it
makes you look really really orange but
i thought you know what maybe i could
mix it together with some of my
foundations that are a little lighter
for me right now so i'm going to take
you two pumps of the josie maran
vibrancy foundation fluid and then one
of this and that's will be at my
foundation peering for this week as far
as mascara is concerned i will be
pairing together my lash blast clump
crusher right yes from covergirl
covergirl LashBlast Club quick clump
crusher I can't say that just try and
say that like seven times fast it's
impossible anyway um this is what I will
as my base mascara this week and then on
top of that i will be using the benefits
they are real mascara which looks like
this so i really like the way the two of
these came out today is thought it was
nice I have a feeling this is a
waterproof formulation which I'm kind of
nervous about hopefully I can get it off
later tonight but these layered very
very beautifully all right as far as
eyeshadow is concerned this week I
really wanted to use my vice four
pallets because I was talking about this
the other day when i did my it's on sale
is it worth it against the Urban Decay
reloaded I was saying how much i adore
this particular palette so today I have
this on I just I'm wearing two different
shades the first one is under hand and
the second is harlot so those are the
two shades that I'm wearing on my eyes
today one is the deep purple I have that
in my crease and on my lower lash line
and then I have this on my lid and I
think the shades in here are absolutely
beautiful they're very very nice and
kind of cool toned there's a few warm
tones in here but for the most part
you're getting just really bright colors
pops of jewel tones and they are mostly
cool tones which I which i think that
with which I think look really nice on
my eyes all right there are a few
swatches for you guys I adore this
palette it's honestly so good it is
definitely my favorite vice palette that
I have ever purchased alright moving on
i will be using a concealer this week
and the concealer i'm going to be using
is from amazing cosmetics if this is the
hydrates concealer the shade that I
whereas ivory and I am trying to use
this up in 2016 so this is what it looks
like on my skin it's a very very good
match as you guys can see and it's just
beautiful very dewy and very very
hydrating so i will be using that this
week and then i also will be using a
let's see here i have no idea where it
is but i'm going to be using the peach
urban decay color correcting fluid
underneath my eyes because i have a very
busy work week so i will swatch that
when we come across it if it is still
out here alright and then as far as
highlighting is concerned this week i'll
be using my kathleenlights highlighter
palette this is what it looks like it is
absolutely beautiful i'm wearing the
middle shade today which is called
starlight and these are just really
really pretty natural highlight so if
you don't want it something that's like
super in your face you would really
really like this there are three
swatches for you guys they look like a
little bit of your skin show through and
that's kind of what i want this week so
that is what i will be using to
highlight my face I won't be
contouring or bronzing my face as well
this week i'll be using my tuesdays
cocoa contour chiseled to perfection kit
which looks like this and i'm probably
going to be focusing on the top two
shades so those two right there the
shades that we have in here are like
cocoa which is a really nice kind of
satiny matt highlight we also have
medium coke 0 which is like a true
contour dark cocoa is more warm tone to
kind of bronze your face and then pop of
light is a really strange kind of
highlight shade I don't really like it
but these are very very nice and very
very soft plentiful contouring or
bronzing products so very excited to use
that this week let's see what else oh
there is the urban decay color
correcting fluid this is in the shade
peach if you guys are curious oh I'm
sorry I have like a really runny nose
today it should have blown my nose
before I did this video but anyway this
is the color corrector in the shade
peach and I will be wearing this
underneath my eyes to color correct any
sort of blue tones because like I said I
have a long work week I also will be
using my to make up for ever aqua extra
large I pencils in these shades m80 &amp;amp; M
10 on my waterline this week I have the
shade m80 on my waterline right now it
is a beautiful kind of plummy shade and
I just thought it would go really nicely
with the Urban Decay vice for palette
and then m10 is just a true solid black
so there is m10 and then there is m 80
and 80 like I said is what I have on my
waterline right now all right as far as
priming is concerned this week i will be
using the oprah silicone primer gel to
prime my face and then i will be using
the tart CC colored clay CC eye primer
to color correct my eyes and also to
prime them so i thought this was going
to be more of like a color corrector
because the shade is actually kind of
peachy and dark but it's nowhere as dark
as the actual peach color corrector from
the Urban Decay color correcting fluid
line so it's nice and i liked it today i
feel like my shadows are staying on
relatively well so that's kind of like a
first impressions because I literally
just hauled this yesterday all rights I
also will be using my Maybelline chic
naturals 15's linen I shadow single just
because the one like kind of match or
satiny shade that's more of like a brow
bone shade in the vice for is slightly
dark for my skin so I will be pulling
this in this is an item that I'm trying
to use that in 2016 I will be doing the
buffing technique with my Cosmo
translucent powder what is this called
bye bye pores translucent powder to set
in my foundation i will be using the
Rimmel stay matte long-lasting pressed
powder in the shade transparent which
looks like this and then I also will be
setting my under eye area with the elf
high definition under I setting powder
which looks like that and then I have
two different blushes that I chose out
this week the first one is from Milani
this is the Milani baked blush in the
shade red vino which is a beautiful
beautiful ready color with lots and lots
of golden Sheen to it it is very in your
face but it's gorgeous so there it is
and then the other one that I chose out
in the one that I am wearing today is
from ELF and this is the pressed mineral
blush in the shade wanderlust and if you
have never tried out the elf pressed
mineral brooklet blushes I can't speak
pressed mineral blushes you really
should because they are so soft and
buttery and smooth so there is red vino
and there is wonder loss I don't know
how they're showing up on camera but red
vino definitely has more red in it and
then this one has more nude in it and
the final item that i will be using this
week is my eyebrow pencil and I'm gonna
use my let's see here bh cosmetics
flawless brow pencil in the shade blonde
alright guys those are all of the items
that i will be using on my face this
week i hope you enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and i'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
