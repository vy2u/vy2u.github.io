welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the products
i currently have on my face and the
products that i will be using all week
let's go ahead and get started the first
item i will be using this week is from
covergirl this is the cg smoothers
hydrating makeup and i have this on
right now i do you have a here on the
back of my hand to show you guys it is
like i don't know it's kind of like a BB
cream and a CC cream combined like they
made a little baby and this is the
product is very very hydrating but at
the same time it gives nice coverage so
i will be using that this week the shade
that I where is 705 ivory if you were
curious just set my face in this week i
will be using my ELF illuminating missed
and set I also will be using my lorac
pro 3 pallets because I did order the
lorac mega Pro three and I want to be
able to do a side-by-side comparison
with this one so I thought it'd be great
to use this one this week here are the
colors that you're really really nice
and neutral and natural i literally just
wearing one today the shade right here
called almond pearl all over my eye of
god I almost just drop this ok it's ok
it's ok all right let me go ahead and
show you guys some swatches there are
just some beautiful colors in here and I
am obsessed with the lorac Pro
formulation definitely one of the best
eyeshadow formulations ever in my
opinion so there are some swatches
really really nice colors and there i
will be using two different powders to
set in my face today so i have been
talking a little bit about how I don't
absolutely love this kat von d locket
translucent setting powder but i like it
underneath the eyes so what i was
thinking of doing this week is trying it
out and using kind of like a lighter
foundation and some cream products so
i'm gonna try this up again this week
I'm going to try using something a
little more densely packed to really
stipple it into my skin instead of just
dusting it onto my face because you know
I bought it and I want to try and make
it work so that is what it looks like
it's just the locket translucent setting
powder and then for a finishing powder i
will be using my maybelline superstay
better skin skin transforming powder in
the shade number 10 porcelain and i'm
just going to be using the little sponge
that comes in here i really love this
sponge i just take it and then I just
dab on the areas where you know I'm oily
or I just want to touch up quickly it's
like right there where I'm dripping snot
why am I always look sniffly in these
videos but anyway this makes for a
really great finishing powder because
it's got this really collect creepily
move texture to it and I used to use it
to actually set in my makeup but now
noticing that if I actually push it into
the skin after I've set in my makeup and
like use this as a finishing powder it
looks even better so i'll be using that
forum blush this week i have to pre
blushes that i did choose out the first
one is from becca this is the Beca beach
tint shimmer souffle in the watermelon
moonstone version it's absolutely
beautiful it definitely smells like
watermelon which is awesome and I really
wanted to try out a few cream products
this week because I will be doing my
makeup declutter series soon and I you
know I want to try out some products and
see like you know those have been
sitting in my collection have I been
reaching for them I claimed not to like
cream products but I have a lot in my
collection so I did want to try a few
out this week so here is the Beca wanna
and then the other one i will be using
is one of my all-time favorite cream
blushes this is the l'oreal visible lift
color lift blush in the shade rose gold
and this is the one that i currently
have on my face today i love this i will
not declutter this but i wanted to
double check with the back of one but i
still think it's beautiful and I
probably will hold on to it but there
are quite a few cream blushes in my
collection I just don't reach for them
you know what i mean so it's like gotta
try them out one more time at least
alright the next two items were sent to
me for PR so if you don't know what that
means this particular company sent me
these products to give you guys my
honest review so they said I could say
whatever I wanted which that is the
those are the only companies that I say
yes to because if they tell me that I
can't give a bad opinion that I say
don't send me your product but this is
from amazing cosmetics this is the
illuminating concealer in the shade
ivory I currently am going through their
hydrate concealer in my current project
pan video this was just okay today so I
put it on and I thought that the
applicator was slightly scratchy
underneath the eyes but as you guys can
see like it had a very nice thick
consistency and texture to it it was
very brightening under the eyes but it
was weird because I noticed that when I
blended it out it got really really
Shearer and I just don't understand why
would you have a product that goes on
kind of sheer but feels so thick and
heavy so it definitely feels like
something is there i'll have to play
around with it today i did set it in
with what time i set it in with or no I
I you know blended it in with a brush so
tomorrow I'll try with my damp sponge
but that is what it looks like pretty
decent coverage
said it feels very very heavy on the
skin so we'll see about that one I do
know that a lot of their concealers tend
to feel a little heavier on the skin
their hydrate version that I bought
myself like I don't feel like that feels
very heavy they also did send me the
original amazing cosmetics concealer
which i think is very heavy duty and
nice but I would never wear that
underneath the eyes they also did send
me this lime smoother plus primer and
this is something that you put like on
areas where you have fine lines and
wrinkles I thought it worked pretty well
today it has these little balls right
here and basically you roll it
underneath your eye to help fill in you
know fine lines and wrinkles around your
mouth and then on any line so i'll be
using that this is that mm i'll be using
this this week to kind of try out and
see i can't really give my thoughts on
this yet because they've only used it
once but that one seemed okay not quite
sure about the concealer alright and
then i have this pure cosmetics hydrogel
lift i got this in the Ulta 21 days of
beauty event and I am going to use this
as my eye primer this week it's super
weird because it goes on feeling like so
cooling and nice and then it feels
really tacky and sticky so that's what
it looks like I just need to use it a
little more and see what it's like and
then also I wanted to say I will be
mixing in my becca shimmering skin
Perfector liquid is that what they call
it yeah liquid in moonstone together
with the covergirl this week so this is
the CG smoothers i'll be mixing those
together i really like the glow that i
got today so let me show you guys what
that looks like i think that these
liquid versions are just absolutely
stunning so here is the moonstone it has
beautiful beautiful consistency to it
and moonstone is that really nice kind
of yellowy goldish color alright moving
on for lip products this week i will be
using two of the all may these are new
to me what are these called all make
color plus care bombs so one of you guys
recommend to these to me and i'm loving
them so far so the first one is rosy lip
twitch looks like this and these are
actually like really comfortable like
bombs like it feels like a lip balm you
know but it goes on like a lip gloss but
they have a nice pigment to them they're
very thick and moisturizing and i am
liking them so far so like I said the
first shade is rosy lips there is rosy
lift it is the one I'm wearing right now
and then this one right here is called
truffle and I have a little more pigment
to it and it's just a little deeper in
tone but yeah these are very comfortable
and I am liking them so far so rosy lips
and then there is truffle super
or glossy as well so enjoying those and
then a for primer this week like face
primer i will be using my it cosmetics
feel the moment this is the anti-aging
ultra hydrating sensory awakening primer
serum i love this stuff out like my
all-time favorite primer absolutely
beautiful and then for my brows i'll be
using the studio 10 brow lift perfecting
liner i'll be using the ashy side for my
brows and then i'll be going in with the
Milani brow shaping wax which i really
enjoy and then for mascara this week i
did do you a review yesterday on the new
lash stashin kit from sephora from her
like their sephora favorites lion and i
did get this st edit mascara which I
don't really like but again I need to
try it out some more so I got this essay
edit mascara right here and I've used it
twice I really hated it both times I
didn't like it that much today but you
know what you have to you have to spend
a little time with a product before your
life you know what I absolutely hate it
so i will be using this side first which
is good volumizing side and this is the
site i really don't like it's just a
really really kind of basic bitch sort
of wand it doesn't get me very excited
but the other side is relatively good
it's relatively good so there is the
other side I felt like this side gave me
a lot more length and then the other
obviously since that was the volumizing
side and then I will be topping it with
my YSL babydoll mascara which i also got
in that kit this is like my new favorite
mascaras beautiful here is what the wand
looks like so very excited for those and
then for eyeliner this week i'm kind of
going like glowy and natural as you guys
can tell so i'll be using the it
cosmetics no tub waterproof gel eyeliner
in the shade highlight and i'm using a
lot of the stuff that i got it that i
got in my new hall because why not i
mean i bought them so that is what the
color looks like i put that on my
waterline today I don't know this has
like a little bits of glitter in it it
just it went on smoothly but I don't
feel like it's very pigmented and then
the last item i will be using this week
is from stila and this is the star light
star bright bouncy blush whatever you
want to call it highlighting palette and
i am using kitten today as my highlight
and i just put this on really really
lightly onto my skin there is the shade
that i'm wearing which is called kitchen
we also have let's see here bronze and
then we have what is that 10 yet
transcendence so there are the three
shades they're really glowy and pretty
very very pretty and I think they look
nice on the skin as long as you aren't
wearing like too much makeup so anyway
that is it those are all of the items
that i will be using this week make sure
to join me for my files and how the
rails on sunday and i will let you guys
know if these products were good or if
they are alright so that is it
thanks for joining me guys and i'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
