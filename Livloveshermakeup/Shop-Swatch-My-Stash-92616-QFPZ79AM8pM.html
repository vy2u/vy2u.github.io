welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the products
I currently have on my face and the
products that I will be using all week
let's go ahead and get started
the first item I will be using this week
is from covergirl this is the CG
smoothers hydrating makeup and I have
this on right now I do have it here on
the back of my hand to show you guys it
is like I don't know it's kind of like a
BB cream and a CC cream combined like
they made a little baby and this is the
product it's very very hydrating but at
the same time it gives nice coverage so
I will be using that this week at the
shade that I wear is 7:05 ivory if you
were curious just set my face in this
week I will be using my ELF illuminating
mist and set I also will be using my
lorac pro 3 palettes because i did order
the lorac mega pro 3 and i want to be
able to do a side-by-side comparison
with this one so i thought it would be
great to use this one this week here are
the colors that you're really really
nice and neutral and natural I'm
literally just wearing one today this
shade right here called almond pearl all
over my eye of God it almost just drop
this okay okay alright let me go ahead
and show you guys some swatches there
are just some beautiful colors in here
and I am obsessed with the lorac pro
formulation definitely one of the best
eyeshadow formulations ever in my
opinion so there are some swatches
really really nice colors and there I
will be using two different powders to
set in my face today so I have been
talking a little bit about how I don't
absolutely love this Kat Von D lock-it
translucent setting powder but I like it
underneath the eyes so what I was
thinking of doing this week is trying it
out and using kind of like a lighter
foundation and some cream products so
I'm gonna try this up again this week
I'm gonna try using something a little
more densely packed to really stipple it
into my skin instead of just dusting it
onto my face because you know I bought
it and I want to try and make it work so
that is what it looks like it's just the
locket translucent setting powder and
then for a finishing powder I will be
using my maybelline superstay better
skin skin transforming powder in the
shade number ten porcelain and I'm just
going to be using the little sponge that
comes in here I really love this sponge
I just take it and then I just dab on
the areas where you know I'm oily or I
just want to touch up quickly it's like
right there where I'm dripping snot why
am I always lick sniffily in these
videos but anyway this makes for a
really great finishing powder because
it's
this really could like creepily smooth
texture to it and I used to use it to
actually set in my makeup but now I'm
noticing that if I actually push it into
the skin after I've set in my makeup and
like use this as a finishing powder it
looks even better
so I'll be using that for a blush this
week I have two cream blushes that I did
choose out the first one is from Becca
and this is the Becca Beach tint shimmer
souffle in the watermelon moonstone
version it's absolutely beautiful it
definitely smells like watermelon which
is awesome and I really wanted to try
out a few cream products this week
because I will be doing my makeup
declutter series too and and I you know
I want to try out some products and see
like you know those have been sitting in
my collection have I been reaching for
them I claimed not to like cream
products but I have a lot in my
collection so I did want to try a few
out this week so here is the Becca wanna
and then the other one I will be using
is one of my all-time favorite cream
blushes this is the L'Oreal visible lift
color lift blush in the shade rose gold
and this is the one that I currently
have on my face today I love this I will
not declutter this but I wanted to
double check with the back of one but I
still think it's beautiful and I
probably will hold on to it but there
are quite a few cream blushes in my
collection I just don't reach for them
you know what I mean so it's like gotta
try them out one more time at least
alright the next two items that were
sent to me for PR so if you don't know
what that means this particular company
sent me these products to give you guys
my honest review so they said I could
say whatever I wanted which that is the
those are the only companies that I say
yes to because if they tell me that I
can't give a bad opinion that I say
don't send me your product but this is
from amazing cosmetics this is the
illuminating concealer in the shade
ivory I currently am going through their
hydrate concealer in my current project
pan video this was just okay today so I
put it on and I thought that the
applicator was slightly scratchy
underneath the eyes but as you guys can
see like it had a very nice thick
consistency and texture to it it was
very brightening under the eyes but it
was weird because I noticed that when I
blended it out it got really really
sheer and I just don't understand why
would you have a product that goes on
kind of sheer but feels so thick and
heavy so it definitely feels like
something is there I'll have to play
around with it today I did set it in
with what I set it in with or no I I you
know blended it in with a brush so
tomorrow I'll try with my damp sponge
but that is what it looks like
decent coverage but like I said it feels
very very heavy on the skin so we'll see
about that one I do know that a lot of
their concealers tend to feel a little
heavier on the skin their hydrate
version that I bought myself like I
don't feel like that feels very heavy
they also did send me the original
amazing cosmetics concealer which i
think is very heavy-duty and nice but I
would never wear that underneath the
eyes they also did send me this lime
smoother plus primer and this is
something that you put like on areas
where you have fine lines and wrinkles I
thought it works pretty well today it
has these little balls right here and
basically you roll it underneath your
eye to help fill in you know fine lines
and wrinkles around your mouth and then
on any line so I'll be using that this
is that mmm
I'll be using this this week to kind of
try out and see I can't really give my
thoughts on this yet because they've
only used it once but that one seemed
okay not quite sure about the concealer
all right and then I have this pur
cosmetics hydrogel lift I got this in
the Ulta 21 days of beauty event and I
am going to use this as my eye primer
this week it's super weird because it
goes on feeling like so cooling and nice
and then it feels really tacky and
sticky so that's what it looks like I
just need to use it a little more and
see what it's like and then also I
wanted to say I will be mixing in my
Becca shimmering skin perfecter liquid
is that what they call it yeah liquid in
moonstone together with the covergirl
this week so this is the CG smoothers
I'll be mixing those together I really
like the glow that I got today so let me
show you guys what that looks like I
think that these liquid versions are
just absolutely stunning so here is the
moonstone it has beautiful beautiful
consistency to it and moonstone is that
really nice kind of yellowy goldish
color alright moving on for lip products
this week I will be using two of the
o'may these are new to me what are these
called all make color plus care balm so
one of you guys recommend to these to me
and I'm loving them so far so the first
one is rosy lip twitch looks like this
and these are actually like really
comfortable like bombs like it feels
like a lip balm you know but it goes on
like a lip gloss but they have a nice
pigment to them they're very thick and
moisturizing and I'm liking them so far
so like I said the first shade is rosy
lip there is rosy lift it is the one I'm
wearing right now and then this one
right here is called truffle and it has
a little more pigment to it and it's
just a little deeper in tone but yeah
these are very comfortable and I am
them so far so rosy lipped and then
there is truffle super super glossy as
well so enjoying those and then before
primer this week like face primer I will
be using my it cosmetics feel at the
moment this is the anti-aging ultra
hydrating sensory awakening primer serum
I love this stuff out like my all-time
favorite primer absolutely beautiful and
then for my brows I'll be using the
studio tan brow lift perfecting liner
I'll be using the ashy side for my brows
and then I'll be going in with the
Milani brow shaping wax which I really
enjoy and then for mascara this week I
did do you a review yesterday on the new
lash stash kit from Sephora from for
like their Sephora favorites line and I
did get this este edit mascara which I
don't really like but again I need to
try it out some more so I got this si
edit mascara right here and I've used it
twice I really hated it both times I
didn't like it that much today but you
know what you have to you have to spend
a little time with a product before
you're like you know what I absolutely
hate it so I will be using this side
first which is these volumizing side and
this is the side I really don't like
it's just a really really kind of basic
bitch sort of wand it doesn't get me
very excited but the other side is
relatively good it's relatively good so
there is the other side I felt like this
side gave me a lot more length and then
the other obviously since that was the
volumizing side and then I will be
topping it with my wild baby doll
mascara which I also got in that kit
this is like my new favorite mascara as
beautiful here is what the wand looks
like so very excited for those and then
for eyeliner this week I'm kind of going
like glowy and natural as you guys can
tell so I'll be using the it cosmetics
no-tongue waterproof gel eyeliner in the
shade highlight and I'm using a lot of
the stuff that I got that I got in my
new haul because why not I mean I bought
them so that is what the color looks
like I put that on my waterline today I
don't know this sounds like a little
bits of glitter in it it just it went on
smoothly but I don't feel like it's very
pigmented and then the last item I will
be using this week is from Stila and
this is the star light star bright
bouncy blush whatever you want to call
it highlighting palette and I am using
kitten today as my highlight and I just
put this on really really lightly on to
my skin there is the shade that I'm
wearing which is called kitchen we also
have let's see here bronze
and then we have what is that one oh
yeah transcendence so there are the
three shades they're really glowy and
pretty like very very pretty and I think
they look nice on the skin as long as
you aren't wearing like too much makeup
so anyway that is it so those are all of
the items that I will be using this week
and make sure to join me for my files
and how to rails on the Sunday and I
will let you guys know if these products
were good or if they are alright so
that is it thanks for joining me guys
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
