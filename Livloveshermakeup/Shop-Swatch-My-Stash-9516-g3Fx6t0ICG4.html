welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products I currently have on my face
right now and they make up products that
i will be using all week let's go ahead
and get started i did choose out quite a
few of the 2015 holiday pallets to play
with this week just because honestly I'm
getting so excited that all of the 2016
holiday items are dropping so yeah I
thought this would be kind of nostalgic
so the first item that I chose out this
week is from benefits this is the real
cheeky party palette this is what it
looks like and you are getting a
bronzers in here you're getting
highlights depending on your skin tone
and also blush it it comes in this
adorable little tin um case here and I
do plan on d potting these because as
you guys can probably see I have already
used up quite a few of the items that
were in here there was like an eyeliner
I think of mascara and then also a
highlighter and I use that up so all
that I have left in here is the
dandelion blush I also have the rocket
or blush the sugar bomb blush I have
coralista and then the hoola bronzer so
let me show you guys what those look
like they're very beautiful and I think
this is a wonderful palette so I'm super
super excited to play with that this
week i'll just give you guys quick
little swatches here those did not
swatch very well but that is okay they I
feel like they don't swatch very well
but they're one of those kind of blushes
that just go on so so so nicely onto the
actual skin and they're one of those
products that like you don't have to
necessarily be careful with does that
make sense like I feel like you really
can spend a lot of time kind of building
these up and if you're someone who goes
in really heavy-handed with blush and
like me then I think that it's quite
helpful alright for highlight this week
i will be using my own estas to get
Beverly Hills moonchild glow kits this
is what it looks like and I'm sure you
guys have seen this you guys know I
reviewed this a lot of people review
this it's just a beautiful beautiful
palette lots of interesting different
sort of highlights in here the one that
I have on today is called Lucky Clover
and I just love this I feel like an
alien when I wear this palette is not is
not like a bad alien but like a cute
alien it's just absolutely gorgeous so
so so beautiful really really enjoy this
palette so that is what i will be using
for highlight this week as far as
eyeshadow is concerned i will be
grabbing for another 2015 holiday
palette this is the Stila trust and love
gift set so I don't want to do pot these
because i love this packaging but i have
already decluttered one of the Stila lip
places that was in here and i also
decluttered the actual mascara that was
in here you guys can see you get two
rows of really gorgeous eyeshadows today
I have on that kind of coppery shade I
have that dark brown on and it's just so
so so beautiful i love this palette i
would say these shimmery shades in here
or the luster shades are definitely the
standouts they're very pigmented and
they go on very foiled the mats are also
very nice as well but i do not think
that the glitter shades are that great
but this is a gorgeous palette gorgeous
gorgeous eyeshadows i keep saying
gorgeous gouges but seriously they're
gorgeous um I did uh I don't know I feel
like I did I get the other one last year
to know I did it so there was like this
small kit from sealdah that came out and
then they had an even bigger eyeshadow
palette that came out I didn't get that
one but I should have because I think
this was my favorite eyeshadow palette
that release during the holidays last
year alright moving on let's move on to
some mascara the first mascara i will be
using this week is the UM my mascara or
amplify ya know it's called ample i
employ mascara amplifying mascara serum
so this is a mascara serum that you wear
underneath another mascara which is
perfect for me you guys know i like to
layer my mascaras so this is what i will
be using as my actual base and then i
will be going in with my extra lash
sculpting mascara from Laura Mercier
which is a beautiful beautiful sculpting
and defining mascara I think it's
wonderful it has a really really crazy
wand literally a medieval torture tool
right here seriously you do not want to
poke yourself in the eye with that
because excuse me you do not want to
poke yourself in the eye with that one
because it is literally it hurts it
hurts so bad yeah it has happened to be
a few times trust me you don't want to
do that alright moving on i will be
using my ELF magic mats mist and sets i
will be using this to you know kind of
prime my face and also set in my makeup
for lip products this week i will be
using these new korres lip butter
glosses so these are new to me they were
part of the 2015 Holiday Collection last
year and the shades that I have
our peach i also have natural and i also
have pink so let me go ahead and swatch
these for you guys i am wearing the
natural shade right now but they're very
very comfortable very very glossy so
there is the pink one and then the next
one we have is peach which is actually
super super juicy looking and like it's
like a papaya shade I love it there is
the peach shade and then the last one is
the one that I am wearing which is that
natural color and I like it it's kind of
like a um no I wouldn't I I feel like
it's kind of like a nudie pinky color
it's definitely more pinky than nude so
there are the three of them we have pink
we have peach in the middle and then we
have natural so really think those are
very pretty very glossy I like the way
that they feel on the lips they're just
very very comfortable and nice alright
moving on i will be using the bombs
cosmetics that ball that the bomb
cosmetics put a lid on it eyelid primer
this week this is what it looks like and
then i will be using the NARS velvet
matte skin tint with broad-spectrum SPF
30 sunscreen in the shaded taryn way
they light 0 as my actual foundation I
was putting this on today and I forgot
like how much this smells like sounds
great it just smelled like straight-up
sunscreen but that's okay there it is on
the back of my hand pretty good color
match for me it does oxidize a tiny bit
so it does go a little pink if you guys
are curious to set that in i'll be using
my maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming powder in the shade number
10 porcelain you guys know I've been
pretty much obsessed with this powder I
love the way that it sets everything in
and that is what it looks like and then
I also will be double setting so I am
double setting because this is a new
product to me it is the kat von d locket
setting powder in the shade translucent
and originally I was just going to use
it to kind of set underneath my eye area
or bake this week or try to make uh I
don't bake it's like my friend aura said
the other day she was like I don't bake
anything except for cookies but that's
me um anyway uh yeah so I was going to
go ahead and just try and use this to
set or bake something on my face however
today I decided to go ahead and just
double set that powder in uh when I use
this the other day if you watch my first
impressions get ready with me video I
did not like the way that this set in my
foundation it was beautiful underneath
the eyes and I think that it does set in
tattoo concealer what's it called the
locket concealer creme I think it sets
it in really nicely but it looked very
cakey on my skin and I feel like it does
look cakey again on my skin today so I'm
not going to use it on my face you guys
but i think i will use it to go ahead
and just set underneath my eye area
alright moving on i will be using the
kat von d lock-it concealer creme in the
shade whiteout and i will be pairing
that with my 8 cosmetics bye-bye redness
neutralizing color creme this is what it
looks like it's like a grayish kind of
color it's very very dark on me so i
will be using it to color correct
redness and then i will go in with my
foundation and then i will use the two
of these on top underneath my eye area
to brighten and then for my face base
this week i will be using the Bobby
Brown vitamin enriched face base this is
what it looks like and this is a really
cool product it smells really good like
lemon cake and spa you know that typical
kind of Bobby Brown send I really do
like this and I think it's nice it's
interesting because it gets really
really tacky on the face which is great
if you really wanted you know products
who adhere to your skin but sometimes it
can be a little hard to buff it in but
when you first put it on it's like
silicone e I don't know it's very
strange I'll give you guys my thoughts
on that at the end of the week as far as
eyeliner is concerned i'll be using my
clinic skinny stick in the shade 03 slim
sable i have not reached for this
forever I put a little little hour over
I put a little on my lower lashline
today and I love this color this color
is so pretty it's just like a deep
chocolaty Brown and this is like the
most precise little eyeliner ever it's
great for tight lining and like I said
today did go on my lower lash line but i
like it i think it looks pretty and then
for my brows this week i will be using
this little brow pencil here this is the
studio 10 what are lit what are you
called what is this call brown lift
perfecting liner so on once she sighs
Schmidt can't speak today you guys one
side we have this topi color and then on
the other side we have this highlighting
shade and I hate the highlighter like
it's too dark it's like a weird to see
that it's like 10 shades darker than my
skin super strange I don't know how
that's
highlight my skin but it's kind of like
a yellowy color and I don't like that
but I do like the topi color and then
I'm going to be going in with my
Maybelline clear mascara to set
everything in and it was funny today put
it on and I was sitting there and I was
waiting for it to kind of set it took
forever it's not like my Tony aprox one
which sets like instantly and then I
absent will be using and there's a
blotter razzi by Beauty Blender sponge
this week I got this in my Sephora play
box I have not used it so instead of
going in with extra powder this week's
and smooth face is already a little
cakey today from using that Kat Von D
translucent powder which by the way i
feel like the cody air spun is so so so
similar i'm not going to return that but
I'm just saying all right i'll be using
de blah de Rossi and I'm gonna try and
use it with my Malley face defender
because you guys I've been having issues
with my Malley face defender the past
couple of weeks let me know if you have
any sort of idea on how I should use
this but like the sponge every time I go
in and I press it into my skin it's
getting all these little weird flaky
things all over like you can actually
see it's like picking up flakes of the
silicon kind of primer so let me know
what I should do I thought maybe I would
try the bladder out see with this and
yeah that is the guys those are all of
the makeup items that i will be using
this week on my face i hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and i will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
