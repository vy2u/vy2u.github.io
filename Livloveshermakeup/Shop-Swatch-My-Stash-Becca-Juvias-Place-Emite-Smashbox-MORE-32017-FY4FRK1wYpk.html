my channel and welcome back to you shop
and swatch my stash where I share with
you guys as they make up products I
currently have on my face and of course
we make up products I will be using in
this week let's go ahead and jump right
into it the first item I want to focus
on is from Kat Von D this is the Lockett
tattoo foundation in the shade light of
44 I did self-tan of the other day and I
think this will just match me better
than the light 42 shade there is a huge
difference between light 42 and light 44
this is actually very peachy tone so if
you are very very fair complected get
the light 42 even though it looks like
it's like a straight-out white color
it's not but yeah I do enjoy this I used
to absolutely love this which is why I
have like three containers of this
sitting around when I was younger like
18 years old I had very very oily skin
with lots of breakouts and this covered
everything but now that I am a little
more dry like in this area and like I do
have the beginnings of fine lines and
wrinkles I noticed that this does kind
of emphasize that so what I'm gonna do
this week is actually mix it with the
Smashbox photo finish primer oil I have
a bunch of these little samples sitting
around and I'm just gonna go ahead put
this on with like a brush and then go
straight in with the foundation so you
can either just mix it directly into the
actual foundation but today I just kind
of put it on a brush and then I went
right in with that
and it worked really well so I'm very
very excited for that for eye primer I
will be using the benefits Air Patrol BB
eyelid a primer and this is what it
looks like I really love that and then
as far as lip products are concerned I'm
gonna be going very very light and
natural I'm gonna be using my Kerry
Graham
lip whip so these are amazing I love
these they are completely natural
cruelty free they're vegan and they
don't have any petroleum in that which
is kind of cool this particular shape is
called radiant this is the one I have on
today and let me show you guys the
texture like you would think that these
do have petroleum in them but they don't
which is awesome so radiant is just kind
of like a pinky shade as you guys can
see I'm sorry I have really really dry
hands right now and then the other sheet
is called a marsala you guys remember
like the marsala trend I feel like that
was the best like color or Pantone color
of the year ever
I wanted that whole collection from
Sephora but i couldnt get my hands on it
so here is the marsala and again i'm
really really beautiful this one has a
little more of like that nude vibe going
on kind of like
these leper really like that and they
either smell like peppermint or cinnamon
so you get to pick which one you want
and yeah those are sold at Sephora and
they are awesome alright I will be going
ahead and setting up my face in with my
maybelline superstay a better skin skin
transforming powder in the shade a 10 a
porcelain eye pam on this a while ago
and i just feel like i haven't reached
for it lately it is a little more yellow
tone so I like to use it when I am
self-tanning and then I'm also going to
bake it with my by Thierry hyaluronic
hydra powder this was sent to me for PR
quite a few weeks ago and I love it you
guys it's really really good it's a
typical kind of silica powder but this
does have hyaluronic acid infused in
there so it's extra hydrating so I do
enjoy that and then another kind of
silica based powder is this little guy
right here this is the elf high
definition under eye setting powder in
the shade of sheer I just want to get
through this it does have little micro
glitters in it and I'm not like the
biggest fan of it but I just thought you
know what I could use this and be done
with it like in one application of
baking my face alright as far as a blush
and highlight is concerned this week I
will be using a my Becca split pants so
we have a champagne pop and hyacinth and
of this is a champagne poppin hyacinth
so this is a matte blush and then here
is champagne pop which is the shimmering
skin perfecter pressed so there is a
champagne pop and hyacinth oh god this
shade is amazing I was wearing this
yesterday in the live chat a lot have
you ever seen you likes the color on my
cheeks so I just applied that with a
very very fluffy brush if you have never
tried out the Becca and mineral blushes
they are very very pigmented like scary
pigmented so be very careful but yeah
that is the first little g-well i will
be using and then also this guy is a
flower child and champagne pop this
one's a little more loved it's what I
have on today I brought this on my
vacation over the summer for like six
weeks it was amazing really really
beautiful they do claim at that flower
child is a matte blush but it's not too
you guys can see it has like a bit of a
sheen to it so those are the highlights
and the blushes that I will be wearing
and then also I'm gonna get a little
extra and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
going to put this baby on top of a
champagne pop now a champagne pop is a
little darker than my skin tone is not a
true highlight so I thought I would go
ahead and add in the new Becca
shimmering skin Perfector press in
prismatic amethyst and I love the way it
looks today I feel like it's a little
different cuz like it
warm tones and quill tones it's a little
trippy but like I've enjoyed it so
anyway this is a what it looks like it's
beautiful it's just like an opalescent
white shade with a little bit of a pink
or lavender shape to it so there it is
all right as far as bronzer is concerned
I will be using up my Too Faced at what
is this sweethearts bronzer in a sweet
tea I really do like this I think it's a
good bronzer
I'm it's not my all-time favorite do you
guys know I love my Morimoto butter
bronzers but this one is still really
really pretty and yeah you have to be
careful if you are very fair complected
it can look a little yellow and kind of
sallow on the skin if that makes sense
but I don't know I still think it's
really pretty and really glowy and I
like what it does for my skin
alright moving on I do have a little
under eye corrector that I want to use
this week it is from a meet a makeup and
I am loving this so far I also love
their primer that I got in like a
boxycharm this is the active eye light
corrector please let me know if you know
where you can actually get these
products but this is really beautiful so
I thought it would pair together really
nicely with that Kat Von D locket tattoo
foundation because I don't want to go in
with like a super heavy duty color
corrector or even just a concealer
because it will just take up so this has
a really nice kind of like eye cream
consistency with a little bit of a
yellow undertone I just took that
underneath my eyes today did a little
triangle put it on down the bridge of my
nose my Cupid's bow my chin and I really
really like this so very very excited to
be playing with that first impressions
wise I'm very impressed I will also be
using my ELF illuminating a mist and
such as this is what it looks like and
then as far as mascara is concerned I'm
going to be layering these two babies
together the first is the Maybelline the
falsies push-up drama which is a rubber
bristle wand with a really really wet
kind of lacquered formula and then I got
this little guy in my Sephora play box I
think last month I did cancel my Sephora
play box not because I wasn't impressed
but just because I am going into like
cruelty free subscription boxes now but
this is what is their little mascara
looks like you guys know I love the
outrageous curl but this is not bad this
is the latest post volume and I thought
of his lights reminds me a lot of the
better than sex mascara it has a very
dry formula so if you don't want this to
flake I would highly recommend going in
and topping it with something that has a
little more of a web formula
alright for my brows I
to my brow pencil earlier but I did kind
of go a little more heavy with my brows
today I'm wearing the Revlon it's not
the colors day I keep using that one it
is the brow fantasy so it has kind of
like a gel on one side and then pencil
on the other it's a little more yellow
toned and a little more like blondish I
don't know if you guys can see the
difference but I do like it and I
thought I would go ahead and set that in
with the Milani
brow shaping clear wax like I said I
drop that on the floor just realize that
as I'm filming this all right and then
for eyeliner I'm gonna be using my
smashbox always sharp a waterproof Cola
liner in Sumatra I feel like I've been
using this forever
I just can't I just can't get enough of
this shade I think it's beautiful
especially if you do have blue eyes and
I just like to kind of like put it right
in my eye and then go back and forth
close my eyes so I can do the waterline
and also the tight line at the same time
because I always look like I'm poking
myself out poking my eye out what I am
filming look at the week cuz you guys
are like oh my gosh look at her you know
don't don't get it in your eye but yeah
what I do now is I just close my eye and
I go like back and forth alright and
then here is the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in the shade gonzo
which is a beautiful blue I thought this
would go really nicely with the palettes
that I'm going to be using this a week
and then I do have this little guy right
here this is the covergirl bombshell
shineshadow
in the shade copper Fling I thought I
would just go ahead and add this and I
don't really pay attention to my single
shadow so I want to show them some more
love and this is really really beautiful
I did have this on my lid yesterday so
again if you saw the livestream this is
what I've had on my lid it's really nice
it doesn't like get tacky like those new
Maybelline chrome eye whatever they're
called I feel like those get really
really tacky and this does not it's very
very like slippery and it kind of
doesn't like I don't know it doesn't set
right away so you do need to go in and
maybe put another like eye shadow on top
of it but I don't know I'm gonna play
around with it and I will keep you guys
updated I feel like if you do have a
deep complexion that could also double
as a highlight and then finally I will
be using a my as you
yes place yeah this is the masquerade at
palette I'm so excited you guys because
I used this yesterday and I used it
today and I'm in love so I did do a
first impressions with the nubian
eyeshadow palette and I felt like I had
to really really take a lot of time
blending those and these are completely
different it seems like they have just
stepped up their game with each palette
so I am very very excited to use it the
shades that I do have on today are Dalia
which is this one I have it on my lower
lash line I had a Zola this one on my
lid and then I did take guysso
or Giza this one right here I put that
on the inner corner of my eye and then
Cairo I went ahead and worked that into
the crease and then I did take though
bow
so bow is a little patchy just a little
bit it's a very very pretty purple
shader I know Purple's are hard to do
like formula wise but still oh my god I
really like this combination of colors
like I don't know how I just came up
with this but I was like let's just go
ahead and put on a bunch of different
shades now because if you guys didn't
know I say dubious place yes Julius
place is a black-owned makeup company so
they do cater to women of color so I
can't really like pull off of this as a
transition and this is like a brow bone
shade necessarily they're just a little
too dark for me so I thought I would go
ahead and pull in at my Sonia Kashuk eye
on a neutral palette so this just has a
bunch of matte shades I do prefer if I'm
gonna do a like transition shade and
also like a brown shade I like for them
to be matte so this is what it looks
like very very basic and today I have
this shade on and this one so all over
the lid and then that's my transition so
anyway I like the eye look it is very
very kind of fun and bright and I feel
like this palette is gonna be a lot of
fun to play with so anyway that is it so
those are all the products I'm gonna use
first shop my stash this week please let
me know if you are joining me this week
or what did you shop your stash for and
yeah I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
