back to my channel and welcome back to
shop and swatch my stash where I share
with you guys the makeup products I
currently have on my face and of course
the makeup products that i will be using
this week let's go ahead and jump right
into it the first item that i want to
concentrate on this week is the Anasazi
of Beverly Hills glow kit in the Sun
dipped version so the shade that I am
wearing today is called summer which is
a really really pretty kind of gold
shade it reminds me a lot of Becca's
moonstone and I will go ahead and swatch
that for you guys very very beautiful
super pigmented super super foiled i
recently picked up this glow kit and i
am already in love so that is what it
looks like on the inside as far as
eyeshadow is concerned this week i will
be using my two base natural matte 29
and piano palette i do have that pier
together today with one of the
magnificent metals liquid eye shadows
from stila but this is what the little 9
pan palette looks like it's in the
little tin form and the shades in here
although they don't look super super
like appealing I guess they just look
very basic they are beautiful when you
actually put them on the eyes so the
first shade i'm wearing is called heaven
which is a really nice brow bone shade
then i have lace Teddy which is this
kind of pinky shade in my crease as my
transition and then I did go in with you
shade cashmere bunny worked that into my
crease and then in my outer V and lower
lash line I put chocolate cookie on so
let me swatch these quickly for you guys
I have a little bit of a lupus rash
going on on my hand even though i'm not
in a flare-up so i apologize if you can
see that but there are these shades
right there i know they look slightly
like patchy but i swear they go on to
the eyes so incredibly beautifully they
take like literally two seconds to blend
which is awesome and like i said i am
going to be pairing that together with
this little guy this week so this is the
Stila magnificent metals glitter and
glow liquid eye shadow in the shade
'some okie storm which is a really
beautiful kind of topi pewter color and
i love this you guys so far this is the
first time i used it today and that is
what the shade it looks like that is
just like a one swipe swatch and i do
have that on my lower lashline today as
well as on my lid i did up a little
bit over here excuse me sorry bad
language I did up a little bit over
here but everywhere else I think it
looks really really nice it did take a
little bit of time to kind of dry down
so you need to make sure that you do
something else while it dries down so
you can bake or you can go ahead and you
can do your eyebrows that's what I did
today
yeah super super beautiful and I haven't
noticed any sort of fallout or glitter
underneath my eyes yet so I'm very
excited for that as far as my face is
concerned this week i will be using the
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion in
the anti-aging of formula and then it
for my face i will be using the Stila
aqua glow perfecting primer which is in
my current project pan I only have a
little bit of this left in fact I may be
able to use this up this week so that is
what it looks like for my actual face
base not so much primer but like my
foundation base i will be using a BB
cream my friend recently gave this to me
it is from burt's bees and i just found
out burt's bees may not be cruelty-free
which is completely ridiculous I feel
like if any branch should be
cruelty-free it is Burt's Bees but
anyway this is 98.9 percent natural the
shade that I do have is light and it
does have SPF 15 sunscreen in it I think
this is beautiful you guys like
seriously beautiful it comes out and it
reminds me a lot of the dr jart BB cream
because it has such a gray undertone to
it I can't remember what my friend
Rochelle didn't like this but if she
does watch this video and she comment I
will go ahead and pin her comment to the
top so she can tell us why she didn't
like it she has completely different
skin than I do mmm excuse me I was just
eating blueberries I think I just like
to choke down a seat anyway I was what
was I saying oh yeah she's completely
different skin than I do she has very
very dry skin I'm more combination oily
so i will definitely pin her comment to
the top if she tells us why she didn't
like it but so far so good for me and
then if we're under my eyes i will be
using they charge rainforests of the sea
aqua sealer in the shade fair this is
one of my all-time favorite under eye
concealers it never takes up it never
looks horrible it's just always looks
beautiful so i love that and then i do
have this amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer in the shade ivory that i will
be using before going in with the BB
cream for spot concealing this was sent
to me for PR and amazing cosmetics is a
wonderful brand unfortunately they do
tests on animals so it's not something
that I would repurchase or I would
except for PR again it but this is a
very very thick concealer you guys I
think it's better for spot concealing
not so much underneath the eye I feel
like you're really creases underneath my
eyes and it's just a little too heavy so
i'll be using that underneath the BB
cream and then for brows this week i'll
be using my revlon colorstay brow pencil
in the shade of blonde as well as my
Maybelline brow drama cran at pomade I
can never say that cran pomade in the
shade of blonde that is also in my
current project pan so i'll be using
those
for mascara i will be using my charlotte
tilbury full fat lashes paired together
with my sephora outrageous curl dramatic
volume and curb mascara one is a natural
bristle wand one is a rubber bristle
wand you guys know I like to layer them
like that so the Charlotte Tilbury one
was sent to me for PR this is what the
actual wand looks like super super nice
I don't find that this gives like a ton
of um i guess like definition but it
definitely gives a nice amount of volume
like very very fluttery lashes if you
like very natural looking lashes you
would like this it sounds something I
would personally purchase with my own
money but you know they wanted to send
me a box of PR and I was quite happy to
get it and then here is the Sephora
outrageous curl mascara now this is the
one I would recommend to you guys
although Charlotte Tilbury is cruelty
free and i would rather recommend
cruelty people cruelty free products to
you guys this one is awesome
unfortunately the Sephora collection
does test on animals so i won't
repurchase but this is my all-time
favorite mascara it's got a really tiny
little wand so it's very easy to get
into all those tiny little lashes on the
inner corner of your eyes as well as on
the outer corner of your eyes I love the
volume the curl it gives the like of
everything about it the definition
everything length definition volume it
is definitely one of those like trifecta
products it will just give you like a
three-in-one and it's awesome so really
happy about using that even though I am
almost done with it and it is currently
in the project pan I still want to make
sure I used up every last drop since I
love it alright for eyeliner this week i
will be using the it cosmetics no tug
waterproof anti-aging gel eyeliner in
you shave black this is beautiful on the
waterline now I do notice because it is
so like oily and kind of humectant it
doesn't stay as long on my waterline as
i would like but still super smooth and
easy to put on so I appreciate that as
far as lip products are concerned this
week i will be using my Too Faced lip
injection glossy in the shade milkshake
which looks like this it is a lip
plumper it is what I have on today and
then also my Sephora Rouge infusion tint
in the shaded tangerine so let me go
ahead and squash these for you guys I
know that when I swatch this 2401 it is
going to stain on my hand but it's okay
it's worth it this is a beautiful color
definitely not like a tangerine color
it's more of one of those like your lips
with better kind of shades but then the
Too Faced galazi or the lip injection
just has a really really sheer amount of
color to it I thought they'd actually
look really pretty layered together this
week so there are the two lip products
alright i will be baking this week with
my elf what is this call this is like
their sheer powder it's their HD powder
in sheer they definitely change the
formula on this but it's set my under
eye beautifully today I like to bake
underneath my eyes around the outer
corners of my mouth where I kind of
crease and I just thought those did a
really good job so very excited for that
and then to set in my whole entire face
i will be using the Catrice cosmetics
prime and find a mattifying powder this
particular shade is 010 translucent and
i have hit some pan on this so i'll see
if i can kind of finish that off this
week for bronzing this week i will be
using one of my all-time favorite
bronzers this is from physicians formula
it is the Muro Muro butter bronzer in
the shade light bronzer now I do prefer
the regular bronzer version but I am
wearing more warm tones this week so I
thought this one would be nice this one
definitely pulls a little more of a
reddish undertone whereas the bronzer
shade definitely just pulls like a true
kind of cool toned undertone but yeah
there it is right there beautiful on
pale skin would highly recommend if you
are fair complected and then I do have
this little sample right here of setting
spray it I want to use up it's from
urban decay it is the all nighter
long-lasting makeup setting spray I used
to buy these all the time especially
when they were on sale like to 430 but
now I don't because I do think that the
drugstore has just as good of setting
sprays out there so i am not going to
like purchase a full size of this but it
is nice and i do want to use it up and
then finally i will be wearing two
blushes from my tarts let's see here
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush line these
are from the naughty nudes collection I
think yeah the naughty nudes collection
the first shade is called risque which
looks like this this is like the formula
that I love from Tarte not like they're
fake like which is like you
know the palettes that are super super
powdery and gross this is like the real
deal these are the wonderful wonderful
blushes that lasts all day this
particular shade is called sensual and
the naughty nudes collection was such a
hit in my opinion so here is the shade
sensual I do have that one on today it's
like a light kind of bronze ishe kind of
similar to the physicians formula but it
leaves a little more of a peachy color
on my particular skin tone and then the
shade risque is beautiful it doesn't
look like much in the pan but it has a
really nice kind of plummy beautiful
undertone to it very very cool tone so
those are the two bushes I will be
wearing this week so anyway that is
everything let me know if you shopped
your stash this week let me know what
you're going to be
cheering and yeah I guess I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
