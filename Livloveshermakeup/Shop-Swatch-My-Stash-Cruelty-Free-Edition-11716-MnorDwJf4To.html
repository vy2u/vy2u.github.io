channel thank you so much for joining me
welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
this is where I share with you guys they
make up products that currently have on
my face and also the ones that I've
worried this week obviously I'm very
excited for this week shot my stash
because I'm going a hundred percent
cruelty-free that means every single
makeup product that i currently have on
my face and every single makeup product
that i show in this video is cruelty
free if you guys didn't know i
eventually do plan on having a
100-percent out a one hundred percent
cruelty free makeup collection and this
video was requested by one of you so
thank you for requesting it i am just
really really against animal testing
it's something that is near and dear to
my heart so I've been trying my best not
to purchase so much from brands like
L'Oreal and may believe that do a lot of
animal testing which is hard because my
favorite eye primer is from Maybelline
but anyway there are plenty of brands
out there that do not do animal testing
and the makeup that i'm going to show
you guys today is not animal tested so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
the first item that i will be using on
my face this week is the honest hacia
beverly hills stick foundation this is
what it looks like and the shade that I
where is called porcelain and I don't
have too much of this product's left let
me show you guys how much I have left so
and this honestly this didn't come with
that much product to begin with but I
only have about this much less and I'm
trying to save this kind of save it for
traveling over the holidays because I
will be traveling for thanksgiving i
will be traveling for christmas and also
my school I'm that I teach it does have
like a winter break so I plan on going
back to visit my parents during those
times and I want to take this with me
because I feel like it's perfect for
traveling but I'm worried I'm gonna run
out really quickly but here is a swatch
of it on the back of my hand it is a
really really beautiful foundation and I
do enjoy working with that so I would be
using that I also will be using my elf
makeup mist and set with a low green tea
cucumber and vitamins a c and e to set
in my makeup to foil my eyeshadows and
also before i go in with this foundation
i do like to spray down by buffing brush
a little bit just to make it a little
easier to blend into the skin because if
you guys didn't know stick foundations
tend to be a little more sticky and
tacky so you really want to make sure
you can buck them in quickly all right
as far as highlighting
concerned this week i will be using my
tart skin twinkle lighting palette this
is what it looks like I have this on
today I forgot how much I love this
highlighting palette so anyway inside of
here you are getting a setting powder in
the middle and if you are wondering y
minus L gouged out it is because this
came very very hard pressed it was like
sandpaper and sometimes with megha
products like this a big it like hard
pan immediately you do have to gouge
them out like duct tape wasn't doing it
so I am going to be using that middle
shade right here even though it looks
like i will be using that to set
underneath my eyes this week and then
you do get a highlight over here called
moonlight and one over here called
sunlight these are really beautiful i
love the consistency and texture on
these they are just absolutely
phenomenal so let me show you guys some
swatches so on the top we have sunlight
and then below what we have moonlight
moonlight has a little more of a pinky
tone and then sunlight obviously has a
little more of a yellow tone so i really
like both of those today i have sunlight
on down the ridge of my nose I have it
let's see here on my Cupid's bow on my
chin and then I have moonlight on at my
cheekbone so I really am excited to be
using that as far as a blush and
eyeshadow is concerned this week i will
be using both of my little um little
guys that I got here from my what was it
called a two-faced grand hotel cafe set
this is part of the Christmas in New
York collection if you guys didn't know
to theses a cruelty-free brand they are
also by favorite brand which is great
that they are cruelty-free so this is
what these two little palettes look like
they each have six I shadows in them in
either a bronzer or a blush so this is
gingerbread cookie and gingerbread
cookie is really really cute as you guys
can see and how they lovely bronzer at
the bottom and then those gorgeous
gorgeous shadows and some of these do
have to be foiled so I did want to go
ahead and point that out right away like
the really really glittery shades but I
did foil a few of these shades from the
eggnog latte palette today on my lid and
I love the way they look so there are a
few swatches of the gingerbread cookie
gingerbread cookies definitely my
favorite out of all three that came in
the set yes there were three different
palettes that came but I am decluttering
the one called what was it peppermint
mocha just because I felt like these
shadows were not as good as they were in
these two pallets so that is the first
level eyeshadow palette and also bronzer
that I will be wearing this week and
then also we have eggnog latte and
eggnog latte is what I have
eyes currently today and also my cheeks
so the blushing here is called peach
cobbler it is absolutely beautiful I'm
obsessed with this blush if they ever
release this in a full size I'm getting
it I'm wearing it on the apples of my
cheeks today I went ahead and used
frosty nog all over my lid and then I
did foil the shade in the middle which
is the gold one all over my lid as well
I really like the way it came out I put
ice coffee this shade right here into my
crease and then I work to this one into
my outer V and this on my lower lash
line so I really like the way the look
came out I think these are quite easy to
blend and very pretty so let me show you
guys some so watch is as well so there
are a few swatches of this palette I
love the base through in that green I
think it's just so so so beautiful and
this blush is literally life it is
everything I am obsessed so there are
some swatches of the eggnog latte
palette alright moving on as far as
mascara is concerned this week I will be
pairing together to like I usually do
the first one is one that I actually was
using this past week it is the
Wet'n'Wild max volume plus mascara and
this is getting better and better than
more it dries out and it's giving pehle
dry so i feel like i will have to toss
this one soon but i thought i would get
one more um a few more juices out of it
at least one more week so i will be
using that and i also will be topping it
with by NARS audacious mascara so nars
is a completely cruelty-free brand but i
do want to mention that they are owned
by shiseido and she sado is not so the
people the osha sada also owned this
brand they own let's see here bare
minerals and also buxom and i believe
their minerals and buxom are both
cruelty-free I think I know norsk is
completely but I just want to put that
out there that yes just 80 is a brand
that doesn't test on animals but anyway
here is what the NARS audacious want
looks like it's beautiful very flexible
so I'm going to be using that one first
and then going in with the wet and wild
because I want to do like a what kind of
coke mascara and then go in with a dry
coat and then for lips this week I would
be using a two of my lime crime lipid
Velveteen that these are really really
comfortable liquid lipsticks the shade
that I have on right now is called riot
and I also will be using Salem witch I
loved that name so the shade riot is
just a beautiful beautiful kind of rosy
color to the one that I have on right
now and these are probably one of the
only liquid lipstick formulations that I
am truly obsessed with I think they are
so comfortable and beautiful
I did some practicing this morning it
still looks good I feel like it's not
too dry on my lips yes my lips are a
little dry so you can still see a little
bit of like crumb not crumbling a little
bit of sinking into like fine lines and
wrinkles on my lips but there's no
crumbling that's what I was going to say
that i love is that these do not crumble
on the lip so here are the two shades
the first one like i said is riot which
is more of that new d pinky color or
kind of like a your loaf of better color
i always say that your lives look better
and then here we have salem which is a
dark chocolaty Brown and I thought that
would be beautiful tear together with
the gingerbread cookie palette so i will
be wearing those on my lips as far as
priming is concerned i will be using my
essence i heart stage eyeshadow base now
this is a little dark on my actual eyes
so i'm going to be mixing it together
with the kat von d locket concealer
creme in the shade whiteout I really
love this and obviously Kat Von D is
completely vegan and also cruelty-free
and lime crime is out so vegan if you
guys are looking for vegan products but
anyway this is a beautiful beautiful
concealer I do like mixing it together
with eyeshadows for or not I shadows but
i like to use it as an eyeshadow base it
can be used that way and also i like to
mix it together with the it cosmetics
bye bye Brenda's neutralizing cream
underneath my eyes so I'm going to be
using all three of those products as far
as eyeliners are concerned this week i
will be using my Urban Decay 24-7 glide
on eye pencils in these shades 0 and
also wrote yes like cockroach kind of
gross but the shade Roach is what I have
on my waterline of right now and that is
the brown shade and then the black shade
is called zero these are both really
really beautiful I like the way they go
on to the eyes and urban decay is a
cruelty-free brand and finally the last
item that i will be using this week is
the Beca backlight priming of filter
this is currently in my project pan
video you guys can see it's just all
uneven everywhere but yeah i started
about right there and i am trying to use
this up by december first so i really
really want to be using this i'm going
to use only this primer for the rest of
the month so anyway guys that is
everything that i will be using on my
face this week i hope you guys enjoyed
this and maybe introduce you to a few
products that are cruelty-free thank you
so much for joining me guys but i just
thought
