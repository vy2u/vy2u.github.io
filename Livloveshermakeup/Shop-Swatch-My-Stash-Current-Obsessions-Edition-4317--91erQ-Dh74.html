welcome back to my channel I hope that
you guys can see me a little better
today I am NOT sitting on my pillow a
few of you were saying i might get ready
with me video that you prefer when i
actually sit just normally i'm super
short i'm only 52 a lot of you were
saying you prefer when I sit like this
so that you can see my whole entire face
I normally just sit up because I just
feel like it's better and I can usually
reach my products better beneath me if I
do have a pillow but I hope you guys
liked this better so anyway today we
have shop and swatch my stash as usual
this is a series I do every single week
on my channel on Mondays where I shot my
makeup stash and I use those products
for the week now this week is going to
be a little different you guys cuz I'm
gonna do current obsessions normally
when I shot my stash I am very good at
staying true to the products that I
chose out but I have noticed recently I
haven't really been reshop in my stash
but there are certain products that I
have been pulling in with the other
items that I shot my stash for if that
makes sense so I thought today I would
just go ahead and this week i'll just
use those products that i have been so
intrigued with and i would just use them
for the whole week and kind of get the
makeup look that I really want to create
i have been using this makeup for I
think the past four or five shows i've
done like performances and things like
that so you know that i'm really into
them so anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into it for primers this week i
will be using my YSL to shake off this
is a beautiful blurring a primer for the
face it is silicone base and its really
really nice and then for eye primer i
will be using my Maybelline master prime
i do where the lighter shade and this is
my all-time favorite eye primer alright
for eyeshadow this week i will be using
my Too Faced peanut butter and jelly
palette I adore this you guys I know
that some of you got really really bad
palettes kind of like how I got a bad at
natural love palette and kind of like
how I probably got a bad peanut butter
and honey palette but I got a really
good peanut butter and jelly palette
these are beautiful they're very very
pigmented I do have them on my eyes
today let me show you guys what shades
I'm wearing so the first one is extra
creamy which is just a nice way to brow
bomb shade and I'm wearing that all over
my lid and then I did take the shade to
spread the love and use that as I use
that as my transition and then I did go
in with the shade and that's about you
which is probably the hardest one to
blend out of all of them it is right
there and I use that in my crease but I
still feel like I got it to blend nicely
so anyway let me to watch those for you
guys and then I
show you the eyeshadow single that i'm
also using so here are those three
shades that i have on my eyes from the
peanut butter and honey palette and then
on my lid and on my lower lash line i
did go ahead and pull in my play do
crush metallic eyeshadow in the shade
eclipse these are stunning these are
only like what four or five dollars at
the drugstore really really good
pigmentation on these you guys seriously
they're really really good and that is
what the shade it looks like so those
are all the shades that I have on my
eyes today I feel like it gives a really
nice pretty warm toned I look that's
kind of just a very very soft focus you
know it's not anything at too harsh and
these are really really easy to blend so
I put that look together in probably
about five minutes today literally both
eyes and you guys know me I'm all about
that easy life when it comes to
eyeshadows so those are the eyeshadows
they'll be using this week and then also
I thought I would pull in another
eyeshadow single i noticed that i always
neglect my eyeshadow singles my duo's my
trios things like that so i thought i
would pull in my L'Oreal infallible
eyeshadow in the shade amber rush this
is kind of like a pressed pigment and
this one and the Palais do they don't
really work very well into the crease
because they have that really foil
consistency i would recommend using
these on the lower lash line and on the
lid but this is what amber rush looks
like and I'm just very excited to use
these this week I think they'll go
beautifully absolutely beautiful with Z
look at that swatch I think these will
go beautifully with the peanut butter
and jelly palette so super super excited
to use them all right as far as
foundation is concerned this week i will
be using my Shores your money luminous
silk foundation I do where the shade at
number 2 which is the lightest out of
all of them I don't even believe they
have a shade number one it doesn't lean
a little bit on the yellow tone side and
I know if you were saying really your
self tanned right now yes I am currently
self tan I know I'm pale as you know
what but yeah I do think this is a
little too yellow tone for me even when
I do have a little bit of self tanner on
I only put one layer on this week but
yes I am self hand this is me self tan
which is pretty bad but anyway this is a
beautiful foundation I do want to find a
cruelty-free option for you guys I've
heard these Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation is very similar so I think
you've tried that out but yeah that is
the foundation i'll be using this week
and then i do want to go ahead and reach
for my color correctors these just
remind me of Easter time these are the
urban decay naked skin color correcting
fluids in these
lavender pink and yellow so what I did
today was I used pink and yellow
underneath my eyes I kind of just did
little stripes and then on my eyelids
and I really like the way it turns out
because they do have a little bit of
color right now the yellow was a nice
pair together with the pink so those are
the color correctors i'll be using this
week and then the lavender one a lot of
people ask me where i actually use this
so what I do with this is I put it on
areas where my skin looks a little more
solo or I have a lot of like
discoloration and after this last lupus
flare-up I was left with a lot of like
yellow tones around my mouth a little
bit here almost like melasma and then on
the sides of my forehead so that is
where I use this it's also really nice
and kind of plumping up fine lines and
wrinkles so again around your eye area
or around your mouth is really really
good all right as far as a blush and
bronzer and highlight are concerned or
not really bronzer but blush and
highlight are concerned I will be
reaching for my Jacqueline heel
champagne collection face palette this
is my all-time favorite face palette I
know that I'm not on subscribe to Jaclyn
hill but this is my all-time favorite
face palette so this is what it looks
like you do get to a different Matt
they're more like I would describe them
as satin blushes in these shades this
one right here is Pomplamoose and this
one right here is amaretto and then you
do get a luminous flush blush which I
love the formula on these this
particular shade is called rose a spritz
and then you do have champagne pop as
well as Prosecco pop which is now
permanent to the Bekaa lines you can get
these still and I believe two of these
are also permanent so anyway I am
wearing at the shade of pomplamoose
today as my actual blush and then I
layered the two of these together as my
highlight I put champagne pop on first
and then Prosecco pop on top so let me
go ahead and swash those for you guys I
just love this palette it really is my
all-time favorite face palette I don't
know what it is about this that just
makes me so happy I know that champagne
pop and Prosecco pop or even a little
dark on my skin tone um but these are
just so beautiful I just love the way
they go onto the skin I thought this was
the best out of the whole entire
collection that they released I hope
that face products were really really
good and I did not like the little eyes
slim sticks I did not really like the
Irish shadow palette but I did love this
palette and I did like the Becca split
pan so anyway that is what i will be
using this week as far as blush and
highlight is concerned and if i do want
to bronze a little bit that shade
amaretto is gorgeous on fair skin you
can kind of like sculpt your nose area
or do a little bit of light contouring
because it's kind of
hey Rosie tan shade if that makes sense
so really nice if you do pull a cool
undertone like idea alright next i will
be using my skin to Navia post makeup
recovery spray I've really been into
this lately this was sent to me for PR
and I don't use it the way that you're
supposed to I find it does nothing for
me post makeup but it's really nice at
just setting the face and lightly it has
a really nice nozzle and actual sprayer
as you guys can see comes out very
lightly and it's not gonna like squirt
unevenly all over your face so i will be
using that to foil my eyeshadows as well
as set my face in i do want to use a
concealer as well this is currently in
my project pan it is the Maybelline
master concealed by face studio
camouflaging concealer in the shade at
number 10 at fair it does it does pull a
little bit of a yellow undertone so it's
very nice underneath the eyes if you do
want to cancel out some blue tones so
i'll be using that and then just set my
face in i will be using my L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte 16-hour powder now
this does run a little too dark for me
so I will be topping it with my by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder um this is just
aid what does it call a colourless
Heydrich hair powder this was sent to me
for PR and I really do love it it's just
a silica powder but this is what did the
L'Oreal looks like and I have no idea if
it's going to show up on camera but it
does kind of darken up on the skin a
little bit however it really makes your
skin look perfected let me zoom you guys
in today so you can kind of see what my
skin is looking like I've been wearing
on my makeup for quite a few hours here
and I just love the way that this sets
my face and it makes it look very very
flawless and just super super beautiful
oops super super beautiful so anyway
I've enjoyed that a lot and then as far
as mascara is concerned this week I will
be pairing together my long home Hypnose
drama with my L'Oreal telescopic carbon
black mascara I have no idea where the
Lancome is right now but I've shown that
a million times just got that nice
natural bristle wand with a super super
wet formula and then here is the L'Oreal
telescopic it's got a very small slender
flexible wand so it's very nice for
lengthening the lashes and I thought the
two of those worked pretty well today
they got a little clumpy and that is
because I forgot how wet of a formula
this one is so I'm thinking of letting
the Lancome kind of dry before going in
with this one and then for brows this
week I'm gonna go a little thicker with
my brows I've been doing this on stage
lately and I really like the way it
looks when I watch videos back or when I
watch action
like phone photos back when I look at
photos back I don't know but this is the
revlon colorstay brow pencil in blonde
you guys know I've been obsessed with
this lately and basically what I've been
doing is just kind of over lining my
brows towards the top I find that if I
fill them in more towards the bottom it
looks very unnatural so just kind of
fill them in towards the top and just
over Phil and I think it looks really
nice so you do have the brow definer on
one side and that is what it looks like
this does lean a little more on the cool
tone side kind of like a topi shade and
then you do have the spoolie on the
other so really been enjoying that the
only thing i don't like about this is
that it is a very very tacky and kind of
wet formula so sometimes you want to
make sure that you do go in with some
sort of like a brow gel to kind of hold
it in place I do notice that I get
fallout from this which is kind of
strange and then as far as my lips is
concerned I've been loving this lip trio
or combo here so the first one is the
what is it Urban Decay 24-7 glide on lip
pencil in the shade at Naked 2 i'm going
to line my lips with that then i'm going
to go in with my tart striking
lipsurgence lip creme now the problem
with these is that they go outside the
lip line really easily i was practicing
a little this morning and you can
probably see them it already messed up
around my lip line but this is what it
looks like it is a beautiful shade of
super super full pigment as you guys can
see and it does have a little bit of a
glossy Sheen to it now this is not
completely warm toned and i'm kind of
going for like a warm tone thing this
week so i thought i would go ahead and
put this on top but this is the all may
what is it rosy lips all make color plus
care lip balm one of you recommended
these to me i would say probably about
four months ago i purchased two of them
and I love them so I'm just going to be
going ahead and layering this on top and
you can see it makes it really glossy
and gives a little more of a warm toned
by so that is the lip combo I'll be
wearing this week and then for eyeliner
I thought it would be perfect to pull in
my next slide on glide on stay on and
definitely a turn on eyeliner in the
shade golden bronze this is amazing if
you have like oh my god if you have blue
eyes you need this in your life it's
beautiful it's got more of a copper sort
of tone to it and I feel like it's going
to pair beautifully with that palladio
crushed eyeshadow like the two of these
together yes all right and then
last thing that i will be using this
week is another blush the one thing that
I feel like is missing from the Becca
champagne collection face palette is a
nice like warm toned almost orangi blush
and I love this one I've gone through
four of these you guys since I was a
senior in high school this is the knicks
p b 08 blush industry cinnamon this is
their old-school one and i don't even
think they have these anymore but you do
have a new formula and they do have this
particular shade it looks so scary when
you swatch it out but I swear to you if
you have fair skin and you use a fluffy
brush this looks absolutely beautiful on
the skin so anyway that is the guys
those are the products i'm gonna be
using on my face this week definitely
let me know down below if you shopped
your stash and yeah i hope you guys
enjoyed this thank you so much for
joining me and i'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
