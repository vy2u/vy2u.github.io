back to my channel I hope that you guys
can see me a little better today I am
not sitting on my pillow a few of you
were saying I might get ready with me
video that you prefer when I actually
sit just normally I'm super short I'm
only 5 - but a lot of you were saying
you preferred when I sit like this so
that you can see my whole entire face I
normally just sit up because I just feel
like it's better and I can usually reach
my products better beneath me if I do
have a pillow but I hope you guys like
this better so anyway uh today we have
shop and swatch my stash as usual this
is a series I do every single week on my
channel on Mondays where I shot my
makeup stash and I use those products
for the week now this week is going to
be a little different you guys cuz I'm
gonna do current obsessions normally
when I shot my stash I am very good at
staying true to the products that I
chose out but I have noticed recently I
haven't really been reshot my stash but
there are certain products that I have
been pulling in with the other items
that I shot my stash for if that makes
sense so I thought today I would just go
ahead and this week I'll just use those
products that I have been so intrigued
with and I would just use them for the
whole week and kind of get the makeup
look that I really want to create I have
been using this makeup for I think the
past four or five shows I've done like
performances and things like that so you
know that I'm really into them so anyway
let's go ahead and jump right into it
for primers this week I will be using my
Elias L to shake ah this is a beautiful
blurring a primer for the face it is
silicone base and it's really really
nice and then for eye primer I will be
using my Maybelline master prime I do
wear the lighter shade and this is my
all-time favorite eye primer alright for
eyeshadow this week I will be using my
Too Faced peanut butter and jelly
palette I adore this you guys I know
that some of you got really really bad
palates kind of like how I got a bad and
natural love palette and kind of like
how I probably got a bad peanut butter
and honey palette but I got a really
good peanut butter and jelly palette
these are beautiful they're very very
pigmented I do have them on my eyes
today let me show you guys what shades
I'm wearing so the first one is extra
creamy which is just a nice way to brow
balm shade and I'm wearing that all over
my lid and then I did take these shade
to spread the love and use that as I've
used that as my transition and then I
did go in with the shade and that's
about you which is probably the hardest
one to blend out of all of them it is
right there and I use that in my crease
but I still feel like I got it to blend
nicely so anyway let me swatch those for
you guys and then I
show you the eyeshadow single that I'm
also using so here are those three
shades that I have on my eyes from the
peanut butter and honey palette and then
on my lid and on my lower lash line I
did go ahead and pull in at my Palladio
crush metallic eyeshadow in the shade of
clips these are stunning these are only
like what four or five dollars at the
drugstore really really good
pigmentation on these you guys seriously
they're really really good and that is
what the shade it looks like so those
are all the shades that I have on my
eyes today I feel like it gives a really
nice pretty warm tone to I look that's
kind of just a very very soft focus you
know it's not anything it's too harsh
and these are really really easy to
blend so I put that look together in
probably about five minutes today
literally both eyes and you guys know me
I'm all about that easy life when it
comes to eyeshadows so those are the
eyeshadows I'll be using this week and
then also I thought I would pull in
another eyeshadow single I noticed that
I always neglect my eyeshadow singles my
duo's my trios things like that so I
thought I would pull in my L'Oreal
infallible eyeshadow in the shade and
brush this is kind of like a pressed
pigment and this one and the Palladio
they don't really work very well into
the crease because they have that really
foil consistency I would recommend using
these on the lower lash line and on the
lid but this is what amber brush looks
like and I'm just very excited to use
these this week I think they'll go
beautifully absolutely beautiful with
Zee look at that swatch I think these
will go beautifully with the peanut
butter and jelly palette so super super
excited to use them all right as far as
foundation is concerned this week I will
be using my Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation I do wear these shade at
number two which is the lightest out of
all of them I don't even believe they
have a shade number one it doesn't lean
a little bit on the yellow tone side and
I know a few of you are saying really
yourself tanned right now yes I am
currently self tan I know I'm pale as
you know what but yeah I do think this
is a little too yellow tone for me even
when I do have a little bit of
self-tanner on I only put one layer on
this week but yes I am self tan this is
me self tan which is pretty sad but
anyway this is the beautiful foundation
I do want to find a cruelty free option
for you guys I've heard these Charlotte
Tilbury magic foundation is very similar
so I think you've tried that out but
yeah that is the foundation I'll be
using this week and then I do want to go
ahead and reach for my color correctors
these just reminds me of Easter time
these are the Urban Decay Naked skin
color correcting fluids in the shades
lavender pink and yellow so what I did
today was I just pink and yellow
underneath my eyes I kind of just did a
little stripes and then on my eyelids
and I really like the way it turned out
because they do have a little bit of
color right now the yellow it was a nice
pair together with the pink so those are
the color correctors I'll be using this
week and then the lavender one a lot of
people asked me where I actually use
this so what I do with this is I put it
on areas where my skin looks a little
more sallow or I have a lot of like
discoloration and after this last lupus
flare up I was left with a lot of like
yellow tones around my mouth a little
bit here almost like melasma and then on
the sides of my forehead so that is
where I use this it's also really nice
and kind of plumping up fine lines and
wrinkles so again around your eye area
or around your mouth is really really
good all right as far as the blush and
bronzer and highlights are concerned or
not really bronzer but blush and
highlight are concerned I will be
reaching for my Jacqueline heel
champagne collection face palette this
is my all-time favorite face palette I
know that I'm not on subscribe to
Jacqueline Hale but this is my all-time
favorite face palette so this is what it
looks like you do get to a different
matte there more like I would describe
them as satin blushes in these shades
this one right here is Pomplamoose and
this one right here is amaretto and then
you do get a luminous flushed blush
which I love the formula on these this
particular shade is called rose a spritz
and then you do have champagne pop as
well as Prosecco pop which is now
permanent to the Becca line so you can
get these still and I believe two of
these are also permanent so anyway I am
wearing at these shade of Pomplamoose
today as my actual blush and then I
layered the two of these together as my
highlight
I put champagne pop on first and then
Prosecco pop on top so let me go ahead
and swatch those for you guys I just
love this palette it really is my
all-time favorite face palette I don't
know what it is about this that just
makes me so happy I know that champagne
pop and Prosecco pop or even a little
dark on my skintone but these are just
so beautiful I just love the way they go
onto the skin I thought this was the
best out of the whole entire collection
that they released I thought that face
products were really really good and I
did not like the little eyes slim Stix I
did not really like the IRA shadow
palette but I did love this palette and
I did like the Becca split pea
so anyway that is what I will be using
this week as far as blush and highlight
is concerned and if I do want to bronze
a little bit that shade amaretto is
gorgeous on fair skin you can kind of
like sculpt your nose area or do a
little bit of light contouring because
it's kind of like a rosy tan shade if
that makes sense so really nice if you
do pull a cool undertone like I do all
right max I will be using my skin to
navy a post makeup recovery spray I've
really been into this lately this was
sent to me for PR and I don't use it the
way that you're supposed to I find it
does nothing for me post makeup but it's
really nice of just setting the face and
lightly it has a really nice nozzle and
actual sprayer as you guys can see comes
out very lightly and it's not gonna like
squirt it unevenly all over your face so
I will be using that to foil my
eyeshadows as well as set my face in I
do want to use a concealer as well this
is currently in my project pan it is the
Maybelline master concealed by face
Studio camouflaging concealer in the
shade at Number ten at fair it does it
does pull a little bit of a yellow
undertone so it's very nice underneath
the eyes if you do want to cancel out
some blue tone so I'll be using that and
then just set my face in I will be using
my L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 16 hour
powder now this does run a little too
dark for me so I will be topping it with
my by Terry hyaluronic hydra powder um
this is just aid what does it call a
colorless hydra care powder this was
sent to me for PR and i really do love
it it's just a silica powder but this is
what did the l'oreal looks like and i
have no idea if it's gonna show up on
camera but it does kind of darken up on
the skin a little bit however it really
makes your skin look perfect it let me
assume you guys in today so you can kind
of see what my skin is looking like I've
been wearing up my makeup for quite a
few hours here and I just love the way
that this sets my face and it makes it
look very very flawless and just super
super beautiful oops
super super beautiful so anyway I have
been enjoying that a lot and then as far
as mascara is concerned this week I will
be pairing together my Lancome Hypnose
drama with my L'Oreal telescopic carbon
black mascara I have no idea where the
Lancome is right now but I've shown that
a million times it's got that nice
natural bristle wand with a super super
wet formula and then here is the L'Oreal
telescopic it's got a very small slender
flexible wand so it's very nice for
lengthening the lashes and I thought the
two of those worked pretty well today
they got a little clumpy and that is
because I forgot how wet of a formula
this one is
so I'm thinking of letting the Lancome
kind of dry before going in with this
one and then for brows this week I'm
gonna go a little thicker with my brows
I've been doing this on stage lately and
I really like the way it looks when I
watch videos back or when i watch i'm
actual like photos back when i look at
photos back i don't know but this is the
revlon colorstay brow pencil in blonde
you guys know I've been obsessed with
this lately and basically what I've been
doing is just kind of over lining my
brows towards the top I find that if I
fill them in more towards the bottom it
looks very unnatural so just kind of
fill them in towards the top and just
overfill and I think it looks really
nice so you do have me brow definer on
one side and that is what it looks like
this does lean a little more on the cool
tone side kind of like a topi shade and
then you do have the spoolie on the
other so really been enjoying that the
only thing I don't like about this is
that it is a very very tacky and kind of
wet formula so sometimes you want to
make sure that you do go in with some
sort of like a brow gel to kind of hold
it in place I do notice that I get
fallout from this which is kind of
strange and then as far as my lips is
concerned I've been loving this lip trio
or combo here so the first one is the
what is that urban decay 24/7 glide-on
lip pencil in the shade naked - I'm
gonna line my lips with that then I'm
gonna go in with my Tarte striking lip
surgence lip creme and now the problem
with these is that they go outside the
lip line really easily I was practicing
aloe this morning and you can probably
see that it already messed up around my
lip line but this is what it looks like
it is a beautiful shade of super super
full pigment as you guys can see and it
does have a little bit of a glossy Sheen
to it now this is not completely warm
toned and I'm kind of going for like a
warm tone thing this week so I thought I
would go ahead and put this on top but
this is the all maiya
what is it rosy lips all make color plus
care lip balm one of you recommended
these to me I would say probably about
four months ago I purchased two of them
and I loved them so I'm just going to be
going ahead and layering this on top and
you can see it makes it really glossy
and gives it a little more of informe
toned vibe so that is the lip combo I'll
be wearing this week and then for
eyeliner I thought it would be perfect
to pull in my next slide on glide on
stay on and definitely a turn-on
eyeliner in the shade golden bronze this
is amazing if you have like oh my god if
you have blue eyes you need this in your
life it's beautiful it's got more of a
copper sort of tone to it and I feel
like it's gonna pair beautifully with
that Palladio crushed eyeshadow like the
two of these together yes
all right and then the last thing that I
will be using this week is another blush
the one thing that I feel like I see
missing from the Becca champagne
collection face palette is a nice like
warm toned almost orange II blush and I
love this one I've gone through four of
these you guys since I was a senior in
high school this is the NYX pb0 H blush
in the trade cinnamon this is their old
school one and I don't even think they
have these anymore but they do have a
new formula and they do have this
particular shade it looks so scary when
you swatch it out but I swear to you if
you have fair skin and you use a fluffy
brush this looks absolutely beautiful on
the skin so anyway that is it guys those
are the products I'm gonna be using on
my face this week definitely let me know
down below if you shopped your stash and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
