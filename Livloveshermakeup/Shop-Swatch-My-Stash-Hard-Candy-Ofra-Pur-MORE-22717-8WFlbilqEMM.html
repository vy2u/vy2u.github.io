welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products i currently have on my face and
of course the makeup products that i
will be using this week basically
products that I've shopped my collection
for so I like to focus on certain items
every week so that I can make it through
my entire collection because I have a
very large collection and yeah that's
pretty much it let's go ahead and jump
right into it I'm sorry if my voice
sounds a little horse today I'm not
quite sure if I'm getting sick or what
but sometimes it keeps like dropping
like it's cracking so if you hear my
voice cracking that's why it's pretty
gross hey wait little bottom jump right
into it so the first item that I want to
use this week is from to face it is the
peanut butter and honey palette now I'm
going to be going ahead and pulling in
another eyeshadow palette with this
because if you guys didn't know I did a
first impressions of this probably about
two days ago and I wasn't super super
impressed it's not a palette that really
inspires me when I open it up this is
what it looks like on the inside and
again I don't feel like the actual
camera does it justice the shades are
actually quite pretty when you're
looking at them but I created an eye
look for you guys in that first
impressions and I wasn't super super
impressed so I do want to play with this
as well as another pallet the sweet but
the two shades that I do have on today
are honey brittle and honey butter so
honey brittle i am using as my
transition and then honey butter I do or
I'm sorry honey buns I actually have on
my lid and here are the swatches for you
guys so here is hunny buns and here is
hunny brittle now the eyeshadow palette
I will be pulling in with that one is
the violet boss ride-or-die palette and
the shades that I am wearing in this one
today are Stephanie as well as Ashley
and also Jane so this has 42 different
eyeshadows in it I thought that this
little yellow row right here I could
work with the honey bun shade from the
honey ah keep wanting to say honey
butter palette from a peanut butter and
honey palette so yeah I am wearing those
three shades today let me show you guys
what they look like oh my goodness the
first shade is Stephanie which is this
beautiful beautiful kind of bronze a
shade this one right here is that Matt
Ashley shade and then this one is Jane
so I am wearing all of those shades on
my eyes today I really like the way the
look came out I think it looks like a
very very kind of like peanut butter and
honey burnt sandwich so anyway those are
the eyeshadows I will be playing with
this week as far as blushes are
concerned i will be using a two of the
hard candy baked blushes these are
beautiful i used to wear the out of
these when i was in college this
first one right here is called honeymoon
which is a peachy color with a little
bit of a purple shift to it now if you
do have a very deep complexion this is
definitely going to be a highlighter on
you and actually right now this
particular show you probably would be
more of a highlight on me but I will be
building them up as blush this week so
there is the shade honeymoon and then
the one I have on my cheeks right now is
called living doll and this one has a
very very cool tone to it as you guys
can see with a little bit of warmth from
that yellow running through it so there
is the shade of living doll these are
beautiful and if you didn't know hard
candy is a cruelty-free drugstore brand
so those are the two blushes I will be
wearing this week and then as far as
highlight is concerned I thought I would
go ahead and reach for my Oprah
cosmetics Rodeo Drive high later I have
not reached for this in a very long time
it's beautiful Oprah is cruelty free and
it's just so smooth and creamy this
formula now this is the original one
this one has more of like as you guys
can see a golden or kind of champagne
color to it I believe they just released
a new one that actually has a little
more of like a pinky undertone which I
think would be great for my skin tone
but this is still really really
beautiful so there it is and I do have
that on as my actual highlight today
alright so now let's jump into what I
will be wearing as my base I will be
wearing the clinic beyond perfecting
foundation + concealer I do wear these
shades 0.5 this will obviously be my
foundation this runs a little dark on me
and also it does oxidize throughout the
day I thought it would be a good pick
for me this week while I still have a
little bit of tan remaining from Hawaii
so anyway that is what the actual
foundation looks like and then I want to
use some color correctors so i will just
one color corrector i should say this is
from urban decay it is the naked skin
color correcting fluid in the shade
yellow I absolutely love this and if you
guys didn't know I can't remember if I
talked about it on snapchat or not but
we will be having a house guest this
week one of tom's friends is coming in
she's going to be here for a week so i
feel like i'm gonna be balancing YouTube
work and also having a houseguest I'm
gonna be pretty tired so I thought it
would be nice to have a good yellow
corrector for underneath my eyes and
then I also want to pull in this
concealer right here this is from
Neutrogena i recently did a first
impressions on this I hated the
hydrating tint but I do like this this
is the
neutrogena Hydra Bruce hydrating
concealer with hyaluronic acid in the
shade fair this is very very yellow
toned apparently Neutrogena thinks this
is the lightest skin colors can go kind
of like Maybelline but anyway that is
what it looks like it is quite a thin
but nice formula and it's very beautiful
underneath the eyes and four spot
concealing all right and then as far as
primer is concerned i will be using my
put a lid on it eyelid primer from the
bomb cosmetics this is a beautiful
beautiful silicon-based I primer really
helps to kind of smooth out the eyelid
and then as far as face primer is
concerned i will be using the pure
cosmetics no filter blurring photography
primer now this was sent to me in
exchange for an honest review from pure
cosmetics as well as oculi i used it for
the first time today and i'm honestly
slightly confused so this is what it
looks like it's like a drop or form as
you guys can see it comes out and kind
of like a thick formula almost like
hyaluronic acid you know when you drop
it onto your hand it's like a little
bubble that is what it looks like and
you guys can see it looks like it's very
pearlized but then you rub it in do you
guys see that has like the strongest
gold shift ever to it it kind of reminds
me a little bit of like the Becca
backlight priming filter but that one
has more of like a neutral color to it
so it's not too cool toned over to warm
toned this is incredibly incredibly warm
toned I did not notice any sort of
hydrating benefits and it definitely
didn't like Phil in my pores so I'm not
quite sure if I'm going to like this but
obviously I need to wear it throughout
the day and see if it actually does
prolonged aware of my makeup I will keep
you guys updated on that and talk about
it in my fields and holy grails on
Sundays for setting spray i will be
using the NYX Julie finish long-lasting
setting spray I love this setting spray
it's really really good for foiling
eyeshadows it's good as a primer spray
and also to set in your whole entire
face I will be baking with my Kat Von D
locket translucent setting powder I'm
just trying to get through this at this
point so that is what it looks like and
I have been loving baking lately for
eyeliner i will be using the steel of
smudge stick waterproof eyeliner
initiate damsel ever since teyla
announced that they went cruelty-free
i've been reaching for more of my steelo
products in my collection because i'm
like yes well done steal a so anyway
that is what the shade looks like it is
a very cool toned um almost like plummy
color but it's like the darkest
chocolate brown ever i do have it on at
my lower lash line today smudged out as
well as on my waterline and also on my
tight line
it really really makes blue eyes pop so
if you have blue eyes this can make it
pop it's beautiful beautiful beautiful
and it's almost like a dark black color
but it's like not it's just a hair
lighter than what if that makes sense
all right for eyebrows i will be using
my revlon colorstay brow pencil in the
shade blonde been using that for weeks
and weeks of weeks ow and then as far as
mascara is concerned I will be layering
together the dior diorshow mascara so
this is what that one looks like it has
a natural bristle wand and then on top
of that i will be putting at my Laura
Mercier extra leche sculpting mascara in
the shade black onyx now this one has a
really tricky wand it literally is like
a medieval torture device and it feels
like a torture tool when you are using
it on your lower lashes because they
poked me in the eye all the time very
very scary wand but it gives beautiful
definition on the upper lashes so very
excited for that I will be setting my
face in with the Rimmel stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder in the shade
transparent this week it does have a
little more of a yellow tone to it but
right now I still am slightly tan for my
trip I do want to do a little bit of
contouring this week very very soft
contouring with this Maybelline Dream
wonder powder this particular shade is
called let's see here 10 porcelain ivory
and it's definitely darker than my skin
tone it may not look like it but it is
it leans very very cool toned and I just
thought I could do some light contouring
so that is what it looks like i will
also be using this little lip balm here
this week i recently found this in my
collection and i was like oh my god I
have to start using this again it is the
soft lips cube it does have a non
titanium dioxide it has a chemical sun
block in it which is great during the
day and I will be layering that with of
course lip products this week so I did
choose out three different shades that I
want to work with these are all really
nice creamy kind of lip glosses the
first one is from NOAA cosmetics i
believe i got this any subscription box
a few months ago such gorgeous packaging
do you guys see that it has like little
cherry blossoms on the front really love
that anyway this particular shade is
called mel back mal bc and it reminds me
a lot of the NARS velvet lip glide of
formula which I am absolutely obsessed
with I need to get all those they are
amazing so this is the shade Malbec it's
a beautiful beautiful kind of purply
peak color it's actually very very
unique and then the second one I will be
wearing is the one I have on my lips
right now this is the
two-faced sweet peach creamy peach lip
oil gloss in the shade Papa don't peach
which is a nice nude and this one's
obviously a little more warm toned I
thought it would go together well with
the warm toned I that I have on today so
here is the shade Papa domed peach so
there's Malbec and then there is Papa
don't peach and then finally I did have
to pull out my NARS velvet lip glide in
the shade bound this is just like my
everyday friendly beautiful lip gloss
that I have been wearing lately and
really obsessed with this formula and
this one has a cool undertone with a
little bit of like a mob eNOS to it so
those are the three lip colors that i
will be using this week and i'm super
excited to play with them so anyway that
is everything I will be using for shot
my stash and what I will be using on my
face this week I would love to hear down
below if you picked out any special
items that you want to focus on this
week and yeah thank you so much for
joining me guys I will see you tomorrow
