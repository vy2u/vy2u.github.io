welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products that i currently have on my
face and also be makeup products that i
will be using all week let's go ahead
and get started with primers and the two
primers i will be using this week are
the becca backlight prime in the filter
and also the benefit air patrol this is
a BB eyelid primer and then this is a
face primer this is currently in my
project pan so I really wanted to go
ahead and reach for that a little more I
will be going ahead and doing some color
correcting last week I used my urban
decay naked skin color correcting fluid
in the shade peach because I really had
a rough week not a lot of sleep and I
knew that I was going to have under eye
circles but this week i'm actually going
to be using the lavender shade i really
like this for basically picking out like
sallowness in the skin I know that
sounds kind of weird but like kind of
filling in fine lines and wrinkles and
also getting rid of any yellow tones in
the skin so i will be using that this
week which i'm very excited about and
then for foundation this week i'm
actually going to be using more of like
a yellow toned foundation so again this
color corrector is going to be very
helpful this is the laura geller baked
liquid radiance foundation with color
correcting pigments of the shade is
called porcelain and this does run a
very very yellow toned i will show you
guys right now even with my self tanner
on right now this just runs to yellow on
me but that is what it looks like I do
like the way that this goes on to the
skin and I did make it work today so I'm
excited to play with that the next item
i will be using is my let's see here
born this way naturally radiant
concealer from to face the shade that I
where is very fair and this is perfect
for me when I do have a self tan I wish
they had a lighter shade because I will
be stopping my self tanning routine soon
just because winter is coming around and
I don't do it year round but this is
what it looks like it's a perfect
perfect match for me right now and I
just wish that they would have a lighter
shade so I could wear it during the
wintertime but we shall see I will be
setting in my makeup this week with my
elf makeup mist and set to this is just
the original one with a low green tea
cucumbers and vitamins a c and e as far
as setting in my foundation in all of
those cream products i will be using my
essence all about matt fixing compact
powder you guys know I adore this powder
it's like 399 at Ulta it really keeps me
nice and matte so I'm excited about that
and then if I need to I will double set
with the it cosmetics bye bye pores
translucent
poreless finish airbrush powder which I
always have every single shop my stash
alright for brows this week we're going
to go pretty basic I'll be using my BH
Cosmetics flawless brow pencil in the
shade blonde and then I will be pairing
that together with my models co more
brows which is basically just a do for
the benefits gimme brow and in that
shade or in that product i use the shade
light / medium i will be doing something
a little different for my eyeliner this
week instead of using like a dark color
i'm actually going to be using a white
eyeliner this is the Knicks what is this
I an eyebrow pencil in the shade spe 906
white and is basically just a white
pencil it goes on to the waterline kind
of nicely I wish it was more of like a
crucial or Kohl pencil because I feel
like those are a lot softer and you're
not like poking your eye out but I still
think it's very eye brightening and
pretty so I'm excited for that I will be
pairing together these two mascaras this
week the first is from physicians
formula this is the sexy booster cat I
collection mascara in the shade ultra
black and look at this packaging I know
I say this every time I use this but
look it's like velvet it's got like a
little stiletto so cute I really like
this for just really really nice natural
voluminous lashes so that is what the
wand looks like and then i will also be
using my Too Faced better than sex
mascara which is also in my current
project pan video and this is what that
wants looks like so I like how my lashes
turned out today nothing too spiky or
crazy or super super long just really
nice and voluminous and kind of natural
looking all right before lip products
this week I will be pairing together my
two it cosmetics is Janice a qua product
so the first is the genesee qua vitality
lip flash and this goes on completely
clear and then it changes based on like
the pH or warmth of your skin and then
we have the it cosmetics by Jamie corona
this is the vitality gloss stayin in
genocide qua and I really just like the
color on my lips it's very natural and
pretty alright so moving on to blush and
bronzer i will be using my new hourglass
ambient lighting edits to real light
palette this is what it looks like and
you open it up and here in here you
basically get some finishing powders you
also get some highlights and some
bronzers in here so i'll do some
squatching i used this particular shade
today to kind of give me like a little
bit of a base highlight and then i used
this blush right here today
and then I also used the bronzer so
super excited to dig into this I love
this palette is absolutely beautiful
really really stunning very very excited
to get some use out of it so those are
some swatches of that palette and then I
also will be pulling it an extra
highlight just because I don't know I've
been getting so many new holiday kits
and I'm just like oh my god I just have
to pull that in so any highlight that I
will be pulling in on top of that is the
becca shimmering skin Perfector pressed
in the shade rose quartz and this is
what rose quartz looks like and today I
paired together that bigger finishing
powder in the hourglass and then I wore
this on top and I love the way that it
turned out so there is a swatch of rose
quartz it's super super beautiful
alright and then finally for eyeshadow
this week i will be using my Christmas
in New York to face the chocolate shop
palette so if you saw my review on this
the other day you know I'm kind of on
the fence I'm more so leaning towards
keeping it but I don't know I need to
work with it a little more today I went
very very simple and natural with my eye
look which I wasn't planning on doing
but I was in a hurry to get ready this
morning so tomorrow I'm gonna try and do
something a little more well now
actually you guys will be seen and the
atara video will be filmed today but in
a few days you guys will be seen and you
know some more dramatic looks with this
particular palette because they really
want to try some stuff out but I won't
be using the blush and highlight and
bronzer here I'll just be concentrating
on the eyeshadows and that is what they
look like i will give you guys some
swatches we have some glitter shades
here some satiny shades and then also
like some matte shades so i'm going to
try and play around with this as much as
I can and kind of decide if i do want to
let this go or if i do want to keep it
there are a few shades right there and
then let me do a few more for you guys
there are some more as well so yeah i
just want to play with these a little
more and i guess i will let you guys
know at the end of the week if it's a
fail or holy grail and also we will do
look of the week with this palette so
anyway those are all of the items i will
be using it this week and everything
that is on my face currently i hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and i'll see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
