welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys they make up
items that i will be using on my face
this week and also the ones that are
already on my face please excuse my hair
today I was using a facial spray this
morning and I'm still going to do a
review and demo on it it's the only
henriksen truth spray and I was spraying
it and I got some of it in my hair so my
hair is looking really greasy and gross
because that stuff leaves a really tacky
weird residue so anyway please excuse my
greasy like bangs or a little of wispies
here that are going on but in today's
video like I said we're doing shop and
swatch my sash and I am focusing on
items that I have in my 2016 makeup and
use up collab challenge so I will be
doing an update on that video soon
letting you guys know where I'm at with
the products but this week I thought it
would be fun to go ahead and kind of
concentrate on those so we're going to
get started and I like to go in order of
how I put my face on so we're going to
start with primers the first item i will
be using this week is the benefits air
patrol BB eyelid primer this is what it
looks like and then to prime my face i
will be using the bobby brown extra
enriched SPF 25 tinted moisturizing balm
in the shade alabaster tint this is what
the outer packaging looks like it's just
in a nice little glass um tub and then
this is what the actual product looks
like so i will be using this as my base
or my primer just because although it
does have a little bit of coverage to it
I feel like it really moisturizes the
skin and it doesn't have that much
coverage and I thought it would make for
a nice like moisturizing base for my
foundation so there it is on the back of
my hand it does leave me slightly greasy
I don't want to say greasy but it leaves
me very humectant feeling and very
moisturized it really does lock in
moisture and it will keep you
moisturized all day long so i will be
double like setting in my foundation
this week like the two different powders
just because i don't want to be looking
greasy but this is an item i'm trying to
use up in 2016 and i'll use it however i
can so i will be using that as my face
primer and then for my actual base i
will be using the Stila aqua glow serum
foundation my shade is fair this is what
it looks like it is a little lighter
than my skin right now because i have
been self tanning but let me show you
guys what it looks like so this is the
consistency it is definitely a serum or
water foundation
and there is a little swatch for you
guys so I will be pairing the extra
enriched SPF 25 moisturizing base with
this and hopefully those will layer
quite well together I have them on today
and I do feel like I'm slightly greasy
even though I double powdered but still
I feel like it's because of the
moisturizing balm that's okay so anyway
that is the base that i will be using
the Stila aqua glow serum foundation to
set everything in the first time i will
be using the Loreal infallible Pro matte
16-hour powder this is what it looks
like it is a little darker than my skin
tone which is good because like i said
the serum foundation is actually a
little like for my skin right now i also
have two items that I want to use before
I powder and those are the dr jart BB
mate bronzing cream and also the
highlighting cream so i will be using
this after i use my foundation to
highlight and contour my face again
these are both items that are in my
makeup use a collab video so I thought
it'd be good to start using those a
little more I'm not getting through the
contouring one very quickly but I'm
getting through the highlighting one
quite quickly so here is the
highlighting and there is the contouring
and they're just cream products that
blend out pretty easily so i thought i
could go ahead and either wear those
underneath the foundation or on top of
the foundation today i did put those on
on top of the foundation and i do like
the way it turned out so that's what
i'll be using and then like i said i'll
be using the Loreal infallible Pro matte
powder and then to double set everything
not do the buffing technique but just to
kind of set and make sure everything is
locked in i'll be using my it cosmetics
/ pores translucent HD powder which
looks like this and then i do have two
settings phrase here that i would like
to use this week to kind of prime my
face and also set in my makeup so the
first is the pixi by petra make up
fixing missed with rose water and green
tea this is almost completely out
literally there's like not even half an
inch of product left in here so once i
finish that up which i'm sure i will
finish up probably tomorrow or the next
day i will be trying to get through my
top show at luminous dewy skin mistake
you guys know i've been trying to get
through this for a while i'm not a huge
fan of this product it leaves me very
very oily and it's filled with alcohol
so i don't really like this product but
i only have probably this much left so
i'm going to try and finish that up this
week or
next week i do have a cream highlighting
product here that i plan on using either
as a cream highlight like for a base for
my powder highlight or i plan on just
mixing it in with my foundation as long
as it doesn't make me look too greasy
and this is the elf shimmer palette and
this is in the makeup use of collab
video or the challenge not the video the
challenge so there's four different
shades here you get different cream
highlights and I've hit pan on all of
these I'm doing quite well with this
however I just don't really know if I
want to use this in the summertime as an
actual like highlighting product just
because they are so creamy and they're
very very light let me show you guys
they're almost kind of greasy feeling
and I feel like that's just gonna slip
inside all over my face during the
summertime so when I'm thinking of doing
is basically using that for whatever i
can if i want to use it more as like an
eye base or if I just want to use it as
a cream shadow or if I want to mix it in
with my foundation I can go ahead and do
that with any of these shades because I
slip right now it's just important to
kind of get through that product and use
it up as far as highlighting products
are concerned and I could use you know
the Korean products as like a base but
the actual powder highlights that I want
to use this week are these ones right
here i plan on layering these and i did
that today and i really like the way
that they look the first one is the
Clinique uplighting illuminating powder
in the shade is 0-1 nude glow this is
more of a blush top or on me so what I
was thinking of doing is basically
putting this all over my face and then
going in with the hourglass ambient
strobe lighting powder in the shade
incandescent light which is a beautiful
pinky color and I thought that the two
of these layered together would give me
a nice peachy glow to my skin I really
love it I have them on today I love the
way that they layer because they have a
similar formulation to them let me show
you guys here is the clinic up lighting
powder they have a very similar sort of
formulation this one is obviously darker
than my skin so I can't really use it to
highlight but mixed together with
incandescent light from our glass I
think they look really beautiful
together and they definitely get more of
like a peachy a peachy glow to my skin
so there is nude glow and then there is
incandescent light and I will be
layering those for my highlight this
week alright so moving on as far as the
blush
I have two that I would like to use the
first is in the makeup use up challenge
this is the gosh cosmetics multi colored
blush initiate and number 50 pink pie
and this is a beautiful blush I do
prefer to use this during the cooler
months because it really has a strong
kind of berry or reddish tone to it and
I definitely prefer like peachy or like
pinky like you know what I mean like
apricot II cheeks during the summertime
but this is still beautiful and if I use
a light hand I definitely can get away
with using this for like a nice flush of
color to my cheeks so there is the gosh
cosmetics and then the other one that I
plan on using this week is the
Physicians Formula happy booster glow
and mood-boosting blush in the shade
warm and this is what it looks like I
love the packaging on this isn't that
cute oh my god it's so adorable and I
have this on my cheeks right now it is
very very subtle and I don't know how
well it's going to swatch but it is a
beautiful beautiful coral color like
pure coral so there is the gosh
cosmetics and then there is the
physicians formula so those are the two
blushes that I plan on using this week I
could probably even go ahead and layer
those if I want to get the gosh one a
little more like peachy and kind of more
summary summary eat all right and as far
as like moisturize moisturizing my lips
is concerned i'll be using my Maybelline
Baby Lips teeny quenched version Quinn
store i can't speak baby lips in the
quenched a version again this week so
this is what it looks like this has
sunscreen SPF 20 and the reason i'm
going to use this again this week is
because i was loving it last week and
the week before I feel like it gives
like nice sun protection to my lips but
also it it makes it so that like any
product that you put on top of it really
glides on nicely and beautifully and
speaking of like lip products the ones
that i will be using our also in the
makeup challenge or the makeup used up
challenge so the first is the NYX butter
gloss in the shade tiramisu I'm almost
completely like this is almost gone it's
on its last leg of the race but let me
go ahead and do a little swatch for you
guys I do have this on today so there is
the NYX butter gloss in the shade
tiramisu it's just a beautiful your lips
but better sort of color
so we'll be using the l'oreal colour
wishbone in the shade to 18 Rose elixir
which looks like that beautiful again
kind of your lips but better shade and
this one definitely doesn't give as much
color it definitely is more of a bomb
staying but it's very moisturizing and
comfortable on the lips there is the
l'oreal and then the last one is the
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stain
in the shade honey and this is also what
i have on my lips today and then I put
the tiramisu on top so there is the
Revlon so really really pretty color is
very very neutral easy to throw on
they're all very very comfortable so I'm
excited to use those and make some
progress on them and then for my brows i
will be using my BH Cosmetics flawless
brow pencil a new shade blonde and I
will top that with the tonio crooks the
brow gel eyebrow gel I like this a lot
last week so I'm going to use that again
and here's what the bhcosmetics flawless
brow pencil in a taupe is it over blonde
no blonde looks like so there is blonde
I like this a lot it's a very dry
formula but it probably is one of my
all-time favorite brow pencils so I
really enjoy that as far as um lashes
are concerned this week i will be using
my Urban Decay subversion lash primer as
always I love this thing and then I will
be layering two mascaras the first is
the cover girl to super sizer fibers
mascara which looks like this the wand
is identical to the original super sizer
formula I do prefer are not the super
sizer formula these super-sized are
actual mascara I do prefer the regular
formula over this one I talked about
them in like it what's new from the
drugstore video and then I will be
topping that with the Maybelline the
falsies push up a drama mascara in black
drama and I love this mascara i have it
on today obviously and it just gives you
really nice like clumpy inky lashes i
personally like that look so i already
know this will be a holy grail at the
end of the week and then let's see here
as far as eyeshadow is concerned i'm
super excited for this one i will be
using my violet boss lorely pro
eyeshadow palette i do have it on today
you get 20 different eyeshadows in here
you are getting some mats you are
getting some shimmers some glitters just
a whole bunch of stuff I do have I think
four colors on today I have tickled
on my lid I have 1988 in my crease mama
bird above my crease and then i put a
little bit of Big E on my lower lashline
so these are really really beautiful
beautiful colors I love the formulation
on the Bible applause eyeshadow palettes
I will have a comparison video going up
on Thursday for you guys but yeah these
are beautiful really love the colors and
I feel like you can do so many different
looks with this you have a lot of
transition colors you have a nice matte
brow bone color you have some nice liner
shades so I am very excited to play with
that and then an item that is in my
makeup use up challenge is the Milani
your soil I shines and this is in the
shade Florence is 0-3 I thought that I
could just kind of tap these onto my lid
or use them as like a liner shade
basically this week i'll go ahead and
swatch all them for you guys they're
basically just like a cream glitter i
would say they're kind of bonded
together strangely but this is what they
look like and i thought that it would go
really nicely with the Loreley palette
and I'm trying to use it up in 2016
alright and then the last two products
i'm not going to swatch for you guys
they are just samples that i am trying
to use up this week and probably next
week before I film sample spotlight for
the month but they are too tart samples
so the first one is the tart
high-performance naturals rainforests of
the sea water foundation with
broad-spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen the
lightest shade here is light neutral
which is the third two lightest shade in
the actual collection so I don't know if
that will actually match me but that's
the one I'm going to try out and then
also I will be trying out the charts
park at princess and glisan Amazonian
clay 12-hour blush and bronzer I think I
already have this one in a full size and
this one but i will be using the sample
up this week this is a beautiful blush
it reminds me a lot of narsus orgasm and
yeah alright guys that is it to those
are the makeup products i will be using
this week thank you so much for joining
me and i will see you guys tomorrow fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
