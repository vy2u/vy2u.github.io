to my channel and welcome back to shop
and swatch my stash where I share with
you guys the makeup products I currently
have on my face and of course the makeup
products i will be using this week i am
extra excited because i am trying out
new stuff for you guys as well as doing
review so some of these items were sent
for PR and then others i did purchase
myself and yeah that's about it let's go
ahead and jump right into it so the
first item that i will be using this
week is the new anastacio beverly hills
aurora and glow kit i do have this on
today as my highlight and the shade that
i am wearing is this one right here
which is called eclipse there are six
different shades in here as you guys can
see and i will be doing a review
swatches comparison and demo against the
anastacio beverly hills moonchild bloke
it for you guys on thursday so let me go
ahead and swatch these for you guys
quickly the first three shades we have
our Eclipse and then we do have this
shade right here which is called Luna
and spectra spectra is one of those like
lighter kind of purple shades and it
really isn't as pigmented as it looks
which is quite nice because when you are
dealing with a purple shade like that
and you plan to wear it as a highlight
you don't want it to be too pigmented so
there are the first three swatch those
are just like one at finger swipes
watches and if you guys can see the Luna
shade right there does have a little bit
of glitter to it so if you are not a fan
of glittery highlights you might not
like this palette too much there are
probably i would say about three of the
shades in here or glittery and then the
bottom three are Helia Orion and Lyra or
Lyra so here is the shade helium which
is more of like a greenish kind of gold
color then we have Orion which is the
blue egg and equate on the sheer side
and then Laira or Lyra is the liars it
later I can't tell and then here are
those ones swatch so there you guys can
see and they are really beautiful i'm
really liking these you guys I feel like
you could build them up in swatches you
can build them up on the face and I
really do enjoy the shade that I'm
wearing today the majority of these
actually show up is a true highlight on
me they're not like too dark for my skin
so yeah look forward to that you know
review and swatches and demo coming up
soon on thursday the next item that i
will be using it's from pure cosmetics
this was sent to me from pure cosmetics
as well as octal ii in exchange for an
honest review it is the new barrett all
12 our foreign one skin perfecting a
foundation so i just tried this out for
the first
today I had not heard very good things
about this but I still wanted to try it
out because when i was looking at people
putting it on at their face the first
thing i thought was wow that would be
good for being on stage and i totally
stand by that the shade i got was called
porcelain and honestly i think it's a
little too light for me right now i'm
still a teensy bit self tanned and I
feel like I'm getting a little bit of a
white cast on my face today but I really
love the packaging on this it smells
like cherries which is awesome but this
is very very incredibly thick you guys
if you do not like having a full
coverage foundation on your face and one
that feels like a full coverage
foundation AKA you know really really
heavy on the skin you would not like
this at all that is what it looks like
it as you guys can see it's just very
very thick it's very very sticky and
tacky I did blend it in with a sponge
today but i think tomorrow i will go
ahead and try out a foundation brush to
see if i can kind of blend it out a
little more but so far I think it's okay
it's not something that I think is
everyday we're friendly am and it's kind
of weird that they call it bear at all
because it really truly is a full
coverage foundation but yeah I will
continue to play with that this week I
also will be using my Smashbox photo
finish primer water I picked this up
during the Ulta 21 days of beauty event
Smashbox is now officially cruelty-free
which is awesome this is silicone free
alcohol free and oil-free and I use this
to foil my shadows as well as you know
said in my face and I also can be a
quick primer spray if you want it too
weak but yeah i'll be using that and i
will be doing my ultra 21 days of beauty
haul for you guys next week and then i
do have two new bronzers here from becca
these are these sunlit bronzers I
purchase these on ulta calm they look
like a little birds flying saucers the
first shade I picked up was called Capri
coast which is a little deeper and it
does have a cool undertone so there is
the shade Capri coast and then I also
did pick up Bali sands Bali stance is
the one I have on right now in to kind
of contour my nose with it today and
then I did you in light dusting of this
bronzer all over now i will be doing a
side-by-side comparison with squatches
price points all that kind of stuff
tomorrow for you guys against the
physicians formula boooo boooo butter
bronzers because I think these are quite
comparable but I did want to let you
know when you look at the like pictures
of these on the actual upstate on the
interweb dachix mom so old when you look
at pictures of these on the actual
internet you guys they really really do
look like they have a lot of sheen to
them these are more of a satiny almost
kind of matte bronzer so basically what
happens is they actually have an
overspray on them and I hate over sprays
you guys over sprays are where you have
like glitter on top and then once you
actually get into the product with a
brush it all swipes away and underneath
you actually have your real product so
if you are hoping that these are going
to be super super shimmery on the skin
unfortunately they are not i would say
they are a satin bronzer as most so
that's kind of the most like
disappointing thing about them so far
but other than that I think they are
quite nice and they do have a nice
sheets election i think there's about
six different shades to choose from
alright i also will be playing with my
new lorac unzipped gold palette i also
got this during the 21 days of beauty
events like i said i will have my hull
going up next week and then my follow-up
all the week after but this is what it
looks like on the inside i did
personally contact lorac and i believe
that they are cruelty-free you need to
go ahead and make that choice for
yourself contact them and kind of figure
out what you think but i truly believe
that they are cruelty-free and the three
shades that i do have all my eyes today
are this one which is called unleashed i
have that on my lid and lower lash line
i do have these shade undeniable in my
crease and then unedited in my outer v
the only shade i did not like was this
unedited shade i felt like it was very
very chalky and hard to blend into the
outer vigne but these two shades right
here were absolutely beautiful so I look
forward to playing with that some more
so far so good those are very very
similar to the lorac Pro formula so if
you love the pro formula and you want
another palette that has a lot of nice
like warm and gold tones in there i
would highly recommend this one and then
for blush i will be using my two
illamasqua massive blushes in these
shades and naked rose which is a little
more of like a cool toned kind of rosy
shade and then also the shade of tremble
which is what i have on my cheeks today
this is more like a hot coral and that
is what it looks like so here is a naked
rose and here is tremble let me go ahead
and swatch those for you guys these are
beautiful i love the pigmentation on
these love the way they go onto the skin
they almost kind of camouflage a little
bit on the skin those are one swipe
swatches as you guys can see so on top
we have tremble and underneath that is
naked rose and as far as the lilies are
concerned this week i was sent a
lipstick from a hundred percent pure
recently they have been sending me a lot
of product and i've been loving their
brand so far the only thing I don't love
is that they are quite expensive but
this is the one hundred percent pure
fruit pigmented pomegranate
anti-aging lipstick in the shade of
foxglove so really really cute little
packaging as you can see and this is
what it looks like this is actually very
very comfortable on the lips I have it
on right now and it is quite pigmented
so let me show you guys a little swatch
here they are vegan they are
cruelty-free this is just a really nice
brand in general the lipstick smells
like pomegranate smells really good and
it kind of reminds me of the bite a
moose Busia lipstick formula so really
have been enjoying that even though I've
only worn it twice I am enjoying it so
far and then I also will be topping that
with my beloved tainting oil from YSL in
the shade at peach me love just for a
little bit of extra moisture so that
will be the lip combo I wear this week
as far as primers are concerned I will
be playing with the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion in the
anti-aging version and then to go along
with that foundation because I heard it
can be a little tricky I want to try out
two different primers so one is silicone
base this is the Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer and then also I have a
little sample of the becca first light
priming filter and i'm actually wearing
this two day with that foundation i
actually like this you guys know i'm not
a huge fan of the becca backlight
priming filter I felt like that gives a
very I feel like in general just gives
me a very artificial looking cast to my
skin like the shimmer and there's just
not very natural looking and it does
also make me an oily best by the end of
the day now this one on the other hand I
really don't feel like it's making me
oil II I've had my foundation on for
about two or three hours now and I
really do like that it has more of like
a liquidy consistency to it it does kind
of smell like lemon pledge like a very
artificial lemon scent but it does have
that lilac tone to it so it's really
nice for kind of brightening I don't
notice a huge amount of brightening but
I do think it gives a little bit so if
this does hold up throughout the day I
might actually get a full size of that
because I'm enjoying it so far and then
for mascara I will be wearing up my
Smashbox photo finish lash primer pair
together with my Urban Decay perversion
mascara which is a natural bristle
mascara that is what the wanda looks
like and it is a very very wet formula i
will be going ahead and layering that
with my bio cell babydoll mascara this
is a rubber bristle one so you guys know
i like to do that natural bristle wand
with the rubber bristle wand and the two
of these together look really really
nice now i will say that lash primer the
smashbox one not a huge fan this one is
insane and what I mean by insane is like
it's literally a torture device it hurt
it hurts so bad I kept poking myself in
the eye this morning so I don't know how
that will go maybe I'll find a different
way to use it but so far not so good
with that all right I will be doing a
little bit of like color correcting this
week as well I found my dr. Girardi be
made contouring neutralizer and also
highlight in my collection these came
from like the BB mate 123 kit I did are
already used up at the contouring shade
and I've actually gone through one of
these kids in a project pan but I still
do have these two guys left here so this
is the neutralizing shade which is kind
of yellow toned and this is the
highlight both of them do have SPF 30
and it is a physical sun block which is
awesome so I'm going to do some light
color correcting underneath my eyes with
those and then I will be doing a tart
shaped tape YouTube maybe buy it review
and demo for you guys on Friday I
finally did purchase letart shape tape
concealer everybody talks about this and
today I thought I went on pretty nicely
I did pick up the shade of fair it is
very very light for me right now I'm
still just a little bit self tan so I
don't know maybe I should have gotten
the other shade like fair light neutral
or whatever it's called but I feel like
this one will work for me for the most
part so i used it today first
impressions why i think it's quite nice
it reminds me a lot of the kat von d
locket concealer creme but at the same
time I feel like if you don't set this
very very well you will get creasing so
that's just kind of my first impressions
on it so far like i said i will do a
review and demo for you guys on Friday
to set in my whole entire face this week
i will be using my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powder which looks
like this one of my all-time favorites I
got two of those during the altar 21
days of beauty sale as well they are on
sale right now for I think buy one get
one fifty percent off and then I do have
this brow product that I'm really not
liking in my brows today might have to
switch this out i'm really not like you
get it is the bhcosmetics HD brow pencil
in the shade blonde and I don't know
what happened you guys I think I just
 my brows up today but this is the
little tiny little pencil side looks
like and then you do have a spoolie on
the other I don't really know what
happened today but i will try again
tomorrow and then i do also want to use
my clinic skinny stick eyeliner in the
shade slim sable I've been obsessed with
this lately I've been using this a lot
haven't I it's just a beautiful
beautiful really really precise nice
cool toned chocolatey brown shade and I
like it a lot that looks like a little
bird or something but anyway you really
have been enjoyed that so I want to play
with
and then finally I had this eve by Eve
conditioning smudge-proof gel eyeliner
in dashain 03 Brown I thought I would go
ahead and try this out as well this week
you guys know I can't do a wing for
but i thought i could go ahead and smoke
out kind of my lower lash line so anyway
that is everything that i will be using
this week for shop of my stash thank you
so much for joining me guys and i will
see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
