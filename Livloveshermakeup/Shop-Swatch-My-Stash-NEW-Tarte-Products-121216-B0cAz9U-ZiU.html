welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys as they make
up products I currently have on my face
and of course the makeup products that I
will be using it this week
please excuse my hair today it is filled
filled with dry shampoo of any way today
or this week I should say we are going
to be focusing on some new products from
Tarte cosmetics I got these last week
and I did not have any time to play with
them so this is the week to play with
them I will have a full review swatches
and comparison against the volume 1
editions going up on probably Thursday I
just need some more time with these but
we are going to be focusing on the new
rainforest of the sea volume 2 eyeshadow
palette as well as the volume 2 skin
twinkle lighting palette so I purchased
both of these on Tarte cosmetics if you
are curious this is what the eyeshadow
palette looks like same sizes Volume one
really cute little coral reef on the
front and then you have a little mirror
here and this is what the actual shades
look like so the shades I'm wearing on
my eyes today are this one on my lid I
have this slight grey color in my outer
V and on my lower lash line and then
this little guy right here in my crease
and this really pearly shade I'm sorry
this really pearly shade on underneath
my brow basically on my brow bone so I
think this is really really nice very
comparable to the first palette if you
do not like that really really Gym ethic
own kind of thicker feeling eyeshadow I
don't think you would like this you do
need to work with more densely packed
brushes when you are working with these
because the second you put it down that
is where the product is gained so I do
like the formulation so far the only
thing I have to complain about is the
fact that I think some of the shades
over here are similar to the first
version again when I do my comparison
video on Thursday I will show you guys
what I mean but let's go ahead and just
swatch this whole entire palette so that
you guys can see because I know you are
curious here are the more warm tone
shades so I'll just do one swipe
swatches so there they are
I did notice I got a little bit of
fallout today on my cheeks which was
kind of hard with that more like Slate
smokey blueish color but at the same
time I feel like they actually go onto
the skin really nicely and they really
adhere all day now I do notice with
these eyeshadows I want to say really
quickly I already know from the last
formulation that they do crease quite
badly so that's just something to be
aware of if you have more mature or dry
eyelids I would just be careful so
alright and here
the other four for you guys so these are
the Morse emoji Said's
oops I'm almost like wait that does not
work so there are the smokey shades so
very very pretty I do like that they did
the cool tone side over here but I just
kind of wish they would have done all
cool tone shades I don't know why but
that's just kind of what I wish so and
that is the eyeshadow palette that I
will be using this week like I said I
will have a review and comparison slash
swatches video for you guys going up on
a Thursday and then as far as my
thumbnail is concerned you can probably
see I was not too impressed with one of
these products and that is the skin
twinkle lighting palette so this is the
volume 2 Edition you are getting four
different highlights in here the
highlight that I have on today is this
one right here which is the lightest of
the four it is called skylight and I
hope you guys can see just from putting
my brush in all four of these that they
already have a lot of texture and
grittiness going on there this is
nothing like the first edition volume in
my opinion I feel like the first edition
had a really nice Dometic own silicone
kind of feel to it and these just feel
very very chunky to me so let me show
you guys some swatches and I am going to
try and show you like right off the bat
so here's that one so hopefully you guys
can see just like how they go onto the
skin immediately now I will blend them
and I will say they do blend in very
nicely and they are quite pigmented but
goodness gracious do they have like a
lot of chunkiness going on there so in
my opinion they are a lot more pigmented
than the first edition I'm sorry those
are really bad swatches but in my
opinion I feel like they do have a lot
more pigments in the first edition
however I feel like they also are very
very chunky and even today when I went
in with my Sigma tapered highlighter
brush I feel like it's going to start
kind of you know emphasizing fine lines
and texture around this area so we shall
see how that wears throughout the day
but this is what it looks like now after
using it I just feel like these are
quite thick and even when you just swipe
your finger you pick up almost too much
product if that makes sense so you're
picking up just a little too much
product so I don't know about these we
will have to play with them a little
more and I will let you guys know my
final thoughts on Thursday all right as
far as mascara is concerned this week I
will be pairing together my new
l'oreal voluminous feline mascara with
my all-time favorite sephora outrageous
curl so the l'oreal voluminous feline is
pretty darn good i thought that this was
going to give me a little more umph like
first impressions wise i really thought
this was going to give me a little more
umph
and this is new to me so it does have a
rubber a wand kind of like bristle brush
and I do like that but I don't know it
was very actually natural when it went
onto the lashes and then my Sephora
outrageous Crowe mascara is my all-time
favorite I love how tiny and precise the
little wand is so that is what it looks
like I will also be using a setting
spray this week to go ahead and foil any
shadows set in my makeup and also use as
a primer this is the pixie skin treats
makeup fixing mist this does have
rosewater and green tea in it so that is
what it looks like and the actual spray
it looks like that so the sprayer I feel
like does get clogged quite quickly you
can resolve that problem by just running
it underneath the warm of water but I do
like this I think it is quite nice and I
think this is the most expensive primer
spray or just like setting spray that I
have in my collection as of right now so
I'm excited to use it that let's see
here I will be using my Becca backlight
priming filter as my face primer this
week and then for eye primer I will be
using my all-time favorite Maybelline
and master Prime long-lasting eyeshadow
base I wear the lightest shade which I
believe is called 5/10 as far as
foundation is concerned I will be using
my covergirl CG smoothers hydrating
makeup in the shade 7:05 ivory I'm not
wearing this right now and that is
because I am wearing a new L'Oreal
foundation on my face right now I
actually will have a first impressions
probably coming up for you guys tonight
it's the new like full coverage L'Oreal
foundation so I'm not wearing this right
now but this is what it actually looks
like on the skin it's really really
beautiful very hydrating and this is
something that is currently in my
project pan video and then I want to
pair that with my Tarte rainforest of
the sea aqua sealer so I love this this
is my all-time favorite concealer it has
a horrible horrible scent but it is
beautiful on the skin very very
skin-like and it's kind of like a serum
concealer so there is the consistency of
the concealer I feel like it's very
similar to the foundation so those are
going to pair together nicely now
because those both have very light
coverage I did decide
I want to set in my face this week with
an actual powder foundation so I will be
using the tarte cosmetics confidence
creamy powder foundation in the shade
fair neutral this is actually really
beautiful and a tad light for my skin
tone which is crazy so very very pretty
like this let me go ahead and do a
swatch for you guys it's very finely
milled but quite pigmented so there is a
little swatch so those are the three
kind of face products I will be using I
also will be using my eight cosmetics
note ugh waterproof anti-aging gel
eyeliner in the shade black this is so
beautiful just goes on to the eye so
nicely so this is what a little so watch
your ooh it looks like as you guys can
see my hand was a little wet so it
didn't go over it perfectly but it is
really really wonderful goes on really
nicely and it does stay on the actual
waterline you do have a sharpener on the
other end as well as far as blush is
concerned I will be wearing two that are
kind of in the same color category but
they have different tones so one of them
is a little more warm tone it's the one
I have on my cheeks today this is the
Becca mineral blush in the shade
songbird so this is the packaging and a
songbird is just really really beautiful
just more kind of a neutral nudie color
this does have gold shimmer in it and I
just love the way it goes on so here is
the shade songbird from Becca cosmetics
and then I also will be using my lorac
colorsource buildable blush in the shade
cinematic which again same kind of color
range but this one's more on the cool
tone side so it is so crazy this one is
so freakin silky it's amazing like next
to the Becca it literally feels so much
softer I don't even know how that's
possible because Becca has some good
blushes but there they are together so
here is songbird from Becca and then
here is cinematic from lorac so those
are going to be the two blushes that I
wear on my cheeks this week I wanted
something a little more neutral because
I knew I would probably go a little
heavier with the eye makeup
as far as brows are concerned I'm just
going to use my Maybelline brow drama
crown pomade which I've been using for
weeks and weeks and weeks now and then a
for lip products I will be using my ELF
conditioning lip balm with SPF 15 in the
shade of blissful berry I love these
these are absolutely amazing this is
what the shade blissful berry looks like
it smells like cupcakes
it tastes like cupcakes it's super super
pigmented and very moisturizing on the
actual skin so I am so excited to play
with this I have not reached for these
scents
god I don't even know I feel like I
haven't reached for these in over a year
and then I also want to use my all May
what is this called smart shade butter
kiss lipstick in the shade number 60
pink light medium kind of reminds me of
the Revlon lip butters which are some of
my favorites oh oh they're the hair on
it this is what it looks like and this
is actually the shade that I'm wearing
today I feel like it really kind of
blend it in with my lips so it's kind of
like a your lips with better kind of
shade but there is the o'may and then on
top of it is the elf I'm sorry for my
poor swatches debate guys and finally
the last item that I do want to go ahead
and use this week is from Laura Geller
this is a bronzer that I just feel like
doesn't get a lot of love in my
collection this is called the beach
matte baked hydrating bronzer in the
shade Sun rise fair so that is what it
looks like you do get a mirror and then
look at this anything that has a little
imprint of a cushion I just want to
touch it and swirl my finger in there
it's so cute so this is a very very
natural kind of bronzer if you're into
that you would like this if you're very
cool toned or you have very fair skin
you would also like this so yeah anyway
guys those are all the products that I
will be using this week on my face I
hope you enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
