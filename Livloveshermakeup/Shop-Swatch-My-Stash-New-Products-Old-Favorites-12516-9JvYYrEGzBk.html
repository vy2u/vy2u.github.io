welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys at the
makeup products I currently have on my
face and of course the makeup products
that i will be using this week i am very
excited because we are going to focus on
new products this week and also some old
favorites i thought that would be kind
of a cool mixture so let's go ahead and
jump right into it alright the first
item that i would be using this week is
my estee lauder double wear
stay-in-place foundation this is what
the actual packaging looks like and if
you are curious the shade that I where
is one and one ivory nude and know if
you guys can see that with the glare but
it's 1 and 1 i've renewed and what i'm
going to do this week is go ahead and
mix in a few drops of oil i thought i'd
show you guys the oil i'm going to use
this is the bios onto the nourisher
precious rose of face oil so i got this
in a boxy charm box probably about three
or four months ago maybe during the
springtime or summer or something like
that and i really like what it does when
I mix it together with more of like a
full coverage foundation so I do have
combination to oily skin and honestly I
actually get very very dry during the
wintertime so kind of like severe combo
skin and I noticed that my skin just
can't handle something like this or the
kat von d lock-it like foundation or
even like the Revlon whipped foundation
without a little bit of oil so I'll be
mixing the two of those together this
week I did that today really liked how
came out I just put the foundation on
the back of my hand put a few drops of
the oil in it mixed it together and then
applied it with a damp sponge as far as
eyeshadow is concerned I will be trying
out a new palette to me this is what it
looks like this is called the studio
makeup on the go eyeshadow palette and
this particular version is called cool
down so I got this in my November 2016 a
boxy charm box and I think it is really
really beautiful lots of cool tome
shades in here i will do some swatches
for you guys and show you the ones that
i'm wearing on my eyes today so this
first shade right here this kind of
creamy color I'm wearing that all over
my eye and then i have this shade on my
lid and you probably could see that
little chunk of a glitter that just fell
out this does have a lot of fallout you
guys so i would highly recommend using a
glitter glue and also going ahead and
really really foiling this if you do
want to put it on the lid and then the
shade that i have in my crease is this
really nice
a purpley one right here really really
beautiful again has a very metallic
finish to it however it does have some
powdery kick up so the shades are
absolutely beautiful I really like the
pigmentation but i will say you do need
to use like a really nice tacky kind of
primer or some sort of glitter glue when
you are working with these and then is
the last shade that I used was this one
up here which is a really pretty
champagne color it has a little bit of a
pinky Q or tone to it and I did go ahead
and I worked that into like the inner
corner of my eye so there it is very
very pretty excited to use this excited
to see how it wears throughout the day a
lot of you did warn me about that
glitter so I made sure that I really
packed that on today was like a very
almost wet brush so anyway we shall see
that we shall see how that goes this
week I also will be this concealer right
here this is actually something that is
in my current project pan video
something I have not reached for for
quite a while so this is the Maybelline
and master concealed by say studio
camouflage and concealer in the shade
and number 10 fair it's beautiful it
does have a little more of a yellow
undertone but I don't mind because they
only use this underneath in my eyes it
is very nice especially if you do have
more dry or mature skin it's very
humectant and actually quite
moisturizing and beautiful so I'm
excited to pair that together with my
Estee Lauder Double Wear I do have an
eyeshadow cream stick this thing keeps
tipping over an eyeshadow cream stick
and also a Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye
pencil that I want to use this week so i
use the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye
pencils all the time but this particular
shade which is called Moon spoon is a
really really beautiful slate gray color
with chunks of silver glitter in it and
I have not reached for this forever so
that is what I'm going to be using on my
waterline I do have that on today and
then I also wanted to go ahead and pull
out this bobbi brown long-wear cream
shadow stick this particular shade is
called a shadow and it's just a
beautiful beautiful slate gray color I
thought this would look really nice with
that cool down palette and okay so
obviously there are no rules to make up
sometimes I like to go ahead and use
that as an actual eyeliner i like to use
cream eyeshadows as eyeliners but also
that could be like an eyeshadow
ace and I thought that would be really
really nice so I'm going to be using
those little guys I also will be going
ahead and pulling in my torches the
blush palette so this is something I
have not reached for for a very long
time as well it is absolutely beautiful
and inside of here you are getting four
of their Amazonian clay and blushes so
one of them does have a little bit of
shimmer today I am wearing that shade at
the sheet is called laughs if you are
curious it does have just a little bit
of shimmer in it not too much and then
the other three are completely mad so
very excited to play with this this is
the shade that I'm wearing today very
very beautiful it almost has a little
bit of like a peachy undertone when you
actually get it onto your skin and then
I will go ahead and swatch it the other
three for you as well so really nice
kind of neutral colors but this is one
of those Amazonian clay blush palettes
that's really full of pigment those are
just one swipe swatches very beautiful
easy to blend and at the kind of typical
formulation that I really like to see
from Tarte blushes so I'm very excited
to be using that and then I do have an
item here that I also got in my boxy
charm in November this is the vintage by
Jessica liber skinned or Lieber skinned
this is a rose gold highlighter so
instantly when I opened my box and I saw
this I knew that this wasn't going to be
a highlight on me but more of a blush
topper just because it is very like dark
so it's more pinky toned than gold and I
do find that I can pull off a gold
highlight if it is darker than my skin
like this past week i used the becca
champagne pop highlight and also
Prosecco pop and i feel like i can pull
those office an actual highlight but
something that has a little more of a
pink undertone I don't know what it is
but it just kind of looks like a stripe
of pink on my face so I've been using
this as a blush topper or I did today
and I did yesterday and I just went
right on top of that laughs shade from
the Amazonian clay palette and I just
kind of stippled this on so this has a
very chunky texture to it I don't know
if you guys can see that so i really
like look at this do you guys see that i
really wanted to make sure that i went
on very very lightly and just kind of
tapped it on top so that it wasn't going
to emphasize any sort of texture so that
is what it looks like blended out i
think if you do have a medium complexion
or a dark complexion that would be a
beautiful highlight but for me it's more
of a blush topper so we're going to be
playing with that and then i did want to
pull in a highlight
haven't reached for for quite some time
about two years ago I got a little trio
of highlights during at the holiday
season from Laura Geller these are the
baked highlighters so this particular
shade is called portofino and it is a
really really nice kind of golden color
um the other one that came was like a
rose gold shade and then also french
vanilla which is a beautiful beautiful
like barely there kind of highlight but
this is super stunning I feel like it is
a little on the sheer side but it still
gives a lot of shine to the skin so you
can still actually see your skin through
this particular product but it's just
beautiful very metallus eyes super super
gorgeous right on the cheek bone so that
is what i will be using for highlight
this week and I feel like this little
packaging is adorable maybe I should
take that when I go back home for the
holidays and then i will be using some
different lip products this week so the
first one is the one that i have on my
lips right now with this is a new
product to me this is the anastacio
Beverly Hills lip gloss in the shade of
fudge I got this in my little cyber fun
day um there was like a little bag that
you could get if you spent more than
fifty dollars this came in there from
Alto so anyway the shade is called fudge
it's what I have on my lips right now I
wish I would have put on a lip liner
with this today because it's very very
pigmented and it is starting to go
outside my lip line after wearing it for
about an hour but it's a beautiful dark
maroon red shade and then i thought i
would go ahead and pick out a lip liner
so this is new to me as well this is the
face stockholm vera lip liner or veera
this came in my tipsy bag probably about
three or four months ago again just
haven't reached for it yet so this is
what it looks like it's a beautiful
plummy shade and I could have paired the
fudge gloss with that today I actually
probably should have because the fudge
gloss is so pigmented it's just going to
go right over this nicely but I do feel
like it's starting to come off like a
little bit around the outside of my lip
but what I thought this particular lip
liner would look really nice with is my
Too Faced la creme lipstick in the shade
Wham so this is a beautiful kind of
cranberry color with a lot of sparkle
and Sheen to it it was limited edition
during the holiday season last year but
it's beautiful and I love the
formulation on these la creme lipstick
so those will be my lip products for the
week as far as mascaras are concerned
I'm going to be trying a new one and
then using an old favorite so
the new one is the Ultima Volume Mascara
so again I got this in my little sample
bag when I did the cyber fun day I'm
hall I was surprised by this today
because I put it on I don't feel like
the brush picks up product evenly but
this is a natural bristle brush which I
am NOT a huge fan of I really like a
rubber bristle brushes so I was kind of
surprised at how much volume this
actually gave my lashes but I also
thought that it was a little wet and a
little dry it was a very strange kind of
consistency so I need to play with that
one more but i will be going ahead and
topping it with one of my all-time
favorite mascaras which is the laura
mercier extra lash sculpting mascara
this is something that is currently in
my new project pan video as well that I
want to finish up so this is what it
looks like it's got like a medieval
torture device kind of brush here but
yeah it is a rubber bristle wand really
really nice for sculpting and giving
extra definition to the lashes so I will
be carrying those together this week and
then as far as primers are concerned i
will be using my stila aqua glow
perfecting primer for my face I have not
reached for this for quite some time but
again it it is in my current project pan
video and then also I have not reached
for my benefit Air Patrol BB eyelid
primer in probably over a month this is
actually a really nice primer and the
longer that it kind of sits out the more
sticky and tacky it gets so it's
actually working really well with those
eyes shadows this week so i will be
using that and then obviously for
foiling my eyeshadows and setting my
face in i will be using a setting spray
this is the NYX matte finish
long-lasting setting spray i just
thought i would use the map version
because i'm using so many glowy products
this week although i do have combo skin
I still do get a little oily in my
t-zone so I want to see if this will
help a little more it has a little more
alcohol in it to kind of dry off the
skin but yeah this is absolutely
beautiful I really do like this product
and I have not reached for this in a
while so i'll be using that and then
finally the last two items that i will
be using are not new products and
they're not like old favorites that i
haven't used in a long time they're ones
that I use pretty consistently they are
the Maybelline brow drama pomade cran in
the lightest version I just love this
for filling in my eyebrows really really
quickly there is a swatch for you guys
and then also the essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder so I have a
bajillion different brow products I have
a bajillion different powders
but I do believe even though shot my
stash is very helpful for be with my
large collection to make sure I make the
rounds for everything there are certain
products that I just love to use so i
feel like i should still be able to use
them on a week-to-week basis instead of
swatching them out or swapping them out
today so anyway that is it for shop and
swatch my stash I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys tomorrow we
are starting by holiday gift guide we're
gonna do part 1 tomorrow part to the
next day and part 3 the day after that
so I'm very excited and yeah I will see
you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
