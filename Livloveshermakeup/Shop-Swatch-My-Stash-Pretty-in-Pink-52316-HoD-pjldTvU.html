welcome back to shop and to watch my
stash I want to say really quickly I
just took off a nail polish that pretty
much stained my nail beds so if you see
like greenish colors on my nails my
nails are not molding it is the nail
polish anyway in today's video we are
shopping and squatching my stash for the
week and we actually have a theme for
this week the theme is pretty in pink
because I have been daydreaming I was
going to be dreaming but yes dreaming
and daydreaming about wearing just like
really really cool tone pink cheeks and
a pink lip and I just had this thought
in mind for a while now and I wanted to
complete a whole week's worth of light
like you don't put together a whole
week's worth of products that pretty
much featured pinky shades on my eyes on
my cheeks and on my lips so that's what
we're doing today so let's go ahead and
just get right into it shall we so for
eye primer this week I'm going to
continue to use my Maybelline master
Prime long-lasting eyeshadow base in
5-10 I used this last week really really
enjoy it so I'm going to continue using
that and then I have a few deluxe ice
samples here of face primers that I
would like to use out I'm really trying
to dig into like my deluxe I sample like
products that i have so i have a few of
these like glowy skin primers the first
is the burberry fresh glow luminous
fluid base it looks like that the second
one is the J eared owl smooth affair
brightening face primer and it looks
like that and then I also have this
shiseido glow enhancing primer so I was
thinking I could probably get through
all three of these since they are so
tiny i could probably get through all
three of these this week and just kind
of use them up which would be good
because i need to kind of move these out
of my collection they have been sitting
in there for more than a year now so i
want to get through those and then also
before I even start priming I want to
use this little thing from bareMinerals
I barely ever use this I don't know if I
got it in some sort of bare minerals kit
around the holidays it is the bare
minerals well-rested face and eye
brightener so it's basically just an
illuminator but it goes on pretty clear
let me show you guys it doesn't seem to
have like tons and tons of sheen or
anything to it so it's like a very very
basic sort of illuminator but
I thought I would just go in with this
around my eye area and any area that I
really want to like fill in fine lines
and wrinkles like around my mouth and on
my forehead there it is see how light it
is and that's just like it's washed on
when you actually blend it out you can
barely even see anything so I thought
you would just be nice to kind of lift
and kind of mattify the areas like
around my fine lines and wrinkles under
my eyes around the sides of my mouth and
also on my forehead because I do a lot
of this so anyway i'll be using that
before going in with my primers and then
i am going to be color correcting this
week because i have a long week ahead of
me and i know that there's gonna need to
be some color correction going on so i'm
going to be using all five of my Urban
Decay color correcting fluids I just
can't use one of these and not the other
I know that sounds so silly but I just
like to use all of them at once because
I actually get a kick out of using these
to be completely honest I just really
enjoy these so here's the first one this
one is green and i will be using this
obviously to camouflage or just to color
correct any sort of redness on my face
then we have the pink shade which is so
nice this will be my secondary eye
primer and also i'll take it anywhere
that i really just want to like lift and
brighten so there is the pink shade and
then we have lavender and i like to use
this on areas where i do have solidus
like right underneath my jawline or even
just on fine lines and wrinkles so there
is the lavender shade and then we have
yellow which i really like to use
underneath my eyes if you have fair skin
with like a warm undertone this one
would be perfect for you underneath your
eyes I personally don't have a warm
undertone but I really like the way that
this cancels out the blues underneath my
eyes so there is the yellow shade and
then the final one is peach and i like
to use peach on my hyperpigmentation and
also you can take this one underneath
your eyes as well depending on what I'm
skin tone you have so anyway there is
peach so we have green we have think we
have lavender we have yellow and then
peach so those are what i will be using
before going in with my
station this week and speaking of
foundation i am using one that i swear
to you i have not touched in like four
or five months ridiculous i'm trying to
see if there's like an expiration date
on here nothing smells weird or anything
like that it still seems completely
normal so that's good the consistency
hasn't changed or anything but it's been
sitting around for like four months
without me like shaking the tube or even
using it so i am going to be using my
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous fresh
complexion oil-free foundation my shade
is 105 I do not love this foundation how
things change obviously sometimes I use
this and I love the way it looked
sometimes I use it and it just
emphasizes everything on my face and
makes me look older so I don't really
know about this one at this particular
shade 105 is slightly dark so i will be
using a tone correcting powder to kind
of camouflage the darkness and i'm not
going to be using any sort of bronzer or
anything this week because it is about a
shade darker than my skin tone as you
guys can see but yeah the scent is still
the same there's nothing wrong with the
consistency so i'm going to give it
another go and I remember holding on to
this during my declutter series because
I was like everybody loves it I just
need to try it one more time but I don't
know really if it's gonna be a fail or
holy grail sometimes when I shot my
stash I know at the beginning of the
week if I'm really going to love
something and I'm very very unsure about
this you might see this as a fail at the
end of the week but anyway that is the
foundation i will be using and then i
will be going in with a concealer so the
concealer is the Maybelline master
concealed by face studio in the shade 10
fair and I just love the consistency on
this it's super super creamy and
hydrating it's really beautiful under
the eyes and it actually pulls quite a
strong yellow or warm undertone so that
also helps to cancel out any blue tones
underneath the eyes like I said I'll be
really busy this week so I'm kind of
prepping myself for having discoloration
on my face with the color corrector them
then also going in with a concealer
because I do feel like I'm going to be
quite sweet depart this week which sucks
like would you know it's gonna be one of
those weeks I'm like really anyway so i
will be using all of those and then like
I'm not going to be using bronzer or
anything like that because that
foundation does run a shade darker so I
won't be studying setting the editing it
in setting it in with my ELF tone
correcting powder and cool you guys know
I love this it's just in mosaic powder
that looks like this you have a green
pink you have a blue and then a yellow
color and it basically it just really
really helps to color correct the face
and I think that will be nice and it
also kind of lifts a dark foundation up
in tone so that's what i'll be using to
set everything in with as far as
eyeliner is concerned i love using this
jelly pong pong two-in-one eyeliner and
shadow in the shade I don't even know
what the shade is it doesn't even have a
shade name on here sorry guys but it's
just this really really rosy color I
like using this when I really want to
have like pink eyeshadow on or anything
that's a rosy tone so I'll put this on
my waterline it actually lasts an
incredibly long time on the water line I
don't like it as a cream shadow I think
when I wear this particular color all
over underneath my lower lashline it
makes me look a little sickly but when I
wear it on my waterline is actually very
pretty so kind of confusing but that is
what I would be using as my eyeliner
this week and then the eyeshadows that i
will be using are the covergirl true
naked roses palette and I day to use a
high-end palette last week so I'm using
drug store this week and I just love the
gorgeous rosy tones in here and I think
it's going to pair really nicely with
this particular eyeliner so I'm going to
have that really Rosie sort of pink look
going on with the eyes and speaking a
pig like I said we're pretty in pink
this week so of course i will be using
pink blushes the first one is from NYX
that this is the NYX blush plus
illuminator in the shade fetish and I
haven't reached for this in a long time
I love the color on this is just this
really really hot fuchsia pink color and
it's got tons and tons of little silver
iridescent like sparkles in it and they
can be a little chunky but honestly if
you can't really tell once you blend it
out so let me kind of blend it out so
you guys can see so there is pink fetish
and that's kind of what it blend it out
when you just straight up swipe it it is
a lot darker looking but you can build
the color on your cheeks and I do like
that one and then I'm also going to be
using my wet and wild fergie center
stage collection blush in the shade
brush with danger I love this blush it
is a cool toned blush this is like a mix
of Elah moscas Katy and a mix-up yeah
it's like parts illamasqua Katy and then
it's part elf what's it called pink
passion it's just a beautiful cool toned
pink color but it's not like straight-up
fuchsia it really has like a bit of a
creamy undertone and it's so beautiful
on the cheeks you guys especially if you
do have um really really fair skin like
I do it is definitely very very powdery
but look at that color do you see that
isn't that beautiful I love that shade
of pink so anyway we have mixes pink
fetish up here and then brush with
danger from wet and wild down there so
those are the two blushes that I will be
wearing on my cheeks this week and I'm
super excited because I think those are
just absolutely stunning and then let's
talk about the pink lip I will be
wearing i'm only going to be wearing one
like lip combination all week and it's
nice because i don't have to pair them
together so the first thing i wanted to
play with and i said i was going to
review this for you guys i'm sorry i
never got around to it but this is the
sephora wonderful cushion matte lip
cream and the shade is wonderful magenta
I love the formulation on this like I
think this is way better of a
formulation than the two face melted
matte lips to be completely honest i
love the formulation it comes like this
you have the little sponge tip
applicator and you guys can already see
that color the color is insane it's
beautiful and I love the matte finish on
it but honestly I'm going to be doing a
lot of gigs this week so I want to make
sure my lips are still relatively
moisturized so if I feel like it I
totally can just wear this particular
color just completely matte on my lips
but I know it would be a little more
moisturizing if I topped it with like a
moisturizing gloss so this is the
Maybelline I think these are called the
yet the elixirs from color sensational
and this particular shade is called 085
hibiscus Haven and this is what it looks
like it looks like it's a lipstick but
it's actually a gloss and i'll go ahead
and swatch this separately and then i'm
going to put
on top of the other color so you guys
can see so I was thinking with these if
I had two lips like this I basically
could pair them together or wear them
separately they're both really pretty in
pink look at that color it's amazing so
there is the matte lip cream and here's
the elixir and I just thought both of
them were really really nice if I'm
having really dry lips I can just go
with the color elixir if I want just a
really bold lip I can go with just the
matte lip cream but what I was really
thinking was that these two would layer
together beautifully so let me put the
elixir on top of the lip cream so you
guys can see and I'm pretty sure that's
what I'll be wearing for the majority of
the week so there is with the gloss on
top how stunning is that color it just
looks so juicy and spring light and
spring-like and pretty in pink e so
that's what i'll probably be doing for
most of the week but if for some reason
I just want to wear like the gloss or
just like the mat lift then I can do
that too alright and then the final
thing I want to talk about that i will
be using this week are these two
mascaras so i'm going to be wearing
brown mascara this week i really want
those pinky tones to be showing like on
my eyes and things like that so I
thought instead of going you with a
really dramatic black mascara I would
layer my covergirl clump crusher in the
shade of brown I will put this on first
I would layer it with the they're real
tinted primer and this one is basically
just like the they're real mascara
honestly I don't think it's that much
different like it is technically a
tinted primer but it really just feels
like a brown mascara to me so I'm gonna
layer the two of those together this
will be on the base this will be on top
and yeah I really think that when they
brought brown mascara will definitely i
cannot speak to them roam at marriott
brown mascaras I feel like those will
really really help so that all of these
really pinky Rosie tones on my eyes can
really shine through so anyway that is
shop and swatch my stash for the week I
hope you guys enjoyed this make sure to
tune in on saturday for look of the week
to see these products in action and then
again on Sunday for miles and holla
grails so you guys can know if I really
liked these or if I didn't
I feel like I'm reaching for a lot of
products that I haven't reached for in a
long time so this will be interesting
this week to see if I still like them
alright guys thank you for joining me
and I will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
