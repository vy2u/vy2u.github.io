my channel and welcome back to shop and
swatch my stash where I share with you
guys the makeup products I currently
have on my face and of course the makeup
products I will be using it this week
now I like to personally shop my stash
because I do have a larger collection
and this is a really nice way to make
sure that I am making the rounds through
my collection and actually using some of
this up which is that with the good
thing I highly recommend you guys go
ahead and shop your stash as well even
if I don't film one of these every
single Monday I still shop my stash
every single Sunday so even if I'm not
filming it I still shop my stash it's
just a really really nice way to make
the rounds through your actual
collection so anyway this week we are
focusing on products I have not touched
in over a year I feel like if you
haven't touched a product in over 12
months that is kind of a clear indicator
they either you need to rediscover it in
your collection or you don't like it
anymore so this is going to be a really
nice way of deciding some items that
need to be decluttered and then also
today like when I put some of these on I
was like holy why haven't I reach
for these in a while so let's go ahead
and jump right into it so the first item
I will be using is this eyeshadow
palette from it cosmetics this is the
naturally pretty Volume one palette it
is beautiful beautiful packaging as you
guys can see and it's probably going to
be a glare here so I don't know if
you're going to be able to see the
actual shades because of the packaging
but really really gorgeous a nice warm
tones and cool tones in here when I put
these on today I was like holy I
almost felt like I over blended up my
eyeshadows like I forgot how well these
blend if there is a formula that I would
say is very similar to it I would say
like the Anastacio Beverly Hills formula
think of like the modern renaissance
palette being like a neutral version
really really buttery very easy to blend
and today I am wearing the shade sheer
glow sheer joy sheer glow sheer enjoy
all over my lid I have the shade warmth
as my transition I took the shade of
sunrise into my crease and then I took
the shade of sunset which is a beautiful
kind of like burnt orange shade I took
that into the outer V and on my lower
lash line and I'm so incredibly happy
with the look I feel like it's just a
very very beautiful barely-there kind of
eyeshadow look but it's like there's
some kind of definition and I really
like it so there they are swatched I
feel like being swatch they're really
it's not a clear indicator how well
these go onto the eyes because they are
very very powdery
you definitely have to tap off that
excess then they go on to the face
beautifully so very excited for that
next we do have two little blush
palettes here from
Lancome these are the blush sub teal
palettes in three to three rows flush
and one to six nectar lace so today I
did put on the rosa flush shade so
mostly I'm just going to be
concentrating on the blush I don't
really reach for these soft contour and
the highlight all that often I feel like
they're almost too soft again kind of
like the it cosmetics they don't really
go on to the skin that nicely I mean
these go onto this get you guys know
what I mean and they're done they just
like you could blend them away really
quickly as what I'm trying to say so I
feel like the contour and the highlight
aren't that great to put the blush on in
the middle or in the middle is
absolutely gorgeous now this particular
shade I picked up because talk to you
raved about it on her channel she said
this was one of her top 5 blushes like a
couple years ago and I remember picking
it up and just being amazed and I was
amazed again today when I put this on my
cheeks it reminds me a lot of the Becca
luminous flesh formula but softer less
pigmented and even more easy to blend
into the skin so really really happy
with that and then this one right here
is nectar lace this one has again a soft
contour a warmer highlight and then in
the middle shade which is what I'm going
to be using is the blush and it's a
really really nice orange shade so very
very excited for these kind of
rediscovered it's crazy that I haven't
reached for these in such a long time um
but there are the two of them so Rose
flushed on the top and then this one
down here is nectar lace very very happy
with those you guys alright next we do
have the highlights that I'm going to be
rooting for this week and the
highlighters that I chose are the Josie
Maran Argan enlightenment in luminizing
veil as well as the Clinique uplighting
powder in the shade and new to glow now
this is the one that I have on today as
my actual highlight and it just reminded
me how beautiful those natural
highlights are these remind me a lot of
the hourglass ambient lighting powder so
you can kind of dust them all over as a
finishing powder the shade is definitely
too dark for my skin but when I applied
it really lightly today on the high
points of my face I just think it looks
beautiful
I really just reminded me again how
beautiful those you know glow from
within kind of highlights can be I feel
like right now I'm so obsessed with the
trend of really really piling on
highlights and today I feel like this
actually made my skin look better you
know sometimes when you put on a very
very heavy duty high
like and it just emphasizes your pores
and stuff today I feel like my skin
looks really really beautiful and just
lit from within and very very happy with
this so yeah
I will be using that and then at the
luminizing veil from josie maran
is absolutely beautiful as well this
one's a little more warm toned again it
kinda has like chunks of glitter in it
but this does not show up on the skin
whatsoever
a very very soft focus sort of
illuminating powder and I feel like
these can be used multiple different
ways so very very excited for those this
week as far as foundation is concerned
I'm going to be reaching for one of my
favorites and you're going to be like
what this is one of your favorites you
literally never talked about this this
is one of my favorites because I love
the finish of it it is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin a liquid and makeup it does
have titanium dioxide sunscreen which is
a physical sunblock as well as SPF 20
blah blah blah blah I really shade
classic ivory and the reason why I never
ever talked about this you guys is
because I can only wear it during a
certain time of year I have two to three
layers of self-tanner on currently and
this matches me perfectly so I cannot
wear it during the winter time just
because it is way too dark on me but
during the spring and summer I can get
away with it and a lot of people say
this is very very similar to the NARS
sheer glow foundation
I've never tried this year glow I'll
probably pick up the sheer glow once I
run out of this since obviously
Neutrogena tests on animals and I will
not be repurchasing but it's a beautiful
beautiful foundation I just wish that
they had a lighter shade because I can
only wear this during the spring and
summertime so yeah I've actually not
reached for this since last summer so it
has been a whole entire year but I love
this foundation alright next we do have
the tortoise contour palette from Tarte
cosmetics this is a beautiful beautiful
palette from Tarte cosmetics it got
stuff underneath my Alex series night
drawer so that is why I literally have
not reached for it in a year there of
course is one mist in here because it's
a Tarte palette shade I feel like
they're always absolutely lovely notes
of Miss Anna Tarte palette and it is
that little pearly white shade right in
the middle but the rest of them are
beautiful you guys said you have on it
this corrector today which is yellow
tone underneath my eyes really lightly
the highlight is super super creamy
again wearing that today and then I do
have on in this shade which is the light
contour beautiful they are cocoa powder
infused some of these softest most
buttery highlights
just like contouring products ever from
Tarte cosmetics I think I like this more
than I like my Too Faced cocoa contour
kit and you guys know I love that cocoa
contour kit
although charts and Too Faced have
definitely been kind of like not so much
hitting out of the ballpark lately I
will say some of their OG or old-school
products are still really really good so
yeah going to be using those and then to
set my foundation in this week I will be
using the tarte confidence creamy powder
foundation in the shade of fair neutral
now this is too light for me but because
the foundation is still a little dark
even with the self-tanner this is what
I'm going to use to set my whole entire
face in its beautiful today I just
Dippold it onto my face and I feel like
I'm matching my neck pretty darn well so
very excited for that I think I have
reached for that in the last six months
but again it has been six months but I
really do like it and then I'm also
going to be using these guys as
eyeliners the first is the boppie Brown
a long wear cream shadow stick in the
shade a shadow and then this guy right
here is what I have on today it's the
Laura Mercier rose gold caviar stick eye
color I know that these are supposed to
be cream eyeshadows I'm not a huge fan
of cream eyeshadow so I'm going to be
using them as eyeliners um you have to
be really careful if you use these as
eyeliners because they do tend to get a
little gloopy on the lashes so make sure
you're very gentle when you take your
actual makeup off but yeah that is what
they look like I feel like the rose gold
will go really nicely with the eye
shadow palette for the warm tone shades
and then the cool tone shades can go
nicely with the shadow stick so very
excited for those and then on my lips
again rediscovered favorites it
cosmetics it girl this is one of their
blurred lined lipsticks and it is
absolutely beautiful you guys I feel
like it's a nice bright - juicy red but
there is a little bit of depth there a
little bit of like a classic red a true
brick-red kind of color so very excited
to be playing with this this week and it
just went on so and nicely you guys know
I'm going to be doing a massive massive
lip declutter soon and this is
definitely going to stay in the
collection as far as primers are
concerned I'll be using these two little
guys right here I feel like I've used
the majority of my primers at the last
six to 12 months which is great but this
little cover effects illuminating primer
and the that gala brightening face
primer from benefit I have not reached
for so I use this one today the reason
why I really don't like this and I feel
like I haven't reach for it in forever
is because it reminds me a lot of the
Becca backlight brightening filter not a
huge fan of that I feel like it gives a
very artificial plastered kind of look
to my face so yeah once I'm done with
this not going to purchase a full-size
and
benefit back yell I remember loving this
but again didn't use it today so we'll
see and then finally I'm going to be
using this little mascara combo here not
happy with it whatsoever definitely
decluttering these probably but let's
see if I can make them work this week
the first is the Lancome um what is this
base mascara it's just a really really
crappy base in my opinion I don't feel
like it does a whole lot for my lashes
whatsoever and then even the Dior what
is this called Diorshow mascara I'm not
a huge fan I'm like really really clumpy
lashes I feel like today this gave up a
very very kind of fanned out fluttering
lash look if you like very very natural
mascara similar to like the L'Oreal
voluminous mascara maybe you'd like this
but for me it's just not my style and
then the last two products i'll be using
this week are just ones that I have
touched with in literally the past week
but I need to you know bring them in so
I can complete my look the first is the
honest hacia Beverly Hills brow Wiz and
you shade blondes I'm going to use that
so I can have a really really nice
natural brow and then also the Smashbox
photo finish primer water which I've
been loving that's going to be used to
set my whole face in so anyway guys
those are promised I had not touched in
a year some of them I already could feel
like oh my god I'm so glad I
rediscovered them and then some of them
today I was like they need to go in the
next e clutter so anyway let me know
down below what you shopped your stash
for this week I hope you enjoyed this
video as always thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow for my very first anti haul by
