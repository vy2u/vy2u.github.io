my channel thank you so much for joining
me today's video is going to be shop and
swatch my stash and also a project pan
so I am going to start with my project
pan I wanted to say really quickly the
last project pan I did was an utter fail
I have been doing project pans on my
channel for over a year now I'm not like
huge in the project pan community or
anything like that but I do believe if
you have a large collection like I do
first of all you should shop your stash
so that you are trying at different
products each week and making sure that
you are rotating through everything and
second of all I do think you should try
and use some up so anyway I do have
ten new products here that I want to
share with you guys that I'm going to
try and use that by June first the
reason why I can't update you on the
other products that I had for that
finish 9 by spring I'm kind of like a
video or because honestly I put them all
in here and then I set them aside in a
place where I forgot about them and I
only got through one of them so I picked
out 10 new items I am going to keep this
right on my desk so that I know to reach
for them so let me share with you guys
what is in here and the first item is
this Bobbi Brown SPF 25 teen teen
moisturizing balm I do wear these shade
alabaster teens I'm not trying to use
this up completely I just want to hit
pan on it it was something that I did
have in my makeup use of 2016 challenge
and I really didn't make a lot of
progress this is what it looks like it's
not that I don't like this product if I
really don't like something I will just
return it or I will declutter it to a
friend there's no point in me forcing
myself to try and use it up but this is
just something that honestly I like it
but I really forget to use it I find
that it's a little difficult because you
have to scoop it out you have to put
your finger in there I find it kind of
gross but it is beautiful on the skin so
I want to keep an eye on that by June
1st I also want to use both of these ups
the first is the NARS Copacabana
illuminator and the second is the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter liquid version
in moonstone so this one has started to
change in scent and you know that when
something starts starts to change in
scent it is starting to go bad so this
is a really beautiful products like
nothing against it whatsoever I'm just
gonna start mixing it into my
foundations every single day I do have
it mixed in with my Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation today and I think it
looks beautiful but that is a little
swatch for you guys it's just a really
really nice kind of yellow liquid
illuminator you can also use it as an
actual highlight i personally don't I
just want to mix it in with my
foundation since I do have more oily
skin but yeah I would like to you
that up since the scent has started to
change on that and then the NARS
Copacabana this has been open for two
years and it is starting to change as
well as far as scent is concerned so I
want to use that up completely
it is like the product from hell though
I mean I love it but it takes forever to
get through this so let's see if I can
make progress on that in the last
project pan I did want to try and use up
my Stella aqua blow perfecting primer I
actually need a lot of progress on this
this is all that I have left in here so
I want to finish this off before June
1st also I want to finish off this
primer right here this is the L'Oreal
magic perfecting base I only have a
small amount left in here it has been
open for over a year and a half and
again at the scent is starting to change
a little bit I do prefer this over the
benefit Porefessional so I want to make
sure that I use that up and then yet
another primer the wet and wild cover
all I love this primer I think it's
fantastic I'm about right here currently
and I want to make sure that I get
through this as well it has started to
change and scent as well
so anyway going to use that up I do have
a brow product here that I really want
to make some progress on it is the
Maybelline brow brow drama
brow drama grin pomade at the shade that
I wear is blonde I was obsessed with
this before I got into my breath long
color stay brow pencil this is how much
I have left and I'm just like you know
what you need to just get through it
before it starts to kind of like harden
up it is still really really nice and
soft so I'm gonna try and use that up
and then I have some mascara products
here so the first one is the urban decay
subversion thicker longer stronger lash
primer I have just a tiny amount of this
left I love it I will repurchase this so
I'm gonna use that up and then I have
two mascaras here that are not cruelty
free unfortunately but they are favorite
so I want to use up every last drop the
first one is these before outrageous
curl dramatic curve and volume mascara
this is my all-time favorite mascara so
I want to use that up and then also the
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
this is a favorite from the drugstore
it's beautiful very similar to the Laura
Mercier extra lash sculpting mascara so
those are all 10 products that I want to
use up by June 1st if you would like to
join me for this project pan please let
me know down below and let me know which
products you are going to use and yeah
that's pretty much it let's go ahead and
get into these shop my stash portion of
this video so the first thing that I
will be using on my face this week is
the Kat Von D metal
Matt eyeshadow palette I have this on
today I have more of like the purpley
pink tones on but this is what it looks
like on the inside you have her metal
crush is it metal crush I think it's
metal crush eyeshadows on top and then
you have mattes on the bottom these
shades that I do have on today are this
one right here all over which is called
bone and then I do have fringe in my
crease as my transition I have silk in
my crease and then I have this shade
ribbon which was a little tricky to
blend I have that in my outer V and I
also smoked out on my lower lashline and
then the shade twinkle which is one of
the metal crush I have that all over my
lid so let me go ahead and swatch these
shades for you guys like I said that
ribbon shade with a little tricky to
work with today but for the most part
these are beautiful beautiful eyeshadows
I love at this palette I think this was
the best one that released this holiday
season so here they are let me go ahead
and do some one swipe swatches for you
guys so there are the shades that I am
NOT wearing today as you can see that
ribbon shade a little a little chalky
and honestly a little patchy but that is
the only one in the whole entire palette
that I find pretty patchy alright so as
far as highlight is concerned this week
I will be using my new Anastasio Beverly
Hills nicole guerrero glow kit
I am so extremely excited and the shade
that I do have on today if you are
curious is this one which is one of my
favorites it is called Forever Young
which is a beautiful beautiful kind of
like cool toned grayish pinky shade so
there is the shade of Forever Young I
did a review on this I will go ahead and
throw it up in the cards right here if I
can figure out how to or I will have it
linked down below but yeah my review
video on there and that particular
product is up and a lot of you were
saying that you love this and a lot of
you were actually saying that you hate
this I noticed that some of you who do
have more mature skin we're saying that
this really clings to dry patches and
these are just not good for you but a
lot of people that were around my age
group were saying they loved it so if
you don't like a really intense
highlighter and if you are worried that
something is going to start like really
emphasizing fine lines and wrinkles I
think that this could be that kind of
palette that will do that so if you do
have aging skin I might stay away from
this but if you do have skin that is I
can't apply cuz I'm starting to age a
little bit as well I'm 24 years old but
if you have younger skin I think that
you would like this they're very very
foiled and metallus eyes let me show you
a few more swatches here is the shade
kitty kat and here's the shade daydream
daydream is the only one that I feel
like a look
like it has little glitter particles
really up close but it doesn't actually
transfer that way on to the actual skin
but yeah I just wanted to let you guys
know there were a few of you that were
saying that this does not look good on
your skin so if you do have more aging
skin I guess I would stay away alright
so for a setting spray this week I will
be using my skin to navy a post makeup
recovery spray this was sent to me in
exchange for an honest review from the
skin janae via brand as well as octa Lee
so that will be my setting spray this
week as far as primer is concerned I
will be using my it cosmetics fields a
moment anti-aging ultra hydrating
sensory away any primer serum it looks
like this is my all-time favorite primer
if you were curious about what my
all-time favorite face primer is it is
this one it has a little bit of a pinky
hue to it it's really nice and nice to
method comb sort of formula I feel like
it hydrates it fills in my pores and I
will actually also be using this as an
eye primer because it works that well
for bronzer this week I will be using
the laura geller beach made thick beach
mat baked hydrating bronzer in the shade
sunrise fair and this is what it looks
like it has like a little bit of like a
cushion imprint on it it's super super
beautiful very very finely milled like
so so so smooth um but I will say this
does lean a little bit on the orange
side this appeared together with the
blush that I'm wearing today I feel like
made my cheeks look a little too out
there but it's okay it still looks
relatively good as far as blush is
concerned I am wearing this lorac
colorsource buildable blush today in the
shade cinematic it is completely matte
and it's a really really nice neutral
terracotta shade now it is intensely
intensely pigmented so if you do have
very very fair skin I would highly
recommend using a fluffy brush with this
today I made the mistake of going in
with something that was a little more
densely packed with bristles and I feel
like it's very very light blue yeah I'm
wearing blush today but yeah that is
just something that is really beautiful
if you do have a deeper skin tone and I
feel like that could even work at the
bronzer on you and then I also want to
be using my illamasqua powder blusher in
the shade Katie which is a beautiful
soft cool toned pink color it has like a
little bit of a white base I feel like
this would look a little ashy on a
deeper skin tones but if you are fair
complected this is really really
beautiful so there is the shade Katie
swatched I do want to do some baking
this week with my by Thierry hyaluronic
hydra powder normally i wouldn't bake
with something like this because i feel
like when you're
you're really kind of wasting product a
little bit cuz you're swiping it away
after a few minutes this is just too
good to swipe away and it's extremely
expensive but I wanted to see how well
it could set my under eye area I thought
is it a beautiful beautiful job today so
I will be using that and this was also
sent to me in exchange for an honest
review from by Tier II and octal II if
you were curious to set my entire face
in I will be using my ELF tone
correcting powder initiate cool and this
is what it looks like and I have hit
some major pan on this baby one of my
all-time favorite setting powders
besides the essence all about Matt
fixing compact powder for my brows this
week I will be using something different
if this is the model lunch or brows in
the shaded taupe so you have the brow
definer on one side this does lean well
I just drop the cap then have this does
lean a little bit onto the purpley side
it's very very cool toned let me see if
I can show you guys I just literally
broke off the top of that but here is
the swap sorry you guys it does lean a
little more like the reddish or purpley
side that you do have a spoolie on the
other side which is awesome so that's
what I will be using it for brows this
week and then for mascara I will be
layering together two mascaras as usual
the first one is the Bobbi Brown smoky
eye mascara this has a natural bristle
wand and then I will be putting on top
the L'Oreal voluminous feline mascara
this one has more of a rubber bristle
and and it's very very spiky let me show
you guys right up my alley so that is
what it looks like
alright as far as lip products are
concerned this week I will be layering
in the two of these together or just
wearing them separately today I am just
wearing this one this is the maybelline
color elixir in the shade 0 8 v hibiscus
haven I love these they look like their
lipsticks but they're not they're
actually kind of like a hybrid of a
lipstick and also a lip gloss this shade
I thought was a little too like cool
toned pink for me and but I still think
it looks kind of pretty so that is what
it looks like I have just this shade on
today and I'm trying to find dupes for
you guys for the NARS Velvet lip glides
and I feel like these two formulas are
very similar so here is the Revlon Ultra
HD matte lip color in the shade honey
this is also really really beautiful and
I actually feel like this is not really
a HD lip or like a matte lip color
whatsoever it stays glossy on the skin
and I absolutely adore it so that is
what the two of those look like there is
the Revlon honey
and there is the maybelline color elixir
for actual like under the eye kind of
highlighting brightening and also
concealing this week I will be using the
cap on G luck a concealer creme in the
shade white out so this is a pale girl
must-have for sure and I actually like
to layer that together with the it
cosmetics bye bye redness neutralizing
cream these blend beautifully together
and this kind of darkens in this
particular shade up a little bit I am
very very tan right now or at least I'm
kind of tan right now for me personally
so this was a little too white for me
today I need to mix a little more of
this together tomorrow and then as far
as eyeliner is concerned I want to wear
two of my NYX what are these eye and
eyebrow pencils and the slide on glide
on stay on and definitely a turn-on
waterproof eyeliner so this one is in
the shade black this one is in the shade
white I have not worn a white eyeliner
on my actual waterline for a while so I
have that on today I feel like it's a
very eye opening so I'm very excited
about that and then finally the last
product that I will be using this week
is from Estee Lauder it is the Double
Wear state in place of makeup this is
just a little yellow toned and a little
deeper than my normal skin tone so it
matches me perfectly right now and the
shade that I do wear is one and one
ivory notice so that is everything that
I will be wearing on my face this week I
hope you guys enjoyed this video
definitely let me know down below if you
want to join me for the project pan and
also it let me know if you shop your
stash this week so that is it thanks for
joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
