channel welcome back to shop and swatch
my stash where I share with you guys as
I make a product ow
the makeup products I currently have on
my face and of course the makeup
products I will be using this week my
hair is a mess as usual my hands are all
sweaty and clammy it's super super super
 hot you can get right now anyway
that's why I didn't show up right into
it I will be going for a very very light
and Spri makeup this week so the first
item that I will be using is from Tarte
so this is the BB tinted primer
treatment this is what it looks like and
I do wear the shade of fair and I wore
this as my base today I'm not going to
be doing in any color correcting or
concealing this is all that I put on and
I will have a friends-and-family sale
haul to do for you guys on Friday from
Tarte cosmetics I will be doing a you
know haul and outs of reviews of all the
products that I picked up like the
beating deodorant and all that stuff but
anyway this is the product i'll be using
this week i love this it does go from
like a cream to eat powder formula so if
you do have more oily skin i think you
would adore it and then to set that in i
will be using another tarte product this
is the let's see here fair honey
Amazonian clay full coverage airbrush
foundation so the shade is fair honey
and blue it's all it's all sticky but
that is what the actual product looks
like and I'm not going to sure about
this I feel like it did set me and
rather nicely today it does have the
tiniest amount of coverage to it but
it's not like amazing in my opinion but
that is what it looks like the sheet is
definitely more yellow toned for my
complexion but this is the latest one
they have it has a little sifter and you
bounce your brush in there I found the
sifter very very annoying but at the
same time loose powders like this can be
very very messy so we shall see I'm
gonna pair the two of those together
again I will give you guys my final
thoughts on Friday's as far as mascara
combination is concerned this week I
will be layering together my Bobbi Brown
smoky eye mascara with the benefits
they're real I have that on right now I
love it I feel like it's very very
lifting and pretty on the eyes the Bobbi
Brown does have a natural bristle wand
and then this one it looks like a little
medieval torture device it's got a
rubber bristle one with lots of little
spikes on it alright moving on for
eyeliner this week I will be using the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
initiated delirious it's a really really
nice kind of like jewel toned purple
shade with a little bit of glitter in it
I guess you could say and it's very very
beautiful so there is the little swatch
right there that was like the worst
swatch ever I swear it goes on really
you do have to build up the color a
little bit on the water line but I
really really like it I think it's a
nice pop of color for spring and then of
course I will be using my Revlon
Colorstay brow pencil in the shade
blonde I have just been loving this you
guys know I told you it has like this
nice kind of inky wet formula over here
almost like a pomade but it has this
really really nice a little applicator
and then you have the spoolie on one end
and I feel like this color is really
really nice for me as well so really
have been enjoying that and that's
literally all I've been using in my
brows this week I'm just gonna fill in
the front part of my brows and then also
the end over here and a little bit in
the arch alright and then I also will be
using my Smashbox photo finish primer of
water this is silicone free alcohol-free
and oil free Smashbox is now cruelty
free and I just have this year so I
think that I will use that to set at my
face in this week and if I do want to go
in with a primer even though this is
technically a primer I'll go ahead and
do that too before I go in with the
Tarte product and then for blush this
week I will be using my Becca luminous
flush the blushes Marc luminous flush
blushes in these shades Snapdragon which
is a really really nice hot coral and
these are super pigmented do not look
the name fool you you guys seriously
they are beautiful so there is the shade
Snapdragon that is the one that I have
on today and then also this one right
here which is called Tiger Lily and this
is like a true true hot orange so really
really beautiful I love these this is my
favorite like product basically from
Becca truly I like these more than the
shimmering skin perfecter press I like
them more than the mineral blushes they
are absolutely beautiful I plan on
collecting all of them however they are
super super pricey like they're
literally what like $30 for let's see
here six grams or is 0.2 ounces so not a
lot of product in here but a little does
go a very long way and I applied at this
one today with a very fluffy brush and
then for highlight this week I will be
using up my Tarte exposed highlight this
is the Amazonian clay formula and I
adore this it is so so so beautiful and
creamy I have it on today like I said
and I think it's really really beautiful
it definitely is darker than my skin
tone but it doesn't mean that it can't
give you a nice glow so there is swatch
super super gorgeous very nice foiled
look to the cheeks and I just bring it
all the way down to the apples of my
cheeks I know a lot of people say not to
do that sorry my phone just went off not
to do that but I do like to bring it all
the way down especially if the highlight
is darker than my skin because then it
just kind of looks like it meshes in
with the blush and the bronzer
and then speaking of bronzer I will be
using the wet and wild color icon
bronzer with SPF 15 in D shade
7:39 ticket to Brazil and I know a lot
of people hate this because it's so
Orange E I'm so cold tones that I
actually really enjoy dusting this on my
face because it kind of like neutralizes
out my skin tone because it is so cool
tone it kind of gives a little bit of
warmth and just makes it look very nice
and neutral so there it is a swatch and
I will be doing a video for you guys
soon as well talking about my favorite
bronzers for fairer skin so that is
pretty much it I do have just two more
products here actually and those are my
lip products I will be using the
Maybelline Color elixir in the shade 0 8
v hibiscus haven this is definitely a
formula do before the NARS the velvet
lip glides and they are really creamy
really really beautiful and the shade is
a nice hot pink and then I will be
wearing underneath this one the Lancome
shine lover lipstick in the shade it's
346 but I'm not quite sure it does not
have a name on it super beautiful
packaging normally I don't like products
from Lancome but this one is amazing it
has a really nice sheer formula super
super buttery on the lips and it's a
bright pop of color so there is the
Lancome and then there is the color
elixir I have those layered together
today and I've been wearing them for two
hours already which is awesome so that
is pretty much it you guys I know this
is a really quick video but I'm not
wearing a lot of makeup on my face this
week I just wanted to go with really
nice light kind of spring it easy
simplistic makeup and I'm super excited
to share this look with you guys for
Saturday so anyway thank you for joining
me and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
