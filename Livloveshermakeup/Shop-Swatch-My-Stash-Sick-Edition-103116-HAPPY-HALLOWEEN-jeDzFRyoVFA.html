channel and welcome back to shop and
swatch my stash where I share with you
guys the makeup products that i
currently have my face and also they
make up products that i will be using
all week i still not feeling a hundred
percent which is why i'm calling this
the sick edition just because i'm still
feeling pretty darn sick you guys didn't
know i've been out with like a lupus
flare for the past about a week and a
half I did have videos that we're going
up for you guys that were pre films but
unfortunately I ended up just not having
enough video is to go up so anyway this
is going to be sick edition I know I
look sick it's because I'm still sick
but I'm gonna share with you guys kind
of the makeup that I like to toss on
when I'm not feeling one hundred percent
so the first item that i will be using
this week is from gosh cosmetics this is
their CC cream in the illuminating
version and this is what the actual
packaging looks like this is such a
beautiful CC cream you guys the shade
that I where is 0-1 porcelain it is
oil-free even though it's very
illuminating and hydrating and it just
melts into the skin I swear to you it's
absolutely beautiful so that is what it
looks like and let me show you by the
actual consistency I really love this
bottle the applicator everything but
that is what the actual consistency
looks like it's quite runny but it
really just illuminates and hydrates the
skin beautiful you don't know how else
to describe it the actual coverage on it
is a very very sheer it's not even light
it's just straight up like sheer but
it's very beautiful so i will be using
that i also will be pairing together if
i want to i did it today just because it
felt like an extra step but i will be
using the Too Faced Born This Way
naturally radiant concealer in the shade
very fair if I feel like I need a little
extra coverage I do love this concealer
because it is so lightweight and
beautiful on the skin this particular
shade which is called very fair is
slightly dark on me right now when I am
at my palace but it is still really
really beautiful go figure the shade
called very fair would be too dark but
it still is really really gorgeous
underneath the eyes um as far as the lip
products are you can excuse me as far as
lip products are concerned this week i
will be using my lancome juicy shaker in
the shade sherry symphony i just thought
it would be easy to Pat onto my lips my
lips are extremely dry after this last
player or episode so I thought that this
would be nice i love the applicator and
it's just a really nice looks nice light
wash of color it is a lip oil so it
doesn't last on the
lips very long but I still think it's a
nice shade so that is what i will be
using on my lips for primers i will be
using my Maybelline Baby skin instant
pore eraser which I love from the
drugstore this is definitely a dupe for
the bio cell too she clawed primer in my
opinion same sort of consistency it's
same sort of appearance on the skin it
is absolutely beautiful so i will be
using that as my face primer and then i
will be using my ELF one-dollar eyelid
primer which you guys know I love
drugstore I primers so i will be using
that this week I do have a little I
shadow palette that I thought I would
pull out I'm only wearing one shade
today but still it makes me feel a
little better to put some eye shadow on
so this is the double duty beauty
Amazonian clay young wild &amp;amp; free pellet
from Tarte cosmetics it says throw
kindness around like confetti which is
so cute and then this is what the actual
shades look like it is mirrored so I
hope I'm not blinding you guys but that
is what the sheets look like they are
very soft and buttery and creamy very
reminiscent of the tart in bloom palette
which is why I really really gave this
palette a great review and I stand by
that I think these are absolutely
beautiful so there are some swatches for
you guys and they shape excuse me sorry
guys they say that I am wearing today is
called weekend which is this one right
here I have that worked into my crease
and then a little bit smudged out on my
lower lashline my hair is driving me
crazy so i will be using that I you
shadow palette this week to set
everything in i will be using my essence
all about matt fixie compact powder what
kind of a video would it be without me
mentioning this huh so i will be using
that to set all of my makeup in and then
i will be using these two mascaras to
combine together this week so the first
is the wet and wild max volume plus
mascara and today i put this on and then
I was like you know what I want to layer
up my mascara I feel like when I'm sick
the one area of my face that really is
like a dead giveaway that I'm not
feeling good is my eye area it just
looks very dead not very awake so I did
put this on and this is a very very
natural mascara this is what the actual
want looks like it's kind of like an
hourglass shape we're kind of like a
pear shape i should say it's very like a
small and skinny on top and then bigger
towards the bottom and this is actually
really beautiful it really gives you
nice to find really really natural
looking lashes but then I thought you
know what I want to take that up a notch
I want a little bit of clump eNOS it
just makes me feel like me so I did go
in with my Maybelline the falsies
push-up drama which this is just a very
very
defining mascara so it's kind of like a
three and one it will sculpt it will
define it out it will also lengthen
those lashes so I do enjoy that I will P
be here I will be pairing the two of
those together and then for eyeliner i
will be using the clinic skinny stick in
the shade a03 slim sable I feel like
I've been reaching for this a lot lately
in shop my stash and I don't know why
but I think it's probably because of how
precise it is that is the little tip of
it it is so tiny and it's beautiful the
actual color is a gorgeous gorgeous dark
chocolaty Brown it kind of reminds me of
the Sumatra shade from these Smashbox
always sharp kohl liner collection but
yeah I really enjoy this and I feel like
it's so nice to get on to the waterline
very quickly and it is very soft as well
and then the last item that i will be
using this week is my ambient lighting
edit palette from the 2015 holiday
collection from hourglass in here you
are getting a strobing powder right
there you are getting to ambient
lighting powders and dim light and out
some boot exposure is it called mood
exposure I'm sorry it's called diffused
light this one's diffuse like this is
dim light and then that one in the
middle is iridescent light which is the
strobing powder you are getting the
blush in mood exposure which I do have
on my cheeks today you are getting a
luminous flush um what does it call
bronzer in the shade bronze light and
then also luminous flush blush which is
that one right there so there's the
bronzer one blush and then boot exposure
this is a beautiful palace I love all of
the shades in here they're so soft and
buttery and creamy and you know a lot of
people didn't like this palette because
you don't get a ton of stuff in it or
you don't get a ton of not a ton of
stuff you don't get a ton of colors in
here but I think this one is just
absolutely beautiful I love the way that
these go onto the skin and if you are
not feeling one hundred percent I swear
this kind of like um ambient lighting
thing really does kind of blur out
imperfections on your face and things
like that so i will be using that this
week so anyway guys those are all of the
items that i will be using a for shop
and swatch my stash this week for my
sick edition thank you so much for
everyone who was checking up on me this
week i am starting to feel a lot better
and i will have another video going up
for you guys later tonight so i will see
you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
