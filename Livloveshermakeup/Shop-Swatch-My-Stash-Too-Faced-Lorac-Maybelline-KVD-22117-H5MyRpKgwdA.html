channel welcome back to shop and swatch
my stash where I sure everything I see
makeup products I currently have on my
face and of course they makeup products
that I will be using this week normally
I do post these videos on Monday but if
you guys did it now I just got back from
Hawaii on Sunday and if you were
traveling from the Midwest to Hawaii it
literally takes like nine hours so I
just kind of had a full day full of
flights and things like that so I
thought I would just go ahead and upload
shot my stash today and get back into my
normal series which I usually do
throughout the week so this one and then
on Saturday look of the week and I'm on
Sunday feels and holy grails so anyway
let's go ahead and just jump right into
it I will share with you guys the
products that I'll be using this week so
the first two items I will be using our
primers this one is the Too Faced shadow
insurance of glitter glue glitter
bonding a primer it is an eye primer and
I really do like this so I will be using
that on my eyes and then for my face I
will be using the milk makeup cooling a
water stick not the blurring stick thing
that everybody's talking about right now
no this is actually something I
purchased about six months ago it's
actually a moisturizer but it reminds me
a lot a lot a lot of the Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer so I'm going to be
using that as my actual face primer you
just kind of roll it up like this and it
is really cooling on the skin I don't
know if you guys can tell I did get a
little bit of Sun while I was on my trip
a little bit of sunburn as well as a
little bit of a tan so this little
cooling water stick actually feels
really really good on my face and it
definitely leaves a little bit of
tackiness which is really nice as a face
primer so that is what I will be using
for my face primer as far as my base is
concerned I did run it I did turn out at
this new Maybelline Dream cushion fresh
face a liquid foundation on the go for
the first time this morning so this is
pretty darn good you guys I think it
looks absolutely stunning on the skin
it's very very beautiful looking on the
skin however this is the lightest shade
which is called number 10 porcelain and
it is still too dark for me so I really
wish they would open up their shade
selection now this is not something that
I would repurchase anyway because ameba
Lee does tests on animals however this
is something that I did purchase I would
say about two or three months ago I was
gonna do a first impressions for you
guys and then I got really worried
because it looked very very dark and
honestly it really does run very very
yellow and very very dark so this is
what the actual cushion compact looks
like like I said I have these shade
which is the lightest which is called
number 10 of porcelain and I will show
you guys a little swatch of that and it
just is very
yellow tone even with my tan right now I
feel like it is darker than my skin and
then also I do want to use the dreamy
brightening creamy concealer this is
from Maybelline as well and not liking
this so far did the first impressions
this morning on it well I guess first
impressions not on camera but just me
sitting by myself putting on my makeup
and I felt like it was really cleaning
too dry patches on my face although it
is very pretty as far as color is
concerned I do like you for underneath
the eyes because it has a little bit of
yellow properties for cancelling out
blue tones it just didn't feel that
creamy on the skin now I do have a
little bit of a sunburn like I said my
skin is a little on the drier side since
I am peeling a bit so maybe this will
work for me once the peeling is done but
for the most part I was not super
impressed with that but I will play with
it this week and just continue to see
how it works all right as far as
eyeshadow is concerned this week I will
be using my Too Faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette I have not reached
for this in a very very long time so
today I am wearing the shade coconut
creme butter pecan and bonbon and I just
have those all over my lid underneath my
lash line I just kind of blended all
three shades together this is my
all-time favorite chocolate bar palette
if you guys are curious I get asked a
lot which one is your favorite and the
answer is this one I really love the
warm tones in here I think it's
beautiful I love the formula on all of
these none of them skip or you know
they're not patchy they're not hard to
blend they're just all really really
beautiful so there are a few swatches
for you guys this one is caramel swirl
and then this one is the pecan shade and
then there is I believe peanut butter
and peanut butter I'm sorry yeah it is
it's peanut butter and peanut butter is
also in the what is it the peanut butter
and jelly palette I believe so yeah
super excited to be playing with that
and then I did want to choose an
eyeliner that would kind of go along
with that this is the NYX slide on glide
on and stay on to flee a turn on
eyeliner in the shade FL bronze and I
just thought this would look beautiful
with some of the warmer toned eye looks
that I am going to create so I'm wearing
that today on my lower lash line and
then I am wearing it on my waterline as
well as my tight line alright I'm going
to continue using my Revlon Colorstay
brow pencil in blonde I've been obsessed
with this for the past couple weeks so
on one side we have the spoolie and then
on the other side
we have the little brow definer or the
pencil that is what it looks like
reminds me a lot of the Anastacio
Beverly Hills brow definer it has that
little triangular sort of tip to it and
that is what the shade looks like so
really really nice kind of ashy blonde
color perfect for me right now since I
have not done my hair I have not gotten
it done or colored for quite some time
now as far as lip products are concerned
I will be wearing my to Korres lip
butter glosses in the shades peach and
also pink so the one I have on right now
is called peach and I just thought this
would be really really nice these are
very very glossy they're very very
buttery and very very comfortable on the
lips so here is a swatch of the peach
shade as you guys can see very very very
pretty and then the pink shade is just a
really nice kind of cool toned pinky
color as you guys can see so this one's
out so very beautiful and I just love
comfortable lip products if you've been
watching me for a while you know this
about me so there is the shade pink and
then there is the shade at peach alright
moving on as far as mascara is concerned
this week I will be layering two and I
really like the way it came out today so
the first one I will be using is Lancome
Hypnose drama which is a really really
nice wet formula this does have a
natural bristle wand and then I will be
layering the it cosmetics superhero
mascara on top of it this one also does
have a natural bristle wand but it is a
very dry formula now I find if I wear
this alone although my lashes look
really really fantastic very stretched
out and elastic looking I do find that
this unfortunately flakes all over my
under eye area which I really really
don't like so I thought if I layered it
with a really really wet mascara maybe
it would work a little better it
definitely gave me a very clumpy eyelash
look which I personally like I know not
everybody is into that but I really like
it so we shall see how those wear
throughout the day and then as far as
setting in my base is concerned I will
be using my Kat Von D locket translucent
setting powder I'm just trying to get
through this now I'm I do I feel like
I've been able to make it work if I were
a baby in it if I and I'm really really
fluffy brush I'm able to just kind of
Pat it all over my face and I do think
it looks quite nice so I'm just gonna
try and get through this I think maybe
I'll you know include it in my next
project pan video so anyway that is what
the powder looks like and then a for
blush this week I will be using my lorac
unzipped cheek palette which I heard
that they are bringing back this is a
$25 blush palette it is amazing you get
four different colors in here as you
guys can see and if you are curious the
one that I have on my
today is this one down here which is
called unapologetic which is a beautiful
beautiful bronzy color it reminds me a
lot of Max Sun bask so if you want
something kind of similar to that I
would HIGHLY highly recommend checking
that out so there is unapologetic and
that is from the lorac unzipped cheek
palette all right and then finally the
last thing that I am going to be wearing
is this makeup geek kathleenlights
highlighting palette and the shade that
I have here that I have on my cheeks
today is called starlight which is this
beautiful kind of pinky tone shade right
here I think it's absolutely stunning
and I am layering this with this
particular shape right here which is
actually called let's see here night
light so starlight is a really really
beautiful kind of pinky toned color I
just think it's very very beautiful and
I actually got it to really be wham bam
in your face today by layering it with
that other shade like I said but also
using my Sigma tapered highlighting
brush so anyway guys that those are all
the products that I will be using for it
shot my stash this week someone just
knocked on the door so I'm gonna go
check it I hope you enjoyed it this
