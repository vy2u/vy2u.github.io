welcome back to shop and swatch my stash
where I share with you guys the makeup
products I currently have on my face and
of course the makeup products that i
will be using all week we are going a
hundred percent youtube baby buy it this
week so thank you so much to my friend
haila okz this idea if you guys really
do like this idea i will also leave a
video down below in the description bar
where I did a whole entire video
dedicated to the subject matter about
six or seven months ago so I'll leave
that down below but yeah let's go ahead
and jump right into it so the first item
that i will be using this week is
something that you to maybe buy
literally just this weekend yes this is
the Too Faced chocolate chip palette I
feel like Instagram also made me buy
this this is one of their new little
Matt pocket palettes i did also get the
white chocolate version and I of course
will give you guys a review swatches in
comparison video once i get both of them
I don't want to review it too early for
you guys I will say first impressions
wise i am wearing this shade today this
one and this one and this one in my
crease first impressions wise i think
they go on to the I point nicely it
smells very strongly a chocolate I think
it's a great little travel palette I
like the packaging and everything like
that but I will say it definitely is not
as silky and soft as some of the maps in
the chocolate bar pellets and also the
mats in the nine pan palette the what is
it called natural matte palette yeah
that one is really really amazing so
these are not as good in my opinion but
this is a $26 palette so just keep that
in mind but here are some swatches for
you guys I feel like some of them are
just inconsistent in texture so they are
very very pigmented which is great but
some of them just feel a little more I'm
scratchy than some others so anyway here
is what a few of these shades look like
as far as the blush and highlight is
concerned i will be using my Too Faced
I'm sorry my becca jaclyn hill champagne
collection face palette I love this
YouTube maybe by bus Instagram made me
buy this and I'm obsessed with this so
the blush that I have on today is called
champagne I'm sorry Rosie spritz this is
a luminous blush and then champagne pop
is the actual highlight that I have on
my face today these are just beautiful
the quality in here is amazing if you
can still get your hands on this i would
highly recommend going ahead and doing
so so here are a few of these sheets and
i will so watch them for you guys so
there they are absolutely beautiful lots
of lots of sheen and just luminosity to
these and i think they are stunning
alright moving on it the next item that
i will be using is the Too Faced Born
This Way naturally radiant concealer
this is in the shade of very fair and
this is definitely something that
YouTube made me buy i'm very happy i
bought it because it is absolutely
beautiful and it pairs very nicely with
the foundation that i will be using this
week so the foundation i will be using
is the Loreal infallible Pro glow
foundation this is in the shade at 201 a
classic ivory I really do like this i'm
very excited to use it this week as far
as lip products are concerned i will be
using three of my wives I'll voluptate
in oils now this is definitely something
that you too baby bye I would never
dream a bind like a $36 lip oil until of
course YouTube was like oh my god you
should buy it there everyone on YouTube
was like you should buy it so the first
one is crushed me orange it's a
beautiful beautiful kind of orange color
we also have pink me love which is a
little more of like a lilac color and
then sharing my chef me which is just a
beautiful beautiful kind of pinky reddy
color so those are the three lip
products i will be wearing this week as
far as mascara is concerned i will be
using my YSL babydoll mascara it looks
like this i actually bought to the
sephora collection lash stash it because
of this like I wanted this mascara so
bad so this is what it looks like
everybody race about this I'm saying
that it's just as good as like the Too
Faced better than sex and I think it is
it's absolutely beautiful so that is the
mascara i will be using this week to set
my face in i will be using my essence
all about matt fixing compact powder
this is definitely a youtube maybe by
it's because of my all-time favorite
youtuber and the person who inspired me
to start my own channel mama loves
mascara i will leave her channel link
down below actually talked about this
all the freaking time so i ended up
buying it and i absolutely adore it you
guys now I'm obsessed with this powder
so that is what i will be using to set
my whole entire face in and then I did
pick out this little eyeliner here this
was talked about on YouTube for so long
for like I don't know like a year or two
years I swear this is the Milani liquid
I liquid like eyeliner pencil and the
shade that I have right here is called
black so this is what I will be wearing
on my waterline this week I am NOT the
biggest fan of this eyeliner pencil and
i will show you guys why right now you
guys can see it really really tends to
skip and kind of leave gaps and I don't
know if mine is just really really dry
out but everybody loves this it's tough
youtube made me buy it so we shall see
how i feel about it at the end of the
week and then as far as an excuse me not
just literally just like cracked open
anyway um as far as brow product is
concerned I will definitely be using my
Maybelline brow drama cran a pomade in
the shade blonde this is not necessarily
something that YouTube it made me buy
that I still love it and it's just
absolutely beautiful so here is what it
looks like on the back of my hand and
the final item that i will be using this
week is the Maybelline a baby skin
instant port eraser i will be using this
as my face primer and also a my eye
primer because i love it that much so
anyway as those are all the products
that i will be using this week you guys

using as well and i will see you guys in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
