starting a new series here on my channel
it will be under a new playlist also it
is going to be called skin care 101
we're basically whenever I feel like it
i guess i'll try and make it consistent
however i don't want to promise any
posting times just because my schedule
changes a lot and you know i still want
it to be fun so um but basically what's
going to happen is I'm going to come
onto camera talk to you guys about skin
care which means i will be bare face
because we are talking about skin um and
usually we'll probably pretty casual it
will be at night or in the morning and
basically if you cook that's you know
when I don't have my makeup on and then
in the night or in the night at night or
in the morning so right now it's pretty
late at night I'm already in my pjs and
a little sweatshirt it's going to be
really casual when I do these kind of
videos but basically I'm going to go
through skin care steps and skin care
routines for certain types of skin and
I'm going to go through section by
section because if I just did it in one
big video it would take probably two
hours so the four different types of
skin that I'm going to be talking about
in these videos are oily skin
combination skin dry skin and sensitive
skin I feel like that kind of covers the
vast majority of people skin types I am
well aware that there are people that
have you know rosacea aging skin and
things like that however just because
I'm just trying to you know appeal to
the wide mass of people I'm just going
to be doing for because I feel like
those four are the most common if that
makes sense so anyway like I said it's
going to be oily skin combination skin
dry skin and sensitive skin and this
particular video is going to be on
cleansers so you may think this is a
really basic topic you're like okay I
know what kind of skin type by how
hopefully do you know um and you're like
I just use a regular cleanser or I like
the quantou i'm using a lot of you
probably know what kind of plans are to
use for your particular skin type but
there's a lot of people out there that
don't so i'm starting with
basic stuff I'll probably work my way up
in the videos to toners and moisturizers
and because four different thing types
it really requires a different you know
product so anyway this video is just
going to be on cleansers I'm going to
walk you guys through before different
skin types and tell you what is the best
cleanser for your skin type so let's
start with oily skin so if you have oily
skin you are just you know oily you tend
to have maybe breakouts and you tend to
have oil you know everywhere combination
skin is usually where your oily in your
teeth own and dry on your cheeks but
when your oily you're usually oily
everywhere so for cleansers I recommend
a cleanser with either benzoyl peroxide
salicylic acid glycolic acid or even I
want to say tea tree oil tea tree oil
might not be strong enough and that's a
little better for combination skin but
definitely do oily skin benzoyl peroxide
10% benzoyl peroxide is going to knock
the oil right out of your skin it's also
going to help with breakouts if you do
have those and salicylic acid is really
great it's going to help exfoliate which
is very very good for oily skin to
people because you guys tend to get a
little bit of buildup because there's so
much oil and gunk on your skin and you
possibly want to get it off and I find
that a lot of people with oily skin tend
to over exfoliate their skin I don't
think that's really necessary I think
that sometimes if you over exfoliate and
you use like a scrub on a daily basis
that might be causing more oil so I
think it's best to stick with just a
normal cleanser and maybe get a
cleansing brush like a clarisonic or
even a sponge you know anything that can
really really help to get a deep clean
into your skin that's a really really
good help usually people who have very
very oily skin don't happen to be super
super sensitive because you do have that
extra layer of oil that's usually on top
of the skin and which is great because
it will keep you looking very gentle
forever but I know a lot of people oily
skin are bothered by the fact that their
oily all the time so definitely benzoyl
peroxide that will suck
the oil instantly especially ten percent
benzoyl peroxide clean and clear makes a
wonderful cleanser it's a cream cleanser
and it is called continuous control and
it has ten percent benzoyl peroxide
highly recommend that if you have oily
skin and like I said salicylic acid can
be very very good too i will look for
something that is above two percent and
that will help to exfoliate without
having to you know scrub your skin and
also you know it will help with the
oiliness and also if you have any right
past so that is what i recommend for
oily skin I do not think you should be
using a scrub in the morning just
because a lot of people that use the
scrubs it actually causes more oil so
you just want to use the stain cleanser
i would say twice a day just be aware
that benzoyl peroxide tells the look
acid glycolic acid these are things that
are going to make you sensitive to the
Sun so make sure you wear your sunscreen
during the day but I would recommend a
cleansing twice a day with either of
those like I said glycolic acid is also
very very good it helps to get the you
know build up build up off of the skin
it really exfoliates without you know
using like scrubbing particles and if
you have oily skin you will be able to
tolerate it every single day so that is
what i recommend for oily skin at the
cleanser for combination skin I
recommend a cleanser with either tea
tree oil glycolic acid salicylic acid or
if you're not too sensitive to it
benzoyl peroxide I recommend using a
scrub in the morning it can have
salicylic acid tonight or it can just be
a scrub that's just in how to make sure
that your cheeks don't get too dry and
that you're removing that excess dry
skin from your cheeks because if you are
a combination skin you have an oily
t-zone and dry cheeks so you want to
make sure that you're taking care of the
oil and the t-zone but also not you know
stripping your cheeks of the oil than it
needs so definitely a scrub in the
morning it doesn't have to have any of
the ingredients that I just talked about
however at nighttime I do recommend
using a facial wash with a sponge or
like a clarisonic for any kind of device
you know like a cleansing brush
basically there you don't have to buy
the clarisonic there's a lot that you
can get for much better prices but
something like that will really help to
take care of the oil but not make the
dry areas to dry on your face so like I
said tea tree oil is really really great
for people with combination skin I
mentioned that it might not be strong
enough for those with oily skin but for
combination skin it's really great
especially if you do suffer from some
breakouts it's very good at handling and
taking care of that situation if you are
sensitive to the scent of tea tree that
tea tree oil that definitely don't go
with that go with the glycolic acid
which you can use I would say you can
build it up to every single night if you
have oily skin you can use it every
single day like twice a day but if you
have combinations can build up you know
a couple days a week and then build up
to every single night but don't use it
in the morning and then you know Celis l
have acid too i usually i have
combination skin and i usually use a
scrub in the morning that has salicylic
acid in it and I just find that that's
really nice it doesn't dry out my cheeks
but it does get rid of the oil in my
teeth on that is what i recommend for
combination skin or cleansers and for
dry skin now we're gonna talk about dry
skin I recommend a basic cleanser that
does not strip the skin or using an oil
to cleanse your face like coconut oil
olive oil I'm hobo oil avocado oil any
kind of oil you want to use or a cream
cleanser and I recommend doing it with
your hands I do not recommend getting a
facial tool or a facial you know
scrubber or a sponge I like a clarisonic
I just think that when you have dry skin
over using that you just cause your skin
to be even more dry if you do have a
clarisonic and you do like it with your
dry skin i highly recommend using one of
the really really gentle basic brushes
because you don't want to over exfoliate
the area even though you do have dry
skin and you want to get that you know
dry skin off the top layer or the dermis
of the skin which is this top layer you
also just want to be careful that you're
not going really really deep because
like with a clarisonic or with like
scrubbers you can kind of go a little
deeper than the dermis which is the top
layer so you want to make sure that
you're just taking you know the flight
soph at the top so I recommend using
your hands and like I said a basic
cleanser that doesn't strip the skin
that could be cetaphil that could be you
know like I said a preemie lenser is
really great estee lauder makes a really
basic cream cleanser that's supposed to
be very very nice for the skin anything
that doesn't sound like a gel or like
something that had acids or like you
know acne medications in it that is just
going to dry your sent out to the point
of no return so you want to you know
steer clear of that so really just a
basic cleanser or you know a prenup lens
or I think of cream cleanser would be
really nice and I recommend using that
twice a day with your hands you can use
a scrub in the morning depending on how
dry you are however like I said I really
think that if you you know / scrub your
face you're just causing more well if
your oily skin you cause like more oil
because you're you're taking all of you
know the moisture out of your face
basically when you're scrubbing which
causes more oil however when you're dry
skin I just feel that people really
really go hard no they really start to
get in there and you're sitting in the
shower and you're really scrubbing at
your face so that is not just hitting
the top layer this and that's you know
hitting below the dermis and you only
want to exfoliate on the top of the skin
if you have dry skin and because it both
any deep earth and it's really just
gonna make your sim punched and it's
going to be too much so I recommend like
I said for dry skin a basic cleanser
that won't strip the skin or an oil you
can cleanse with an oil you can use
coconut oil you know whatever that would
be nice hydrating for your skin to or a
cream cleanser so that is what i
recommend for dry skin like i said two
times a day with that basic cleanser or
oil or cream cleanser and use your hands
and the less skin type is sensitive and
i would say for this one you need to use
a very basic cleanser with absolutely no
fragrance no or no odor or older that's
all it's a weird odor odor no odor no
fragrance and i would recommend using
your hands do not use scrubs
do not use a clarisonic do not use any
kind of a facial tool that is just going
to irritate your skin I recommend just
using a basic basic cleanser I think
cetaphil is great its fragrance free
dermatologist tested you don't want
anything that's going to be too heavy on
the skin because that will irritate your
skin and you don't want anything that's
going to be you know to let so I think
cetaphil is definitely a must if you
have sensitive skin I really think
that's the only one I would recommend
and I recommend using your hands and
doing that twice a day sensitive skin
doesn't need to be over exfoliated it
doesn't need to be exfoliated every day
it doesn't need you know drying products
on the skin it's basically just you want
to make sure that you're not irritating
the skin even more than it is so anyway
so yeah that is what I recommend for
sensitive skin and that is it those are
all four of the skin types i'm talking
about for cleansers oily combo dry and
sensitive i hope this video was helpful
if it was please give it a thumbs up and
i'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
