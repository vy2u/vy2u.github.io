hope you are all having a fantastic day
this video is going to be all about skin
and skin care so if that does not
interest you by any means i will have
another collection video up later
tonight it will be probably much later
tonight because i have not filmed it yet
and my internet has been acting really
crazy the past couple of days it's been
taking forever to upload videos so I
can't say that it's going to be up
before like eleven o'clock hopefully
after eleven okay really really hope so
but anyway that would be my nail polish
collection video so either you guys can
catch that tonight or tomorrow i will be
posting a lot of videos tomorrow as well
but this video is all going to be all
about skincare and it is specifically a
series that i started on my channel
about six to eight months ago call skin
care 101 where I did you guys um
basically product recommendations on
certain areas of skin care they're
basically like five well there's always
more skin types and you think there is
because people could have oily skin and
sensitive skin or aging skin and dry
skin but basically there are five very
common sort of skin types which are oily
combination dry sensitive and normal and
I thought that I would go through and do
a series and give you guys actual
product recommendations I have a bunch
of cleansers and scrubs in front of me
right now and basically do like a four
to five part series where I walk you
guys through cleansers for your skin
types i'm going to do cleansers and
scrubs today for your skin type tomorrow
I will do toners and then i think
thursday or friday i'll do serums and
the next week i'll do moisturizers and
then the final video will be masks so i
just thought it would be fun i am not a
dermatologist i'm not a doctor so please
don't take what I say to be very very
literal but I just wanted to give you
guys different options on how to take
care of your skin because I feel like a
lot of people don't know how to take
care of their skin and it's hard to know
what kind of skin type you have so the
first thing we're going to start with is
cleansers and scrubs so we are going to
talk about all the five different skin
types that I mentioned so let's start
with normal skin normal skin is
basically where you have very normal
skin you're not too oily and you're not
too dry so you just kind of fall right
in between and some cleansers that I
want to give you ideas on our
basically you can use pretty much
anything you are very very lucky you
don't have skin that drive out too
quickly and you also are not like an oil
slick all day so one thing that I want
to mention for you is micellar cleansing
waters these are really fantastic
because you don't have to sit there and
give yourself a really really deep
cleaning scrub in the morning or even at
night because you have very very normal
skin so you can do something really
really quick and fast like this so this
is the simple micellar cleansing water
all you have to do is they simply put
this on a cotton pad and you can run it
all over your face it will not dry you
out and it will also not make you only
because you do have normal skin so it's
just going to be the perfect way of
cleansing your face without having to do
it X the sink and then a recommendation
I want to give you on the scrub side is
the be fine food skincare exfoliating
cleanser this is nice it has brown sugar
it has um sweet almond and oats in it it
does start to lather up into kind of
like a foaming sensation and I find that
it doesn't strip my skin too much I
don't have normal skin I have
combination skin but i find it doesn't
strip your skin too much and i also
doesn't over exfoliate so i think that
this would be a really really great
option for anybody who has a normal skin
again you really are the kind of skin
type that can do anything you could do
anything from oil cleansing all the way
over to doing like a really hardcore
sort of like microdermabrasion scrub and
you're not going to have any sort of
issues so just be aware try and pick up
products that don't have too many
ingredients and then like alcohol which
will over time dry your skin out or
anything that's too um like moisturizing
because you also don't need that either
just try and find something really basic
that works for you whether it be in
micellar water or a nice like um to
unwind product like a scrub that turns
into a phone so you pretty much can do
anything you're very lucky the next skin
type I want to talk about is oily skin
so for oily skin I do have a few
recommendations the first thing I want
to recommend is a glycolic acid facial
wash it does not have to be this one
specifically this one is from peter
thomas roth this has three percent
glycolic acid in it and i think that a
lot of oily skin folks tend to run for
salicylic products like cells feel like
acid products and also benzoyl peroxide
and i am going to mention those in a min
because they really do help clear out
oil and decongest your pores normally if
you have oily skin you do sometimes have
bouts of breakouts or congestion with
your skin but um one thing that I think
a lot of oily skin people don't know
about is glycolic acid this is a
fantastic fantastic acid that will go in
and basically push all of the D
congestion out of your skin it's going
to clear your pores it's going to help
with acne it is overall just going to be
very very nice for you so this one is
from peter thomas roth these last
forever is cleansing gels last forever i
think you get eight point five fluid
ounces in here so a lot of product if
for some reason salicylic acid or benzyl
peroxide are not working out for your
skin and you do have oily skin I highly
highly recommend checking out glycolic
acid now something that you can get at
the drum store and that really really
helps if you have oily skin or even
combination skin are benzoyl peroxide I
find that normally somebody usually you
prefer either salicylic acid or benzyl
peroxide I have combination skin so I
get oily in my t-zone and I prefer
benzoyl peroxide I also know when I'm
breaking out I prefer benzoyl peroxide
salicylic acid is really really great if
you have lots of blackheads it's really
going to push any sort of it kind of
goes in and scoops out the black head
and pushes it out of your skin if that
makes sense whereas benzoyl peroxide is
going to go in and suck up all of the
oil so when that cleanser that I want to
recommend if you guys from the drugstore
if you have oily skin is the Neutrogena
clear pore this is a cleanser and mask
so you can actually put this on and wash
it off or you can keep it on for a few
minutes it does have 3.5 beds
three-point-five percent benzoyl
peroxide in it and I guarantee you if
you put this on your face and you leave
it for three to four minutes that oil is
going to be sucked up very very quickly
now one thing I do want to recommend if
you do use this in the morning because I
think if you have oily skin you
definitely can get away with using a
benzoyl peroxide product or a salicylic
acid product more than once a day if
your combination skin i would recommend
once a day but if you have oily skin you
could definitely use this twice a day
but what i want to say is definitely
wear a sunscreen with this benzoyl
peroxide is going to make you sensitive
to the sun and the last thing you want
is to have sunburn on your face so just
be really careful then i highly
recommend
hang out benzoyl peroxide that will
definitely suck any oil out of your skin
this one is from clean and clear this is
the advantage three-in-one exfoliating
cleanser if you are someone who has a
lot of congestion problems as well you
see that you have very very oily skin in
your t-zone but you also have lots of
blackheads or maybe a lot of active
breakouts having something that
exfoliates but also have benzoyl
peroxide or salicylic acid in it are
really going to help your skin this
doesn't have amazing exfoliation beads
but they are definitely there and it can
help get off any sort of build up that
you might have on the skin so this one
has five percent benzoyl peroxide in it
again this is a fantastic fantastic
little scrub clean and clear also makes
a cleanser that comes in a bigger tub
it's called the continuous control acne
cleanser that has ten percent benzoyl
peroxide in there so that will really
really suck out any sort of oil that is
congesting up your skin basically and
also and that one does not have an
exfoliator in it so if you for some
reason have oily but sensitive skin and
you really can't use anything abrasive
that one will work for you alright let's
move on to combination skin so for
combination skin the first thing I want
to recommend is a newer product for me I
have combination skin by the way so this
is the garden-gate clean plus balancing
daily exfoliator it purifies the t-zone
and a softens dry areas it's got
grapefruit and pomegranate in it
pomegranate is a very very soothing for
any sort of dry areas you might have and
gives moisture back whereas grapefruit
really um clears out any sort of
congestion or oil you may have so this
is a really fantastic products i love
using this in the morning it does not
have any sort of salicylic acid or
anything like that in there but i find
that the particles in here the
exfoliating beads in here are not too
abrasive for my cheeks like i don't get
sensitive when I'm scrubbing it on my
cheeks but also it clears out any
impurities in my t-zone so I really like
this a lot that is the first round of
recommends and then the second one is
the Garnier clean plus blackhead
eliminating scrub again if you have oily
skin you can also get away with using
this in the morning this does have
salicylic acid 2% in it and I find with
combination skin especially around your
t-zone if you are having active
breakouts benzoyl peroxide personally
works the best for me but a lot of
people claim that telus telecasted works
very well for them so the nice thing
about having a scrub even though this
one said it is for oily skin
nice thing about having a scrub when you
have combination skin is that you
usually are drier in your cheek area so
that any kind of scrub that's in there
any little exfoliating particles in the
product are really going to like slop
away slav SLO ugh how do you say thats
awful way any sort of build up that you
have on your skin so this is a really
really nice one I highly recommend this
as a smell is very very good and then
another scrub that I want to recommend
of course I have a lot of products for
combination skin since I have
combination skin but this shade waste
your african black soap problem skin
facial wash and scrub this is really
nice it has tea tree oil tamarind
extract another really great product for
oily skin if for some reason salicylic
acid glycolic acid or even benzoyl
peroxide are not working for your skin
definitely check out tea tree oil it is
very very natural but it does amazing
things for breakout so definitely
definitely check that out it also can
help clear out some of the oil in your
skin but anyway this is this is supposed
to help clear and balance your skin so
if you have combination skin it's going
to help clear up your t-zone but balance
your cheeks and it's for blemished and
oily skin as well so it says this gentle
facial exfoliator provides instant
resurfacing benefits which really helps
me have dry skin on your cheeks while
helping to control breakouts like in
your teeth on african black soap and
shea butter natural blemish fighting
secrets combined with kale and clay to
absorb impurities control excess oil and
detoxify the skin tamarind extract and
tea tree oil help to calm and encourage
skin to clear and before we go any
further I just want to mention if you
have breakouts still if you still have
oily skin but you'd also have aging skin
I really want to recommend african black
soap for you I do have an african black
soap cleanser that i absolutely love but
it's in my shower right now but it's
really fantastic african black soap is
basically like a two in one product that
can help clear your skin but also it has
anti-aging properties so i just wanted
to throw that out really quickly but
this is a really really nice one from
shea moisture and then of course you
also if you do have combination skin you
can use products to have benzoyl
peroxide in them products that have
cells
acid because they are going to help
purify your t-zone but keep your cheek
area somewhat dry now if you do use
products like this especially if you go
and get the ten percent benzoyl peroxide
one that I was talking about for oily
skin from the clean and clear line you
just want to make sure you follow up
with a really really nice moisturizer
and I will talk about moisturizers like
I said was it next week that I have the
moisturizer video plan G I think it's
next week and I'll talk about different
moisturizers because obviously
combination skin needs a little more
moisture than oily skin so anyway I will
get into that and another time but I
also wanted to say that be fine foods
skincare this exfoliating cleanser i
also find works really really well on
combination skin just because it has
enough exfoliating properties that it
really kind of clears out my t-zone and
rinse it up any excess oil but also it
turns into a foaming cleanser so really
really is nice on the cheek area as well
alright so we have talked about normal
skin we have talked about oily skin we
have talked about combination skin now
we're going to go ahead and talk about
sensitive skin sensitive skin is
obviously sensitive you need to be
careful you definitely don't want
anything that has anything aggressive no
benzoyl peroxide for you no tea tree oil
no glycolic acid no salicylic acid don't
even go there if you are having
breakouts and you have sensitive skin
you need to go for something really
really natural maybe african black soap
would be nice for you because it still
is gentle gentle but anything like
benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid is
only going to aggravate your skin more
so that you definitely don't want that
again i would recommend a micellar water
I think this would be fantastic for
somebody who has sensitive skin because
it's not going to irritate or strip your
skin of anything it's not going to strip
it of oil it's not going to you know
make it super super red and raw because
you're scrubbing at it this is very very
simple it's very basic and this simple
line in general is very very simple not
a lot of ingredients really fantastic
product another thing that I want to
talk about is this fantastic i love this
i talked about this in my 2015 holy
grail skin care products video again if
you have normal skin you could also use
this this is the clean and clear morning
burst facial cleanser it has the time
yes tiniest little exfoliating beads in
there that really don't scrub the skin
that much so if you do have sensitive
skin it's still good to go ahead and do
a it is still good to go ahead and
exfoliate your skin there are different
ways of doing that and I will talk about
that maybe I'll also do like a little
treatments video instead of the mass
video well I'll do a mass video for skin
care 101 but also maybe eight treatments
video because there are better ways if
you have sensitive skin at to exfoliate
your skin and it still is important to
exfoliate your skin you just have to be
careful with it but this one is really
really nice I find that it really does
wake me up it has this wonderful orange
scent the only thing that I want to say
is that yes it does have sense so if you
are extremely sensitive you really want
to try and find something yeah this may
be a little much for some of you who
have sensitive skin but if you are just
somewhat sensitive I think this is a
very very basic facial cleanser and its
really really great now if you are very
very very sensitive again a simple
micellar water this is fragrance free
it's not going to irritate your skin
have absolutely no alcohol in it I'm
also cetaphil ah makes a fantastic basic
basic basic cleanser has no scent it
feels a little slimy on the skin but
when you rub it in you notice it doesn't
strip your skin of every anything it's
not taking anything away from your skin
and that's what you need when you're
sensitive skin you don't want to put too
much in and you don't want to take too
much out you just kind of want to let it
do its own thing and not irritate it or
you know like it's like throwing punches
at someone like come on come on you know
it's like you don't want to do anything
to make it like fight back by any means
you just want it to be how it is and you
don't want to irritate it um I do also
want to say what was the other thing the
Clinique clinic makes another really
really fantastic basic basic I think
it's called their liquid soap cleanser
it's basically the same exact thing as
bc to fill one go ahead and purchase the
cetaphil one it is cheaper and you can
get that at the drugstore I don't
recommend any sort of abrasive scrubs if
you have sensitive skin it is just not
going to go over well okay don't try
anything with Ben
oxide no salicylic acid nothing was
fragrance unless it's very very mild
like something like this but overall
just be very very careful and be very
very gentle all right and now are we
going to talk know that now we are going
to talk about dry skin all right so if
you have dry skin one of the biggest
things that I recommend for you is oil
cleansing I know a lot of people are
scared but they will start breaking out
or have issues if they all cleanse well
let me tell you I have combination skin
and I actually oil cleanse to remove my
makeup so you could use really anything
I'm sweet almond oil is a really
fantastic oil it is very very pure and
it doesn't leave your skin too oily so
if you like an oil that's not too oily
you would probably really enjoy sweet
almond oil but overall I would say i
recommend coconut oil for anyone with
dry skin definitely go ahead and give it
a try I have done oil cleansing on my
cheek area especially during the winter
my combination skin starts to get very
dry so I really like to oil cleanse
definitely around my cheek area and I
noticed that coconut oil really does it
for me because it leaves something there
and what you guys are lacking is
moisture in your skin so you've been an
oil especially one that is high in like
omega 369 fatty acids like coconut oil
are going to be really really fantastic
for your skin and you're going to find
that it really really nourishes another
thing you can do vitamin E is a
fantastic oil this one right here is
from trader joe's sorry i'm going to
show you guys this one's from now
solutions i ordered that on amazon and
then nutiva makes the best coconut oil
this is virgin extra will let me read a
few extra virgin organic unrefined
cold-pressed virgin coconut oil you
really want something that is extra
virgin definitely cold pressed and
definitely organic this is going to be
the best for you but I also want to
recommend if you have extremely
extremely dry skin avocado oil is
absolutely fantastic as well very very
high in omegas and very very rich thick
thick texture very similar to olive oil
so another really fantastic one for
cleansing I don't recommend going crazy
with scrubs especially if you have very
very dry skin just because you might
think oh I need to get the dry skin off
I should scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub
it's going to do more harm than good go
ahead and use something that maybe has
like a
eh I you know what you could use is the
peter thomas roth they talked about this
for the oily skin people the glycolic
acid 3% facial wash you could use this
maybe once a week like colic acid
exfoliates the skin so it's going to
take off any sort of dead skin that you
may have but don't use this every single
day i would say once a week would be
enough for you Maya badescu also makes a
fantastic like colic facial wash and so
does um the nip + fab line I believe you
can get that at Alta so definitely look
into that and then if you have some wet
dry skin and you're not super super dry
another oil that I highly recommend you
check out for oil cleansing is ha hobo
oil this is very very very light way to
actually mimics see them in the skin see
them basically the oil that makes um I
know I don't want to say makes us break
out oily skin folks have lots and lots
of sebum like the sebum is always coming
out it's like when you get oily skin or
oily hair that's the sebum that's coming
out we're as dry skin people don't have
as much and that's why they're dry skin
because that natural oil is not coming
through to the surface so I highly
recommend checking this one out it
actually mimics i think i read online
actually mimics the exact like um
percentage or their i don't know is
something really really like scientific
but it's supposed to be the closest to
the actual sebum in the skin and on the
scalp so i would definitely recommend
mahoba oil as well so anyway guys those
were just some scrubs and cleansers that
i recommend of course everybody has
different skin i'm not saying if you
have this skin go get this product i'm
just trying to give you guys
recommendations if you guys saw my skin
care collection video from yesterday you
know i have a lot of cleansers i have a
lot of products in general and I just
have learned a lot about skin care from
learning about my own particular skin
type so i thought i would share kind of
a few recommendations unless you guys
know maybe what you should be looking
for um with your particular skin type so
i hope this was helpful tomorrow i'm
going to be talking about toners and
yeah thank you so much for joining me
guys but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
