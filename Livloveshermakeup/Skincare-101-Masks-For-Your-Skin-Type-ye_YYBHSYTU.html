are wrapping up my skin care 101 series
in this video and we are talking all
about face masks so the five different
types a skin that we've been talking
about in this series are oily skin
combination skin normal skin sensitive
skin and dry skin so I want to say right
away for normal skin I think any of the
mask that i'm going to show you you can
use for your skin type i think when you
have normal skin it's nice to kind of
change things up so whether your skin is
a little more oily that day or a little
more dry you really could use any of the
products i'm going to show so the ones
that are really going to show you the
recommendations are basically for oily
skin combination skin sensitive skin and
dry skin so let's get right into it i'm
going to start with oily skin so the
first thing that i want to recommend is
actually a poor purifying peel for your
face this is from Alba Botanica it is
the good and clean fruit acid detox
fusion this is really nice it is
definitely going to strip out the oils
of your skin and i don't mean strip like
take them all away it is just going to
basically eat off the top layer of the
skin because it is a fruit acid detox
peel so it is going to feel a little
tingly on your face but it is nice
because it is a gel formula so it's not
going to leave any excess moisture or
any kind of film on your skin after so
you leave this on for about five minutes
wash it off and you're going to notice
that your pores look a lot less
congested and also there's not going to
be as much oil on your face so that is
my first recommendation for oily skin
one that I recommend for oily skin and
combination skin is the freemen feeling
beautiful charcoal and black sugar
polishing mask I especially love this
from my combination skin because it has
that black sugar in there which helps
basically purify my t-zone but at the
same time it also helps exfoliate my
cheeks which which get really dry and I
think this is really nice for oily skin
because it does have active charcoal in
it which helps draw out impurities and
again oil congestion things like that
another really fantastic charcoal mask
for oily skin is the origins clear
improvement it has active charcoal in it
and this is just really really nice if
you have active breakouts it will help
clear it up and then I have another one
over oily skin this is the formula 1006
you can find this at Ulta this is the
deep down detox ultra cleansing mud
baths with orange and bergamot this is
really
nice if you want to claim ask that's not
going to over overly dry your face
basically sometimes you put those claim
s on and you can barely move your face
like the Glen blows super mud this is
great for oily skin as well but if you
don't want something that's super super
like stiff on your face I really enjoyed
this one because it doesn't completely
dry down but it still has the great
benefits of like a purifying mud mask so
it will draw out the impurities without
over drying your skin which I really
really like so I recommend for oily and
combination skin and then also for
combination skin I think the peter
thomas roth pumpkin enzyme asked is
fantastic anything that has kind of like
a dual property to it like it's going to
exfoliate and also clear out congestion
from your skin I think is really
fantastic for combination skin so this
pumpkin enzyme mask from peter thomas
roth is great because i have those
active enzymes in there that will eat
off the top layer of the skin and also
exfoliate your dry areas which are used
to be your cheeks michael todd makes a
very similar one also this is the
pumpkin nutrient-rich facial mask
basically the same exact thing do not
use these if you have sensitive skin all
the combination skin would like those
and then what I also want to recommend
for combination skin one of my favorites
is the glam glow power module cleanse
treatment it has exfoliating beads so
it's going to decongest again your
t-zone we tend to be a little more oily
but then it has like mud properties to
it so it's also going to pick out and
pull out any congestion any sebum any
oil and it's just going to leave your
skin feeling very very normalized if
that makes sense so this is fantastic
for combination skin all right as far as
sensitive skin goes I think that this
peter thomas roth cucumber gel mask is
fantastic cucumber has very very calming
properties to the skin it's very cooling
it's very calming if you have rashes if
you're just very very sensitive even
sunburn you can use this it is fantastic
this is the detoxifying one and it says
that it's refreshing it's cooling it's
moisturizing and it's a calming gel so
this is really fantastic for sensitive
skin to people also the formula 1006
keep your cool skin calming gel mass
this is another one that's fantastic it
has coconut and cucumber in it and it
will just calm down redness in your skin
which if you have sensitive skin you
tend to have a lot of redness so this is
a fantastic
one as well all right now let's move on
to dry skin the first one I want to
recommend is from Freeman this is the
golden grain brightening mass this is
going to help brighten your skin and
also give hydration to your skin if you
have dry skin you tend to have a little
bit of dullness in your skin because you
don't have an extreme amount of sebum or
oil in the skin so this is really nice
because they have vitamin C and it also
has golden grain and net so it is going
to brighten and also moisturize at the
same time so I really love that one for
dry skin and for my cheeks which get dry
I also recommend the origins drink it up
intensive overnight mask if you need an
overnight treatment this is going to be
the one for dry skin it smells amazing
and it really moisturizes super super
well and then the last one I want to
recommend for dry skin is the boots
number seven beautiful skin this is for
dry or very dry skin you can leave this
on even overnight if you need to it's
hypoallergenic and it is curated to help
dry skin behave like normal skin so it
gives a huge amount of moisture there is
oil mixed in here with like a
moisturizer and it's really fantastic
one pump with this is definitely enough
for me I cannot keep this on my
combination skin for more than five
minutes at a time so it is very very
very moisturizing so that is the last
one that I recommend for dry skin and
like I said if you have normal skin I
think he really could use any of these
you can also pick up some of these
little face masks that you get in the
packets you could try regular ones like
cucumber and a low you could try
illuminating wines you could use
hydrating ones exfoliating ones you can
really kind of take a little bit of
everything and use them for your skin
whether it's feeling a little more oily
one day or a little more dry you can
just kind of curate have like a little
like a little basket of mass that you
can use for different times so those are
the mask that I recommend for the five
different kind of skin types that we've
been talking about thank you so much to
everybody who has been joining me for
this series I really enjoyed doing it
and yeah thanks again bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
