thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having a fantastic day I am
here to share and continue my skin care
101 series today and we're actually
going to be finishing it as well please
excuse my horrendous nails um I don't
even know what I was doing was there
doing dishes last night or something in
literally I'm wearing a glitter polish
and literally all of the glitter just
like started coming off on the tip so
please excuse my horrendous fingernails
but anyway we are continuing and
finishing with skin care 101 series
today I have loved doing this series I
think it's really important um for
anyone that has a YouTube channel to go
ahead and make content that your viewers
want to see but also go ahead and make
content that you want to put out there
and the skin care 101 series was
something that I really wanted to share
with you guys and put out there so I was
so so happy to do it thank you so much
for supporting and watching and I really
really do appreciate it so this video is
going to be all about moisturizers for
your skin type and then i will be
posting a video later and I can't tell
you when later because YouTube has been
acting up for me personally I have been
uploading videos and they get stuck in
ninety-five percent processed for like
six plus hours that's what happened last
night with the second part of my makeup
collection video and I was like what the
heck so I won't be promising that it
will even like a be up within the next
six hours but either it will be up right
after this one or it will be able later
but anyway that will be mass for your
skin type and then that will finish up
this series and let me know if you guys
have any beauty related series that you
would like me to start on this channel
because i love love love starting new
series so anyways let's just get right
into it we are going to be talking about
moisturizers for your skin type and i
also have some recommendations for you
guys so we're going to be talking about
oily skin combo skin normal skin
sensitive skin and dry skin so let's
start with oily skin because oily skin
is really really difficult to find a
nice moisturizer for but it's very very
important that you do moisturize your
skin especially if you have oily skin
sometimes you deal with breakouts and
things like that and you're actually
using products that can be drawn to the
skin so you want to make sure that you
are putting and replenishing your skin
with some moisture so I have some
recommendations for you guys the first
one is from bosha this is the
revitalizing black hydration
gel I love this especially in my t-zone
I accommodation skin so I get oily in my
t-zone and dry on my cheeks and this is
amazing absolutely amazing in the t-zone
area for me and I think people with oily
skin would really like this a lot it has
a cool like tingling effect on the skin
I believe it has a little glycolic acid
in it so if you are going to wear this
during the daytime please wear a
sunscreen with it but anyway it's really
really nice it does kind of decongest
your pores but also give a little bit of
moisture and it is a gel so it's not
going to sit on top of your skin and
become greasy throughout the day so this
is a great great option for those with
oily skin another really great one that
you can wear at night if you have oily
skin is the Vichy vici it's a v-shape
the Vichy the beachy v.i.c hy you guys
have probably heard of this brand this
is there I delia skin sleep this is a
really really nice gel moisturizer I
find that it really hydrates my skin
beautifully but again it has that gel
texture which is really really nice for
those who have oily skin or even combo
skin it smells really really nice it's
just a beautiful pink gel very very
lightweight very nice and like bouncy on
the skin it doesn't weigh my skin down
whatsoever even in my oily area I feel
like it sinks in immediately and it will
give you that dose of hydration that
your skin still needs because oily
people still need hydration everybody
does and then the last one I have to
recommend for those with oily skin is
the Neutrogena hydroboost water gel this
has hyaluronic acid in it which is
fantastic but this is a water gel they
also have a gel creme version for those
who have a little more dry skin but this
is amazing this is one of my all-time
favorite moisturizers ever I think it's
great for those of combination skin and
also with oily skin you can see it's a
very very liquidy sort of moisturizer is
literally if I went like this it would
just tip right out and actually recently
I was in target and I saw that they
repackaged this so now it is in a
squeezy tube and I think that's maybe a
little bit better because it is so
watery so when you did your hand in here
to skills like some of the products is
getting like lost and lick seeps through
your fingers so anyway it has been
repackaged but this is the absolutely
fantastic fantastic lightweight gel
moisturizer just make sure that if you
have oily skin you
pick up at the water gel instead of
Beach out creme all right moving on to
combination skin I have a few
recommendations here that I think are
really really lovely two of them are
from oly henriksen I really like ole
henriksen he has some really really
interesting wonderful products that I've
recently really got me into but his
moisturizers are so light weight and I
mean they moisturize but they're very
lightweight I think even if you have
oily skin you could get away with using
these the first one is the only
henriksen empower featherweight
moisturizer this is so light I barely
noticed on my skin but I noticed that my
cheeks are nice and hydrated and then it
doesn't um make my t-zone any more oily
so this is what it looks like it's got a
nice little set to it and it has just a
very basic texture it's almost gel like
I would say almost gel-like not
completely but almost gel like it's like
a mix of a creme and a gel and it's just
wonderful it doesn't make the overly
oily in my t-zone but it also doesn't um
you know it gives moisture to my cheek
area which I really really appreciate so
that is a fantastic one for combo skin
another really great one for combo skin
is the sheer transformation this is an
oil-free perfecting creme this is also
really really nice i like the finish
that it gets on my skin i think if you
had oily skin as well you would probably
like this i'm the kind of gifts like
Gabe's I don't even know how to describe
it kind of like a perfected look to the
skin it doesn't have a tint or anything
like that any pore filling benefits or
anything like that in it but it just is
so nice and it's just oil-free it feels
really light again it's kind of a mix of
like a gel and a creme and it's really
perfect for those who have combination
skin I love this on my skin alright and
then the last one I want to talk about
is if you are somebody who has
combination skin during the wintertime I
definitely get a lot more dry on my
cheeks and then my t-zone starts to get
a little more dry as well I've been
loving this tata indigo soothing triple
recovery cream this is really really
nice it is actually like an indigo
purpley blue color and it's very very
sick it doesn't smell very good however
it is again even though it looks like
it's a thick kind of purply cream it's
actually a mix of like a gel and a cream
so even though it does give a lot of
moisture it's not going to be oily or
greasy on your skin so this is
fantastic i love wearing this underneath
make up in the morning alright let's go
ahead and move on to sensitive skin
because sensitive skin is so so
important that you find the right kind
of moisturizer and i really only have
one to recommend and i would recommend
this or maybe something very very basic
you want to look for a product a
moisturizer anything that you put on
your skin if you have sensitive skin you
want to look for products that are very
very basic they don't have a huge long
ingredient list and I think one of the
best moisturizers you could use for your
skin is the cetaphil everybody says
cetaphil but it's cetaphil I've seen the
commercial cetaphil moisturizing cream
this is for dry sensitive skin this is
an amazing amazing like body butter sort
of thing and I use this I have used this
on my face and it's just a very very
thick texture as you guys can see but
when you rub it in um it really really
does sink into your skin which i think
is really important it's got absolutely
no sense whatsoever which is great for
those of you who do have sensitive skin
because any anyone who has sensitive
skin usually is a little like hesitant
with fragrances because it can irritate
the skin even more so this is just a
wonderful wonderful option like i said i
would keep it basic find something
that's you know you could even do an oil
if you want to i will be doing a video
on my favorite hair and face oils um and
i'll have some recommendations for every
sort of skin type in there as well but
anything that's really really a hundred
percent natural has one ingredient or
two ingredients and nothing that's crazy
in the fragrance dept or have more than
probably ten ingredients probably want
to stay away from those but i think this
cetaphil moisturizing cream would be
fantastic in the morning and at night
for those who have sensitive skin all
right let's talk about normal skin i
really think you could use anything that
i'm showing and i know i always say that
in these videos i'm like normal skin
you're so lucky but you guys really are
lucky you're not too oily and you're not
too dry you could get away with using
the cetaphil you could get away with
using the Neutrogena hydroboost it just
depends on what you're feeling do you
want more moisture do you want less
moisture you're not going to get overly
oily and you're not going to get overly
dry so you really can use any of these
products so let's move on and talk about
dry skin because for dry skin it is
really really important to moisturize
your skin so I
some really great recommendations for
your eyes the first one is from Revlon
this is the Revlon eternit when t7
moisture cream this is with pro genet in
and yes who knew that Revlon made a face
cream well this is old-school it smells
old school definitely if you have
sensitive skin stay away it is a thick
white cream that smells like you know
you're on tour your granny ok but this
is what it looks like it is extremely
thick and when you start rubbing it into
your skin it actually turns into an oil
so that is so so so good and amazing for
those of you who have dry skin because
if you have dry skin you know that you
know if it's just like a cream sometimes
it's not enough you really want
something that maybe has an oil base in
it or even mixing in oils with a
moisturizer is probably going to be you
know your best bet for getting
moisturization into your skin so this
one from Revlon is great I find this in
the area underneath the old-school
colorstay lipsticks and it's like at the
bottom so if you're looking for this at
the drugstore I found this way at the
bottom that's where they hide the face
cream so anyway and then the next three
products i'm going to recommend i think
josie maran is a fantastic fantastic
friend if you have dry skin every single
one of her products is formulated with
argan oil and i think argan oil is
wonderful any kind of oil is really
great for people who have dry skin
whether it be more crucial oil argan oil
you know whatever you want to use
coconut oil olive oil like i said it
will be making a video on my favorite
hair and skin oils and i'm definitely
going to be covering the grounds for all
the dry skin gals out there about gals
and guys anyway I really think that
adding in a moist you know if you're
just using a regular moisturizer adding
in any sort of oil is going to boost the
hydration level of that product which i
think is fantastic for you guys but
these josie maran products already have
oil in them so you don't have to go and
find a separate oil to add again so the
first one I want to talk about is the
josie maran pure argan milk this is
wonderful this is probably the most
lightweight out of all three that i'm
going to show you guys i think it's
lovely it really is an intensive
hydrating treatment and it's kind of got
a milky consistency and texture it is
like the little dropper bottle it's
really really nice you can definitely
tell once you start rubbing it in that
there's oil in there
and you will see there's like a little
bit of glossiness on your face it might
just be me because like i said i do have
combination skin so it could just be my
skin but i noticed that i love the way
that this gives moisture to my cheek
area that tends to get very dry during
the wintertime and i think it would be a
fantastic fantastic option for those of
you who have dry skin another one that I
recently did a review on I will link the
video below is the josie maran whipped
argon oil face better if you are one of
those people with dry skin that doesn't
want to deal with the oily feeling you
are going to absolutely love this it's a
beautiful consistency it's fragrance
free it's absolutely gorgeous and it has
that one hundred percent pure argan oil
in there but I don't know what it is the
texture of this is literally it's like
whipped but it's so moisturizing but it
leaves no residue and I have combination
skin so that says a lot that it leaves
absolutely no oily residue so if you are
someone who has dry skin and you just
don't want to you know have that feeling
of oil on your face the josie maran
whipped argan oil face butter is a
really really good bet for you and then
the last one I want to talk about is for
those who have severely dry skin it
feels good when you literally you like
you want to bathe yourself in oil that's
how dry you are this is the josie maran
argan infinity intensive creamy oil this
stuff is so so so hydrating I have to
use this very very sparingly with my
combination skin because it will make me
look like an oil slick it is extremely
extremely hydrating it comes out kind of
like cream and then it turns into
straight up oil on your hands while
you're rubbing it in it is definitely
more hardcore than the pure argan milk
there's something in here that's a
little more like a moisturizer this is
more like straight-up oil so um you know
if you have extremely extremely dry
dehydrated skin this would be a really
really wonderful option for you it's
fragrance meat-free it's not going to
clog your pores it's not going to
irritate your skin really really good if
you have extremely dry skin so anyway
those are the moisturizers that I
recommend for those five different skin
types I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and stay tuned for my next one which
will be all about face mask</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
