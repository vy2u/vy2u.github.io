you so much for joining me I hope you
are all having a fantastic day I am
continuing my skincare 101 series today
with you guys
and we are going to be talking about
serums I have all my little mini serums
here to talk with you guys about and let
you know a little more about serums and
why they are important for every single
skin type and also we're going to be
talking about specifically what serum
you should be looking for whether you
have normal skin oily skin combination
skin dry skin or sensitive skin so
basically what is the serum and do you
need one so a serum is basically the
powerhouse of your entire skincare
routine a lot of people skimp on serum
because they don't really understand
they're like well isn't it moisturize
her that makes your skin look amazing
and whatnot no it's not moisturizers are
literally just there to moisturize your
skin they don't have a lot of anti-aging
benefits besides hydration and the
reason you want a serum in your skincare
routine
either once a day or twice a day is
because it literally has it is packed
with like really potent ingredients it's
filled with antioxidants it's gonna make
everything else that you put on your
face like your moisturizers Sinkin
better it's gonna make things work
better and on top of that it really is
the little powerhouse literally it is
such a thin consistency and the reason
that I think a lot of people skimp on
serums is because they think they're
doing nothing because of the consistency
or how you know when you're putting it
on I feel like it's barely there they
sink in right away that is the point of
them the point of them is that they
don't have any sort of moisture barrier
on them so that they can just sink right
into the skin right away whereas a
moisturizer it's a little more thick and
greasy usually and you get more you know
moisturization properties with it but it
really only penetrates the first layer
of your skin the first or second layer
whereas the serum is really gonna go
down there and it's really really going
to benefit your skin so yes I do think
it is important for every single skin
type to use a serum let's have a few
let's have about a few different ones
right now one that I really think is
fantastic for Entei aging is the Lancome
advances genifique
I have been using this for a while I
have gone through multiple multiple full
sizes of this this is great if you have
dry skin if you have normal skin sense
combo anything this is a fantastic
fantastic little serum what I really
like about it is that it's very
lightweight it is very very lightly
fragrant so even if you do have
sensitive skin you will be able to use
this on your skin it literally
penetrates the skin with him just a
couple of seconds after you apply your
toner and maybe if you wear an essence
on your skin essence like Hydra essences
or whatever you want to call them are
usually a product that goes on before
your serum it's just an extra moisture
barrier but this is applied basically
after your toner or your essence and it
just sinks in immediately it allows you
to go in with your moisturizer
afterwards and really really put the
moisture back into your skin but this is
not going to take away from your skin
it's not going to strip your skin in any
way shape or form and I really think
that it can be used for all different
kinds of skin types so this is a really
really good one and a lot of women I
have met a lot of older women that have
claimed that this has completely this is
like the only anti-aging like serum that
they use on their skin and they've been
using it for ages and ages and they look
beautiful and I've heard the same thing
about the Estee Lauder say the Double
Wear foundation the Estee Lauder what's
it called advanced Night Repair Serum or
advanced synchronized night Repair Serum
that's another fantastic one I've gotten
through multiple multiple bottles of
that in the full-size and it's difficult
with the serum because you're not really
quite sure if it's the serum that's
working or if it's like your moisturizer
or your toner there's a lot of things
that I think it's everything combined
that makes your skin look the best it
can but it really is the serum in the
long run that is going to make your skin
look really good because it's so potent
and it's just so highly highly
concentrated so they are a little more
pricey I would definitely say serums are
a lot more pricey than moisturizers or
toners or even essences just because it
is the one part of your skincare routine
that really really is probably the most
beneficial in my opinion anyway let's
move on a second one that I want to talk
about that I think would be really
really great for a lot of different skin
types as well I think that you could use
this if you have dry skin you know what
all the skin types could use this this
is the only Henriksen truth serum
collagen booster potent vitamin C
complex especially if you have skin
I think dry skin folk would really
really like this sometimes when you have
dry skin
you don't get as much luminosity to your
skin you don't have as much oils or
sebum in your skin so sometimes your
face doesn't look very luminous and
there's nothing wrong with that it's
just that sometimes it can look like
it's not very bright and things like
that especially if you also have
discoloration so this is a really
fantastic one from Olay Hendricks and
vitamin C complex is fantastic for your
skin if you are looking for products
that are going to lighten
hyperpigmentation lighten any kind of
age spots anything that is discolored on
your face melasma whatever you have
vitamin C is going to do it it's
absolutely fantastic
what I like about this particular serum
is that it is really really running you
guys can see that going down my hand
immediately it is like almost a salami
consistency but this stuff sinks in
immediately I would say maybe if you
have sensitive skin you might be a
little taken aback by the fragrance it's
very very strong orange smell so if you
have sensitive skin you might want to
stay away from this one I would
recommend if you have sensitive skin to
go and try and find a serum that has
absolutely no fragrance like this just
say no one would be able oh my gosh
Wow I just dropped that really hard
anyway but this just say the 1 would be
a really really good option but anyways
I think this would be great for people
that are dealing with a lot of
discoloration on their face I know a lot
of people with oily skin and also
combination skin I have combination skin
we tend to deal with a little more acne
than some other people do or other skin
types doom so this is really really
fantastic to help clear up any sort of
discoloration you may have from previous
breakouts and things like that I have
hormonal acne that I get on my jawline
and I definitely have hyperpigmentation
I have noticed a big difference when I
use this so this one would be fantastic
for combo skin oily skin and I would say
dry skin sensitive skin and stay away
you can also use this actually all of
these that I'm gonna mention you could
use if you have normal skin I feel like
normal skin is such an easy skin type
you guys really can just use a lot of
different products but I would recommend
this one for oily skin combination skin
and dry skin and the Lancome advanced
genifique I really think this would work
for everyone it really doesn't have too
much of a fragrance so I think yeah even
with sensitive skin
you definitely could get away with you
think these longer ones so that is a
good point for everyone now let's go
back and talk about this shisei no one
that totally made a big bang on my
little music stand here that's how I
balance my products out if I put my
music stand I tilt it this way like
horizontally and then I have it here and
this is not glass so hopefully I mean at
least it didn't break but anyway this is
a Shiseido ultimate power infusing
concentrate this is fantastic I really
highly recommend if you have sensitive
skin normal skin combination skin if you
only skin you might not like it too much
it can be a little moisturizing honestly
I really find that this is a little
humectant so I would stay away from this
if you do have oily skin but dry skin is
going to drink this it's great it really
really sinks in easily and I noticed the
difference in texture in my skin when
I'm using this I noticed uhm I don't get
as much it's just kind of sooo smooth
things out if that makes sense it
smooths things out and I notice that
within a week of using this is that I
definitely there's a lot less visible
texture on my face so this is a
fantastic little one as well absolutely
fragrance free I truly could not smell a
single thing it sinks then very very
quickly it's got a typical sort of you
know typical serum sort of look to it as
you can see it doesn't look exactly like
the Olay Henriksen one it's a little
more humectant a little more creamy you
could probably see when I'm rubbing it
on my hand right now you can see there's
a little bit of moisture there which is
why I think people with dry skin would
love it but if you have oily skin
probably stay away from this one alright
now let's talk about one for dry skin
your skin people usually tend to deal
with a little more anti-aging issues in
general because when your skin starts to
get dehydrated you start to notice
visible lines a little more stuff like
that and I don't mean to say everybody
who has dry skin looks like they're
aging because that's not what I mean at
all what I mean is that um you know
wrinkles and fine lines and things like
that can be a little more obvious on dry
skin because it's when you lose moisture
in your skin that you start to get fine
lines and you start to have some aging
issues so one that I really recommend
and I think it's great for dry skin is
the Clarins shaping facial lift total
the contouring serum I really like this
a lot it was a little humectant for my
skin
type um I will still use it but I really
liked it around my neck area and like
this area it really does tighten and
firm and what I liked was that I felt
like um any day that I have really
really puffy eyes or I just felt like I
had kind of you know those sleep
wrinkles that you get where you're lying
on your pillow really really hard at
night and you get a little bit of sleep
wrinkles I felt like I was getting that
anytime I get that I basically will
reach for this and I really do feel like
it smooths things out
it is very very nice it's got a nice
thick sort of consistency to it and it
definitely has some moisture in there
which is why I think it would be
absolutely fantastic for dry skin and
again any sort of skin type can deal
with fine lines and wrinkles I have fine
lines I'm 23 and I have combination skin
I already have fine lines around my eye
area and definitely around my mouth area
so anybody can get them I'm just saying
with dry skin it could be a little more
noticeable on your skin type because you
have lost moisture if that makes sense
you need to put the moisture back in so
this is a fantastic little serum for dry
skin types all right another one that's
fantastic for dry skin types and also
for sensitive skin is this coadley
resveratrol firming serum this is
another one that is very firming it's
got a really milky consistency to it and
there is fragrance in here which is
interesting that I would say oh yeah go
ahead and use it if you have sensitive
skin but what I've noticed is that this
literally makes the redness in my skin
which is something that people with
sensitive skin tend to have a lot of
redness in their skin because if you
touch it too much or you irritate it too
much it gets red I have combo skin that
gets sensitive pretty easily and I
noticed the redness in my face is so
like diminished when I use this product
so even though it does have a little bit
of like a kind of like Greek yoghurt
it's not really cute not a very good
fragrance but what I notice with this is
that it really really does diminish the
redness in my face that's why I'm
recommending it for people who have
sensitive skin you could definitely use
it or if you have normal skin the people
with dry skin are gonna love this it has
a really milky consistency to it really
really awesome I find it really
moisturizes my cheek area you could
definitely get away with using it if you
have combo skin I would recommend just
using it once a day probably in the
morning but if you have dry skin twice a
day this would be a wonderful wonderful
serum for you because it is going to
help with anti aging properties but it
so it's going to help with the moisture
and or help put moisture into your skin
all right and then the last one that I
want to talk about I think every single
scrub ah every single every single every
single skin type could use this is the
bare minerals skin longevity vital power
infusion I have been using this this
week I am so in love I am totally
getting a full-size of this this is
amazing this is from bareMinerals it is
a really really thin liquidy sort of
texture it's absolutely amazing it has a
little bit of a scent but it's nothing
that is going to be bothersome I think
for people who have sensitive skin
because like I said I do get sensitive
around this area and this doesn't bother
me at all but look at this can you see
that there's moisture there and that's
lovely for people with dry skin but then
it sinks in immediately so it's great
for people who also have oily skin and I
am telling you right now my hand feels
so silky right now like I it almost
feels like there's like silicone in here
but there's not because I have looked at
the ingredients list online and there is
no silicone but it just is amazing and
it completely just sinks into the skin
and I think it's wonderful that the skin
drinks that up even in my oily areas you
know I'm le in my t-zone my skin will
just suck this right in so I really
think anybody with any sort of type of
skin could use this normal skin dry skin
sensitive sensitive skin combination
skin oily skin
everybody everybody could use this I am
loving it
this is I am so getting a full-size of
this I have been absolutely adoring this
this week and I have noticed just a
significant reduction in watching us on
my face redness I haven't been breaking
out that much this week it's just been
fantastic I use it once a day in the
morning before I put my makeup on and I
mean look at my hand right now
can't even tell there's anything on
there but you guys saw when I pumped it
on how moisturizing it was so I think
this is a fantastic it is a new product
from bareMinerals so definitely I will
leave a link below if I can find a
direct link for it right now I think
they're only selling it in a trio so
maybe I'll link that trio below but that
will be the first one that I linked
because I think it will work for
everybody's skin tone or skin tone skin
type I've been
too much all right guys so that is the
skincare 101 on serums I definitely
think serums are absolutely crucial for
every single skin type if you have dry
skin look for something that has a
little moisture to it if you have
combination skin or oily skin any sort
of serum that's just going to sink in
right away is going to be perfect for
you and you're lucky because serums are
really do sink in very quickly they're
very concentrated they're filled with
antioxidants they are going to help your
skin you may think it's your moisturizer
that's doing all the great things for
your skin but it's not it's the serums
that go and deeply penetrate but you
know first like what is that three or
four layers of the skin like the dermis
it can actually go way way way in there
which is awesome so absolutely you need
to get a serum you can use them once a
day twice a day and I think they're
absolutely crucial for every single skin
type so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video next week is it next week hold on
let me check my little youtube banner

beneficial and crucial for skin care as
