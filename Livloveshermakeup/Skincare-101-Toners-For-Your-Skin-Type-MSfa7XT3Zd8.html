thank you so much for joining me in this
video we are continuing our skincare 101
series again if you guys are not
interested in these kind of videos I
will have a review up after this video
and tonight I will have another
collection thing go up it will be my
perfume collection so that will be up
later so you guys definitely don't have
to watch this if you're not interested
but anyway I wanted to go ahead and talk
about toners in today's video yesterday
we talked about cleansers for your skin
types
well cleansers and scrubs for your skin
types and the five different kinds of
skin care or skin care the five
different skin types that I've been
talking about in these videos are oily
skin combination skin sensitive skin dry
skin and normal skin so today we're
talking about toners and I'm gonna let
you guys know if I think and again I'm
not a dermatologist or a doctor please
consult your own dermatologist if you
have really really specific questions
I'm just somebody who has done research
on skin care and I thought I would share
with you guys what I have learned but
today we're going to talk about toners
and I'm gonna let you know if I think it
is a necessity for your skin type or not
so toners used to be this product that
basically would rebalance your ph level
in your skin people kind of I don't want
to say like in the olden days but there
used to be cleansers that were either
really really stripping or didn't do
much for the skin and it would throw off
the pH balance in your actual skin so
toners were used to basically put that
pH back like in balance and that was all
the toners were used for nowadays they
are either used to rate your skin of
excess oil or maybe put moisture into
your skin so I think that for normal
skin and sensitive skin I'm going to
start with those two out of the five
normal skin and sensitive skin I really
don't think that you require a toner in
your skincare routine I think it really
is optional for you guys sensitive skin
is just one of those things where you
don't want something that's gonna strip
too much out of your skin because it is
going to make you sensitive and you also
don't really need any extra moisture in
your skin so I would just say stay away
from toners altogether and when it comes
to normal skin I think because you are
not super over oily or super super dry
you really don't need something that's
going to either balance your skin out
the only reason you should use it
maybe if your cleanser it's not removing
all of the like residue off of your face
if you still have dirt and grime on your
face you can go in with a toner and
again if you are sensitive if you really
do want to use a toner definitely use
one that is alcohol-free and fragrance
free and if you have normal skin just
find one that really isn't too drying
but also one that's not going to be
putting moisture into your skin because
you really don't need either of those
things now let's move on to oily skin
people with oily skin I highly highly
recommend checking out a salicylic acid
toner or something with witch hazel in
it I will always say stay away from any
products that have alcohol in them but I
will say if you have oily skin or even
combination skin using a toner that does
have alcohol in it is going to help read
your pores of any sort of bacteria which
can help clear your skin usually if you
have oily skin you do have now I'm not
saying all the time but most of the time
you do have active breakouts and see
with combination skin and I just want to
say I do really really love this toner
from Olay this is the oil minimizing
clean this has witch hazel in it which
is really really fantastic for combo
skin people and also oily skins people
so you can use anything like this this
does have alcohol in it this is the only
toner I've ever tried that has alcohol
in it but I noticed it really really
leaves me squeaky squeaky clean so if
you have oily skin and you really do it
battle with you know basically having to
touch up throughout the day you need
like oil blotting pads and all that kind
of stuff having a toner like this is
actually a really really nice thing to
use and I would only recommend using it
once a day again because it does have
alcohol in it you want to be careful if
you have oily skin but also sensitive
skin definitely don't go for something
like that but if you just have really
really oily skin and you really want to
feel clean in the morning before you put
your makeup on and things like that you
definitely can pick something up it has
a little bit of alcohol in it because it
will help decongest your pores it will
help basically suck up the oil on your
skin and also witch hazel is really
really beneficial another thing that is
really really nice is a salicylic acid
toner again this can be used for
combination skin as well this is the
oil-free acne stress control triple
action toner with micro clear technology
from Neutrogena this is a fantastic one
I've used this that
time when I'm having breakouts because I
find that the salicylic acid really
pushes any sort of dirt out of my pores
but if you have oily skin you definitely
could get away with using this twice a
day even in the morning it's really
gonna strip and I don't want to say
strip that sounds are really bad but it
is going to pull any sort of oil out of
your skin for the day and you're not
gonna have to deal with as much like oil
blotting or you know touching up if that
makes sense
if you have combination skin I recommend
only using this probably once a day
maybe at night and only really in your
t-zone you don't want to go all over and
get you know crazy and go all over your
cheek area because if you have
combination skin like I do you are
probably dry on your cheek area but
anyway this is a really really fantastic
toner I highly would recommend for those
with combination skin and also oily skin
it's a refreshing multitasking toner it
works three different ways for clearer
shine free skin so it has the micro
clear technology it eliminates oil and
shine and it also refreshes and soothes
the skin it does have cucumber extract
in here so that also can help with
combination skin because you don't want
anything too harsh on your cheek area so
for oily and combination skin these two
toners are really really fantastic be
careful with the Olay one because you
don't want to overuse this especially if
you have combination skin because it
will dry out your cheek area but
definitely in your t-zone once a day it
will work and this one once a day as
well for combination skin but if you
have oily skin you could definitely get
away with using both of these twice a
day now I want to kind of talk a little
more about combination skin another
really fantastic toner that I have tried
is from the nude skincare line this is
sold at Sephora this is the purified
toning water and what I like about this
is it has cardamom and cinnamon in it
which really really helps with
inflammation so also if you have oily
skin and active breakouts
this can be really really fantastic but
what I also like about it is that it is
free of any sort of alcohol so if you
have combination skin it's not going to
open overly dry or overly irritate your
dry cheek area so this is a really
really fantastic one as well that
cinnamon and cardamom in there really
does help congest decongest
the pores and clear any sort of active
breakouts that you may have so I would
recommend this one more for combination
skin and then they sell
sell an acid or witch hazel one for oily
skin now let's go ahead and talk about
dry skin the last one that I do think it
is good to have a toner this one from
L'Oreal this Hydra fresh toner I have
used this up completely this is
fantastic it really refreshes the skin
and I feel like it puts moisture back
into the skin so if you have dry skin
you are not looking for something with
salicylic acid or cinnamon or cardamom
or witch hazel in it because that's
going to pull moisture out of your skin
what you want is something that's going
to put moisture into your skin so this
L'Oreal one is really nice I find it
very very moisturizing on my skin it's
very nice on my cheek area it has beta
hydroxy acid which also helps to
exfoliate the skin usually if you have
dry skin you have a little bit of
buildup of dry skin on your face and
instead of going in and using a scrub
and really really rubbing at your skin
you want to get something that has like
an exfoliating acid in it that's going
to help clear off any sort of congestion
on the top which is basically from
having layers of dead skin cells so this
is a really really fantastic one for
those with dry skin and then it is
alcohol-free it really does refresh the
skin and it feels really really good if
you store this in the refrigerator and
you use it on your skin in the morning I
think that if you have dry skin you can
get away with using this twice a day
absolutely it does have Pro vitamin b5
which also helps protect against
moisture loss and it has hyaluronic acid
in it which helps lock in moisture into
the skin and another toner that I want
to recommend for anybody with dry skin
is the body shops vitamin e hydrating
toner absolutely fantastic I don't have
it here to show you guys but it really
really does put moisture back into the
skin so a little over run if you have
normal skin I don't think it's a
necessity for you to have a toner and if
you have sensitive skin I think it's
just going to irritate your skin more
you can absolutely skip this step if you
have oily skin I would recommend looking
for something with tea tree oil witch
hazel salicylic acid anything like that
you can definitely use a toner twice a
day combination skin I would look for
something that has purifying ingredients
in it like something with cinnamon or
witch hazel but nothing with too much
alcohol in it because you don't want to
dry out your cheek area as far as dry
skin goes I would look for a toner
that's going to put moisture back into
the skin and look for something that has
a
um a like acid that will help exfoliate
your skin because you do get built up up
dry skin on your face so anyway I hope I
got through all the skin types we'll see
here oily yes combination yes normal
skin yes sight sensitive
doesn't say hypersensitive sensitive
skin and then the last one was dry skin
yes so we got through all of them I hope
that this was somewhat helpful I will be
talking about serums next and we will
talk about which ones to use for your
skin type um and yeah I'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
