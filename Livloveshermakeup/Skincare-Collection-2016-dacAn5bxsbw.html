skincare not just this all this I am
showing you guys my skincare collection
today everything ranging from hand
creams foot creams body lotions facial
cleansers toners eye creams all that
kind of stuff over here we have hair
care products but that will be a video
for Friday but yeah we're talking about
skin care today I'm showing you guys how
I organized everything and I'm just
gonna be going through every single
product I'm not going to be sitting and
reviewing and talking about everything
for a million hours because as you can
see I do have a lot but I wanted to
start with this little pile right here
cuz this is the these are some of these
skincare items that I chose out for this
week if you guys are not familiar with
my channel I do swap out my makeup my
skincare and my haircare every week
after I film my weekly favorites videos
on Sundays so that is how I get through
all of these products I just want to say
that right away I do make the rounds
through these products you guys will see
in the video there are very few that I
have not touched so I do have a lot but
I don't know it's like makeup it's like
an illness literally collecting and
having like skincare is almost as bad as
makeup so it's just one of those things
I just have kept collecting and I do
make the rounds through the product so I
don't want you guys to think like wow
she has so much stuff and she doesn't do
anything with it I really do make the
rounds through it if you watched me leak
lis favorites videos you probably know
that because I talk about a lot of stuff
every single week but how I have this
organized is basically by bird's eye
view I like to be able to open my closet
doors and look down on the products and
that is because if I put everything into
a bin I would not know where anything is
I'm a very out of sight out of mind sort
of person so that would not work for me
basically I just use lids from boxes or
glossy boxes or like a lure sample
Society boxes anything like that and I
will put two different products in
different one so over there I know I
have my hand creams of my foot creams
here I know I have my facial moisturizer
is over here are two boxes of masks you
know I know where everything is and
