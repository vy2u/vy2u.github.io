my channel happy Friday today's video is
going to be all about skincare products
that actually work just for a little bit
of background information I do have
combo to oily skin I definitely am drier
on my cheeks and oily in my t-zone and I
will be 25 years old in August so in a
couple of months I will be 25 years old
and I have been loving and paid using
skincare since I was literally like 16
17 years old I've been using retinols
and things like that since I was 18 I'm
just an avid like skincare addict I love
skincare I think it's great and there
are some products out there there really
do actually make a difference in your
skin
so today we're gonna talk about those I
have some drugstore favorites as well as
high-end favorites so let's go ahead and
jump right into it the first brand that
I want to talk about is the nip plus fab
line this is actually something that is
like drugstore price that you can find
it alta right here I have the nip plus
fab dragon's blood fix cleansing pads
this is what they look like they have
hyaluronic acid in them as well as
salicylic acid and Dragon's Blood which
comes from a plant and then here I have
the glycolic fix scrub but now I also
like the overnight gel I can't find it
in my collection right now but I would
say if you are someone with dry skin if
you are someone with hyperpigmentation
if you are someone who has oily skin
pretty much all sorts of different skin
types except for sensitive I think you
would really really enjoy the glycolic
fix line so one of the things I love
about this scrub is that it really does
kind of microderm your face it's got
those tiny little particles in there
that almost feel like pumice stones on
your face so it really gives a good
scrub and the glycolic acid in there is
really nice for clearing up acne
decongestant the skin and also
exfoliating so I love that as well as
the Jawa and then these little guys
right here I've been using these this
week and they're just really really
wonderful if you don't want to use like
a liquid toner these are great for just
toning the skin really quickly before
going in with your serum or your
moisturizer they have a very interesting
scent to them I don't hate it but I also
don't love it but they are really nice
because normally when you do find fixed
pads like this what happens is that you
get something with salicylic acid and it
dries out your skin this has hyaluronic
acid built in there which is awesome
they are very very soft and cushiony
this is what the little pad looks like
you have one side that's a little more
textured the other side is smooth but
both sides feel very very smooth they
never feel irritating and I really enjoy
these you do not rinse them off your
skin you just apply them and then you
can go in with your normal skin care
just make sure if you are wearing these
during the day
you follow up with Sun care or I guess
some screen you should say but make sure
you follow up with sunscreen because
these will make you Sun sensitive since
there is salicylic acid in there
something else from the drugstore that I
would really recommend to those of you
who do have especially if you have a
lupus and if you have very very
sensitive skin is the Cetaphil
moisturizing cream this is what I use on
in my face when I am in lupus flare ups
I cannot stand any fragrance and
glycolic acid retinol is anything like
that when I am in a lupus flare but this
is amazing so it is just a really really
thick white cream as you guys can see
and it will moisturize you head-to-toe
you literally can use this all over your
body if you want to but it really does
work it have absolutely no fragrance no
irritation and it's just something that
I use consistently when I am in lupus
flare so if you are very sensitive would
highly recommend these Cetaphil
moisturizing creams um there are some
products here from Sunday Riley that of
course I have to talk about I really do
like the good jeans from Sunday Riley
I'm looking into the ordinary what does
it called the ordinary 5% lactic acid
serum I think next because it's around
five or ten dollars and I do know you
know Sunday Riley is very very pricey
but I do think they make the good jeans
in this it's pretty darn good I don't
notice as much of results as I do with
like the luna oil or with these guys
right here but I do like that and the
luna oil is very nice if you do have
more mature skin but if you're someone
who has very very oily skin problematic
skin skin that breaks out I would highly
highly recommend these the first is the
Martian mattifying melting water gel
toner it is basically like a cooling
toner and it comes out in a liquid form
as you guys can see and then what
happens is it just like goes into like
almost like a gel into your skin
it smells like wet dog and honestly I
don't think any of the oh I don't think
any of these Sunday Riley products smell
good whatsoever but this is really nice
and you do get a lot of product in here
and I just love to bathe my body and
this literally like when I went in the
summertime and I'm very oily and I just
want a cooling sensation on my face I
use this all over my decollete my neck
and my face everywhere and then at night
time
is nice to go and with the UFL ultra
clarifying face oil there are a lot of
good oils from Sunday Riley I've not
tried that you know but I have tried
pretty much all of the other ones and
this is just something that I really
enjoy if you are very very oily you can
also go ahead and mix this into your
foundation it does smell very very
strongly a basal so if you are not a fan
of that you would not like it but a
little goes a very long way I've had
this for I believe over eight months now
and that is how far I've gotten so
really enjoyed this and I think it's so
smart too that they went ahead and they
took a drying agent kind of like um you
know salicylic acid or retinol things
like that and they put them into oils it
just makes a lot of sense because
normally when you're using retinol when
you're using salicylic acid benzoyl
peroxide all that kind of stuff it will
dry out your skin so Sunday Riley is
kind of genius for doing this in my
opinion something else I want to
recommend it for those of you who are
extremely extremely dry is the Josie
Maran Argan infinity intensive creamy
oil I don't have anything that really
moisturizes my face quite like this
these Cetaphil is what I use when I'm in
lupus flares because there is no
fragrance there is a tiny amount of
fragrance in here but I can still get
away with using this when I am in flares
it has a little bit of like a lemony
scent to it and it is very very
moisturizing I'm talking like if you
have irritation on your skin and you you
just like cannot get rid of that dryness
that this is what you need so it comes
out kind of been like a balm and then as
you guys can see when you rub it in even
on top of this Martian mattifying
melting water tell toner it is very very
oily but you know what if you are
extremely dry extremely part you know
how nice it feels when you actually do
put an oil on your face so this is
something I would highly recommend it is
very very beautiful alright next I do
have a face mask err and I love face
masks I feel like there's really really
good ones from the drugstore like the
Freeman feeling beautiful mask anything
with clay I really do enjoy the Queen
who leaned mint julep basket balms her
like seventeen of these since I was like
12 years old anything like this will
pull the impurities and the oils out of
your skin but if there was one mask that
I could choose besides the rose stem
cell from Peter Thomas Roth I would say
the pumpkin enzyme mask is amazing and
resurfacing your skin it is a dual and
somatic
yeah dual enzymatic resurfacer so it has
physical particles of exfoliation as
well as the chemical exfoliator xin here
that is what it looks like and it does
smell exactly like pumpkin pie it really
really will microderm the hell out of
your face it feels very very nice your
skin will look a lot more clear it won't
have as much hyperpigmentation after you
use it this is the one mask I would say
I noticed an immediate difference with
when I wash it off my face so I love
that and I also do love the clear pore
cleanser slash mask from Neutrogena I
have been using this for years you guys
this does have 3.5% benzoyl peroxide in
it I am someone who does suffer from
hormonal acne which means that I get my
acne along my jawline and right here
like in my I guess chin area do you also
get oily in this area but I don't get
tons of breakouts in my t-zone now if
you do have a lot of big painful cystic
pimples that are super super sore to the
touch around your jawline you probably
do have hormonal acne I started to clear
mine up when I went on birth control
when I was about 15 years old my
dermatologist put me on birth control
I'm no longer on birth control but it
really does help to you know kind of
clear up hormonal acne birth control
does definitely obviously talk to your
parents about it first ask if that's
okay but it is something that's really
really good if you are younger and
you're dealing with hormonal acne but
another good thing is definitely benzoyl
peroxide now so silic acid can only do
so much at you know exfoliating your
skin and also getting rid of blackheads
and things like that but I don't feel
like Stella said like acid does for
a really really big painful cystic
pimples benzoyl peroxide does like I
said this is three point five percent
clean and clear makes a 10 percent
benzoyl peroxide wash would highly
recommend be very careful though you
want to make sure you follow up with
something that will be moisturizing
again I would recommend it the Cetaphil
because this will dry your skin out but
it's very very good at removing oil and
helping with breakouts now I do have a
toner here from Neutrogena this is the
oil-free acne stress control triple
action toner this is something that I
want to recommend it but at the same
time I don't this is filled with alcohol
you guys and it does kind of burn your
skin and I'm like I know you're probably
thinking like why are you talking about
it I'm talking about it because it
actually works if you do have a huge
pimple and you want to get rid of it you
know the next day you can go in with
like the Mario Badescu dry and lotion
which you do have to do a couple of days
worth of I notice that if
just put this directly on there like
it's gone within the morning so the
Mario Badescu drying lotion is fantastic
as well anything with benzoyl peroxide
that you can leave on overnight to the
personnel time from clean and clear
things like that but this one is really
really good stuff so it's not
necessarily good for your skin but if
you have like ah if you're like me and
you have a performance the next day and
you got to get rid of a big pimple I
just take a little bit with a q-tip and
I put it on there and I'm good to go all
right as far as facial oils are
concerned there are two that I have
noticed big differences with I have a
huge amount of facial oils I've done a
video all about like my favorite facial
oils before but the difference that I
see is definitely what this guy right
here and this one so this is the Korres
Wild Rose vitamin C brightening oil and
this is what it looks like and you do
have to use oils pretty consistently to
see a big difference this actually has
dried mm-hmm excuse me sorry this
actually has dried rose petals at the
bottom as you guys can see and I've used
up probably about half of this I've had
it open for like a year and a half it
still hasn't gone bad it smells like
fermented rose which isn't really that
great of a scent but I do notice that my
skin if I use this consistently if I mix
it in with moisturizer everyday if I
wear it on my skin at nighttime I
noticed that my hyperpigmentation does
start to look a lot less like definitive
on my face definitive it makes no sense
it doesn't look as drastic on my face so
I really do enjoy this oil this is what
I would recommend for those of you with
more combo to oily skin if you're super
dryer I would go with the marula beauty
oil now this was sent to me for PR and
honestly at first I was just kind of
like can it be that good but this one is
really really nice I do still prefer the
drunk elephant oil though I don't know
why this one seems just a little bit
different it does have a little bit of a
scent to it so they did add some
fragrance in there I believe that is the
drunk elephant marilla oil is a hundred
percent virgin so there's no you know
fragrance and there are anything like
that but this one is quite nice if you
just add a few drops of this into your
moisturizer you should be good to go if
you do have dry skin and also our Vaughn
oil is absolutely fantastic which is why
I recommend to see Josie Maran craven
alright next we have the acne free
therapeutic sulfur mask this does have
vitamin C and copper in it again if you
are very problematic skin acne prone
large painful cystic acne around your
jawline things like that this is great
you can use it as a spot treatment you
can also just use it as
facemask and I really do enjoy it it
smells like ass it smells like sulfur
but it really does work you put it on
it's basically a white cream and then
when it's ready to come off it will turn
to a blue color and you can rinse it off
that is fantastic
if you're someone that is more into
cruelty free all-natural alternatives
for skin care the she Tara organics rose
hips black soap a facial wash wash is
really really good for anti-aging
properties as well as clearing out
breakouts so it does stay right here for
all skin types
100% natural anti acne anti aging wonder
soap it definitely does not smell good
it has a very natural scent to it but
this is really good for microderm in
your face without having physical
exfoliators in it so what you do is kind
of like on damp skin I would take about
a pump and a half of this I would put it
on your skin leave it on for about five
minutes you'll start to feel like
tingling effects and then you rinse it
off and honestly your skin is so smooth
and nice I don't notice the biggest
difference as far as like clearing up
you know like cystic breakouts is
concerned but if you are a little older
and you also want to help it with anti
aging this is a really really good soap
and I do find this on Amazon alright as
far as glam glow is concerned you guys
know I really do like glam glow but
these are the two products I would
recommend to the most actually do what
they say they're gonna do this is the
glam glow dream duo overnight
transforming treatment now I don't
recommend using this as like a mask once
a week I recommend if you're super dry
just use this as your nighttime
moisturizer it has one side that has
like a serum and then the other side
does have like this seal that will
completely you know push everything into
your skin so that no moisture is going
to leave your skin it's really beautiful
I like to use this the night before
shows and usually if I know I have a lot
of shows that week I will just use it
every single night as my nighttime
moisturizer so I enjoyed that and then
also the glam glow glow starter mega
illuminating moisturizer it's not going
to do anything for hyperpigmentation
it's not gonna clear up acne it's not
gonna resurface your skin it is just
going to give a beautiful beautiful
luminous effect to your skin and some
people just want that they just want to
look really moist and beautiful and if
you have more mature mature skin or more
like dry skin that I cannot speak more
mature skin or more dry skin you would
absolutely love this I will show you
guys what it looks like on camera
tomorrow when I do look of the week but
I've been using it this week it is
fantastic really enjoy that and as far
as their other masks are concerned I do
like the tingle exfoliating treatment I
think that
nice don't use it if you have sensitive
scanner and then the green one is my
favorite that's power bud and that one's
really really good for clearing out oil
in the t-zone and then helping keeping
your cheeks and nice and moist if you do
have combo skin all right next we have
the Peter Thomas Roth unwrinkled peel
pads these have a 20% acid complex the
glycolic salicylic and lactic acids you
guys you need your acids I'm seriously
you need them whether you have mature
skin young skin old skin whatever kind
of skin type you have you should get
into this lactic acid is great salicylic
acid is great glycolic acid is great I
would highly recommend these are awesome
I would say a cruelty-free option that
is also really good are those what are
they called
first a Beauty fix pads those are also
really good you don't wash those ones
off these ones you do because they do
have such a strong complex 20% is a lot
of acid to put on your face you do have
to go ahead and rinse these off your
face on but they are beautiful you can
even feel like I've ever dipped like
near your mouth or anything like that
you can taste it literally feels like
fruit acid on your tongue but they're
awesome they help to clear up acne for
me personally they help with my
discoloration I think they're really
really good if you're more combo to oily
skin if you do have dry skin though too
you need to make sure that you are
exfoliating your face and glycolic acid
and salicylic acid can do that so those
are fantastic if you have really really
oily skin and you want a nice toner
that's just going to get rid of oil I
would highly recommend the only
Hendrickson grease relief facial water
this is what it looks like and you have
to use it exactly how they say on the
back so it's as if purifies and
mattifies with lactic acid goldenseal
and hops extract and you guys will
notice I talked about a lot of products
that have acids in them they just work
very well for my skin personally what
you want to do is miss five sprays onto
a clean dry cotton pad and then you want
to rub in circular motions if you just
swipe it on your face like directly it
will not work you have to do the
circular motions it will completely
completely remove all the oil on your
skin it's absolutely fantastic here I do
have a product from Skin diva this is
the 20% of vitamin C plus E of fruit
llyich acid serum this was sent to me
for PR and I'm really really surprised
it is very very good you do have to
refrigerate it vitamin C is very
unstable item you probably heard that a
lot it is a very unstable kind of thing
but anyway this says to apply two to
three drops on to fingertips and smooth
on to the skin I apply one whole a
dropper foam onto my face when I'm done
with like lupus
when I'm left with a lot of
discoloration vitamin C is going to
clear that up now
polish choice makes really really great
vitamin C products as well I used to
only use Paula's choice I used to only
use Mario Badescu products now I kind of
branched out and use all sorts of
different things but yes you can get the
Polish choice one polish choice also
makes it really fantastic hyaluronic
boosters which you can add into other
moisturizers and so does the skin deeper
brands but I just want to show you guys
this one anything with vitamin C is
really going to help to clear up
hyperpigmentation on your face here is a
retinol product that is not the luna oil
this is the Neutrogena
ageless intensive anti wrinkle deep
wrinkle moisturizer this is the night
cream version you guys can see like I'm
almost done with this I love this I have
been using this since I was 17 years old
17 years old I will not purchase again
because Neutrogena does tests on animals
I'll just continue with my own well
right now I'm using up the 100% pure
retinol restorative night balm and then
also I do like the luna oil but as far
as retinol is concerned if you want
something over the counter it's not
going to have as high of a percentage of
retinol yeah high of a percentage of
retinol as Elune oil and things like
that but this is still really really
really good you can get the day cream as
well which does have a built-in SPF and
I just love the feeling of this on my
skin it never ever leaves me oily so if
you've tried Luna oil and you're like ah
I don't like that feeling this will not
do that it's an awesome product really
enjoy this and I've heard so many people
rave about this and then also I want to
talk about these Sunday Riley title
Britney and same water cream this is the
great daytime moisturizer for those of
you with hyperpigmentation and dry skin
it works for me and I have combo skin
Tom and I have both been using this
lately and as you can see we are almost
done so I enjoyed this a lot something
that's pretty darn similar is the
Neutrogena hydro boost water gel but
this one definitely you can feel it kind
of working a little bit you get a little
bit of tingling sensations from be built
in acids in there and then also like I
said if you're going to use this during
the daytime you do need to follow up
with a sunscreen and then finally I do
have two eye creams here now I do not
really believe that eye creams do that
much in of my personal opinion but these
two right here are really really nice
for wearing underneath and makeup if
you're just looking for a nice smooth
base the first one is the yester great
proof dark circle correcting eye cream
it does have a yellow tinge to it so
it's going to help with dark circles and
if you do have a very oily eyelids this
will sink in immediately
and then this guy right here would be
great for those of you with more mature
skin or very very dry skin it is the
timebomb skin care white TI perfection
gel and this is from the balm cosmetics
it is awesome let me show you guys what
the actual consistency looks like it
truly is like a gel but then when you
rub it in you can feel that it is
silicone base so it's really gonna help
to kind of smooth out anything
underneath the eyes and I got that on
HauteLook for I believe around five or
six dollars which is awesome so anyway
that is it I feel like I just talked a
whole lot I hope you guys enjoyed this
video as always thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for it look at the week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
