video is going to be my night time
skincare routine I have not done one of
these videos forever you guys and the
reason for that is because I change up
my products all of the time but recently
I have tried out some new products I did
purchase everything myself just want to
put that out there but I did recently
pick up some Sunday Riley products that
I'm absolutely in love with so I thought
I would share with you guys my current
nighttime skincare routine because I
have been using consistently like the
same products every single week now I
still change up my skincare routine in
the morning because I have a whole lot
of skincare items but this has been
really really wonderful like night
routine for me and I'm very excited to
share with you guys so let's go ahead
and get started so I have a full face of
makeup on it usually at the end of the
day so what I do is I will slash my face
with some water and then I go in with
the purity made simple facial cleansing
gel and I makeup remover this has
recently been my all-time favorite
makeup remover it really removes even
waterproof mascara it moves like all the
gunk on your face I really do enjoy this
I would say it removes probably 99.5% of
all of your makeup which is awesome so
this has definitely been my favorite of
course I still love my bozo makeup
breakup whole cleansing oil I will
probably go back and forth between the
two of these but this is what I've
currently been using a little goes a
long way like I said you do need to
splash your face first with a little bit
of water then take about a quarter size
amount really lather it up on your hands
and then start working it onto your face
so after I use that I do go directly in
to the rock daily resurfacing disc this
is kind of like my second cleanse and I
use these at nighttime all the time so
these are clinically shown to diminish
the appearance of fine lines and
wrinkles I just love them because
they're so compact and very travel from
there you can literally just take like a
handful of these like on vacation with
you and they work really well basically
these are just little discs that already
have cleanser kind of infused in them if
this side is a little more textured and
what I like to do is kind of go in
circular motions in my t-zone where I
tend to be a little more oily and then I
take the softer side I go over my eye
area I go all around my face underneath
my neck everywhere and I just love the
way that these kind of remove that
excess like 5.5% makeup that was you
know remaining on my skin they smell
really good and I feel like if you do
have acne prone skin and especially if
you do have more mature skin these are
really really nice
so I do enjoy those and then what I do
is I usually put on a face mask I'm not
going to show you guys a face mask right
now because I don't have a particular
one that I've just been using
consistently I change them up weekly but
then I'll go ahead and I'll get in the
shower I will rinse a my mask off and I
have been using this cleanser lately so
right now the Ulta 21 days of beauty
event is going on and this is something
that I got in last yeah to last also 21
days of beauty event in the springtime
this is the Murad clarifying cleanser it
says it reduces 99.9% of irritating
surface bacteria in less than one minute
it does have salicylic acid 1.5% which
is a really really nice amount I feel
like it really helps to exfoliate the
skin without drying you out like maybe
benzoyl peroxide would but I also feel
like 0.5% salicylic acid never really
does anything for my skin so if you do
have combo or oily skin I think this is
a nice one and I got this for half off
and I know they had it again this time
it just has 6.75 fluid ounces in here
and it's a gel cleanser so a little goes
a very long way it kind of smells like
lemon and menthol or something I don't
really know it doesn't smell evaporates
but I feel like it works really really
nicely it just giving my skin at that
nice cleanse and you may be thinking
well if you already went in with the
purity made simple to remove your makeup
and then you went in with the rock
dislike why are you going in with a
third cleanser I basically consider
these two right here to beat my makeup
removers and then this is my actual
cleanser so anyway I have been enjoying
that quite a bit and if you guys are
curious I do pair that at nighttime with
my Clarisonic Mia this is my Clarisonic
Mia I do use the heavenly luxe brush
this is my all-time favorite also Tom's
favorite he has the black Aria one and I
just love my little thing why I think
it's so cute I need to get a new brush
head here anyway this is a really really
wonderful product I've talked about
Clarisonic a little bit on my channel
I got my Clarisonic when I think I was
not this one I've gone through like five
different models I think I got it when I
was 16 or 17 when they first released
onto the market I'm a big believer that
these do work I used to use them
consistently twice a day now I just use
it once a day and I do like this
particular brush the most it is
definitely the softest and the least
abrasive on the skin so I really really
do enjoy my Clarisonic I plan on getting
the for rail Luna
and I will go ahead and give you guys a
comparison between this one and that one
because that one kind of stimulates the
skin which is good for blood flow and
producing more collagen whereas this
really kind of cleanses the skin so
we'll see how that goes so after I have
cleanse my face I will get out of the
shower and what I like to do is that I
just realize I don't have them here what
I like to do is go in with my rock daily
resurfacing not my book no no girl no I
like to go in with our theater Thomas
Roth unwrinkled peel pads now I have no
idea where they are like where did they
put them but you guys know what I'm
talking about I talk about my unwrinkled
peel pads all of the time on my channel
they are a skincare favorite of mine and
what I like to do is basically after I
have like you know Pat dried my whole
entire body after getting out of the
bath or the shower I will go ahead and I
will take one of the little discs I like
to put it on the back of my hands and
then I flip it over and I put it all
over my face now depending on what kind
of skin type you have you can leave it
on for about 32 seconds up to three
minutes I do personally leave mine on
for about two-and-a-half minutes because
I'd use it in the morning and at night
it's got glycolic acid in it sell us a
bit glycolic acid in it salicylic acid
and also lactic acid which are really
really great for your skin in general so
what I do is I put one of those on and
what I like about the unwrinkle peel
pads is the fact that you don't leave
them on so after about three minutes
that's the longest you want to keep them
on your head and you actually neutralize
the peel with water so after I left it
on for three minutes I go ahead I rinse
it off I pat dry at my face and again I
am left with a bare face and that is
when I go in with my new products from
Sunday Riley like I said I bought all of
these with my own money if you are
curious just want to put that out there
the first little set I want to talk
about because I am now basically
alternating each night so the first
little said I want to talk about are the
luna sleeping night oil and the good
jeans all-in-one lactic acid treatment
so basically I like to go straight in
with the luna sleeping night oil when I
have a completely clean face so right
after I Pat my skin dry I like to go
directly in with this this has retinol
in it and it does have blue tansy as
well and very very hydrating I would say
I use probably half a dropper full yep
probably about half a dropper full and
if you guys are curious as to why these
Sunday Riley
rules are kind of tinted like this is
because it's trying to remind you to use
this at nighttime like you don't want to
put something blue on your face and have
it tint during the day so this is
something you want to use at nighttime
retinol will make you very Sun sensitive
so please don't use this during the day
but this is a beautiful product and what
I like to do is go ahead and put it all
over my face I take it underneath my
eyes the only area that I avoid is my
lips I do take it around this area but
for the most part I just kind of you
know put it all over and then I press it
into the skin so after I have thoroughly
kind of like blended it into my skin I
press it into my skin so that it's
really kind of penetrating the skin and
then I wait I would say about 2 to 3
minutes you don't want to wait till it's
completely completely sunk into your
skin because that's going to take
forever this is an oil I will go in with
my good jeans all-in-one lactic acid
treatments this brightens exfoliates
plumps lines evens hyperpigmentation and
it also increases circulation for
instant radiance now you can go in with
this first and then go in with this one
I find if I use this one first and then
go in with the oil for some reason it
falls up on my skin I have tried so many
different things and technically you
really should use this one first it's
more like a serum and then you want to
top it with the oil because sometimes if
you're putting a serum on top of an oil
it's very hard for that serum to
actually penetrate through the oil and
into your skin so I like to go in I mean
I would really like to go in with this
first and then go in with this but I
swear to you it just won't let me like
it balls up on my skin I just have all
these weird little crispy things on my
face it's very strange I could be
because this is a very strong lactic
acid treatment and it does start to kind
of exfoliate the skin so what I've been
doing is going with this and then I go
in with this about two to three minutes
later and this one you definitely can
feel it kind of working it starts to
kind of tingle on your face kind of
similar to the Peter Thomas Roth
unwrinkle peel pads those also have
lactic acid in them
I think lactic acid is great for
hyperpigmentation I think it's great for
combo to oily skin people it's great for
mature skin these sunday Riley Luna I'm
not just a Luna but also just the
products in general tend to be really
really nice because they're giving you
top-notch ingredients that tend to be a
little more on the dry inside but
they're putting it
post an oil form so it's more
comfortable on the skin which is genius
so anyway I do want to say really
quickly people were asking like do you
like the smell um because you guys know
I'm very like I only like good smells
but this one does not bother me at all
and the good jeans kind of just smells
like lemony and it also doesn't bother
me so yeah very very happy with the two
of those so Monday Wednesday Friday and
Sunday I use those and then after I go
in with the lactic acid I just
completely go ahead and that's it that's
it for me at nighttime I really think
the two of those pair together are
beautiful you don't want to go in with
anything on top of it just in case it
will you know deactivate the actual
retinol or the lactic acid treatment in
here so I just leave it like that now on
Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays I go
ahead and I use these babies so I
recently picked these up but I had tried
out samples before and I was like I need
these in my life so I like to alternate
the two of these because like I said I
do have combo to oily skin and I am a
little more prone to breakouts so this
is the Martian mattifying melting water
gel toner for oily to acne prone skin it
says it instantly transforms from a
cooling gel to a water toner as it
clarifies removes oil and visibly
tightens pores I don't feel like it
tightens my pores I do feel like it
clarifies in a removes oil immediately
if you do have very oily skin this will
be a nice product you can actually use
this during the daytime the UFO you want
to use at night time again has salicylic
acid in it which can make you Sun
sensitive but this has been tonight clay
in it which is really really good for
purifying the skin it has marshmallow
and also manuka honey so it's still
hydrating so yeah this is what it looks
like and I take one pump of this and let
me show you guys what it looks like I
take one pump of this ah do you see that
one pump of this on the back of my hand
it's almost like a bouncy gel
consistency you can go in with a cotton
pad if you want I just take it and put
it all over my face it really really
does kind of cool down inflammation it
feels really good on the skin the smell
is a mixture of wet dog and lemon at
first you just smell the lemon you both
know I'm a citrus girl so I'm all about
that life but then you smell like that
wet dogs net smell and you're just kind
of like what is that um so this smell
isn't amazing but it does come in a pump
like this and I do think it's good that
Sunday Riley products are packaged
properly a lot of people don't
understand that like lactic acid
treatments and retinol they have to be
in a dark bottle
in glass you know they don't do well in
plastic you can't have them in a light
color bottle because it will actually
deactivate the product so anyway I like
that this is in a pump and I do think
this is a very nice product I will go
ahead I will put that all over my skin
actually let me show you guys like I'll
just take a little bit right there and
you can see it really instantly kind of
mattifies the skin and it sinks in
immediately because technically it is a
toner and oh yeah being that zesty kind
of smell right now a little bit of wet
dog again you just put it all over your
face and then I do like to go ahead and
Pat it in and I I like this I feel like
it really does mattify me at first I was
like I don't need that one I only need
the good cheese and the Luna but
honestly after trying like a bunch of
different sunbae Riley products I'm just
kind of like kind of I'll take all of
them please thank you all right so after
that sinks in to my skin I wait about
two to three minutes again I do go in
with the UFO ultra clarifying face oil
this was like instant love literally
instantly by using I've been using it
probably three or four days now I
thought that sounds like it's not enough
time but you guys I feel like when I
find something that really really works
I swear to you it really really works
because I changed my skincare weekly and
I can see a difference immediately so
this is a 1.5% salicylic acid treatment
kind of like this cleanser right here
now a cleanser you know this is only
staying on your skin for so long this is
a wonderful product because if you are
like sensitive to salicylic acid or even
if you have like more mature skin or dry
skin but you still have breakouts this
is genius again just like the retinol
which can make you very very dry on your
skin benzoyl peroxide salicylic acid can
do the same thing so this is an oil form
now this is a dry oil so it's not nearly
as um humectant as I would say the
luenell is but it's beautiful it says
1.5% salicylic acid this is a quick dry
and fast-acting medicated oil that
clears acne and blackhead causing it
buildup and debris from congested pores
for smoother blemish free skin it has
tea tree oil and black cumin in it as
well it supports clear skin while oh I
don't even know how to say that I meant
I'm gonna try hexa lacrosse that's it
yeah that's that one and licorice
naturally brighten the appearance of old
acne discolorations very visibly more
even toned complexion milk thistle and
cucumber seed oils combat the drying
effects of salicylic
asset and calm down the skin so again
this is a green oil as you guys can see
this one doesn't have that offensive of
a scent either it's so funny these
everybody complains about the cents on
these products and I'm kind of like I'm
taking it I like it it has a pretty darn
strong fragrance so if you are really
sensitive to fragrance I don't know
about this one but they are natural you
know natural fragrances so this is what
the UFO oil looks like and it is a dry
oil so when you put it on obviously it
goes on quite oily but I swear to you if
you do have combo skin or really oily
skin do not be afraid of oils I use oils
all the time to combat my oily skin and
this is a beautiful oil so I will go
ahead and I will put like I said at the
Martian toner all over my face I do not
go around my lip area or around my eye
area since this is drying and I do the
same with the UFO so I will rub that
into my face these two oils tend to be a
little more on the thick side so after
you rub them in then you can push them
and Pat them into the skin and I avoid
the eye area with this as well because
it's Ella silica acid and I don't need
to exfoliate around that area so I did
want to show you guys what I do after
that I have been going in with an eye
cream and I do have one that I've kind
of been digging this is the Olay
Henriksen ultimate lift IGEL I think
I've been using this for three and a
half weeks consecutively which is crazy
because I changed my eye creams all the
time I think I have like 12 that are
open in my collection right now I know
it's really bad but this is a really
really nice product it is a night
treatment you don't want to use it
during the day it is very tempting to
use during the day because it really
really kind of firms and lifts the eye
area but this does have I believe
glycolic acid in it which will make you
Sun sensitive so go ahead and use this
at nighttime but after I have you know
let those two green products kind of
sink in on my skin I take a little bit
of this gel and I will tap it underneath
my eye area I don't use my ring finger
because I do feel like I can't get a
very good control although is the
weakest I just I use my metal finger I
do go on my eyelids as well and I tap
everything in and then that is it
I go to bed so as you guys can see
pretty easy skincare routine I mean I
know I just talked for like 15 minutes
straight but for the most part I'm
wearing like two products on my face at
nighttime right now which is crazy
because in the morning I do like the
Asian skincare routine thing we used
like seven or eight different products
I'm not going to do a morning skincare
routine because I have
I change it I change it weekly and it's
just not fair for me to be like oh
here's this here's that I talked about
them in my feels and holy grails but I
will say this particular line is Sunday
by we've lined the sipping incredibly
incredibly impressive the height is real
and you know pipe is there for a reason
so yeah pretty much just been peering at
the Martian or the green acne-prone line
together and then also the good genes
and the luna oil so anyway that is my
nighttime skincare routine I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know down
below if you have tried some Sunday
Riley products you guys were the ones
who recommended that I try the samples
that I had and it was like instant love
it was instant love and I feel like
sometimes you do get those products
especially ones that have benzoyl
peroxide salsa like acid glycolic acid
lactic acid
they really do show results pretty darn
quickly so this was just a line that I
do I feel like I believed in you know
it's like I believe in it I would say my
next purchase from the line will
probably be that title brightening
enzyme cream it helps to lighten up
hyperpigmentation and things like that
and during the winter time if I'm not
hydrated enough with this particular
combo right here on Tuesdays Thursdays
Saturdays I will go in with that water
enzyme cream on top so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
