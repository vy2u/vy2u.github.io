video is going to be a demo on all four
of the new Smashbox color correcting
Stix if you would like to see a review
on these products I will go ahead and
link that video down in the description
bar I did go ahead and review and do
swatches of all of them yesterday in
yesterday's video but if you are
interested in seeing how I personally
apply these on my skin and then just
keep on watching so let's just get right
into it I'm gonna pull on my hair back
quickly because I always get makeup in
my hair and I just don't want it in my
hair so I do want to tell you guys I
have already cleansed my face i cleansed
it with the Garnier skin active micellar
cleansing water this is the sensitive
version just so you guys know it's the
one that doesn't have like that oily
residue so all I did was cleanse my face
with that I am not wearing primer or
anything like that I thought it would be
interesting to show you guys how the
products go on without like a silicon e
primer or something like that they would
give it more slip so all I have is clean
skin and we're just gonna get right into
it so the shapes that we have here are
peach we have orange we have green and
then we have purple and I'm just gonna
show you guys how I use these and walk
you through what I use them for
basically so the first one we are going
to use is orange and it looks like this
and I am going to put this underneath my
eyes to cover in my dark circles than
any sort of blue tones that I have so I
am literally just coloring this right on
the areas where I see that I have blue
tones which is kind of on the inner part
of my eye and then a little bit
underneath and these are so nice they
glide on so creamy even if you're not
wearing a primer and I'm just kind of
touching those in the areas where I see
darkness a little on the outside of my
eye and yeah so that is what I'm doing
with the orange one and then the next
one I'm going to go into is the kind of
violet shade they call it a purple it
looks like this and I'm going to put
this on areas where I have fine lines so
around my mouth what I like about this
purple shade is it really kind of lifts
the color out I mean it lifts your
wrinkles in my opinion it gives the
illusion of filling in your wrinkles
because it just kind of brightens the
area so anywhere where I have some fine
I'm just going to run this over and I
love the formulation of these pencils
they really do glide on like butter if
you are someone who is in a hurry or you
want to carry one of these in your purse
that would be perfect for you and then
we have the get less red which is the
green one and I'm going to go ahead and
put this on any active break up I don't
have tons and tons of active breakouts
this week but I do have one on my neck
it's not weird I like your face will be
relatively clear and then you get one on
your neck or somewhere on your body but
anyways I do have one right there and
just a little bit of acne scarring here
I have some redness around my nose so
I'm gonna pencil that on there as well
just any area where I see kind of active
redness from like scarring from a pimple
that just went out like that hasn't
really started to turn into pigmentation
yet if that makes sense like
hyperpigmentation that's what I like to
use the peach shade for but like when
you first get a pimple and then it goes
down it's still really red so I like to
cover that with the green one and then
this is the peach one and I'm just going
to go in and cover my hyperpigmentation
with this and I have hyperpigmentation
all along my jawline from hormonal acne
so I am just putting it in that area
like that on each side this is where I
get the most scarring so there we go we
have color correct to the face and now
we are going to blend it in so I have
tried blending these in with like adding
a Beauty Blender and I felt like they
really sheared out when I did that
because they kind of are like a creamy
formula so I prefer either using my
fingers or using a really densely packed
brush so what I'm going to use in this
demo is the Tarte this is the new brush
oh my gosh I have nail polish all over
my finger just painted my nails I am so
messy anyway um I am going to use this
new Tarte brush that I got with my aqua
sealer this is part of the spring 2016
line that Tarte released I believe you
can get this on the Sephora calm website
now but the reason I'm using this I'm
gonna use this side by the way is
because it's really densely packed as
you guys can see but it still has a
little bit of give to it and it's small
enough that I can just kind of buff this
color into my skin so that's what I
prefer to use you could definitely use
like the
simple brush small stipple brush or even
hold on let me see here all my brush is
here anything like I don't know tart
also has something like this like a
little angled brush anything that's
really really densely packed even the
mineral powder brush from Alice might
work anything this is densely packed but
has a little bit of give that you can
buff this like product into your skin
with is going to work so we're just
going to start buffing this into
circular motions all over the piece and
I do feel like it worked with the Beauty
Blender but because it is like a pencil
form and it is kind of I don't want to
say it's it's not as creamy as say the
Urban Decay ones but it's a little more
tacky than those but I just feel like it
looks the best when it's blended in in
circular motions rather than just being
stippled on to the face but that's just
my opinion I mean you could do whatever
your little heart desires
but this is just personally what I like
to do I feel like they're really really
creamy ones like the liquidy creamy ones
this is more like pencil form but the
Urban Decay one things like that those
blended really nicely with a Beauty
Blender and I feel like the damp sponge
kind of takes away a little bit of
coverage which is why it looks so
natural on the skin but the reason I
like to use this brush is just because I
feel like it really busted in and makes
it look nice and natural so that is what
I'm doing and yes color is getting you
know spread into different areas but it
really doesn't matter I mean we're just
blending it in in circular motions you
could probably use the other side of
this brush as well it's really really
small but I find it a little I mean it's
nice to get into like smaller areas but
I just find it a little um stiff I
prefer the other end so I am just
blending this into circular motions
blending this in with circular motions
it's a little early in the morning guys
the keys me the keys me
alright alright once I have blended that
in I'm going to go ahead and put on my
concealer the one I am using is the
Maybelline master conceal this is by
face studio it is in the shade fair or
10 and I am just going to put this
underneath in my eye area and on it my
eye lid so let's go ahead and do that
I'm just tapping it in kind of going
down and then taking a little bit onto
my eyelids as well and then I'm going to
go in with my Real Techniques and sponge
it is damp and I am just going to blend
that into my skin and I like to use
these particular color correctors I like
to use them only underneath foundation
because I feel like they are quite
pigmented and they peek out if you put
them on over foundation so anyway the
foundation I'm going to be using or the
CC cream is the covergirl costal a CC
cream toned rehab foundation in 105
ivory and I'm just going to take one
pump of this onto the back of my hand
like that and then I'm going to dip into
my Real Techniques sponge again I'm just
going to apply this all over in my face
and I like this it really gives good
coverage even though it is a CC cream
but I wanted to use something a little
lighter so that you guys could see that
you know the colors do get covered
nicely without it being like oh my gosh
they're still color on your face
I'm just taking this all over my face so
on a one to ten scale I would rate these
particular pencils you guys know I've
tried a lot of color correctors in the
past like week month I would rate these
as being like my second favourite so far
I just think that they're so easy to use
and you literally can put them on and
like get out of the house in like five
minutes so if I want to color correct in
a hurry and I'm like want to get out the
door immediately I reached for these
ones just because I feel like they do
color correct the face and it's easy you
just paint them like onto your face
practically so I really really do like
that and then if you feel like there is
any other area that like you want to
cover a little more you can obviously go
in with another layer of the CC cream or
your foundation a foundation will give
more coverage than this CC cream I just
wanted to show you guys that it looks it
still looks relatively good with like a
BB cream or a CC cream you don't have to
have like a full coverage foundation to
actually cover
the actual color if that makes sense but
yeah I would recommend just applying the
color correctors underneath I feel like
when I go on top of the skin it starts
to peek through I know some other color
correctors are really nice and you can
put them on top of your foundation like
the Urban Decay ones but those are like
pastel like these are a little more
pigmented or a little darker in pigment
if that makes sense so I recommend using
them underneath your foundation so
overall I feel like I'm pretty well
color corrected now there may be a few
areas where it's like oh I kind of see a
few colors but I don't want to take on
the CC cream so what I'm going to do is
just go in with my tone correcting
powder and cool from ELF
it looks like this and I'm going to set
my face with the a cosmetic spooky
buffing brush and this will help even
out any other color that might still be
peeking through this is basically a
color correcting product in its own I
love this this is my holy grail setting
powder if you guys are looking for
something color correcting but you don't
want to get color correctors check out
these elf tone correcting powders they
have one in warm as well so if you have
a warmer undertone in your skin you may
prefer that one I have a cool undertone
so obviously I prefer this one this is a
new one so it's really really flying all
over the place
but anyway um so that is basically how I
apply it these Smashbox color correcting
Stix I think they're really nice they're
very blendable as long as you set them
with a powder they really lock in all
day and I feel like you can wear a CC
cream or a BB cream with them and they
won't peek through I just recommend like
I said going ahead and only applying
them underneath your BB cream or CC
cream or foundation because I think they
do peek through even if you're using
like a heavy duty like coverage
foundation like the glamoflage from hard
candy or even Kat Von D's locket like
I've tried it with the locket one and
they still show through so I don't know
that's just something to be aware of
sorry that's a liner that's anyway so
yeah I feel like everything is the color
corrected now and obviously I'm gonna go
put some color into my face now but let
me make sure everything looks good yeah
I feel like it color corrects without
being super super crazy I don't have to
wear like a heavy coverage foundation
with these
products like I said I am wearing a CC
cream and I just like the coverage that
that CC cream cream give it still is
really really nice but these are great
for on-the-go and also if you want to
wear them with a BB cream or a CC cream
I just recommend putting them underneath
that product not on top so I hope you
guys enjoyed this little demo on the new
Smashbox color correcting Stix if you
