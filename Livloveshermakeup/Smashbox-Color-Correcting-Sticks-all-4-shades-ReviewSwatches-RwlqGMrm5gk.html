thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day let me turn this a little
bit okay I am here to give you guys a
review on all four of the new Smashbox
color correcting six I'm also gonna
swatch them for you guys and tomorrow I
will be posting a demo on these products
if you are interested in seeing how I
applied them but these were $23 the
piece on the Sephora calm website hey
I'm going to link below where you guys
can pick these up if you are interested
it is not an affiliate or a referral
link it will just take you right to the
Sephora website so you can purchase one
of them speaking of the Sephora website
I'm going to go ahead and read a little
bit about what it says on there with
these products so that you can get a
better understanding of what they are
supposed to be so these are the Smashbox
color correcting Stix they are a vib
exclusive and also a support exclusive
they are $23 a piece and you get four
different shades to get peach orange
lavender and green so peach is supposed
to help you look less tired or interest
those two also help you look less tired
the lavender or purple shade is supposed
to be called don't be dull like to help
with dullness in your skin and then the
other one is called get less red which
is the green one to help correct redness
so these are a collection of buildable
creamy skin tone evening sticks to
transform your complexion it's as easily
achieved complexion perfection with
Smashbox collection of color correcting
Stix creamy Stix an array of shades to
target skin concerns minimize the
effects of a late night or reduce the
flush of rosacea with just a swipe of
these blendable shades the green one
instantly reduces redness lavender
brightens sallowness or yell mess in the
skin yellowness in the skin and the
peach and orange ones are perfect for
eliminating skin to conceal dark circles
and hyperpigmentation they are infused
with a moisturizing vitamin E complex to
blur the look of fine lines and pores
and they leave natural looking color
when applied with foundation and
concealer I personally like to use them
underneath foundation I feel like they
are visible when you apply them on top
of foundations don't just want to throw
that in there quickly but it says these
sticks can be applied wet or dry to
customize for sheer to medium or
buildable full coverage I agree with
that i have tried applying these with my
Beauty Blender and I feel like they're
really really sheared out if you apply
them with the pea
blender my personal favorite way to
apply these is with a really really
dense brush and kind of buff them into
the skin and again I will show that in
my demo tomorrow
but yeah so I'm really really excited
about these you guys and there's a
reason for that the reason I was so
excited with because last year Smashbox
released this step by step contouring
stick trio where you get a bronzer shade
a contour shade any highlighting shade
and I knew immediately when I saw the
packaging for these color correcting
sticks that this was going to be the
exact same formula as this and I love
this little contouring trio so it is the
exact same formula I'm so happy to let
you guys know they are so blendable and
pigmented and easy to use and absolutely
beautiful on the skin so let me show you
guys what the actual packaging looks
like they all come in these little Matt
boxes like this and the reason they're
so big is because at the bottom of each
little box you get a little prize now
I'm just kidding you get a sharpener
which is so so nice because these are
really really chubby kind of thick
sticks so it's really really hard to
actually find a sharpener that was
something I was concerned about I was
like how am I gonna find a sharpener to
fit those because you do have to sharpen
them they're not like the twisty ones
you have to sharpen them so I'm so happy
that Smashbox went ahead and included
sharpening like little sticks in there
or I mean the sharpener that made no
sense the sticks have a sharpener at the
bottom of the box and so happy that they
included that because I don't remember
them including that with this particular
trio and I had to find a huge-ass
sharpener for these guys so anyway that
is how they come in this little matte
box I think the packaging is really
really nice and sleek and they do come
wrapped in this beautiful black tissue
paper which i think is very very sexy
and luxurious so anyway this is what the
actual packaging looks like you don't
know tons and tons of products in here
but I feel like these are relatively
well priced compared to some of the
color correctors that have been
releasing lately so I just want to say
really quickly if you are someone who is
in a hurry if you want to carry a color
corrector with you in your purse I don't
know who would really do that but if you
want to these are gonna be the color
correctors for you these are by far the
easiest to use in my opinion out of all
the ones that I have tried and I have
tried a lot in the past month I feel
like the Beca ones you have to take your
finger in the steelo palette you have to
dip your finger in or a brush in
and the Urban Decay ones you have to use
the applicator with these it's so nice
because they are literally a pencil you
can just draw this right onto your face
exactly where you want them and they are
just amazing they're so fast and easy to
use so if you're someone who really
wants to do color correcting but you
want something super super fast and
super super blendable these are going to
be the ones for you I still think the
Urban Decay ones are my favorite but I
love these these are definitely coming
in at second place for me totally so
anyway let me go ahead and swatch them
and show you guys what they look like
and I'll tell you what and use them for
so the first shade is called peach it
looks like this and they have the color
at the end of the cap and then we set it
like this one is because it's almost
like a nudey peach color like it's not
completely completely peach toned as you
can probably see it kind of has like a
nude base so it's really really
beautiful the second one is the lavender
shade and the reason I use this is to
kind of brighten up any sort of fine
lines by the way the peach one I like to
use that on hyperpigmentation along my
jaw line where I have had hormonal acne
but the lavender shade I really like to
brighten up around my mouth I like to
brighten over up around any area that I
have like a fine line just because fine
lines and wrinkles are kind of deep set
and I feel like the lavender shade
pushes them up and kind of plumps them
up or give the appearance of plumped up
wrinkles so there is the lavender shade
right next to it sorry I'm a little
Raschi there and then we have the green
shade which is really really nice for
correcting redness I put this on any
area where I have um like redness around
my nose or if I have active breakouts so
this is what did that one looks like and
again you guys are just so buttery you
can apply them so easily there is the
green shade right there and as I can see
they're not super super dark kind of
like the back and ones I feel like the
back of ones are super super pigmented
but they're also not as light as the
urban decay once the urban decay ones
are like pastel like these these kind of
lie right in between I would say and
then this is the orange one and I like
to use this underneath my eyes to color
correct any sort of blue tones I may
have or dark circles so anyway that is
kind of what the tip looks like just you
guys can see it literally glides on like
butter I just want to show you that
quickly anyway I am absolutely loving
these you guys I think they wear really
really incredibly well I know they are
infused with vitamin E
I can kind of feel that because they do
glide onto the skin so beautifully so
what I like to do is just apply them
before I put my foundation on I
personally find that they do peek out if
you are wearing like a BB cream or a CC
cream they might peek through because
they are still somewhat pigmented I
personally don't like to put them on top
of my foundation because especially like
the orange one I feel like that does
peek through and also these really
really need to be set and I feel like
when I put my foundation on it kind of
sets them in a little more because they
do have that vitamin E oil in there they
can move around on your face so if you
have combination skin like me or even
oily skin you definitely want to set
these guys in but overall I think that
they are fantastic they wear an
incredibly long time I wore these all
day yesterday literally for 12 hours and
they wore very very well I didn't notice
any redness peeking through I will say I
do have an active breakout right here
and I have noticed that the green one
didn't completely cover that today but
overall I think that they are really
really good and if you are someone who
is on the go and you just want something
really really quick you want to carry
one in your purse I think that these are
going to be the ones that you want to
get out of all the color correctors that
have released I think these are just so
fast and easy to use like they are the
best packaging in my opinion they're
also very sleek and black and I feel
like you could travel with these like I
said you can toss them in your purse
they're just perfect for that kind of
purpose so overall I think they're
fantastic they wear a very long time I
like to wear them underneath my
foundation I will show you guys a demo
on how I apply them tomorrow I
personally like to use a really really
dense brush and just kind of buff them
in in circular motions you can blend
them in with your fingers as well they
are super super creamy and blendable and
I feel like if you want the fullest
coverage I would use a brush or your
fingers if you want sheer coverage you
can go ahead and use a damp with Beauty
Blender but overall they are absolutely
fantastic I'm definitely keeping all
four and very very happy with them and
out of all the color correctors I have
tried I would say these come in as
second place so I hope you guys enjoyed
