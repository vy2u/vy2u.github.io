thought I'd continue on the videos that
I was doing yesterday about swatches and
also just my favorite um like best of
products well technically you're
probably seen them today they were
filmed yesterday but I posted them a few
hours ago so I actually just got back
from the gym myself I'm all gross and
sweaty but I wanted to continue this fun
swatch eNOS so I picked these up a black
friday shopping these are the smashbox
lip enhancing glosses and i love these
guys i'm loving them they are just
beautiful oh my goodness i forgot one
and this is one of my favorites so let
me show you this watches those are the
swatches they're very very pigmented
very creamy not sticky at all this one
the pink one at the top is called pout
and the one below it is called Ruby um
the one below that that one is called
luster um that kind of like tan color
there I want to say it's like a looks a
little different in this watch this one
is called radiate and in the one at the
bottom which is one of my favorites I
love Barry colors is cold oh goodness
the words are all smooshed together
coerce I guess um so there are the
swatches and this was just with one draw
of the lip sponge so they do come like
this but they are so lovely you guys
they just give such a nice Sheen to your
lips and they definitely give color so I
love them these are great I'm really
really happy with this purchase I
believe this little kit was like 24 or
thirty dollars well worth it smashbox um
you know is a pretty expensive brand and
i know that their lip glosses do well i
have a fuser lip glosses yeah they're
usually around like fifteen twenty
dollars so it's definitely worth
that these holiday kits guys that are
going on you know Alta and sephora they
are worth it let me tell you so anyway I
just wanted to do those swatches and
tell you guys what I thought of them i'm
really happy with these I mean you
really have nothing bad to say so that's
kind of exciting anyway also you know I
got this little outfit this workout
outfit from the black friday sale and
I'm loving it also it's so comfy and so
cute and I feel like oh oh oh getting
stuck I just said it's not sticky and
then I get stuck it's really not as
Dickey you just know how it is a cloth
anyway so I'm where I'm I feel like I'm
wearing all my black friday stuff but um
these were great deal this workout off
it was a great deal and I was really
happy with a lot of the purchases i got
so i'm going to continue this little
review fast tonight and do some my other
best or favorite products and i'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
