in a different setting if you guys can
tell I'm visiting my boyfriend in
Wisconsin right now so I am in this
apartment so I'm sorry if there's a
change in lighting and all that kind of
stuff it's just different you know when
I'm traveling but I do have some reviews
coming at you guys today so let's just
get started the first one is going to be
on this new Smashbox mini palette I got
this for $39 on the ulta.com website I
believe this is sold exclusively at Ulta
right now I don't think you can get it
at Sephora and so basically what you get
in this kit is this little palette that
looks like this and you open it up and
you get eight eyeshadows and then you
get a highlighter a blush and a bronzer
you also get a full-size mascara the
Smashbox full exposure in jet black
full-sized really nice and then you get
a lipgloss in pink lady which is like a
deluxe size so I think for the price $39
it's really great to get all of those um
smashbox has wonderful wonderful
formulations when it comes to their
powder products i've never been really
disappointed um i find that they're just
so creamy and pigmented like the
eyeshadows are and also i just love that
you get a full-size mascara i think that
that's awesome you know for $39 this
probably runs for about eighteen to
twenty dollars normally so i think
that's really awesome you get a
full-size of that and of course a lip
gloss can never hurt a girl it's always
lovely to have and this is a really
really beautiful color as you guys can
see it's a really nice peachy color it's
really really nice everyday color i
think anybody can wear it so i think
this is like a really cool little kit to
have just because it's so on the go it's
so portable it's so easy like it's
really really nice and sleek compact
just awesome so like I said you guys get
eight eyeshadows which are really
beautiful let's see here you get two
mattes and the rest have shimmer in them
they're really really creamy and
pigmented I am wearing them as eyeshadow
today and I'm just really impressed I
think this is the photo-op
I want to say it's the photo-op formula
which is a really really beautiful
formula that Smashbox does and then over
here you get this nice matte bronzer a
nice matte blush and then you get this
kind of
of shimmery highlight color that looks
like that's kind of peachy not a huge
fan as you guys can see you get a lot of
kick up when you like brush your finger
in it or anytime you put a brush in it
so not a huge fan of that highlighter
for that reason also it's a little dark
if you are a little more fair it's gonna
look almost more like a peachy blush on
you but it is supposed to be a highlight
but I would say out of all of you know
this whole little palette area that eye
shadows really really are the standout
product the blush is universal
it's matte it's a nice dark peachy color
and then you got that nice matte bronzer
so that's wonderful to have and it does
have the names of everything on the back
so you know so lens is the yeah lens is
the highlight color duranium geranium
kind of flower I know it's a geranium
geranium I guess radio is the blush and
then Sun Tan is the bronzer and then you
have the eye shadows are vanilla cinder
nude rose ambient peacock sienna and
ultramarine so I love that they have
that on the back even though it is so
compact and small so I think this is
great for traveling and obviously I'm
traveling right now so I've been getting
a lot of use out of this um next let's
talk about the mascara I'm not super
impressed with the mascara by any means
it has eight like natural blondes like a
natural bristle wand I don't personally
love those kind of wands and mascaras I
find that rubber wands give me the best
volume and the nicest look to my lashes
I have I like kind of clumpy mascara I
don't know anybody else likes that but
this will give you really really natural
lashes I am wearing it today and I just
found like two this is two coats and it
just didn't do anything extravagant for
my lashes by any means so I mean I'm not
in love but I am happy that you do get a
nice full-size of that and then the last
thing is this lip gloss and I really
really love this lip gloss the
applicator is really interesting it's
flat unlike the side very thin and then
super flat on each side and I think the
color is just beautiful it's in pink
lady so let me read a few guys a little
bit of
what it says on the back of the box here
it says includes eight photo op
eyeshadows one highlighter one blush one
bronzer be legendary lip gloss and pink
lady and full exposure mascara
it says earthy neutrals cool shimmers
and lush lashes for eyes pair for the
eyes pair perfectly with soft pink lips
and blush bronzer highlight of her face
all in one take everywhere palette and
yeah I'm going to read a little bit now
on the Ulta websites and that didn't
give me too much information but let me
click over here so the Ulta website says
this is the mini box palette it is $39
says what it is it's a limited edition
set of Smashbox must-haves must-haves
for face lips and eyes it says why
you'll love it earthy neutrals cool
shimmers I already read that on the back
of the box you know lush lashes eyes
pairs perfectly with soft pink lips and
then it says it is a 128 dollar value
which is kind of cool it includes eight
photo op eyeshadows and then yeah it
basically just says so yeah there's not
not too much information actually on
this one
I feel like Sephora always gives more
information when I read from the website
but that's what it says about this one
so anyway um it is just what it is it's
just a really nice little set it's so
easy to travel with it's on the go and
some of smashbox best products so i hope
you guys enjoyed this review i will link
everything where you can pick it up
below and i'll see you in my next one
