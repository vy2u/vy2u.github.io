all bundled up today it is really really
cold here in New York so excuse all the
layers going on but today I wanted to do
some swatches and review for you guys on
the Smashbox on the rocks photo up eyes
shadow luxe palette it looks like this I
purchased mine on Ulta calm I love this
I love the packaging this has to be the
best packaging of the year it's like a
quilted like squishy thing on the top so
you know everything all the shadows are
in there really well it's not gonna
break like if you're flying or traveling
and the back like I just love all the
little diamonds and everything on it I
think that's so adorable it opens up
with a magnetic closure and my biggest
issue with this palette is the fact that
the names are on a piece of paper so
they're not actually on the palette let
me show you guys what the palette
actually looks like you get these nice
warm colors here some purpley pink
colors and then you get your Smokies
over here so it's like a really really
lovely palette but my issue like I said
is I don't like the little sheet with
all the names on it because what if I'm
doing a tutorial and I don't want to
keep the sheet you know what I mean it's
like I won't know what I'm going to eat
so I guess you know it will just be one
of those things that I'll just have to
be like take this color and this one
next to the little diamond in the middle
or whatever but anyway those are the
colors again like I said the pattern is
kind of like you get your Smokies here
some pinky Purple's here and then your
neutrals here and I love all the
sections in here I am wearing it on my
eyes today I'm wearing some of the smoky
colors a little bit of that grey some
pink and yeah that completes my look
today absolutely love this palette
everything is so pigmented by the way
this comes in as the Fox when you get it
this is like a lookbook and it actually
does list maybe this is what I'll keep
this list the actual colors so I think
I'll keep this instead of just a sheet
this will list all the colors marzipan
me das purple miss snow gypsy all of
them and actually uh numbers them too so
that's nice I think I'll keep this and
this actually shows different
looks you can do which is always nice to
have you can do a studio glow a smoky
sapphire and a very smoky eye so that's
kind of fun to have and like I said
today I'm wearing some of the smoky
colors on my eye I love them I love this
big mirror everything is just like so
good about this palette but the number
one thing that stuck out to me was that
when i swatched them like when I take a
swatch and the reason I don't have them
all over my arm for you guys is there's
like a bajillion colors in here and I
don't have enough arm space so I am
going to go ahead and swatch them with
you guys so I'll take a few of each
little shade category and swatch them
but my favorite thing about these is
that when I swatch them on and like my
finger they almost feel kind of rough
like it takes a little bit to build into
the actual color underneath like at the
softness you know like the actual
texture of the shadow but um what I love
is that oh my god on the eye these blend
seamlessly they're so pigmented they're
just amazing everything is wonderful so
yeah anyway um let me go ahead and
swatch a few of the warm colors I think
I'll do this one right here that one and
that one those are the colors beautiful
and let's swatch them gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous can you guys see that did I
just do really horrible swatching okay
wait let me try again
I can never figure out this watching
there we go you can kind of see those
beautiful beautiful beautiful um they're
like I said just so pigmented and like
creamy and once you kind of work away
it's like that top layer you know
sometimes you get an eye shadow palette
and like the shadows don't feel as good
as they do later like a month in when
you've like completely worked your way
into the palette that's kind of what
this palette is like and I think the
more you work into it the better so now
we're gonna go into the purpley blue
section I'm gonna take this one right
here it's purple and I think that one so
those are the colors and oh my goodness
that was the worst watch ever where's
what I like can't see on my it's crazy
it's tiny
two two tiny but you get some gorgeous
blues some nice like grey is just like
some pretty pretty stuff going on there
I love that wiping my fingers in between
to see you guys now and then I want to
show you guys some of the smokey section
which is actually one of my favorite
sections in this palette which is funny
because I'm not super into the grays and
like the blacks but have been with this
one so we're going to be going into this
section and we're going to take this one
right here let's take that one
everything is backwards on my camera
look like I can't see and then let's
also take the gray one so those I think
look like on my finger at let's go ahead
and swatch them one two people and them
so you guys can actually see them and
there so as you can see just some
gorgeous colors like these just swatch
so easily there's still tons left on my
fingers everything is just like soft and
creamy and beautiful and perfect
I just absolutely have been in love with
this palette I highly recommend it I
mean I'm I was like I don't know like
for some reason when I kind of like did
finger swatches the first couple times
when they hadn't been like dug into yet
I was like I don't think I'm gonna like
this I thought this would be better
quality come on Smashbox like step your
game up but I now just like love this
this is one of my favorite palettes to
work with lately so anyway those are the
colors this is the palette love it
highly recommend it beautiful
pigmentation all different kinds of
colors going on you got your warm family
you've got some pinks purples Smokies
everything you could want to send this
nice and very well nicely packaged
little palette so highly recommended I
hope you guys enjoyed this I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
