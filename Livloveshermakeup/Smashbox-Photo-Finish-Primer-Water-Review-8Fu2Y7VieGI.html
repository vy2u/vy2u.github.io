hope you guys are having a great morning
um I just wanted to come on here and do
a review for you guys on the new
Smashbox photo finish primer water I
purchased this for $32 on the
sephora.com website and I have really
really been enjoying this ad this is the
box that comes in and uh like I said it
was $32 on the Sephora website and it is
silicone free alcohol free and oil free
so it is basically a primer water so you
can use it three ways you can either use
it
mist it on your face before you put your
makeup on as a primer you can use it
after you apply all your makeup as a
setting like final uh you know just like
a setting mist or you can use it
throughout the day just to touch up your
skin and touch up your makeup make sure
nothing is getting too cakey I like to
use it in all three ways my all-time
favorite way to use it though is to use
it as a primer before putting on my
foundation um I have found that this
really really works it really does make
my makeup last all day and I do love
giving a final spritz also after I apply
on my makeup of course just to make sure
everything is all even and dewy and
beautiful so let me just read a few
things for you guys on the support
website about this product it says it is
a makeup primer spray that hydrates and
revitalizes the skin it gives the
benefits of priming hydration and sheer
radiance with this all-in-one photo
finish primer water free of silicone
alcohol and oil it's packed with
revitalizing electrolytes that work to
waken reawaken reawaken reawaken your
skin and restore moisture the enriched
water instantly absorbs into skin /
lasting hydration leaving skin looking
refreshed and ultra soft while it locks
in makeup what else you need to know
back in 2000 Smashbox founder and
photographer David Factor Davis factor
sorry developed our iconic photo finish
foundation primer to help makeup look
better and last longer on shoots fast
forward 15 years and a new icon is born
photo finish primer water it's
everything you love about the
original primer in the lightest purest
and most refreshing form imaginable from
the silky smooth texture of the original
to its super fine mist of this new water
the primer is perfect for all skin types
so they are basically claiming that this
photo finish primer water is the
equivalent of their photo finish primer
in water form so that's pretty cool I
really think that's awesome
obviously there are a lot of makeup
setting sprays on the market I have
quite a few myself I really love the
urban decay ones um but I find that this
one just gives that extra step because
it is not just claiming to lock in
makeup all day it can also be used as a
primer before you apply everything um
normally other makeup finisher sprays or
whatever you just spray them after
you're done with your makeup but this
one you can spray before after and
throughout the day so it's pretty cool
um and basically yeah that's all it says
on the website like I said it was $32
which is kind of expensive I like to
also use let's see the elf one is like
you know like five dollars and there you
can find basically makeup setting spray
at all different prices you can get the
alpha one you can get open decay which
is I think around $24 or you could spend
the extra $10 and get this Smashbox one
so basically I have just found that when
I apply this to my face before my
foundation and I just kind of lightly
spray it and mist it across my face let
it kind of set and then apply my
foundation it really really does work as
a primer I'm really really surprised I
kind of thought that was gimmicky at
first I did not think this would work as
well as it does but it really does I'm
really happy it's alcohol free oil free
and silicone free because look at so
much silicon free I really actually like
products that have silicone in them kind
of like that slip to the skin but
alcohol free is really really important
when it comes to makeup setting spray
because alcohol really really dries out
your skin so if you are taking a makeup
setting spray that has a lot of alcohol
in it which will help make it you know
sex throughout the day and really make
your makeup last but you will start to
get dried out pretty
quickly um let's see the urban decay
ones I'm pretty sure a filled with
alcohol I'm pretty sure because even the
one that I've been using currently which
is the which is it the moist one or
hydration one even tends to dry out my
skin out a little bit so that's
something to be careful of if you do
have dry skin just you know be careful
try and avoid a makeup setting spray or
a primer that has alcohol in it so this
would be a very good thing for you
anyway so like I just showed you like
they have a very very ultra fine mist I
mean it is so ultrafine this is one of
my favorites because the spray bottle
like the actual nozzle and things like
that are just right you do not get any
kind of splatters all over your face
there's nothing worse than taking out a
like a spray and spraying it on your
face and then just being big lots of
water like on your cheeks or your
forehead or things like that that is not
attractive nobody likes that it's not
comfortable so I'm really really happy
that this one just has that perfect
amount of like it's just perfect the way
it like just it gives just the perfect
amount on the face and it feels so good
I'm probably wasting so much product
here but it feels really good um it does
have a bit of a scent um I would kind of
describe it as almost like a tad spicy
that might sound weird but it's probably
because it has um you know like vitamins
and nutrients in it so it's not like
you're smelling something that's bad for
your skin because it really is free of
all that kind of crappy stuff for your
skin it's probably something natural but
it just doesn't smell as good as say
like the elf makeup settings but I think
that smells really good it smells kind
of like aloe or something it's a little
weird it's a little weird but um it's
not something that stays on your face
after you apply it so not not a not a
deal-breaker in my opinion but overall
I'm really really happy with this I
thought I'd share with you guys because
I really did not have high expectations
for this product I did not think I was
gonna like it as much as I do I think
it's awesome because it's not just a
makeup setting spray I was think
oh my god $32 for makeup setting spray
seriously
the prices just keep going up there but
this really is a three-in-one product
and it can be used before you put your
makeup on which i think is awesome so
I'm really really loving this I'm super
super happy with it I will continue to
use it yes like I said $32 is really a
lot but I could see myself repurchasing
this once I've run out so hopefully it
will last a long time
I'm just I'm really just super happy
with everything I even think the
packaging is cuter than the Urban Decay
one just because it's like see-through
and I don't know the Urban Decay ones
are like white and kind of uh they're
kind of bulky with the lids and things
like that it just seems like they took
up a lot of packaging space when they
didn't need to but this one's just
really great I'm really really happy and
I highly recommend um go ahead go to
your Sephora try it out on your skin
just like take it and kind of mist it
over your face see if you like the you
know the feel of it there really is not
like it doesn't feel heavy there's
really no texture to it but again some
people have to get used to using primer
waters or setting spray because it does
feel different on the skin depending on
which one you use which brands but um I
highly recommend I think this is awesome
I will link below where I found it and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this review
of the Smashbox photo finish primer
water and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
