to jump on here really quickly and let
you guys know I will be coming back to
my channel sometime this a week and
maybe tomorrow or the next day but
usually when I have been gone for
multiple days in row you probably know
what it is if you're you know a longtime
viewer of my channel it means I have
gone into a lupus flare up which is what
has happened
I did have scalp surgery about two weeks
ago um related to lupus Anna he has been
a lot more difficult to recover from the
scalp surgery than I thought it was
going to be um you know my hair kind of
looks like a mess right now I've just
been sleeping a lot and you know that's
basically what I do the whole time when
I do what I am in a flare-up is to sleep
a lot but um yeah this has been a longer
recovery process than I thought it would
have been I have gotten my sutures out
and one row of stitches that I still
have another row of stitches they need
to be taken care of and it's been very
painful I've been having a very hard
time sleeping if you didn't know it's in
the back of my head and I know if you
you're asking me if I would show you
guys the stitches and stuff I'm just not
comfortable with that so I'm not gonna
be doing that but yeah I I basically
have another row stitches in the back of
my head and it's just been very very
painful to lay my head down at night
I've been very low on sleep and you know
I've just been trying my best to make up
on sleep and all that kind of stuff so I
just wanted to let you guys know I'm
doing okay I'm sorry I haven't checked
in on snapchat I really just haven't had
time I've been exhausted and this is
unfortunately what happens with my
channel is I am so consistent and then
the second I get sick I just fall off
the face of the earth and I think that's
one of the downfalls of my channel is
just the fact that I am someone who does
have health related problems Anna you
will have to deal with those kind of
little bouts with me being there and
then also me just not being there so if
you're ever wondering where I've been
what's going on usually I do try and
keep you guys updated on Instagram
that's what's easiest for me personally
but I am on the tail end of this lupus
flare right now and I'm just kind of
wrapping things up my rash is completely
gone which is great it completely
diminished in the past 24 hours I've
been feeling a lot better and I've been
getting up and moving around but I'll
probably take the day off again tomorrow
from work but yeah I just want to let
you guys know that's what's going on
this what always happens and I know it's
probably very repetitive with me to make
these quick little short videos films on
my you know computer just saying I'm
coming back
I'm coming back it's just that you know
when I'd get new people they're like
what the hell is going on you seem like
you're so consistent on YouTube and then
you just fall off the face of the earth
so it's always related to health related
stuff and yeah unfortunately I'm just am
one of those people that does have
health related issues and health related
stuff comes with the worst time then you
know you just gotta make sure you focus
on yourself before you can get back on
and do other things and do your hobbies
and all that kind of stuff and I've been
out of my professional work setting for
quite a while now too about I would say
about a week and a half so it's been it
hasn't been that great either it's not
technically like out of the work setting
for a whole week and a half but I've
been taking half days off so I've been
going to work than taking like half days
and I probably shouldn't have even gone
to work last week in the first place
because I had gotten scalp surgery and I
think that's kind of what put me over
the limit but I'm guessing what happened
this time of the flare-up was just that
I had the surgery and it put my immune
system down really low I continued to
post on here I continued to push myself
and go to work and it was just too much
for my body and I couldn't handle it so
that's kind of what is going on I just
wanted to update you guys I have a ton
of new videos coming up I always hate
hated what I go into lupus flare up you
guys because I mean I don't even want to
sound cocky when I say this but I have
hundreds hundreds of video ideas that I
want to get to you that I have written
down I want to do my anti house I want
to do all those kind of stuff and it
just makes it so difficult when I do go
into a flare-up because I can't get to
these videos and I'm such a scheduler
you guys I love to schedule I like
to write things down I like to have my
little agendas going so it makes it very
difficult when I have to start to make
up for certain videos but that's what's
gonna have to happen I know tomorrow I
had planned for an antic haul I don't
know if I'll be on YouTube tomorrow I
don't know if I'm gonna feel good enough
to be back I'm gonna take like I said
probably one more day off but I'm
guessing my next video will probably be
something easy like an empties video and
then we'll just get back into the swing
of things so thank you so much to
everybody who is sending me love and
yeah you know it's just lupus and it is
what it is it's it's difficult and I
wanted to touch on something really
quick as well I know some people have
been saying lately I've been seeming a
little negative about my health about
health related things and I just wanted
to say that's what it's like when you do
struggle with an autoimmune to see
something that's with you in your life
all the
time excuse me you get a little
emotional about it but um you know it is
sometimes hard not to be not to be
negative about these kind of things so
I'm really sorry if any of you have
thought that I've been feeling a little
negative recently in the past couple of
weeks I can assure you it's because of
health related things that has nothing
else to do with anything that is going
on in my life but yeah it's rough it's
rough when you do have some health
related problems and I try not to
sugarcoat it and excuse me I'm sorry uh
when I did after I got my surgery I was
feeling really really good I would say
the first two or three days and I think
that I should have just spent a little
more smart to probably take in a couple
of days to rest instead of jumping back
on to film and doing all that kind of
stuff so I really appreciate you guys I
appreciate when you guys get on me and
you're like hey you need to slow down
you need to just kind of take it easy
I'm definitely a workaholic when it
comes to my youtube channel and I'm a
workaholic when it comes to my
professional life that's just who I am I
like to keep going
I get bored very easily I don't like
sitting around doing nothing it's
totally not my style so of course I'm
always gonna want to be pushing myself
that I appreciate when you guys are like
hey take a step back the last time I
posted on snapchat I was saying I'm
exhausted you guys I'm exhausted I had
17 people write to me and they were
gonna they were saying you know I think
you're going into a lupus flare up and
you were completely right so I always
appreciate when you guys are you know
even though it's kind of a hard pill to
swallow I do appreciate when you guys
are telling me you know just take it
easy slow down things like that so yeah
that's pretty much it I just wanted to
UM pun here a quick little update again
I know that I do these a lot but it's
mostly just for new subscribers who are
like where the has she gone and
yeah haven't been on snapchat haven't
been answering snaps so please don't
think I'm ignoring you I just have not
had time and yeah I will be back when
I'm back which will probably be within
the next couple of days so thank you so
much for joining me guys and I will see
you in my next one
