today I am creating my very own
 tag video this is the
spill the tea tag I hope that some
people will do this I will tag certain
people down below but feel free to go
ahead and make a video on this if you
would also like to do this tag let's go
ahead and jump right into it
the first video that I was really really
scared to post was definitely my
consistent versus unreliable makeup
brands video part 1
I had a few brands in that video that
actually ended up coming and attacking
me and I was worried that that was going
to happen with that particular video at
one point that video was taken down it
was removed and then it went back up
because I fought for it and I said
it I didn't do anything wrong here okay
so I'm gonna go ahead and say that was
the first video that I definitely was
scared at to post and why I was scared
to posted because I knew brands will
come after me
everybody's opinions do change and I
recently watched a video from a lass and
she was talking about how you know she
has strong opinions on things and she
mentioned that two-face ended up sending
her some PR and of course you know you
get these naysayers in the comment
section that are like oh but you've
roasted to face before you can't have PR
from them or oh you've done this before
you can't have PR from them you know I
roast the out of tart and to face
what I accept PR from them at this point
absolutely not because there's other
stuff that has gone on behind the scenes
however does it mean that you are
Schilling and doesn't mean that you are
selling out if for some reason a brand
that you mentioned in a video before
comes and says hey we love to send you
some PR absolutely no it doesn't however
your opinions are out there on the
internet and what you say is what people
are going to believe and you should be
honest I'm always brutally honest on
this channel and I'm not sitting here
saying I'm the best beauty youtuber
there are so many people that do not
like my channel there are things about
my channel that I personally don't like
there are things about my channel that I
know I could change that would bring in
more people I know that if I stop
talking so much stop talking so
much smack I could have more
opportunities but I choose not to do
that because although sometimes opinions
change about products my opinions are
very firm on certain stances so I have
not found it difficult the larger I've
gotten you know to stay true to myself I
still don't use affiliate codes I always
told you guys I probably wouldn't I
still have never done a sponsored video
it's it hard to turn down three thousand
five thousand dollars yeah that can pay
your rent
it's absolutely hard to turn it down
there is a reason why you choose not to
do sponsored content there's a reason
why you choose not to do affiliate codes
you guys wanna know why I don't use
affiliate codes cuz I'm sick of
opening up a description bar and seen a
ton a ton of little stars and clicks and
links all over the place some people are
really into it for me I know where I
want to shop I know where I want to go
if it's a friend of mine sure maybe I'll
click on that affiliate link but for me
I don't like a messy description bar I
already have enough information
in my description bar that's why I don't
want to use affiliate links because I
find them annoying to look at as far as
sponsored content
concerned I don't personally believe
that I should be doing sponsored content
I'm much too opinionated to be able to
take a script from a brand and read it
off and say okay guys so here's this
product you know mention it three to six
times even if they are offering a large
amount of money it would come off as
phony people would call me a sellout and
I would consider myself a sellout when I
first started my channel I was
absolutely not true to myself I was
trying so hard to be something that I
wasn't but recently I have been very
true to myself and I feel as if my
opinions and my stances have been strong
and I have stuck to them
we an interesting one especially if
people are going to do this tag because
I think the first instinct is to always
go ahead and delete I like a lot of
other beauty channels currently have a
channel moderator I'm not gonna sit here
and Talia Oh some of these comments
don't hurt my feelings you want to know
the words that I have blocked gasping
anything that has to do with talking
fast all of that blocked because it does
hurt my feelings and there is this big
battle between do you go ahead and you
fix yourself so that you can fit into
this perfect little ball that people
want or do you just keep doing your own
thing and you just kind of it and
say whatever this is my channel this is
what we're doing and this is how it's
happening if someone comes in and says
hey Liv lately I feel like you've been
very very negative I had a comment like
that the other day on my video I thought
I responded well did I respond amazing
and say I will take all of that
criticism all of that advice that you
just gave me and I'm gonna change myself
no I didn't because you have to
understand why you're on YouTube what
are the reasons you're on YouTube and
what do people like you for and what do
you like yourself for I mean I'm very
outspoken and out there I do have a
channel moderator there are things that
absolutely 100% hurt my feelings
I'm okay with saying that but I yeah if
somebody calls me a piece of I
usually call them a piece of back
personally right now I feel like my
channel is in I feel as if it's in limbo
and he can't just sit there and say I'm
not gonna look at my subscriber crown
I'm not gonna look at my view count all
of us tend to be fixated on these things
especially when it comes to YouTube you
will see that certain videos get more
views the video I posted the other day
talking about cruelty-free shopping at
Sephora I was crying and tearing up
after filming that video I felt very
passionate in that video and it got six
thousand meals and I'm thinking oh my
god that's horrible
but then you have to go back and think
well it's not all about YouTube rules so
there is this rule of thumb that you
want to get 10% of views within the
first 24 hours on your videos so say you
have 7,500 subscribers like me you want
to hit 7,500 viewers that video didn't
hit that view count and I thought oh my
god oh my god and then I realized why
are you feeling that way it's because I
do tend to hyper focus on my channel I
think all of us do I do tend to
sometimes go and compare myself to other
channels but I try my best to stay in my
own lane I think if everybody stays in
their own lane and does their own thing
and it's not constant repetition across
the beauty community there is going to
be a room for so many people's and right
now I'm posting three times a week I
really want to get back to the midweek
mysteries as well as the miscellaneous
mondays I feel like that was a huge push
out for me and yest and I lose
subscribers absolutely go over to social
Blake go check that I lost
subscribers I lost subscribers I lost
subscribers well you will see that some
people like a certain kind of content
from you and that's also another
decision on whether you want to follow
through with that sort of content what's
your most popular or whether you want to
talk about whatever you want to talk
about and for me I feel as if I'm just
kind of in this limbo area right now
because I want to add more substance to
this channel and it was hard for me at
first I really wanted to have all
separate channels to make everybody
happy but then I realized bucket I just
want to post what I want to post I
definitely have lost some inspiration in
the past couple of months and when I say
inspiration I don't mean video ideas or
this or that
homegirl homegirl have tons of video
ideas you guys know this about me I have
a lot of stuff a lot of things I want to
go through but that's not just what
YouTube is about a lot of people say I
want to film every day but I don't have
all the video ideas well some people
struggle with how do I put this video
out there how do I make it so that I'm
also happy on my channel and how do I
make it so that this feels worthwhile to
make people find me to be very very
aggressive and very hyper focus on
certain subjects and certain things and
I like to think I'm just a passionate
person if I'm into something I am 110
percent there you're never gonna get
this you're always gonna get this or
this I am an extremist all the way this
is definitely a good thing it's also not
such a good thing and I struggle with
finding balance when it comes to my
channel sometimes I feel I want to post
all these controversial videos but then
I think I have to put buffer videos in
between the buffered videos you
should just post what you got damn wanna
post I think a lot of youtubers get to
the point where they start to not give a
 and it's not that I don't give a
 I'm not there yet when I get to the
I don't give a sort of feeling I
will probably quit my channel because
that means that I'm not enjoying this
anymore what I have noticed is that I
have to do what's best for me I have to
do what makes me the happiest and that's
how I'm feeling about my channel so
anyway guys that as these fill the tea
tag I hope you enjoyed it I hope you'll
do this tag video thanks so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys later
