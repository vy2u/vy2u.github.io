are talking about luxury products that I
am pre-screening for my declutter series
in October I am breathing everything
into a splurge or purge category and
then I'm going to tell you what I will
get rid of in October what I will keep
but not repurchase and also what I do
think is worth the splurge or worth the
hype now I am talking about the really
really pricey stuff I'm not talking
about like hourglass and Marc Jacobs I
do know that those could be considered
luxury to some people I feel like those
brands are still on the very very tippy
top high point of high-end
the brands that I'm talking about here
are like you know expensive perfume
brands YSL do your stuff like that this
is very very luxury stuff to me
personally so I don't have too much of
it which is really really good but I
just want to be able to look back on
this video when I do start my declutter
series to remind myself of what I'm
really into and what I'm not into you
because I feel like the more you spend
on a product the more likely you are to
want to hold on to it so I don't want
that to happen because if I don't like
it I should just go ahead and get rid of
it so I will give you guys a little mini
like review on each item and then I'm
gonna let you know why it's going into
the pile it's going into you so I hope
you find this helpful let's get started
alright so first we are gonna start with
the splurge pile that is what I will
splurge on and what I will buy more of
so right off the bat let's see here yes
YSL Philip tinting oil my all-time
favorite lip product I only have this
one shade which is cherry my Shaklee
definitely will spend a bajillion
dollars for this like honestly is the
best the best lip product ever and I do
plan on going ahead and purchasing every
single shade after I do at my declutter
series because I am gonna be ganging up
rid of a lot of lip products alright the
next item is definitely my Versace a
bright crystal perfume this has quickly
become my signature perfume it used to
be Victor and Ralph's flower bomb we'll
talk about that in a second because I
have a pretty pretty good blue over
where that's going
but yeah Versace bright crystal this has
become my signature scent I love it it's
a beautiful beautiful fresh scent and
you know like half an ounce it's like
$90 I think I need to get the bigger one
next time but it's beautiful worth the
splurge in my opinion so that's in the
splurge pile as well obviously my Dior
glowing gardens
glowing pink highlighter this is limited
edition but I heard they they bring it
back for the holidays along with the
nude one I will have to get the nude one
and also they did release another one
for fall 2016 that I want to get my
hands on but yeah beautiful definitely
worth the money and what else I guess
probably this last item this is the
Burberry ODA perfume for women now I got
this tiny little thing on HauteLook and
whole look is so weird because the
picture looks like it was like the
biggest size and it was the tiniest one
for like $42 so if you want to get the
biggest size of this it's usually around
like $120 but it's a beautiful scent
very sophisticated I feel like a woman
when I wear this so I really enjoy that
so that is definitely the little splurge
pile over there those are items that I
definitely definitely will put the money
into to go ahead and purchase more of
all right now let's talk about hmm
products that I will keep but I don't
want to I'll keep them for now but I
would not be purchased them once they're
empty so the first is I hate saying this
but I think my flower bomb perfume I'm
starting to get really sick of this
scent I also have the flower bomb soap
right here I'll get into that in a
minute but anyway I'm the flower bomb
perfume I just feel like this is a
little too powdery for me right now I
feel like I don't know my taste has
changed and I'm just not really into
this this used to be my signature
perfume but now I'm really into the
Versace so I think once I finish this I
will not repurchase right away or maybe
ever but this I definitely will not
repurchase this is the victor involve a
flower bomb soap but this is like I
think 39 no wait 29 29 $35 oh god it's
ridiculous you guys like who buys a bar
of soap for that much well apparently I
do I went onto the Sephora website and I
was like I need it I need it it's all
dirty because it was in the guest
bathroom but anyway this is just a bar
of soap you guys it's nothing special
actually it's quite slimy it feels weird
on the skin I would totally put it in
the shit's pile and say bye bye but it's
a soap I feel like I can't declutter
this like give it to someone so I am
going to continue to use it it is in the
guest bathroom so it's not us that's
using it you know it's our guest but
anyway I
feel like it really smells that similar
to the flower bomb perfume but again
that like weird like I don't know a
powdery undertone is starting to
bothering me and like those two cents
anyway I don't know I'm staying staying
away from those so I don't think I will
repurchase after I go through those and
let's see here the YSL - she clawed
primer I love this this is a beautiful
perfect gorgeous primer but honestly I
feel like this can't be duped very
easily at the drugstore or by pretty
much any sort of DeMatha cone or
silicone primer so I don't think it's
worth it to go and you know pay a really
really high price for this when the
maybelline instant pore eraser one or
whatever it's called is obviously a
fraction of the price and it works just
as well so I won't repurchase that once
I go through it and also the YSL
definitely I love this is the pop water
glossy stain in dewy red 2:01 I love
everything about this except for the
fact that it just goes on streaky
it's tricky it's a streaky formulation
but it's beautiful it smells good I have
an amazing dough for an applicator I
love the shade I love the packaging
I love YSL lip products but you guys I
might as well just go ahead and purchase
all of the Vil up tin tin oils and just
leave this out because honestly I always
notice it I always notice it right away
I'm like oh my god look it's patchy on
my lips again so it's just not worth it
once I use this up I will not repurchase
alright and then now let's talk about
the stuff that I'm definitely getting
rid of these will be going to my friend
Rochelle the first item is this coach
perfume I don't know if she'll like this
but this smells kind of similar to the
Victor and well Flowerbomb which is
probably why I'm sick of it and I just
don't want to have it anymore um I
really do like these coach perfumes I
have all of the ones that have the
little flowers on them I think they're
just called the poppies or whatever it's
called looks like the collection but
yeah I don't know this is the freesia
freixa blossom and it's starting to
really annoy me I don't like this any
more so that's gotta go also the V's art
palette or the visor palette I talked
about this tried to return this it was
too late they wouldn't let me this is an
$80 eyeshadow palette that is the most
I've ever spent on an eyeshadow palette
and look at this shitty-ass packaging
like sorry but plastic seriously this
isn't cool
maths beautiful colors very very
pigmented but I'm sorry like unless you
are a professional makeup artist or if
you like to put a little more time into
your makeup I could see this working for
you but I am NOT that Panna girl I
really I'm like a one-and-done kind of
girl so this was just too hard to work
with too hard to blend I feel like my
friend Rochelle is a little more patient
when it comes to like putting her makeup
on than I am so I think that she will
hopefully enjoy this if she doesn't then
she can go ahead and sell it or whatever
but yeah I just met I don't like that
and then I'm also going to pass on at
this little Dior Addict lipstick in five
seven eight to her it has super cute
packaging it's a nice kind of pinky
moppy color but I mean how many pinky
moms can't a girl have right so anyway
those are some of my luxury items I feel
like I probably have more in my
collection if I dig around that I just
want to have a little bit of a viewpoint
for when I go into my declutter series
when I come across these items and I'm
like oh holy like this is so
expensive like this is like a ninety
five dollar perfume I don't want to get
rid of that I have to remind myself but
you don't like the scent get rid of it
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
