my channel today's video is going to be
a splurge or purge this is my version of
it will i buy it video if you guys have
never seen the original creator of the
will i buy it series it is my friend
Samantha March here on YouTube as always
I like to go ahead and throw her series
up in the cards so you guys can check
out either her latest will I buy a video
which she posts every single Wednesday
or her whole entire playlist I have been
getting a ton of requests to start doing
these on a weekly basis and as much as I
love and the overall concept of will i
buy it videos I'm still an anti hot girl
you guys like I am going to be doing
more so anti hauls and splurge or purge
videos I know that this is a very very
popular video topic right now but I
don't always just go with what's popular
I like to do different stuff on my
channel so I promise to do one of these
videos every single month as well as an
anti haul every single month starting in
July but without further ado let's go
ahead and talk about some new beauty
products that are out on the market and
I will let you know if I'm gonna fucking
buy them or not
alright colour-pop is getting my pussy
wet with this latest release this is a
no filter foundation it is $12 for 0.85
ounces and there are 42 different
fucking shades to choose from they also
have two new loose powders I'm sorry
three new loose powders that are nine
dollars each
you also have a blotting powder in six
different shades which are nine dollars
each and two foundation brushes you have
the x16 which will be nine dollars as
well as the f17 which is eight dollars
and this is already out hell yeah by men
I'm not quite sure on the powders I
definitely don't need like a blotting
powder for my sad sad dry dry fucking
skin but those loose powders do look
interesting they have sort of a banana
shade a deeper shade in them a lighter
shade so I might pick up the later show
you to do a little bit of baking or even
I've really really been enjoying a
setting in my whole entire face with a
damp sponge any loose powder recently
but hell yes to the foundation good on
you color pop it is amazing I love 42
different shades for $12 a piece I think
that's absolutely fantastic so yes I
will be going ahead and picking up this
foundation moving right into a new
palette here from violet Boss this is
actually from their new summer
collection and it is called the Flamingo
collection now when I saw the outer
packaging I was like I'm not into that
and then they released a picture of
swatches of the eyeshadow palette
and then swatches of the face palette
now I can tell you right away I am NOT
interested whatsoever in the face
palette I am sort of a hit-and-miss sort
of love-hate relationship with violet
vos face products I feel like they're
highlighters as well as their blushes
tend to have this really really thick
Tim epic own sort of texture kind of
similar to their really really foiled
eyeshadows and sometimes I can just
emphasize a lot of texture on the skin
especially if you are dry so I am
passing on the face palette although I
do think the shade selection is
beautiful you have a really really hot
red blush and then you have more of a
neutral blush you have it really really
pearlescent slight highlight as well as
two different kind of golden shades and
then you do have a deep bronzer I think
that's gonna work for a lot of different
complexions good on you but I will say
the violet boss eyeshadow called the
Flamingo palette is getting me excited I
have to get this I have to get this I
know it is a little expensive people
Minko eyeshadow palette will retail for
$45 and I set it over and over and over
again a lot of violet boss eyes shadow
palettes do look similar and they are on
the pricey side but this is completely
different than anything I feel like
they've ever done and they tend to
overlap a lot of different shades and
the majority of the finishes in here
appear to be pretty foiled but I love
that really really thick Dometic home
feel as far as eyeshadows are concerned
so this is something I'm willing to work
with I want to scoop up I definitely am
going to get it like I said the face
palette is also $45 which I feel like
it's a little pricey I think they could
lower that down to about thirty or
thirty two dollars and that would be
more so worth the price but they do have
a good eye shadow formula and if this
formula is anything similar to their
latest a ride-or-die palette it's gonna
be fucking brilliant so very very cool
color selection I'm in I'm picking it up
let's move on to I keep thinking this is
dose of colors it is the dominique
cosmetics lemonade palette i feel like a
lot of brands have been doing the
lemonade thing recently is it Maybelline
or L'Oreal that recently released a
bunch of like peach scented and lemonade
scented products or something like that
I feel like it's kind of popular right
now to do some sort of a scented palette
or lemonade themed palette now honestly
when I look at this I get similar vibes
to the violet vos palette and I know a
lot of people were saying that recently
a jeffree star released his summer
collection or he will be and also like
lunar Beauty all these palettes look
kind of similar but if there is a brand
that I am most comfortable with
purchasing it would be viola vos over
any of those
when I look at the viola bas palette
versus the lemonade palette I feel like
the lemonade has more I can see where
she was going with it and I have to say
I'm very very impressed with how
Dominique has been putting together her
palettes I like the color selections and
I like that there's neutral tones
there's a brow bone shade you always
have a transition as well as a nice deep
definer shade but I feel like those LEDs
that are more of a shimmery finish are
really just gonna be lid shades for me I
can't work that shit into my crease and
make it show up especially like that
like minty green color the pink one I'm
just not quite sure about I look at this
and I think it's the more muted version
of the violet Voss palette I would much
rather happy violet boss because I feel
like those are a little more poppy sort
of shades and I know that I could pop
those on my eyelid and it's gonna be
really really wet BAM in your face so I
will be passing on this she also is
releasing four different glosses and the
glosses look pretty darn neutral you
have a light pink as well as sort of
like a hot coral you have a deep kind of
I don't even know that's kind of like a
caramel color gives me more fall vibes
and then you do have like a mid-tone
kind of terracotta they look very pretty
I'm not really that into glosses i love
the marc jacobs glosses i love and the
buxom glosses i have enough glasses in
my collection for now so definitely
passing on both of those stroke elephant
is releasing something that's really
exciting this is called the deep bronze
i anti-pollution sunshine serum it said
four it just got back from somewhere
glow that flatters every single
complexion and that's an interesting
that's an interesting thing to say we
will see about that it says it is like
sunshine in a bottle without the
damaging effects the ingredients include
Omega rich of Virgin marula and black
currant seed oils along with vitamin F
which you don't care very often which is
a fatty acid um it says it replenishes
the delicate balance that supports a
healthy barrier function of the skin
protective antioxidants boost the skin's
defense against pollution and
environmental stressors so let me just
tell you what I'm so excited about I
think this looks really really it nice
and bronzy and recently I have been
using loving tan I'm actually completely
pale right now I'm going to be tanning
tonight so I scrubbed my whole body down
last night I have absolute
no tan on so this is just the Arizona
tan here I'm pretty fat as you guys know
but I think this is really cool because
normally I see these sort of instant
self tanners or overnight self tanners
that are like a very very thick heavy
cream and they personally make me break
out I'm interested in trying out that
Charlotte Tilbury overnight mask that
has like a built in self-tanner I've
heard very good things about that but
what I like about this is this a serum I
feel like that's gonna sink in instantly
and when I do use a loving tan in the
darker shade which is like a deep dark
mousse
I feel like that's going to blend it
nicely with it now it does appear to
have quite a bit of shimmer to it and
this may be something that I'm just not
into if it is something I'm really not
into I will go ahead and return it but I
do want to try this out I think it would
be cool
DRO Kelvin is a great brand I feel like
they have some really really awesome
skin care products so I am interested in
it now it does they down here how do you
use it so I thought I'd read this off
cause why the fuck not it says at a pump
of deep bronze like to any drunk
elephant serum oil or moisturizer so
obviously it doesn't have to be anything
from drunk elephant you could just add
it into any oil or moisturizer that you
have and look at you a gorgeous glow and
a potent dose of protective antioxidants
marula oil in there like I said at some
vitamin F which is a fatty acid I just
feel like it's gonna be good it's gonna
look good on my skin it's gonna be good
for my sad dry skin but also it's going
to protect my skin so I'm interested I
want it and finally guys we have a
pallet here that is going to be a dupe
aboard the I see the bench pallet from
Tarte cosmetics obviously that was a
April Fool's Day joke that went wrong
completely fucking wrong now I have to
say I'm really not interested in this
and it's only because of the brand that
it's coming from this is from face candy
now I think I told you guys and I think
I showed you guys any living life vlog
that I'll go ahead and throw above I did
get sent a bunch of products from hush
so the hush app does sell face candy as
well as bad habits and all these
different brands you know j-cap Beauty
all that kind of stuff and I ended up
getting a lot of pallets and I tried out
some really really good face candy
palettes that are for the face literally
face candy from a baby
and then I tried out some of their
eyeshadow palettes I have not been
impressed with their eyeshadow palettes
a happy Sahara as well as the it's
supposed to be like the naughty/nice
palettes from Kylie cosmetics like a
dupe for that the Sahara isn't as bad
I'm not quite sure if I'm going to
declutter that but I
these are very silky they're very very
pigmented when you swatch them but they
swatch better than they apply to the
eyes which usually it is the other way
around when it comes to eyeshadow
palette so I'm already having a little
bit of a hard time although I love the
color selection and I think it's
absolutely fabulous and there should it
be a palette like this on the market I
am worried about purchasing this one
even though it is only fucking you know
$40 I don't think I'm gonna get enough
use out of this I would rather maybe put
together my own icy batch palette which
a lot of people have been doing so I
will be passing on that you guys I just
don't feel sturdy enough about face
candy as a brand I think they have some
really really good knockoff what is it
like glow kit dupes I think they're
highlighters are fucking fantastic
really really good quality but their
eyes shadow palettes just aren't there
for me so anyway that is it I hope you
guys enjoyed this will I buy a video
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
