my channel today I am sharing with you
guys another splurge or purge video on
some new eyeshadow palettes that are
releasing now some of these are holiday
2017 some of them are just fall 2017
releases and this is basically a mini
series that I put together after being
incredibly inspired by my friend
Samantha marches will i buy it series
she is the creator of this series and
basically what she does is she will
introduce four or five new beauty
products every single week every single
Wednesday and she walks through and
talks about if she will buy it or not so
that's kind of how this concept is
splurge or a purge it's kind of like a
combination of a wish list as well as an
anti haul so let's go ahead and jump
right into it guys I would like to start
with two new pallets here from
colour-pop
and that will be launching on october 26
at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the
colour-pop comm website the first one is
called the you had me at hello palette
now I'm in a certain in photo with the
both of them next to each other so the
you had me at hello is the more neutral
one without the pink shadow and then the
element of surprise palette is the one
with the pink shadow and now like I said
both of these will be available on
October 26 I would definitely definitely
recommend jumping on it right away
because these palettes do sell out very
quickly
however color pop is very nice and they
do restock quite frequently and now both
of these palettes are going to include a
mirror which I think it's amazing
because all of their eyeshadow palettes
usually just come in this kind of cheap
cardboard packaging I don't really mind
it because actually these are very very
compact and travel friendly but none of
them do have a mirror now if this is the
last eye shadow palette that they did
release called the I think I love you
and because I got this one I feel like
I'm good I feel like I'm good I don't
need these two palettes on the element
of surprise palette I feel like the only
shade in there that's really catching my
attention is that bright pink shade and
I do also have this little Quint right
here which is called the color pop on
belle of the ball Quint that pink shade
mixed together with the peachy r1 I feel
like I can get that same sort of look I
feel like if you have the color pop My
Little Pony palette you probably have a
lot of these shades and then when it
comes to the you have neon fellow
palette it's all just neutrals so I'm
gonna go ahead and say purge on this
particular palette but the next one
want to talk about I'm probably going to
splurge so the next one we have here is
the color pop Sephora palette this is
going to be called the golden state of
mind eyeshadow palette it is limited
edition it is cruelty free it will be
made in color pop facilities but it will
be released on the Sephora calm websites
online in Canada as well as some stores
you know in the US so anyway this is
going to be $26 it is all shimmers now I
know a lot of people are saying like
what's been up with all these shimmer
palettes releasing we have the Urban
Decay heavy metals palette we have the
fenty Beauty galaxy collection now I'm
one of those people that I feel like if
I'm going to get an all shimmer College
I absolutely know that it's going to be
a supplementary palette so if you do not
like shimmers obviously you're not gonna
want to pick this color palette color
pop palette up but I feel like because I
already do have the Urban Decay heavy
metals palette and I skipped on the
Fenty there's a part of me that's like
you don't need this palette but at the
same time I'm loving the colors in there
they're very topi and they're very like
purpley they don't remind me of golden
state of mine at all I don't know why
they're naming it that but it's just a
really really beautiful palette so I am
actually gonna go ahead and purchase
this on October 31st when it does
release let me know if you're gonna go
ahead and splurge or perch on this one
but I just feel like when I look at it I
know that those metallic eyeshadows and
there are going to be very very
pigmented one of the reasons why I did
not want to pick up the new Fenty
palette is because I was watching
reviews and I was seeing there basically
glitter Stoppers I'm so not into that if
I'm gonna do a metallic eyeshadow I
wanted to be full-on pigment right away
and I trust that color pop was gonna do
this right so I'm gonna go ahead and say
splurge for that one alright guys up
next we have the taupe knotch ballot
this is from violet Voss now a viola
boss actually released on Sephora last
night out of nowhere I was like what the

I feel like Sephora and Ulta have been
picking up so many new brands and it's
just very very interesting to see and to
watch especially these kind of like
smaller indie brands I'm a big fan of
the eye shadow formula from by LaBeouf's
especially they're more foiled shades I
do have their Holy Grail palette I have
the drenched metal I do have the Laura
Lee
as well as the ride-or-die now I saw the
price on the right or diet is $75 and
they definitely had to up that a little
bit to be on the sephora.com website it
was never a really cheap palate but I
did not have to pay 75 for that so I was
pretty surprised that they're bringing
it all the way up there but I do think
overall and this is just going to be a
palette that's gonna be a big no for me
I'm gonna say purge and the reason for
that is because I'm not skilled enough
at makeup to be able to blend those on
my eyes and then you can see a
difference you know what I mean if
you're a huge lover of cool toned
eyeshadows I think you would love this
and I am a huge lover of cool tone
eyeshadows but I would have loved some
purples and stuff like that mixed in
there and on top of that I don't even
feel like the majority of these are Toby
they're very just cool toned Brown which
some people may say is taupe but for me
it's not okay I feel like the only ones
in sure that are really really topi or
maybe on numero-uno world class and to--
that's it
the other ones just really don't catch
my attention so I have to say perch for
this one I'm definitely not gonna pick
it up it will be available on October
24th on their website as well as Sephora
if you do want to pick it up but for me
that's gonna be a big old purge all
right guys and finally we have the new
divine collection this is going to be
releasing in February on the sephora.com
a website this is from Kat Von D and now
Devine is a drag queen and I love this
palette when I look at it I feel
inspired let me know if you guys want me
to do a video on makeup that inspires me
because sometimes I will just open a
palette up and I'm like holy I feel
artistic I feel like I want to play with
color and that palette or this palette
right here is definitely giving me those
vibes however I just don't think it's
something I'm gonna reach for enough I
mean that bright green shade that
fluorescent blue and that darker blue
and the silver I'm intrigued I
definitely definitely appreciate the
creativity as well as the artistic
approach of the whole entire thing but
this is just not going to be something
that I reach for on a daily basis so I'm
gonna go have to go ahead and say purge
for that
now when it does come to the lipstick I
might have to pick that up that is a
beautiful beautiful shade I don't own a
lot of Kat Von D lipsticks and that
bright green packaging is definitely
catching my attention
let me know if you guys are gonna go
ahead and splurge or purge on it that
particular collection but from me I'm
gonna go ahead and say a purge so out of
those four eyeshadow palettes the only
one that I will be picking up in the
Sephora color Pop Collaboration aka the
Golden State of Mind palette let me know
what you're gonna pick up and I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
