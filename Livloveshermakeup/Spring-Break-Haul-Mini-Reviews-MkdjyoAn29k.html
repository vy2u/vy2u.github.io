flew in back to Manhattan yes New York
last night I have been visiting my
boyfriend for a week in milwaukee
wisconsin i was on spring break now that
i am back i thought i'd show you guys in
a little haul video what I picked up
while I was on vacation I somehow always
end up picking up millions of things
while I'm on vacation so i thought i'd
share you guys share with you guys what
I got basically I went to Sephora and i
also want to target and i thought i'd
show you guys everything but also review
them and give you guys little mini
reviews because i did have the
opportunity to play with these all week
so I thought I just show you guys the
hall and also give you guys my thoughts
on the products so let's get started the
first thing I picked up at sephora was
this marc jacobs genius gel supercharged
foundation my color is 10 ivory light
and i am wearing this today i do have
very minimal makeup on today and kind of
tired so i am just wearing this and it
is a perfect dead on colourmatch it's
amazing if you are pale i highly
recommend this it is so so good so i
really really like this i love the
little pump and i love the bottle it's
nice and it's glass and basically it
just pumps out the product and its
really really this nice texture it's
kind of jelly jelly like and i just
think it applies really beautifully with
hands but also with a Beauty Blender
that's my favorite way to apply it and
it's just been like so good and I just
love that the color match is so dead on
so that is the first thing I picked up
that I'm really really really happy
about I'm absolutely loving that Marc
Jacobs foundation the second thing I
picked up was also at sephora and that
was another foundation and this one is
the Make Up For Ever HD high definition
foundation the shade I picked up was n
110 and 110 and basically it's like a
neutral foundation it's got a nice pump
the packaging isn't it's great because
it is plastic I like
James better but it's like this really
Remy fluid e foundation and it is i
would say maybe like half a shade up too
dark on me however i think this was
their lightest one and when i do blend
it really well with like a flat top
kabuki brush it really blends into the
skin beautifully and you can't tell that
it's too dark for me so i'm also really
really happy with that one I think it
looks amazing in photos it's really
really good i do like that high
definition kind of standard for this so
really really happy with that foundation
as well and then the last thing i got a
sephora was just a little sample of the
new smashbox pore minimizing primer she
gave me like a nice little sample in
here and i love this i think this may be
better than the benefit Porefessional so
I'm definitely probably going to end up
picking up the full size of this I
wanted to get one of their like deluxe
sizes that you can get for like ten
dollars but they had none of these ones
left so I asked for example and they
gave me a very hefty nice amount um it's
just like really really smooth but when
you blend it into the skin it's like not
as thick as the professional it's a
little thinner and it just is so soft
and it makes every like poor and fine
line on your face just disappear so I
really love it and I think I'm gonna
have to pick up a full size of that ok
the next is stuff that I picked up at
target the first thing I already did
review on my Catholic what just happened
it's okay Lily something fell I wasn't
makeup though it's okay i did already do
a view on this this is the l'oreal
appellate nude one and i've been working
with this for about a week now and we'll
all of these products actually got all
of these products basically at the
beginning of the week which is why i
have good opinions on them so far but
i'd already did a review on this i will
link below where i did but i love this
palette I think it's awesome I'm going
to review the second one as well the
next thing I got was the wet'n'wild by
Fergie center stage collection to
reflect shimmer
Hallett and this is in a 065 Hollywood
Boulevard and this is like the most
amazing highlight ever first of all the
packaging is like really big and huge
and awesome but when you mix your finger
in here and I've noticed that this one
is extremely creamy the pigmentation on
this one you get this gorgeous you see
that like golden gorgeous just perfect
perfect highlight I think it is
beautiful it's awesome so I'm really
really happy with that one these are
kind of hard to store because they're so
big but um I really like them i think
you get like such a bang for your buck
because those are like under five
dollars at the drugstore so really
really happy with that i'm also really
happy with the other one I picked up
from the fergie collection this is the
wet and wild fergie in 0 a 0 for 4 rose
golden goddess and this one's just a
little deeper and much more like Rosie
reddish orange e tones in it and it's
not as smooth like the pigmentation I
mean the powder isn't as smooth but the
pigmentation is just as good so this
one's more like a rose gold almost
orangie kind of shade and I think it's
beautiful I think that's like a perfect
blush topper or even if you use a light
hand a slush so really really love that
one as well these two are just beautiful
like let's look at those side by side
quickly beautiful i love them so so much
I have to pick more of these up I know I
have one of them like a pinky one that I
got last year but the new ones are
awesome um next I also picked up one of
the tone correcting powders and cool
from ELF this is my Holy Grail setting
powder I will never go without it I have
like 10 of these right now in my makeup
stash in the bathroom I keep like an
everyday makeup bin in the bathroom
trying to get rid of it and trying to
put everything in the drawers but
sometimes it just won't all fit but
anyway it looks like this you get like a
pink green yellow and a blue
oh and when you mix it together it just
creates like a tone correcting you know
crepes redness it corrects just lots of
different things going on in the skin
and the actual powder is so like finely
milled it's really really beautiful
can't even tell it's on my hand but it's
really really beautiful I just love the
way it sets any foundation that i'm
wearing my go to next i'm so excited
about this I got this wet and wild come
correct celebrity concealer it looks
like this and oh my god this concealer
is amazing i highly recommend really
giving it a good shake first so that it
doesn't get too oily but the shade i got
was a 111 fair and this is like so
brightening like it's almost it's too
pale like for my skin tone like it's so
light when I put it on my face it's like
amazing like it really gives a nice
highlighted effect but this is so thick
and creamy it covers up anything
anything on your face I've been using at
the past couple of days I'm not wearing
it today but oh my gosh you guys you
have to try this concealer it's so good
i'm going to go and pick up another
shade think i'm going to go one shade
deeper which is surprising because
normally brands don't cater to my kind
of skin tone very well um but this one
is so light i think i'm going to go for
one a little deeper and use that to
cover up my acne scars um after i put my
foundation on but this is so light that
i can only wear it before I put my
foundation on but it brightens up I area
beautifully it's amazing it's so thick
and creamy and it was like three dollars
highly recommend that concealer they
come correct celebrities concealer from
went wild the next thing I picked up was
the NYC smooth skin BB creme five in one
instant mat the reason I got this is
because the shade looked really to be
similar to my skin tone it's an 01 light
and I really do like this as a BB cream
this was only a couple dollars and it
really does blend into my skin tone
really really well I got lucky on this
trip by finding so many color matching
products but they
quickly it glides on really beautifully
it's kind of moisturizing but it does um
step to a pretty matte or I would say
like semi Demi matte finish so i really
really like that i would say that it is
kind of light it's not something I would
wear on an everyday basis maybe if I was
just going to kind of light makeup like
I did today I would wear just that but
um it's really beautiful underneath like
a foundation to if you just need that
extra little coverage I like doing that
with CC creams and BB creams on days
where I need a little more coverage so I
do indeed like that NYCB be one I was
looking for the BB powder I haven't
found it yet but when I do I'm going to
pick it up and let's see here on the
next thing I got was this elf flawless
finish foundation I did not realize this
was in such great packaging this is like
a nice glass bottle like really really
great with a pump included like go out
so basically I really love the finish of
this it's like super kind of thick and
moosey not Lucy but like creamy it's
just super super creamy as you guys can
see it's a bit too dark this was their
lightest shade which was 8 31 11 11 but
it is a bit too dark but I can make it
work and I really do think that it
covers what it needs to and it does give
a really nice radiant look to the skin
when you apply it with a beauty blender
or a sponge damp sponge um so I'm really
really happy with that one actually
really i really do like that i had not
tried a lot of elf foundations um I do
have like their stick foundations but I
use those usually for like contouring
but I'm really really happy with this
moment like that so I've got a lot of
foundations on this trip but I'd like
basically all the ones I got and the
last thing i got was also from
Wet'n'Wild this is the coverall primer i
have used the coverall foundation which
i did like and so I thought I'd pick up
the primer and this really really it
comes out this nice white texture and
you rub it in and it feels nice like
it's not silicone II you're not going to
get that um like smooth finish that you
would with like
professional or at Smashbox one it just
kind of glides on and it feels like
hydrating as it glides on but after it
sets it sets pretty much like Matt in my
opinion not Matt to the point where it's
going to dry out your skin but it's just
like undetectable that it's on the skin
so I really really like that it does
have a little bit of a yeah funky smell
sorry my nose is still stuffed up it
does have a little bit of a funky smell
but I do like it it says it refines
porous pills finds lines brightens
complexion even skin tone I don't know
if it does all that but it is a really
nice quality primer if you're looking
for a good one I truly believe that
primers work like primers and makeup
setting spray so I do use things like
this and I would definitely consider
repurchasing this so that's the wet and
wild cover all primer anyway those are
the things I picked up on my spring
break vacation I hope you guys enjoyed
this hall and reviews I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
