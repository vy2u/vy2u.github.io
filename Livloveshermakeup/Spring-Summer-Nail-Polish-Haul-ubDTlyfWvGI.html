super excited for this video I am going
to be doing a nail polish haul for you
guys excuse the messy here it got really
really warm here in Manhattan today it
was like in the 70s I feel like a lot of
my makeup came off and I have to speak
level i thinked on my forehead but i
love how like you know you pointed out
and then now everybody seemed to be
looking at that but i mean even my
makeup was like melting off today was
really really born here but anyway back
to the point of the video the point of
the video is that i went and picked up
some nail polishes from wet'n'wild and i
also picks them up from Illamasqua and
this is going to be a spring and summer
nail polish haul so I'm going to start
with the wet and wild ones because
they're more like pastel and I feel like
pastels are very spring to me and then
I'll get into the darker ones and the
more like poppy colors which in my
opinion are more like summer ish and
those ones are from Illamasqua so let's
just get started the first one I picked
up from wet and wild is wear skinny
jeans and it looks like that it's like
this beautiful um purpley almost
periwinkle color and it's just got this
really nice like pastel look to it and I
think it's going to be beautiful on so
that's the first one the second one I
got is a latte love and it's like this
really nice like neutral um white based
whatever color and it's kind of got a
bit of gray in it I'd say almost like
topi it's really really pretty the next
one I got is reject the mainstream which
is more of a lilac purple I think it's
really really pretty it's a little more
purple than my scarf but I think this
will be really really nice in the spring
I just love that all of these are like
very much like pastel I feel like pastel
colors are so spring so yeah the next
one I got is stream of consciousness
this is more a little bit like um what
was the a latte love but this one is
more pink toned so it's got a little
more pink in it but then I got to warm
filter which is a beautiful beautiful
beautiful coral shade it looks like that
really really pretty
and then I've got two percent milk which
is also like a latte love and what was
the other one stream of consciousness
except this one's a little more peachy
really really pretty kind of matches my
skin tone and the last one I got from
the wet and wild line is tree hugger
which is like this beautiful minty color
so really really excited to try those
out no this is not the one I have on my
nails right now the one I have on my
nails right now is from Zoya but this
one looks like it's going to be very
very similar maybe a little darker so
those are the ones from went wild like
that I feel like that's gonna be perfect
for spring um just like pastel colors
are so spring to me so I'm really
excited to start wearing those um and
now let me show you guys what I got from
Illamasqua the first one I got is in
harem or hero har a.m. yeah and it's
like this bright purple and I feel like
the illamasqua ones are going to be
great for summer because they're so
bright and just gorgeous so it's this
really really pretty purple shade and
illamasqua um their nail varnishes or
like their nail polishes whatever you
want to call them are really amazing and
it requires like one coat to get like a
full full amount of color so I'm really
really excited to play with these so
that's hair up or harem the next one I
got is cameo and it's this gorgeous
gorgeous um like I guess this one almost
like periwinkle it's like periwinkle
blue ish really really pretty is showing
up a lot more blue on camera but it
shows up a little more like periwinkle
in real life but I'm super excited to
play with this one this one just looks
so pretty for summer next I got a really
nice bright pink shade called collide
it's like a super super hot pink like
BAM neon it looks like that really
really beautiful I just think that's
going to be gorgeous on the nails then I
picked up um dama which is a bright
bright neon orange and this one's also
going to be amazing on the nails very
pretty then I picked up
Venice or Venus I think it's Venus
Venice it looked like a venom or
something but um this is like a really
nice turquoise color it's a little more
muted like I feel like you can wear this
one kind of into fall so that's going to
be nice and then the last one I picked
up is obsessed which is like a bright
purple color it looks like that and I
think it's so beautiful kind of matches
my Fitbit but I think it's so so so
pretty so I'm really really excited to
play with these I can't wait I hope you
guys I hope you and guys I hope you guys
enjoyed this little haul from Illamasqua
and wet and wild um and yeah keep you

color I'll be wearing each week on my
