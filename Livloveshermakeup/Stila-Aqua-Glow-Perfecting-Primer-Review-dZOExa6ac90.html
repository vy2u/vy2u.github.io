hope you guys are having a great day
look at my cute little kitten shirt
isn't that adorable got this on dress
linked on for like $4 not sponsored I
just wanted to say look at the cute
little kitten if you're a crazy cat lady
like me I'm sure you can appreciate that
anyway today I'm reviewing for you guys
a semi new product I would say this came
out movie about a month ago I have had
it for three weeks so I have really
really been using it and trying it out
and I'm gonna give you guys my opinion
on it but it is the Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer it comes an adorable
little gold box like this really really
cute and the actual packaging is really
cute too so it is just a gold like
cylinder kind of container it looks like
this and it opens up and you get your
primer stack so basically um I was
really drawn in by this because number
one it is a primer stick and I'm just
sick of like going into my primer
collection and taking stuff and
squeezing it out and all this stuff I
thought this would be really really
quick and easy and also it said aqua
glow perfecting primer and it reminded
me of the cheek glow the aqua cheek
thing that I had recently reviewed from
Stila which I absolutely love stealing
has been stepping up their game lately
they have really really revamped their
line they have added in a lot of new
staff they have redone their palettes
and I think they've really stepped their
game up and you know just in you know
all sorts like packaging and consistency
wearability like everything has been
really really great so after I could try
it out that cheek like aqua what does
they call it aqua cheek like jelly
naturally it was like a you can go back
I will link the video below if you guys
are interested but it was a newer blush
that they had released and it was like a
watercolor cheap thing and it was so
great I absolutely loved it I wear it
all the time I just cannot remember
gonna lie to me the exact name I'm sorry
about that but um I was really just
thinking you know I should try more
things out from Stila because they have
really revamped their lines so when I
saw this on the support website about
three weeks ago I knew I had to get it
and I loved it I loved it instantly I
think it is just such a cool concept I
like the concept in the summer
especially of having just a little stick
that you just run all over your face so
basically this is supposed to be a
cooling hi
stick primer and it's supposed to help
mattify the skin it's supposed to help
you know cover up pores it has like
lemon in it for brightening purposes
it's like a cooling water-based primer
stick and when I saw that it was a
water-based I was really really drawn in
because um during the summer I tend to
get really sensitive eye and basically
like allergic to the Sun I have lupus
which makes me very very sensitive to
the Sun so I'm constantly wearing SPF
I'm very fair I can't really tan or
anything like that so I do get burns and
I'm not just normal sunburn like bad
like rashes kind of burns so when I saw
that this was you know water-based and
like you know cooling I just thought oh
my gosh that sounds so lovely for the
summer time
so anyway it comes in the cute little
packaging like this it was $28 on the
Sephora website I will link below where
you guys can pick it up if you were
interested I do think it's worth it
however I will say right away I've had
this for about three weeks and already I
have used quite a bit so that's really
my one of my complaints the other
complaint I guess we'll just get rid of
the complaints right away before I talk
about the good things um when you start
to use it you can see that a little like
bit like it doesn't stay completely even
if that makes sense like when you're
using it you put it all over your skin
and then when you close it up you can
see that little tiny bits get like stuck
around that it's okay I still go in and
kind of scoop them out and put them on
because it is such a blendable beautiful
primer so basically what you do is it
says the instructions are just to apply
it actually let me read I have the
support website right here let me read
for you guys what the instructions say
it says how to use prep skin before
makeup by applying primer under the eyes
and all over face and because it is
really really cooling a nice it feels
great underneath the eyes for today I'm
wearing it today under the hard candy
glamoflauge that new foundation that you
can get I also had a review on that I
will link the video below if you're
interested I am wearing that today I
love love love that foundation great
price great coverage well go off on a
huge tangent but it's really really
great so anyway I'm wearing that with
this today so what I did was I just took
this and I just applied it all over
underneath my eyes and for today's video
I did apply it on my eyelid
as well I'm gonna say right away it does
not work very well as an eye primer you
will get creasing and things like that
I'm not even wearing eye shadow I'm just
my eyeliner and mascara but I can
already tell that there is some crazy
so for eye primer no however under the
eyes wonderful beautiful really cooling
feels really really great really smooth
so you just run it all over your face
and then I like to just blend it into
the skin it's super quick it feels
really nice it doesn't have a very
offensive smell it smells kind of just
like like a cooling I don't know like
something you would expect to smell like
water-based you know nothing is strong
or like really you know in your face a
little bit of a lemon scent and it does
have lemon in it so that's probably why
but anyway I apply it all over I rub it
in and it just really really really
makes any kind of foundation that goes
on top of it beautiful like I said I've
been using it for three weeks so I have
tried it out with a lot of foundations
and I love it with the glamoflage one I
love it with everything um normally I
apply everything with my Real Techniques
Beauty sponge and like my foundation and
this just looks beautiful you know it
makes the foundation just go on
beautifully I'm only wearing concealer
around my eyes today and you can see
that it just looks so flawless and soft
and beautiful so anyway I really really
love it I would say the scent is a
little lemony did I mention that now I'm
smelling it it smells a little bit like
lemons so anyway umm really really love
it I think it's so blendable it feels so
great on like in the summer just to run
something cooling like this over your
skin it really does feel cooling when it
goes on and you can see it goes on
completely clear sometimes you do get
those little bits right there that are
stuck you get them on you know your
hands but it just blends away so
beautifully so it goes on a little like
slicks like it kind of feels like you
can you can see the product like when
you're putting it on you can see there's
like a little bit that got stuck you can
see how easy it blends away though you
can see it looks like it's a little
moist but then when you blend it in you
can see that it just turns like really
it just sinks in instantly it's very
very quick and instantly right now I can
feel that it has a little texture like
not stickiness and not tackiness but
just a little bit of like a grip so that
the foundation can really stick but it's
still so smooth I normally don't love a
primer that is really really sticky
because then like I feel like the
foundation
goes on kind of blotchy and gross
however this one is still like a little
tacky but still really smooth because it
has that tackiness
it makes your foundation last all day it
makes everything that I put on my face
lasts all day I've just been really
impressed I've tried it with foundations
I really like filmation's I don't really
like and I notice that they just stay on
all day so it has made me rediscover a
lot of foundations that I thought to not
have good staying power now I'm like wow
with this they do have the same power so
after a few seconds you can feel it
still feels like a little bit tacky but
really really smooth soft great
so anyway I'm gonna read you guys a
little bit about what it says on the
Support website
so it says the Stila aqua glow
perfecting primer $28 what it is a
cooling water-based primer stick that
preps the skin for makeup application
what it does it creates the perfect
canvas for your makeup application with
a refreshing primer stick aqua glow
perfecting primer is packed with cooling
ingredients that leave skin looking
still key even and pore perfected while
hydrating and soothing the skin it
really feels hydrating and really
soothing it doesn't feel um I just want
to point out because it did say that it
perfects the pores it doesn't feel
silicone E in any way so if that's what
you're looking for you know this is not
the product however you could take like
the professional or another silicone
silicone based like Perfector like that
and put it on over this and I think it
would work really well
I have tried that with the benefit
professional and it did work very well
it says the Alaskan glacial water
amazing hydrates soothes and reduces the
appearance of pores a blend of snowdrop
and aloe extracts work to protect skin
from free radicals and UV rays while a
lemon extract come back to fatigue and
transform skin so that it's supple and
refreshed the results formed seat porous
seem tightened redness appears reduced
and the skin texture looks visibly
smooth I would definitely say that the
redness appears reduced and that the
skin looks visibly smooth pores seem
tighten not quite sure about that you
probably need a pore like minimizer for
that anyway it says it is formulated
without parabens sulfates and phenol
eighths and like I said how to use it
just says put it all over underneath
your eyes you can also apply the stick
directly to your face and blend with
fingers or with the steal of brush
number 33 so anyway I am absolutely in
love with this primer I've used a lot of
it as you guys can probably see um
they said for $28 you do get quite a bit
but you go through it quite quickly
because it kind of just melts into the
skin and you keep wanting to apply it
because it feels so good but this is
definitely a summer must-have for me I'm
loving this I am definitely gonna be
looking into more Stila products I feel
like they've really revamped their line
and I'm just really really impressed so
I hope you guys enjoyed this review if
you did please give it a thumbs up I
will link below the video on the
glamoflage foundation and also what else
did I say you guys have another one was
it I cannot for the life of me remember
but I believe all of the glamoflage
foundation video and yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this review if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
