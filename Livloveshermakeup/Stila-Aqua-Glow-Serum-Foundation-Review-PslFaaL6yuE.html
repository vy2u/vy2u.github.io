thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day I am
here to give you guys a review on the
new Stila aqua Glo serum foundation this
is the box that it came in
I ordered mine from Ulta calm but it
also is now available on the Sephora
calm website for $45 I was really really
excited when I saw that they had
released this from Stila because if you
look back at some of my videos that came
out during the summer you would have
seen me review the Stila aqua glow
watercolor blush and also the Stila
aqua glow what else is called perfecting
primer which are both products that I
really really love from Stila they kind
of revamped their line earlier in the
summer and they started coming out with
new kind of aqua products which are
supposed to be very very water based
hydrating very very nice on the skin and
are supposed to be just not irritating
and just really really fabulous products
and basically I thought both of these
were this is one of my favorite primers
now and this aqua glow watercolor blush
is absolutely beautiful so I was really
really excited when I saw that they had
released a foundation on the ultra calm
website like I said you can get it there
for $45 or these Sephora calm website
for $45 I will link both of the links
below if you guys want to click on those
they are not affiliate links by any
means but anyway this is what the outer
packaging looks like it's a very pretty
kind of gold box and the actual
packaging on the foundation looks like
this very very reminiscent of the primer
and also the watercolor blush with that
kind of matte gold thing going on
basically so it's kind of got like a
little bit of the matte gold and then it
goes down into the color that the
foundation is and the shade that I
picked was fair that was the lightest
shade that they had on the website and I
just thought well I do have fair skin
and that's probably going to be the best
shade match for me personally and I'm
really really happy with the shade match
I find like if I find then it doesn't go
to pink or too warm so you don't get too
much yellow undertones or too much pink
undertones like
like I really am getting just a straight
forward sort of neutral fair color and I
feel like that really can work on my
skintone so you do get one fluid ounce a
product in here and I'm going to read a
little bit about what it says on these
sephora.com website for you guys so it
says the Stila aqua Glo serum foundation
is $45 it is an ultra lightweight
water-based foundation with buildable
and natural looking coverage it says
this water-based foundation blends
seamlessly to provide natural-looking
buildable to full coverage infused with
an innovative electrolyte balance system
compromise of ionized ionized ya ionized
water advanced hyaluronic acids and
essential minerals the serum formula
helps hydrate and nourish the skin so
that it glows with healthy looking
radiance after 12 hours of continuous
wear skin is more hydrated it is highly
refractive multi reflective pigments
play with life to ultimately smooth skin
and instantly reduce the appearance of
imperfection pores fine lines and
wrinkles the skin is left looking and
naturally radiant and not masked by
heavy opaque pigments and it is
formulated without parabens sulfates and
feta lates so it really is supposed to
be just this really beautiful kind of
luminous lightweight really really
hydrating foundation and I'm happy to
say it really really is I've had some
good luck this past week reviewing all
sorts of products high-end to the
drugstore and this one is no exception
it's really really a great product and
I'm really really loving it so the
actual little applicator opens up like
this has one of those little closures
that kind of snaps closed which is
really really nice and you open it and
you kind of had this little dropper
thing going on here you can see this
little button at the top you push that
to get the product in the dropper and
then when you lift it up you can see
that you have the little dropper right
there and it just dispenses right onto
your hand in a really really nice way it
is a very liquidy sort of formulation
and you guys can see that fair color is
a really really nice color match for me
or hope you could hopefully you guys can
see that so that is what the shade fair
looks like it's definitely got a neutral
undertone and this is what the actual
consistency of the foundation looks like
it's very
liquidy but it is not silicone II by any
means they don't feel any kind of
silicones in there anything heavy or
like unnatural filling like fill like
fillers basically you know how sometimes
foundations just have tons of fillers in
them you get a really really sort of
silicone II feel to the product or
anything like that I don't feel that at
all with this it literally feels like I
am putting some sort of water product on
my skin and you guys can see it's not
pulling too much pink undertones or too
many yellow undertones it really is just
kind of stayed neutral so that fair
under that fair shade is really really
nice it doesn't have too many undertones
that are pulling it one way or the other
so I really do enjoy it it's just got a
beautiful liquidy consistency to it
and I'm so surprised at how well this
actually builds on the skin I am wearing
it today the way that they recommend
which is by shaking it well before use
because it does have that serum in there
and then it says we using your
fingertips or a brush number 33 blend
over face build wear more coverage is
needed I don't have the number 33 brush
so I just used my fingers and I think
it's beautiful applied with the fingers
I think it's even more beautiful applied
with a damp Beauty Blender or damp Real
Techniques sponge it just really really
is gorgeous on the skin you can barely
tell that you are wearing foundation it
really wears a long time especially if
you are wearing a primer underneath it I
like to pair it these two together of
course because the Aqua glow products
just go really really beautiful too
beautifully together and I feel like
they are just so lightweight and they
feel so good on the skin their hydrating
they just feel very refreshing and I
think that these two pair are really
really beautifully together however I
have tried it with my Too Faced hangover
RX primer as well which is how I'm
wearing it today and I think that is
absolutely stunning as well or was it
didn't read this one today no no I wore
this one yesterday paired with this so
it was really really beautiful um but
anyway long story short I think that
it's a fantastic foundation it really
does have some strong wear time it is
really beautiful on the skin it's very
hydrating it doesn't look cakey it
doesn't look you know crazy heavy by any
means you can build it up on certain
areas where you need to where you know
you may
any scarring or just texture or whatever
you want to cover I do like to put it a
little more around my cheek area that is
where I have acne scarring and also
where I breakout from hormonal acne so I
think it really built up beautifully in
that area I think you can definitely get
get it up to a media months
coverage I wouldn't say that it builds
to a full coverage like they say but you
can definitely get it up to a medium
coverage I think for everyday wear it's
beautiful like I said it applies really
beautifully with a damp sponge however
you can apply it with your fingertips as
well and get a gorgeous gorgeous look so
I think it's a fantastic fantastic
foundation I'm so happy that I found it
I recently have found this one and the
laura mercier candle glow luminous
foundation I found both of those and
they both are really really kind of
lighter like lighter weight sort of
foundations and I've been enjoying that
lately normally I like a very very heavy
coverage foundation just because I feel
like I do have a bitch to cover
especially when it comes to acne
scarring however I feel like my skin can
just breathes when I'm wearing this
foundation and also the Laura Mercier
one as well I just feel like it's a
different kind of change for my skin and
yes it doesn't cover everything you can
still see little spots and little
freckles but it's beautiful on the skin
and I can imagine during the summer this
is gonna be absolutely fantastic so I am
really really really happy with this
foundation I highly recommend like I
said I will link below where you guys
can pick it up from either Sephora or
Ulta comm and yeah thank you so much for
joining me I'll see you guys my next one
