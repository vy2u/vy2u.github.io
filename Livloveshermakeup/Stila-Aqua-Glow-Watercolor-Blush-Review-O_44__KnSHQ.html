of you today I had to kind of fool
around with my lighting and started
getting really bright in here and the
natural light was just kind of watching
my face out so I hope that this is a
little better have some artificial
lighting going on and just a little bit
of natural light
anyway um this review is going to be on
the new Stila aqua blue water color
blush the packaging looks like this and
the shade I got is watcher Lillie they
have I believe six shades on these for
website I purchased this for 26 dollars
by the way on the support website I will
of course leave below where you guys can
pick it up yes they have one two three
I'm sorry five shades on the support
website they have rosewater which is a
pretty rose color they have water lily
the one that I have which is a vibrant
rose color they have water blossom which
is a pink violet color they have
shimmering Lotus which is a golden pink
and they have water copy which is a
vibrant coral red color so lots of nice
bright shades I immediately was drawn to
the product because I was like wow those
look like really nice like summery
colors very fun just something I would
definitely want to use so what I was
looking at it on the website I for some
reason the picture that they displayed
made me think that it was one of those
products that basically you have the cap
and then you have like a little like
sifter basically and then the product on
the bottom and almost looked like it was
a powder so the powder would come up and
go through the sifter however when I got
my product about a week or so ago I
opened it up and I realized that it is
completely a wet product this is like a
cream blush it really does have that
little sifter thing it's bouncy and you
can actually like you know pick a
product up that way but basically the
instructions are by the way that's
shaded the instructions are to shake it
well before you use it and then
basically the products will come up
through the sifter and you can take your
brush and dab it in there then what I
like to do is put it on the back of my
hand cover my brush I usually use an elf
small stipple by the way cover my brush
in the product brush a little off on the
back of my hand which by the way it
completely stains the back of your hand
I recommend actually doing it on the
back of
like some kind of palette or something
like that because it really will stay in
your hand by the way I'm wearing it
today I don't know if you guys can tell
I hope you can machine that I'm getting
is actually from the Too Faced candle
lit glow yeah like that double high
light thing this is like that really
glowy gold one but the color that you're
seeing on my cheeks the pink color is
from this product so this is what it
looks like like I said I got the shade
water lily which is this beautiful rosy
kind of coral color and immediately it
starts to kind of set and it's just such
a beautiful formula I tend to be a
little iffy when it comes I do love
cream blushes and I really have tried to
get more into them because I feel like
it's one of those things that's great
during the summer time and just anyway
it's one of those things that it's like
really nice in the summer time it feels
really really light on your skin but the
problem is is that when I apply it and
I'm talking about with this blush to
that the many times that I have used it
and I've used it probably four times
this week I would say that or this past
week I would say that every time I've
used it there's been a little bit of
like blotchiness and I think it's just
the way I'm applying it if you guys have
a better technique of applying actual
like liquid blushes let me know because
I really want to get into it I think
it's beautiful for summer this one this
formula blends out so beautifully and
honestly that is just such a gorgeous
color I love the way it looks on my fair
skin and I just think it's beautiful
so I really really love the formula I
just really want to find a brush that's
perfect to apply it with I feel like
when you're working with like wet
blushes or cream blushes you have to it
takes a little more work it's not as
easy as popping out a powder blush and
just going to town because you really
have to put it exactly where you want it
immediately so that it doesn't set in
the wrong places if that makes sense
so I have found that after I've been
using this I have had to go over with
powder just to kind of blend out any
kind of line that I'm
I have just to make sure that it looks
really natural however I will say that
the actual blush looks so natural on the
skin it really just picks up as like a
natural flush and I think it's
absolutely gorgeous
so really really impressed with the
formula I think it's awesome too little
sister thing in there I think it's
really cool
again it is definitely not a powder
formula it is completely liquid you want
to shake it before you use it and I will
say this color in particular has the
tiniest amount of golden shimmer to it
but it's basically undetectable on the
skin but really really love this water
lily shade anyway I'm gonna read you
guys a little bit about what it says on
the actual Sephora website it says the
Stila aqua glow watercolour blush $26
each like I said there are five
different shades it is an oil free
lightweight water-based blush in an
exclusive netted pot delivery system it
brings a sheer wash of color to the
cheeks while creating a rejuvenating
effect the gel formula cools upon
contact and blends seamlessly to create
a luminous healthy looking glow the
exclusive mesh touch color dispenser
delivers a single flash of color each
time and it adds a luminous finish that
provides a fresh glow to the skin the
water-based formula goes on crystal
clear allowing the pure pigments and
parts to be dispensed evenly and blend
in seamlessly giving the skin a fresh
smooth and supple appearance it is
formulated without parabens sulfates and
fat lights so they lit how do we that
bang away I totally agree I feel like
it's like this nice it feels like water
it really does feel like water when
you're blending it in wow this is so
thin and yet
it looks so beautiful I have found today
I'm wearing the Sephora teen infusion or
tint infusion foundation and I find that
it really pairs with this nicely if I
were a really heavy-duty coverage
foundation like the Kat Von D or
something like that
I really can't work with cream or liquid
products it just takes away from the
foundation and it starts to get all
blotchy but I really find that this
really glides on beautifully to a lot of
different foundations haven't tried it
with the Kat Von D but my guess from
trying other you know cream products or
liquid products with the Kat Von D is
that it would make it kind of move
around however I just find that it
really had been looking great and I wear
a lot of foundation I wear a lot of
powder and this doesn't kick up at all
so really really impressed and
absolutely loving I think I'm going to
pick up a few more shades of this so
again that was my review of a Stila
aqua glow watercolor blush my shade is
in water lily I absolutely love it and I
think it's just gonna be perfect for
summer so I hope you guys enjoyed this
review I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
