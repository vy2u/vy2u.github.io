channel thank you so much for joining me
Chuck again when I turn the camera on I
apologize I need to just stop like it
being such a shaky person anyway um
today's video is going to be a demo and
it is going to be on the new Stila
corrects and perfects palette I did a
whole review on this product yesterday
so if you would like to see that where I
purchased it how much it was all that
kind of stuff I will link that video
down below in the description bar it
will be the first thing you see but
today I am showing you guys how I use
this palette and basically how I apply
this products all over my face so this
is what it looks like you get an
assortment of cream products I don't
want to glide you guys cream products
and then powder products and we are
going to be using everything on our face
this morning and I woke up and it is
that time of the month they have lots of
redness going on and I could use a lot
of color correcting basically so let's
just get right into it this is going to
be this is going to be good alright so
the first thing I am going to do is use
as a cream products in here and I just
want to show you back on the back of
here it will show you what all of the
cream products and powder products do so
it claims I'm going to use this dark
orange cream color here and this one is
supposed to be neutralizing for blue
purple undertones for darker skin but
I'm still gonna use it I have fair skin
but I'm still going to make sure that I
use everything in here so you guys can
see how I blend it out and everything
like that by the way I have nothing on
my skin right now I just woke up I put a
little micellar water on I didn't put
any primer on I want you guys to see
exactly how these products go on to this
game so anyway this orange cream color
is the first one I'm gonna take I'm just
gonna put it onto my finger and this is
supposed to be for darker skin tones to
cancel out blue tones however you can
still use it if you have fair skin so
what I'm going to do is tap this right
underneath my eye and then go into like
a little what is this like a moon shape
kind of like this because this is where
I personally get a lot of dark blue
colors and discoloration as far as dark
circles are concerned in this little
area like here all the way to here not
so much over here over here I just want
to kind of cover up veins and things
like that and I will cover that with the
peach color but this dark orange cream
color I really really like oh I get over
there already I really like because it
just goes right over those blue tones
really really nicely so I'm going to do
that on each side of
fils and i did talk about this yesterday
in the review but this particular
product the cream products in here are
very very slick kind of oily they have
to be set and on top of that they kind
of blend away a little bit so I am
applying a lot to see you guys can see
because I don't want to have to reapply
more and more layers because they just
end up blending out anyway I do would
like to blend these out with a damp
Beauty Blender you can also use a Real
Techniques sponge this I would just
recommend using a damp sponge in general
anytime I use a brush I feel like it
takes away a lot of the product and
anytime I use my fingers it doesn't
blend it perfectly so all right after we
have put that all over where we need to
I'm going to go into this green color
I'm gonna take another clean finger and
I'm really picking up a lot because you
guys can see this is a very slick and
oily formula and I really want to make
sure that I'm getting enough so I'm
gonna go over the areas where I have
breakouts on my chin it is that time of
the month so I have some hormonal
breakouts I usually get them on the
outer perimeters of my face along my
jawline like this kind of area so I am
just going to apply that anywhere where
I see one big guy out there and the
green is going to counteract any sort of
redness you can also use this around
areas where you have broken capillaries
you know redness around your nose
whatever you want to do I prefer to use
the yellow color I guess that's the next
one will do the yellow color in here
because it is kind of like skin tone ish
it's not super super yellow I prefer to
use this around my nostril area where I
get a little red just because it's not
super super yellow and I don't like it
underneath the eyes even though it
claims that it's supposed to help cancel
out blue tones underneath the eyes I
don't feel like it does a very good job
because it's not super super yellow so I
like that and around the nose and let me
read for you guys quickly this is the
yellow one
neutralizes purple and brown
hyperpigmentation and dark spots but
usually like with yellow correctors you
use them underneath the eyes to give a
little more brightness I don't feel like
this necessarily covers any sort of
hyperpigmentation I have the shade that
I like to use for that is actually the
peach one which is the one we will go
into next so that's this one right here
and this
says it neutralizes blue and purple
under-eye circles on fair and medium
skin tones I like to use it to cover my
hyperpigmentation so I'm going to go
into that one and I'm going to apply it
on the areas where I have
hyperpigmentation along my jawline and
things like that
we're just kind of doing this messily
because we are going to blend it out
with our beauty blender and then I the
last one I'm going to take is that light
pink one and this one is to brighten
highlight to the eye area and mask
fatigue I think I already said that but
what I like to do with this one is just
go on at my eyelid and the reason I like
to do that is because it kind of cancels
out any sort of veins you might have on
your eyelid and also I feel like
especially when you first wake up in the
morning like I did I feel like it really
kind of gives them lift to the upper eye
area and honestly I could use all the
help I could get in the morning
especially when it's this early it's
like 5:15 so alright so those are all
the cream products we're gonna go ahead
and blend those out now with a Beauty
Blender like I said I have tried this
with a brush it just kind of blends the
product away you guys are gonna see what
I mean even with my damn Beauty Blender
it's not wet it's just damp it's going
to take a little bit and this is not
supposed to be like a full coverage
product these are correctors but you're
going to see that especially along the
areas where I have redness this green
color doesn't necessarily color correct
super super well and again I just feel
like these products don't build up very
nicely on the skin so I think you guys
will see what I mean when I start to
blend it out but anyway we're just kind
of going over and making sure we fund
everything out I think you can see right
away boom boom boom all red right there
and it's just unfortunate because this
product I think the reason why it does
that is because it is so slick and it is
so oily and so basically you're just not
getting a enough like opaqueness if that
makes sense I feel like the orange cream
shade is really the only standout cream
product in this palette I feel like it
actually does cancel out blue tones
underneath my eyes as you guys can see
but the other ones just seemed to kind
of blend away no matter how much I build
up and no matter if I blend them out
with my finger if I blend them out with
a brush it just never really works out
like do you see that look at that angry
pimple he's still so rad so it's kind of
a bummer because normally with
correctors you want them to color
correct so that you can go in with
whatever kind of coverage concealer and
foundation you want today I am using my
Laura Mercier campbellot soft luminous
foundation in the shade shell and this
is a very lightweight foundation
it's not meant to do a it's not meant to
be doing like a ton of coverage and it's
just I don't know it's kind of sad
because you guys will see you'll still
be able to see spots through my skin
with these kind of products they're
supposed to color correct you're still
gonna see redness along my areas like
where I have breakouts like on my chin
you're still going to be able to see
some of the hyperpigmentation and it's
just it kind of it kind of irks me but I
really do love the powder products in
this palette so that is why I am not
returning it so anyway I am just taking
this and applying it all over my face a
nice even layer of this foundation I
love this foundation it's very very
lightweight just applying that
everywhere it's interesting normally
when I'm in the middle of my cycle I
tend to reach for a really really like
heavy coverage foundation but this week
I've been all about these light
foundation so that's kind of interesting
so it's nice too because then you can
see if the color correctors are really
working because I could just get my Kat
Von D lock-it tattoo foundation and just
cover my face and then you won't see
anything but I feel like with this one
you guys can actually see what they're
doing and how they're working alright so
the next step that I like to do is go in
with my concealer and then I will set to
my foundations let me wipe my lips
quickly I would get foundation there so
the concealer that I have been using all
week and really really adoring is the
Tarte rainforest of the sea aqua sealer
in the shade fair so this is what I'm
going to be using around my eye area on
my eyelids on any active breakouts
things like that and you guys are gonna
see that this is going to be the product
that really is going to cancel out the
redness and cover up any sort of
imperfections it has a really really
nice coverage and I like that you can
build it up without it getting cakey on
the skin so I'm just going to tap that
there put a little bit along my jawline
because that peach color didn't really
neutralize the hyperpigmentation that
much unfortunately
I can hear the seagulls outside my
window I live right near Lake Michigan
and I always love that I can hear the
seagulls because I don't know I always
associated hearing seagulls with like
being near the ocean but I forgot that
like at the Great Lakes you know they
like to hang out near the water Rambler
anyway um and then I'm going to put it
there
obviously big ns pimple all right let's
blend it out and then you guys will be
able to see that this like concealer
will completely make sure that all of
the orange tones are covered up and
everything like that now we will have a
color corrected face I will be doing a
demo later on the new Urban Decay color
correctors which I definitely prefer
over this product like I said my
favorite part of this product is the
powder products which I feel like are
the best but I'm really excited about
the urban decay one because those are
some darn good corrector is in my
opinion great just blending blending
blending so I'm still seeing a little
redness here where I have like my
hormonal breakouts and mr. sad because
it's like oh well why did I color
corrector on I thought it was supposed
to help with at least the redness it's
not supposed to cover it's not a
concealer but I expected it to do a
little color correcting not conceal but
color Greg all right so now I'm going to
go ahead and set my face with my real
estate mask this is my long lasting
pressed powder in 0:01 transparent and
I'm going to be using my it cosmetics
Buki buffing brush I'm just swirling
into the product and setting my face
and you can go directly from the cream
product right into the powder products
that are in here but what I like to do
is set my face first and then go into
these and do extra like color correcting
kind of benefits the powers are pretty
pigmented but they're really easy to
blend on the skin they're really really
lightweight they feel great and I really
love the lavender powder in here it's my
all-time favorite all right so once I
have said everything in that we're gonna
go into the racks now so as you can see
we have a yellow powder here and a
lavender the yellow one is too
neutralized purple and brown you can set
any of the color correcting creams or
use all over to even out the skin tone I
personally don't do that I have a fair
skin tone and I like the lavender powder
for all over but I don't like the yellow
one and then the lavender powder
neutralizes yellow it sets pink creams
you use all over or to brighten solo
yellow skank seller or whites gift
didn't fix all those that was good all
right well so what I'm going to do is
tap in missing this BH Cosmetics fluffy
brush go into the yellow one tap off the
excess because they are a little powdery
and I'm going to go all over this like
eye area here underneath all over my lid
just to make sure that we are
neutralizing any sorts of blueish tones
there and I'm not going to use this one
all over my face because again I do have
a little more of a cool undertone in my
skin you probably can't tell right now
because the lighting looks a little
yellow but I do have a little more of a
cool undertone to my skin so the
lavender powder is what I like to use
all over then I'm gonna go into the
lavender and I'm just going to set
everything in put this all over I love
this I feel like it really does brighten
up the skin nicely without being too
pigmented like boom you have purple on
your face I think it's absolutely lovely
nice little kind of last touch finishing
powder sorry so that's how I personally
use this palette you can do absolutely
whatever you want you can try out
different methods like if you want to
use it with a brush or if you want to
use it with your fingers this is just
what works best for me and this is how I
can get this palette to work the best
for me I feel like it doesn't do the
best job at color correcting in my
opinion I feel like the powders are
decent at color correcting but I just
feel like the cream products are not
that great their oily they're kind of
slick they're not super opaque and if
you don't set everything in that they
will start to break up on your skin
throughout the day so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this demo thank you for
joining me and I'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
