sorry then we'll just want shaky shaky
anyway this video is going to be a
review and swatches on the new stila
correct and perfect palette i purchased
this online for $45 i will link below
where you guys can pick it up you can
only pick it up if you are idea the
exclusive member or a vib rouge member
right now i don't know when that would
change it probably will in a couple of
weeks but as of right now februari what
are we February's 17 2016 it is only
available to the IB and vib rouge
members so i purchased this like we said
445 dollars on these sephora.com website
this is what the actual palette looks
like I'm going to read a little bit
about what it says on these before our
websites you guys can get a better
understanding of the products but i want
to say really quickly i will be doing a
full demo on this product tomorrow so if
you want to come back to this video
tomorrow i will have the demo linked in
the description bar anyway it says on
the visa for website the Stila correct
and perfect palette is VIP exclusive
online only and it is $45 it is an
all-in-one color correcting palette that
neutralizes skin tone imperfections it
addresses every skin tone imperfection
and delivers professional quality
results leaving your skin looking even
natural and perfected it features 5
sheer to medium buildable color
correcting creams that let you achieve
flexible coverage while neutralizing
imperfections dark spots dark circles
redness and hyperpigmentation the to
finishing powders even out the skin tone
brighten and set the correcting creams
infused with an advanced are clay youth
revival bio available mineral complex
quite a basketball it minimizes the
appearance of pores and fine lines while
hydrating and providing oil control this
palette features 5 cream characters and
to press finishing powders to target
your skin tone concerns and the five
Queen correctors are peach for
neutralizing dark under eye circles pink
which brightens up I areas and mass
fatigue yellow which neutralizes
hyperpigmentation and dark spots green
which counteracts redness from rosacea
acne broken capillaries things like that
orange which contracts dark I under
under eye circles and also neutralizes
veins so the two press finishing powders
the yellow one is to set any correcting
cream and the lavender you can you know
set any pink correcting cream or
whatever you want so this is what the
outer packaging looks like it's really
really
cute I feel like stila has stepped up
their game lately all of their like um
aqua perfecting line and everything like
that is now in this beautiful little
gold box so I think that's really really
cute and then you get a little pamphlet
in here and it basically describes to
you what you're supposed to do with
these color correcting creams which i
think is great because color correctors
are now just now getting really really
hyped up on the market it seems like
everybody has released one from Becca to
urban decay everybody has we've been
releasing these kind of products lately
so i think it is nice that they go ahead
and they show you a little pamphlet on
how to use the products which colors to
use for certain areas and they show you
the basics because it could be kind of
like difficult like when you first look
at like a dark red color and your level
where do I put that or a green color
you're like where do I put that on my
face so anyway they do give you little
instructions on how to use this and then
this is what the actual packaging looks
like I think it's a really cute and
rides it kind of likes it's like 70s I
don't know it's like that weird little
pattern but it's cute I would have
preferred if it was all gold but it's
okay it is acrylic it is made out of
plastic you open it up you get a nice
sized mirror and then you get your cream
products right here and the best thing
about this guy's do you see this little
thing right here ah yes one more time oh
yeh yeh sila sheila is protecting your
cream products from your powder products
how many times have we had a palette
where the pre cream products or the
pattern products get into the cream
products oh yay stila they put a little
thing there and it is attached so you
don't have to keep putting it on there
but anyway you get your cream products
right here and then you get your to
finishing powder products right at the
top or at the bottom if you're looking
at it this way so overall I thought what
this palette was going to be a lot
bigger I don't know why but when i saw
it on the website i was just like i
thought this was a lot bigger i feel
like you don't get tons and tons of
products in here for 45 dollars but
overall i think it is a nice color
correcting little palette now i have
been reviewing a lot of color correcting
products lately everything from the back
up back lake targeted correctors i
picked up all of those i also picked up
all of the new naked skin color
correcting fluids and i have to say this
one just falls in the Legman category
for me it's just okay at the problem i
think one issue with these is that the
cream products in here are slippery
their little oily and
honestly and they tend to kind of
disappear on my skin no matter where i'm
using them and also they kind of
recommends that you use certain products
like certain colors areas on your face
which i wouldn't necessarily do like
they they recommend using the yellow one
to neutralize hyperpigmentation and dark
spots where as i always thought using a
peach or an orange shade would help
neutralize brown spots or dark spots on
your face the green one they do say it
neutralizes red rosacea acne broken
capillaries sunburned that's fine and I
like to use the green one anywhere where
I have active breakouts the peach one
they say you know neutralizes blue and
purple under eye circles I feel like
that is fine the pink one like brightens
and highlights and then the orange green
wanted they say to use underneath the
eye but it was a little weird with the
yellow one I always thought the yellow
was more for brightening properties and
I didn't really feel like the yellow
cream that was in here really did a lot
of brightening for my hyperpigmentation
spots at that make sense the oral i
think the cream products are just ok
again i think what i like about this is
the fact that they don't come in single
form like the urban decay ones or the
better ones where you have to carry like
10 of them with you if you want to do a
full face of light color correcting i
like the fact that you get them all in
one pallet but i just am not a huge fan
of the formulation of the cream products
i'm gonna go ahead and swatch them for
you guys so here is the peach one as you
guys can see this is kind of a thin oily
consistency and it's just not my
favorite because um i just don't feel
like there's enough opaqueness there and
also it's very very oily not humectants
you know the backup backlight targeted
correctors these are very very humectant
in my opinion they stay very very nice
and creamy on the skin but they're very
very pigmented whereas the back of one's
just feel slightly oily and like they're
going to move around on my face so
anytime i'm wearing them and make sure
that i set them with a powder because
that's how i know they're not going to
go anywhere because they are very kind
of oily and I was just having issues I
really felt like I had to set my under
eye area or if I was putting the peach
one along by um like jaw line where I
have hyperpigmentation I feel like I
have to really set everything in with
powder so this is the peach one and the
peach one is where i use i will i
personally use it for hyperpigmentation
and also anywhere where i have age spots
and in the next
here is the pink one and I like this for
like the under I like doing the V like
the under eye right here for brightening
properties but again the consistency is
just kind of thin and oily and it's just
not my favorite it doesn't really settle
into my fine lines like I don't really
notice that but I just noticed its
variance it's just not very opaque
there's not a lot of coverage at that
make sense the next one is this kind of
yellow one and this one is supposed to
be they recommend this because can't
really see how oily that is do you see
that formulation but anyway this is
supposed to be in my opinion I would use
this for just brightening up like blue
tones like on the inner corner of my eye
right underneath here where I get like
dark circles but they recommend this for
hyperpigmentation I don't really think
it does anything for hyperpigmentation I
go in with the peach one if you're
looking for a good like
hyperpigmentation color corrector the
next one they have in here is the green
one again just feels very oily and very
slick and I don't feel like it lasts
very long on my skin um there it is
swatched hopefully you guys can see I'm
trying to build these swatches up but
again they're not very opaque and then
the last one you get is that dark kind
of ready orange they call it orange
cream again look how slick that formula
is just just not my favorite this one is
a lot more pigmented I do like this one
for underneath my eyes also on to
contract any sort of blue tones and i
would say that one is my favorite one
out of all the cream products the orange
green one is my all-time favorite so i
think that the consistency is just not
great on the cream products I'm not
loving the cream products if this whole
palette consisted of just cream products
i would probably return this palette
however and absolutely in love with the
finishing powders they are beautiful i'm
happy that they are the biggest part of
this palette you get a lavender one you
guys please feel like butter on the skin
you can set your under eyes with this
you can set your whole face with this
lavender powder it is absolutely
gorgeous and so brightening it's got
gorgeous pigmentation it's a very finely
milled it sits on the skin absolutely
beautifully and then the kind of yellowy
neutralizing peachy one I think that's
what they call in this was also nice i
prefer the lavender one but this one is
really really nice if you do have a lot
of like dark blue underneath your eye
you can set in any of the Queen products
again those cream products are very oily
and kind of slips so i definitely
recommend setting them but you can set
in you know your under-eye area with
that yellow one or you can set your
whole face with it depending on your
skin tone I really really love that
lavender powder in there you guys
actually almost wish that they will make
like a separate like full size of that
powder because I would purchase that to
set like my entire face it is that
beautiful so overall I think that the
cream products are kind of a miss I do
love the packaging love that they put
that little um filme there so that you
can just take it off and none of your
powder products are getting mixed in
with your creams I think the powder
products are the standout in this little
palette I do like that it's in palette
form because it's travel friendly you
can travel with it you can bring it
anywhere and you have all your colors
here but I feel like you really have to
set those cream products and I feel like
they are a little oily if you have oily
skin combination skin these are gonna be
a little harder to work with if you have
dry skin sensitive skin aging skin you
might like these a little more than say
the Becker ones or even at the urban
decay naked skin one so overall I think
they're pretty good though we're time on
these is not fantastic again I think
it's because they are so oily and slick
they tend to break up underneath the eye
area and along here on my jaw line for
me after about three to four hours which
is not very good again compared to the I
don't mean to keep comparing it to but
the Beca ones these last forever and so
do the Urban Decay ones these we're for
like nine ten hours so the fact that
these start to break up after four maybe
five hours tops it's kind of like a
bummer you know and again I don't know
if it's because i do have combination
skin and they're just breaking that
because they have a very oily base um
but yeah this just seems to be what's
happening I don't know if maybe I need
to like double set it with powder said
it was powder and then go in with one of
these but overall I think that the
powder products are definitely stand out
in here so I would recommend going in
store and swatching this out I don't
know if this is going to be a forever
online exclusive right now as the
februari 17 2016 it is an online
exclusive but it may hit stores so
hopefully you can go in you can play
around with the texture see if that's
something that you're interested in if
you have oily skin combination skin I'm
thinking you may want to stay away from
this one but overall I think the powder
products in here are absolutely
beautiful that lavender
outer is giving me life okay so anyway
that is my thoughts of my review my
swatches on the new cielo correct and
perfect palette I will have a demo on
this palette tomorrow so you can come
back to this video and look in the
description bar it will be the first
little thing that you see and thank you
