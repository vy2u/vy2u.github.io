them just want shaky-shaky anyway this
video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Stila correct and
perfect palettes I purchased this online
for $45 and will link below where you
guys can pick it up you can only pick it
up if you are Idid exclusive member or a
vib ruche member right now i don't know
when that would change it probably will
in a couple of weeks but as of right now
February what are we February 17 2016 it
is only available to the IB and the IB
Rouge members so I purchased this like
we said for $45 on these sephora.com
website this is what the actual palette
looks like I'm gonna read a little bit
about what it says on these before
websites you guys can get a better
understanding of the products but I want
to say really quickly I will be doing a
full demo on this product tomorrow so if
you want to come back to this video
tomorrow I will have the demo linked in
the description bar anyway it says on
the visa for our website the Stila
correct and perfect pilot is VIP
exclusive online only and it is $45 it
is an only one color correcting palette
that neutralizes skin tone imperfections
it addresses every skin tone
imperfection and delivers professional
quality results leaving your skin
looking even natural and perfected it
features five sheer to medium buildable
color correcting creams that let you
achieve flexible coverage while
neutralizing imperfections dark spots
dark circles redness and
hyperpigmentation the two finishing
powders even out the skin tone brighten
and set the correcting cream infused
with an advanced article a youth revival
bio available mineral complex quite a
bath foam it minimizes the appearance of
pores and fine lines while hydrating and
providing oil control this palette
features 5 cream correctors and to press
finishing powders to target your skin
tone concerns and the 5 cream correctors
are peach for neutralizing dark
under-eye circles
pink which brightens up eye areas and
mask fatigue yellow which neutralizes
hyperpigmentation and dark spots green
which counteracts redness from rosacea
acne broken capillaries things like that
orange which contracts dark eye under
under-eye circles and also neutralizes
fades
so the to press finishing powders the
yellow one is to set any correcting
cream and the lavender you can you know
set any pink correcting cream or
whatever you want so this is what the
outer packaging looks like it's really
cute I feel like Stila has stepped up
their game lately all of their like um
aqua perfecting lying and everything
like that is now in this beautiful
little gold box so I think that's really
really cute and then you get a little
pamphlet in here and it basically
describes to you what you're supposed to
do with these color correcting creams
which i think is great because color
correctors are now just now getting
really really hyped up on the market it
seems like everybody has released one
from Becca to Urban Decay everybody has
would have been releasing these kind of
products lately so I think it is nice
that they go ahead and they show you a
little pamphlet on how to use the
products which colors to use for certain
areas and they show you the basics
because it can be kind of like difficult
like when you first look at like a dark
red color and you're like well where do
I put that or a green color you're like
where do I put that on my face so anyway
they do give you little instructions on
how to use this and then this is what
the actual packaging looks like I think
it's a really cute it might be kind of
like it's like 70s I don't know it's
like that weird little pattern but it's
cute
I would have preferred if it was all
gold but it's okay it is acrylic it is
made out of plastic you open it up you
get a nice sized mirror and then you get
your cream products right here and the
best thing about this guys do you see
this little thing right here ah yes
one more time yay yay Sheila Sheila is
protecting your cream products from your
powder products how many times have we
had a pallet where the pre cream
products or the powder products get into
the cream product so yay Sheila they put
a little thing there and it is attached
so you don't have to keep putting it on
there but anyway you get your cream
products right here and then you get
your two finishing powder products right
at the top or at the bottom if you're
looking at it this way so overall I
thought this palette was going to be a
lot bigger I don't know why but when I
sat on the website I was just like a lot
bigger I feel like you don't get tons
and tons of product in here for $45 but
overall I think it is a nice color
correcting little palettes now I have
been reviewing a lot of color correcting
products lately everything from the
backup backlight targeted correctors I
picked up all of those I also picked up
all of the new naked skin color
correcting fluids and I always think
this one just falls in the Legman
category for me it's just okay at the
prom I think of an issue with these is
that the cream products in here are a
slippery
they're a little oily and honestly they
tend to kind of disappear on my skin no
matter where I'm using them and also
they kind of recommends that you use
certain products like certain colors
areas on your face which I wouldn't
necessarily do like they they recommend
using the yellow one to neutralize
hyperpigmentation and dark spots whereas
I always thought using a peach or an
orange shade would help neutralize brown
spots or dark spots on your face the
green one they do say if neutralizes red
rosacea acne broken capillaries
sunburned that's fine and I like to use
the green one anywhere where I have
active breakouts the peach one they say
you know neutralizes blue and purple
under-eye circles I feel like that is
fine
the pink one like brightens and
highlights and then the orange green one
they say to use underneath the eye but
it was a little weird with the yellow
one I always thought that yellow was
more for brightening properties and I
didn't really feel like the yellow cream
that was in here really did a lot of
brightening for my hyperpigmentation
spots if that makes sense
so overall I think the cream products
are just okay again I think what I like
about this is the fact that they don't
come in single form like the urban decay
ones or the Becker ones where you have
to carry like ten of them with you if
you want to do a full face of like color
correcting I like the fact that you get
them all in one palette but I just am
NOT a huge fan of the formulation of the
cream products I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch them for you guys so here is the
peach one as you guys can see this is
kind of a thin oily consistency and it's
just not my favorites because I just
don't feel like there's enough
opaqueness there and also it's very very
oily not humectant you know the backup
backlight targeted correctors these are
very very humectant in my opinion they
stay very very nice and creamy on the
skin but they're very very pigmented
whereas the pepper ones just feel
slightly oily and like they're gonna
move around on my face so any time I'm
wearing them I make sure that I set them
with a powder because that's how I know
they're not going to go anywhere because
they are very kind of oily and I was
just having issues I really felt like I
had to set my under eye area or if I was
putting the peach one along by like
jawline where I have hyperpigmentation I
feel like I have to really set
everything in with powder so this is the
peach one and the peach one is where I
use eye
I personally use it for
hyperpigmentation and also anywhere
where I have age spots and then the next
one in here is the pink one and I like
this for like the under I like doing the
V like the under eye right here for
brightening properties but again the
consistency is just kind of thin and
oily and it's just not my favorite
it doesn't really settle into my fine
lines like I don't really notice that
but I just noticed it's a variance it's
just not very opaque there's not a lot
of coverage at that make sense the next
one is this kind of yellow one and this
one is supposed to be they recommend
this guys do you really see how oily
that is do you see that formulation but
anyway this is supposed to be in my
opinion I would use this for just
brightening up like blue tones like on
the inner corner of my eye right
underneath here where I get like dark
circles but they recommend this for
hyperpigmentation I don't really think
it does anything for hyperpigmentation I
go in with the peach one if you're
looking for a good like
hyperpigmentation color corrector the
next one they have in here is the green
one
again just feels very oily and very
slick and I don't feel like it lasts
very long on my skin
there it is swatched hopefully you guys
can see I'm trying to build these
swatches up but again they're not very
opaque and then the last one you get is
that dark kind of ready Orange they call
it orange cream again look how slick
that formula is just just not my
favorite this one is a lot more
pigmented I do like this one for
underneath my eyes also on to contract
any sort of blue tones and I would say
that one is my favorite one out of all
the cream products the orange cream one
is my all-time favorite so I think that
the consistency is just not great on the
cream products I'm not loving the cream
products if this whole palette consisted
of just cream products I would probably
return this palette however and
absolutely in love with the finishing
powders they are beautiful I'm happy
that they are the biggest part of this
palette you get a lavender one you guys
these feel like butter on the skin you
can set your under eyes with this you
can set your whole face with this
lavender powder it is absolutely
gorgeous and so brightening it's got
gorgeous pigmentation it's a very finely
milled it sits on the skin absolutely
beautifully and then the kind of yellowy
neutralizing peachy one I think that's
what they call it
this was also nice I prefer the lavender
one but this one is really really nice
if you do have a lot of like dark blue
underneath your eye you can
in any of the Queen products and again
those crude products are very oily and
kind of slipped so I definitely
recommend setting them but you can set
in you know your under eye area with
that yellow one or you can set your
whole face with it depending on your
skin tone I really really love that
lavender powder in there you guys they
actually almost wish that they will make
like a separate like full-size of that
powder because I would purchase that to
set like my entire face it is that
beautiful so overall I think that the
cream products are kind of a mess I do
love the packaging I love that they put
that little film there so that you can
just take it off and none of your powder
products are getting mixed in with your
creams
I think the powder products are the
standout in this little palette I do
like that it's in palette for him
because it's travel friendly you can
travel with it you can bring it anywhere
and you have all your colors here but I
feel like you really have to set those
cream products and I feel it like they
are a little oily if you have oily skin
combination skin these are gonna be a
little harder to work with if you have
dry skin sensitive skin aging skin you
might like these a little more than say
the Becca ones or even at the Urban
Decay Naked skin one so overall I think
they're pretty good the wear time on
these is not fantastic again I think
it's because they are so oily and slick
they tend to break up underneath the eye
area and along here on my jaw line for
me after about three to four hours which
is not very good again compared to that
I don't mean to keep comparing it to but
the Becca ones these lasts forever and
so do the urban decay ones these wear
for like nine ten hours so the fact that
these start to break up after four maybe
five hours tops it's kind of like a
bummer you know and again I don't know
if it's because I do have combination
skin and they're just breaking up
because they have a very oily base but
yeah this just seems to be what's
happening I don't know if maybe I need
to like double set it with powder said
it was powder and then go in with one of
these but overall I think that the
powder products are definitely the
standout in here so I don't recommend
going in store and just watching this
out I don't know if this is going to be
a forever online exclusive right now as
the February 17th 2016 it is an online
exclusive but it may hit stores so
hopefully you can go in you can play
around with the textures see if that's
something that you're interested in if
you have oily skin combination skin I'm
thinking you may want to stay away from
this one
but overall I think the powder products
in here are absolutely beautiful that
lavender powder is giving me like okay
so anyway that is my thoughts of my
review my swatches on the new Sela
correct and perfect palettes I will have
a demo on this palette tomorrow so you
can come back to this video and look in
the description bar it will be the first
little thing that you see and thank you
