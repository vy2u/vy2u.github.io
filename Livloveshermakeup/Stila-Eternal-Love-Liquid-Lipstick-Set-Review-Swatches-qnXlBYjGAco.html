thank you for joining me for this video
this is going to be a review and
swatches on a new little lip kit that
recently launched for the holiday season
from stila this is called the eternal
love liquid lipstick set and in here you
get three of their award-winning liquid
lipsticks so I have never tried the
liquid lipsticks from stila I've heard
so many good things so when I saw that
this little trio was on the Alta website
for twenty dollars I was like I had to
get on that so yes really really good
deal it is a 33 dollar value but it goes
for twenty dollars on the alto calm
website and I believe in store also I do
want to say if you are not into these
kind these three colors which are a very
very fall-like Sephora recently launched
on their online website they have like a
six piece set that goes for thirty-nine
dollars so basically you get three more
than you do in this kit for 39 or about
forty dollars and that one has more like
neutral and pink sort of shades but the
reason I picked up this one was because
I thought that these shades were so very
very fall-like so this is what they look
like I am wearing a basil right now on
my lips so if you are wondering that is
this gorgeous gorgeous true red color I
am wearing that on my lips right now but
the shades you get in here are boxy
which is this one it is like a very very
neutral kind of mob like pink undertone
your lips up better kind of matches my
nail polish which by the way is kind of
chipping sorry about that the really
really beautiful dusty rose neutral sort
of color and you then get beso which
like I said I'm wearing on my lips and
it's a beautiful beautiful true red
color and it has no kind of you know
orangie or bluish undertone it's just
like a red undertone all the way just
completely red and then the last date
you get is Rico which is this gorgeous
kind of deep plum II sort of mob color
so I thought that this trio was going to
be the best one for me to get because i
really really love these shades but if
you do want something a little more
neutral or you want something with a
little more pink tones you can go on to
the support calm website and look for
the new steel asset which has six of
them but just different shades so these
are a few of their like best selling
shades i believe and these are deluxe
size so you know you get a pretty good
amount of product in here let me see if
i can find how much is actually in here
you get point zero five fluid ounces or
1.5 ml so you get a pretty decent amount
in here and for twenty dollars i just
think that you're getting three gorgeous
gorgeous fall kind of neutral shades and
i have been wearing beso on my lips for
about an hour and a half now and they go
on very very glossy and then they kind
of dry down to a i would say demi matte
finish they never get to matt but it's
uncomfortable and you feel like um you
know you need to put lip balm on top of
it i will say when you before you guys
put this on you really want to make sure
that you do moisturize your lips these
are very long wearing and they can be a
little drying so you do want to do that
also I recommend if you guys have a lip
primer these will we're extremely
extremely well with one of those i
recently picked up the toothpaste what's
it called lip insurance lip primer one
of my subscribers recommended that for
me and i picked it up and with these
like on top that they will wear for
literally six to seven hours honestly
but without a lip primer i notice about
four to five hours before i have to
reapply I don't notice that they start
to like flake off you know how sometimes
with liquid lipsticks as they start to
progress throughout the day they start
to kind of flake off in certain areas
these tend to kind of go on my knee I'll
go on my lips and kind of fade evenly if
that makes sense which I really really
like I don't like when you have a liquid
lipstick and it starts to kind of peel
off in certain places I do notice the
most like amount of wear that I get is
definitely around like the inner part of
my lip but that's just because it's a
lot more wet there and that would make
sense and one thing I do want to say
when you do apply these you kind of just
want to keep your mouth open for a
little bit I don't recommend like moving
your lips together and going like this
huh just because it will get on your
teeth and I just hate when it gets on my
teeth especially with these like dark
kind of out there you know bright sort
of shades you just want to make sure
that you don't get them on your
but overall really great where time they
go down to a demi matte finish that's
very very comfortable on the lips and if
you you know apply them with a lip
primer you get really really great
staying power so let me go ahead and
swatch them for you the first one I'm
going to swatch is the kind of neutral
color called basi BAC I really really
beautiful and like I said they go on
pretty glossy at first and then they
start to wear down to or once they start
to dry they go down to it would say a
demi matte finish so this is a basi
really really gorgeous you guys can see
these are completely opaque and amazing
I'm so happy I picked these out because
I have never tried this formula before I
was so surprised that like I never have
tried them because I'm very very
impressed so beautiful beautiful kind of
neutral dusty rose but with like a taupe
undertone color so really love that the
next one is beso and this is the one I
am wearing on my lips right now is that
gorgeous stunning true red color I mean
there is no blue undertone or orange
undertone in here it's just read through
and through really really love this one
oh and the little applicator looks like
this kind of like doe foot really really
easy to apply really nice soft little
brush kind of tapered at the top so you
can really get into the inner corners of
your lips but that is a base so that red
color and then the last one is called
Rico and this is kind of like that ma
vie deep deep plum e dark dark vampy
color I love this one
these are just awesome these three
shades are amazing for fall so there is
Rico at the bottom so those are all
three swatched I would say if you are
someone who loves like a fall lip like a
really standout fall lip you will
definitely like these especially basal
and Rico but overall I'm just really
really impressed I'm very happy for
twenty dollars i think this is a great
way to try them out and these are three
of their you know top selling shades so
definitely definitely check this out i
will link below where you guys can pick
it up and I will also link below to the
set that they are selling on the Sephora
website if you are not interested in
these colors and because I know that
these are besides this shade up here
these two colors you know not a lot of
people are comfortable wearing those
kind of shades those bright or dark
shades so if you are not you should
definitely check out the sephora set I
will also link that below that one has
like I said more neutral pink lighter
colors so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this review and swatches of the new
little stila eternal love liquid
lipstick set and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
