thank you for joining me look at this
cute shirt I'm wearing today
it's Dumbo oh my gosh I love that boy he
is just too cute too cute anyway today
this video is actually going to be a
review on a new mascara that recently
launched from Stila cosmetics it is
called the huge extreme lash mascara
this is the box that it comes in and if
you guys have been like up to date with
Stila lately I'm still has been
basically like relaunching their whole
makeup line they have new packaging new
formulas of like everything and just a
bunch of new products so um this is one
of the newer ones and you can get this
for let me see here I have it pulled up
on the support page $23 on the
sephora.com website they only have one
color it is black and I am wearing it
today if you guys are wondering I'm
sorry but your squeaking my chair is
squeaky anyway um so like I said $23 on
the Sephora website they have one color
and this is what the actual packaging
looks like I think it's really really
beautiful I love gold so I'm very very
drawn in by this packaging right here I
think it's just very sleek and very nice
it's like it looks very similar I'm
going to be doing a lot of comparisons
to be better than sex mascara because I
think that they do have some
similarities so it's about the same size
as the better than sex mascara from Too
Faced and it has that kind of packaging
that's like shiny and this one's a
little lighter this one's more like
aluminum I think and this one's a little
heavier but it's very similar to the Too
Faced better than sex packaging so
basically another comparison I want to
make right away is the wand it is very
similar again to the better than sex I'm
going to show you guys the wands in
comparison but the first thing I thought
when I opened it up was that it looked
quite similar to the better than sex so
this is the better than sex and this is
the Stila you can see the better than
sex is a little more wide and the actual
like applicator is like a natural
bristle brush and so is the one on Stila
however this one has more of like a hard
whatever this part is called this long
part right here whereas this one is
definitely like rubber I think so anyway
those are what the wands look like next
to each other one side is a little
thinner on the Stila and then the other
is a little thicker and it's just that
natural bristle brush so I was really
excited when I opened it up because I
was like oh it's gonna be very similar
to the Too Faced better than sex which
is one of my all-time favorite mascaras
um the only thing that they have in
common is the packaging and the breast
brush looks similar because the formula
is absolutely different you guys can see
this has already gotten really gunked up
at the top here and that is because this
is a very very wet formula I really
don't think I've ever worked with such a
wide formula before in mascaras this is
just unbelievably wet and it's really
not my favorite um like I said I I'm
wearing it today this is two coats and
you can see it gets clumpy very very
easily within one coat you're gonna have
pretty clumpy lashes I personally do
like the look of clumpy lashes however a
lot of people don't so if you are
looking for a natural mascara that's
gonna give you like a lot of separation
and things like that this is not the one
for you and I think a lot of it has to
do not with the brush but with the
actual or not with the applicator but
with the actual formula because it is so
wet I find that it travels up here very
easily because the formula is so wet and
I actually during the summer and things
like that prefer something like the
better than sex because it better than
sex is a very very dry formula and I
feel like it stays on my lashes longer
this one just starts to run really
easily it's not good for the summer time
because it will start to bleed basically
very very quickly and you'll get it
underneath your eye and up here if your
lashes are long enough when you go like
this and they hit the upper brow which
it happens with me all the time or
beneath the brow you will get those
little smudges right there I applied
this about like an hour ago and I
already feel like it is starting to come
underneath and on top so really really
not very good staying power for an
mascara especially because
of the formula I think it's just the
formula is just so wet I think the
packaging and the applicator is really
wonderful and if the formula with a
little drier it would be much better
so basically Stila claims that this is
supposed to be great for like curling
like holding a curl volumizing and
lengthening and I think that it does do
those things I think because the formula
again is so wet it does not hold a curl
well at all
I actually like real my lashes everyday
for about 30 seconds and I can already
see that it's starting to droop a little
bit umm so definitely not good for
holding a curl um I think that's again
just because of the formula because it's
kind of a heavy wet formula um as for
thickening I think the wet formulas do
tend to do very well with thickening so
I definitely looks like my lashes are
quite thick and for length it's just
okay it's so-so
so overall for $23 I think that it's
probably not worth it I would say
definitely go out and try something from
the drugstore before you purchase this
just because the actual picture on the
sephora website like shows the brush
you're probably thinking right away what
i thought was oh that looks so similar
to my toothpaste but it really doesn't
have a lot of similarities the formula
is just completely different and it's a
little disappointing
so I'm gonna read for you guys a little
bit about what it actually says on the
sephora website though so it says the
Stila huge extreme lash mascara is $23
they only have that one shade in black
what it is a mascara with all-in-one
volume length and curl for dramatic
lashes and I would say if you think of
dramatic lashes as being like clumpy
lashes then yes it is quite dramatic
what it does brush on high drama with
steel is huge extreme lash mascara
smudge proof and long wearing totally
not either of those because it's so wet
and it's not waterproof it's just oh my
gosh it's smudging already and I believe
in learning it for about an hour and
it's not long wearing because it will
start to run especially I personally
live in Milwaukee Wisconsin and it
doesn't actually get too hot here during
the summer we're right on the lake so um
I would say like literally it's the
highest that it gets here in
temperature-wise it's like 80 degrees
and that's just sad this is already
starting to run like think about
live in Arizona or when I was living in
Manhattan like it would be like 106 in
August literally it'd be like 100
degrees really hot I mean think about
people like that like it is this is
never going to laugh I'm sorry I just
have to throw that in there but anyway
it says that it is much proof in
long-wearing it lets you create bold
beautiful lashes the triple pigment
saturate lashes with deep black formula
that is one thing that I will say that I
like the size of packaging and the
actual app applicator it really does
have that really nice dark color to it
it's not like a ashy black it really is
just like pure black and I do like that
I think it's beautiful because I do have
light hair I have light eyelashes so I
do like that um it says it's virtually
weightless color with every added coat
for a bullet ball and eyes looked
formulated with a blended a blend of
soft malleable waxes to keep lashes from
feeling clumpy or crunchy and that may
be the reason why it's so like slick and
it like runs you know when they have
those extra waxes in there um when I
feel it it really does not feel crunchy
at all it's amazing like that it really
doesn't feel crunchy at all however it's
like why do that if it's gonna you know
like seep off and run all over I'd
rather have crunchy lashes that's
something that's just gonna give way
like right away you know what I mean
it's just gonna give up and fly all over
your eyes formulated with a plant okay I
leaves the lashes without feeling clumpy
or crunchy it allows lashes to go fuller
than ever before the innovative wand
features dense yet flexible crimped
fibers that work to pull lashes up and
out coding every last year it is
formulated without fatal aids parabens
and sulfates what else you need to know
this product is ophthalmologist tested
and is suitable for sensitive eyes and
contact lens wearers so that's all very
nice like that's wonderful I don't agree
with a lot that they put in there
however there are a few things that they
stated that they were like you know
trying to create in the mascara like
they said too soft nice like lashes it
really even though it looks like I am
wearing quite a bit of master it doesn't
feel like I'm wearing anything so it is
really nice and I think the waxes and
all that kind of stuff it's like a great
concept but it just doesn't come out
well enough especially if we needs like
package
so nicely and you have such a nice wand
like don't do such a wet like I'm waxing
kind of for Nia I just don't think it
works right as well um I do have
combination skin and you know my eyes
area doesn't get too oily it actually
tends to be a little more dry so I feel
like you know just the fact that it
starts running underneath and up here
right away within 45 minutes to an hour
after application is just like
unacceptable and I just don't love it so
anyway that was my review those are my
thoughts on the new steel a huge extreme
lash mascara I hope you guys enjoyed
this I just have to throw out there if
you are going to splurge and you want a
really nice mascara at the Too Faced
better than sex I would definitely
recommend more than this deal a huge
extreme lash they do have similar ones
but don't be you know surprised if they
don't do the same thing for your lashes
they definitely didn't do the same thing
for mine one is a very wet formula maybe
you like that and one is a very dry one
the better than sex is very dry and the
Stila is very wet so yeah anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this review I hope it
was helpful and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
