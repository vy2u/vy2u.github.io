swatches of the Stila in the garden
palette I just posted the in delight
palette review and swatches so I thought
I'd go ahead and do the in the garden
one as well I have been using both of
these and I did purchase up at the same
time so I thought it was only fair to
review and swatch them at the same time
now this one does not have a mirror I
have no idea why but these are the
shades you get so I think a lot of
people probably think oh in the garden
so you think it's going to be all bright
colors but actually you have a lot of
neutrals in here with just a few um you
know brighter colors so I actually
really love this it does come with one
of those eyeliners if you watch my other
video you know I'm not a fan of this
formula this one is in the color
starfish these are the steel of smudge
stick waterproof eye liners I don't like
them because they skip you can see that
there's like open space but I do think
this one's cool it has sparkles in it
and it's kind of this mafia green color
so I like the color i just don't like
this a lot um so anyway here's the
palette again so i have the top row on
my right arm swatched and then the
bottom row on my left arm so let's get
started starting here with the lightest
shade right here this one is called a
chinois the next one is called breeze
this one right here is called bark then
you have free shop and rosette and then
starting here on the bottom row with the
lightest color this is nectar this one
is honey this one is sage this one is
the moss and this one is juniper so as
you can see they are super super
pigmented just like the Stila in the
light palette most of these are Matt the
in the light palette has a little more
like shimmer sparkly colors to it these
are not as sparkly they're a little more
matte but look at how many neutral
colors you're actually getting in there
guys do you see that you're really only
getting a few color pops like four of
them literally so i highly recommend
this palette um i think that you know if
you like having the random color pop but
you also just like neutrals like grey
have some gold you know just some nice
colors like this then you know go ahead
and pick this up the in the light
palette is a little more neutral but
this one is for the person who also
loves the color pop so um yeah I highly
recommend it it did come with this
packaging just like the in the light one
and it comes with this to the look book
of shadows so you can actually put
together they tell you which shadows to
put together for which look so I think
that's kind of cute i like when brands
do that and um that is my review and
swatches I really love it and i highly
recommend it so see you guys in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
