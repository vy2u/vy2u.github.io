I have a review and swatches of the
Stila in the light palette for you guys
this is what the palette looks like I've
been using this a lot the past probably
week and a half two weeks and I really
really love this palette and by that I
need the eyeshadows not the eyeliner
eyeliner in here is the Stila smudge
stick waterproof eyeliner and I really
don't like this in my waterline it just
disappears it gets smudgy gets stuck in
the corners here's the swatch of that
this is in the color damsel yeah so it's
almost like a deep deep deep brown
almost black color but can you see it
skips you know you can see little spaces
there that it hasn't covered it's
because it skips it's not good so not a
fan of that if the shadows absolutely
i'm a fan of a lot of these in here
remind me of my naked palette but some
of these are even more creamy and
wonderful than my naked palette so let
me just start out um so the top row as
you can see is warmer and the bottom row
is cooler so I have the top row swatched
here and the bottom row swatched here so
I will start with these the first one is
called bear the second one is called
kitten this color right here is called
bliss then you get sunset and the last
one there is called sandstone yes
sandstone and then over here we have the
bottom row so starting with the lightest
shade this is bubbly and then we have
gilded gold and then we have luster
which is this kind of like almost gray
color it's really interesting and then
you get night sky which is actually a
beautiful blue color with little
sparkles in it and then the last color
you get is called ebony and it's just a
black color but it's not super super
pigmented um so I really like that you
get these like warm colors in here but
then you get the cooler ones on the
bottom I guess I should hold it like
this you get the warm ones on top and
the cooler ones on the bottom and you
get a nice selection of mass
and shimmer in here there are no really
chunky glittery shades i would say maybe
night sky just a little bit but nice guy
really comes off more of like a gray
color if you guys can see that there so
yeah that's really kind of interesting
but um anyway so yeah I mean I love this
palette I love the eyeshadows not a fan
of the eyeliner like I said but the
eyeshadows are wonderful I definitely
see a resemblance to the Naked palette
maybe if you don't want to buy the Naked
palette you want to get this I could
definitely see that you can get some
nice pop of colors in here too and it
does come in this packaging um I didn't
know if there was anything in here that
maybe I needed to keep they just have
the colors on the back and then here
they have one of those little it shows
you what shadows you can use it's like a
shadow book and it shows you what kind
of looks you can create so it's the in
delight eyeshadow palette book book so
that is what you get with the Cielo
palette you can purchase this on
sephora.com alternate ulta you know
anywhere like that and i love it and i
hope you guys will look into it and i
hope you love it too so i'll see you in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
