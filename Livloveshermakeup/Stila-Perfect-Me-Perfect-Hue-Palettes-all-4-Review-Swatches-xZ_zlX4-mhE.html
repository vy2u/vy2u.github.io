video is going to be a review and
swatches on all four of the new Stila
perfect me perfect hue palettes I
purchased these for I believe 36 dollars
apiece on the Stila home website that is
the only place that they are currently
available as of right now which is what
April 7th
is the April 7 something like that where
in the first week of April so that is
the only place that these are currently
available and will go ahead and link
them down below in the description bar
people just want to pick them up and
pretty sure these will be releasing at
Sephora at the right now there's just no
talks on when that's going to happen so
if you're watching this video in the
future and they already released I will
leave some sort of little you know would
they do release at Sephora or alt I'll
go ahead and leave some sort of little
link in the description bar as well so
anyway I was really really excited when
I saw that these released just because
my friend Amy and I have been waiting on
these pallets forever I'm trying to be
posted a photo probably about two and a
half or three months ago of one of these
pallets and we didn't know that there
were going to be for that released the
only one that we saw what the legis was
which is this one right here which is
called Fair slash light and they had
posted a photo of this and I was like
that looks so beautiful you get five
eyeshadows in here in two blushes and I
was just like I'm all about that life
like I really really need that palette
and since then we have just been
stocking the supporter website they
steal a website literally trend mood
everywhere and finally they released
them and they released four of them
which I so didn't see coming so anyway
all of these are kind of labeled for
like your perfect hue so this one is
fair slash light and like you said in
each one you do get two blushes and then
you get five shadows the next one is
called light / medium which looks like
this very very beautiful again you get
two blushes and five eyes shadows the
next one is called medium / tan which
looks like this very very beautiful and
then the darkest one is called a tan /
deep which looks like this which is like
stein so anyway the credit points of
these palettes are basically to just
will give you a perfect hue for your
particular skin tone so you get I shadow
that are supposed to be complementary to
your skin tone and also blushes there
to be complimentary to your skin tone
now I picked up all four of them and I
understand that I don't have like deep
skin tone or a medium skin tone I am
fair to light however when I thought
that there were four I was like I have
to get them because I thought that some
of the darker colors and like the deep
palate we're just absolutely stunning so
anyway the up packaging looks like this
very very similar to the Stila aqua
color line if you've ever picked up any
products from them whether it be their
primer or their steel aqua glow
foundation very very reminiscent it's
just a kind of like pretty matte gold
box and then the outer rounding is so
cute so from far away you probably can't
tell but you guys this is a leopard
print okay isn't that adorable leopard
print and this is the exact same size as
the Stila come correct palette or I
think that's what it's called us that
the correct upper back palette I'm sorry
the Ceylon correct and perfect palette
it's the same exact size you do get a
nice or not a product in here you get so
let's see here 0.49 ounces or 14 grams
of product and you do open it up you get
a nice sized mirror and then of course
you get your two blushes and then your
five eye shadows so today I am wearing
this particular palette fair slash light
I did the no mirror makeup challenge
this morning and I feel like my makeup
still don't look amazing I put a little
more on and tried to kind of even things
out but I still feel like it doesn't
look amazing but these perform amazingly
amazingly well I am very very impressed
with these palettes I highly recommend
checking them out you can go and pick
one out that is like going to be perfect
for your particular skin tone or if you
really really like say the deep one then
you can pick that out because honestly
some of these just have just gorgeous
gorgeous colors and then and I
particularly my favorite one I have to
admit is a medium splash deep or is this
tan / deep sorry
tan / deep I think this has the most
gorgeous colors in it you're getting
like this super super dark like berry
blush color and a beautiful kind of
peachy color and then you're getting
just like gorgeous gorgeous like
eyeshadows in here I honestly just think
this one is probably my favorite out of
all of them I have decided to go ahead
and probably keep all of them I do want
to go ahead and just play around with
them a little more I'm thinking each
palette there is a little bit of a hit
and miss with certain eyeshadows certain
textures but for the most part I'm
pretty darn sure I'm going to be keeping
all for them because they really it just
I'm in love with them I think they're so
travel friendly and each one has a
different sort of blush in it has a
different sort of color variety in them
and I think they are all very very
different so let me go ahead and hold
them up for you guys you guys can kind
of see so this is ferrous flashlight and
this one is light flashing medium I just
want you guys to be able to see there
are differences there they are quite
subtle but there are definitely
differences there and then here we have
this one which is a medium flash cam and
then this one is tan flash deep so I
can't do this okay
medium flash tan tan / deep hopefully
you guys can kind of see so you do get a
little bit of colors in there that look
similar but honestly they perform
completely differently on the face which
is why I really want to keep all four of
them like I said perfect for travel I
honestly think the wear time on these is
the cream credible like the blushes wear
it like a tarte amazonian clay like 12
hour blush like they just stay on all
day which I absolutely love like I said
today I'm wearing at this one and when I
did the no mirror makeup challenge this
morning I used this very very light kind
of dusty almost like this reminds me of
Illamasqua skatey blush it's kind of
like a white undertone really really
cool toned pink shade but I did go in
with the other shade here which is
called on playful so the two of those
are called romantic and playful this
month's romantic this one's playful
really really enjoy these layered
together I feel like you can get a nice
a gorgeous kind of depth to your cheeks
and I think that's really nice as well
when they do have the face products in
there because you are literally getting
two different tones of blushes so you
can kind of use one to sculpt out your
cheeks and then you can use one on the
apples of your cheeks to kind of just
make them look a little glowy and pink
and pretty so anyway overall I think
they're really really fantastic the
blushes are incredibly impressive and I
will say the formulation on every single
one of them is a little different I find
that the eyeshadows really do we're
incredibly long as well not as long as
the blushes but if you wear a nice eye
primer with them they go on very nicely
I don't experience it ton of fall out
with the eyeshadows but one thing I
noticed is that it's definitely a hit
and miss between the
actual finishes like in each pallet I
feel like the mats are quite creamy I
feel like they have on this like shimmer
shade or luster shade in each one of
them that is super super buttery like
amazingly buttery and then you have this
one like kind of darker definer shade in
each one that literally almost feels
like cardboard or sandpaper and I'm like
really like why does it have to be like
that so for the most part I mean I would
say like 98% of each palette is actually
amazing and has really really wonderful
staying power really really great
pigmentation and is very very easy to
use and blend but there is one shade in
each one and it usually is one of the UM
actually now if it is one of the
eyeshadows that it just kind of is like
myth like not so great so I will talk
about those once I go through them and
swatch them but for the most part I
think these are really really fantastic
like I said I believe they are around
$36 I'm sorry I don't know the exact
price on the top of my head I'll link it
down below but I think for 30 35 or 36
dollars it is a really good deal because
they are so compact easy for travel you
get a big mirror they're really
blendable em scuse me they're really
blendable they're beautiful I just think
they we're an incredibly long time and
if you do have like fair skin tone or
really deep skin tone you can go and you
don't have to think about Oh which one
do I want to pick you kind of know that
there's already one that's going to be
complimentary for your actual skin tone
so let's go ahead and starts to watching
these babies we're gonna start with the
fair / light one which again looks like
this so we're gonna start with the
blushes the first one is called a
romantic which is a soft kind of muted
pink they describe it as a yeah kind of
like a soft muted pink and then we have
playful so here is a romantic and here
is playful as you can see they are
really really um buttery they can get a
little a little powdery but they're very
very beautiful so we have romantic and
playful and then the eyeshadows that we
have here let's see here the first one
I'm going to swatch is this one right
here I guess I'll just kind of swatch
them all on the back of my hand and then
tell you what they are alright so yeah
that like darker shade there can you
guys see that that like definer shade
that's the one that kind of drives me
crazy in each palette I feel like it
totally is like
like it's very crispy and kind of
difficult and you guys can even see when
I swatch it it doesn't swatch evenly but
the other ones do they're very very
beautiful
so the shades we have the darkest one is
called glamorous so this one right here
is called glamorous and then we also
have passionate breathtaking
so this one is passionate this one is
breathtaking and then we have dynamic
and alluring so dynamic and alluring you
guys can see that let me try and work
these up a little more for you guys
alright so as you can see that is the
fair flashlight palette and I feel like
for the most part it's a very very fair
and light palette if you do have deeper
skin tones probably wouldn't work for
you but I feel like this one is just a
very very neutral everyday sort of
pretty and I am wearing it today on my
eyes I have the dark chocolate shade as
like my definer sort of shade I have
this color right here which is called
passionate which is the lip color I have
that on my lid and then I did put this
color right here which is called dynamic
in my crease which I enjoy and by the
way they do want to describe or explain
on the back where you should put all of
the colors which i think is fun and cool
and datas alright moving on the next one
we have is light / medium and this is
light / medium you are getting a nice
kind of blush color and then you are
getting a deeper blush color that almost
has a little bit of like a topi or tan
sort of color to it
so the kind of topi one is called
angelic and then we have Charming which
is the pink shade go ahead and swatch
those for you so you have angelic and
then charming as you guys can see they
get a little powdery but I swear when
you blend them out they look beautiful
there they are angelic and charming and
then as far as the eye shadows of
concerns we have artistic which is like
the base we have dazzling which is the
highlight we have ambitious which is the
lid spontaneous which is the crease and
mischievous which is the liner shade so
let's go ahead and swatch those and
again like I feel like every single time
it's the lid or definer shaded that
is kind of a bit of like eating this can
you guys see that like when i swatched
it it just doesn't go on very evenly and
it bothers me because all the other ones
are super creamy and beautiful like
really really gorgeous but you can see
it's the a clear difference between
these and this so anyway I mean I feel
in every single palette it has that one
like definer or liner she that literally
is just a complete fail but for the most
part everything else is really good
which is why I am keeping them all right
and then the next one we have is the
medium splash tan palette so in here we
get kind of a berry tone blush and then
more of like a bronze II sort of blush
which I really really like I think this
one is really super super gorgeous so
this one right here which is kind of
like that bronzy color is called
inspiring and then we have the shade or
no I'm sorry this one's called
mysterious this one is called inspiring
I can't talk like backwards on the
packaging but these are just gorgeous
like these are super super gorgeous and
that um how is is it inspiring
I can't tell no I think this one's
mysterious alright yeah I got it this
one is mysterious this one is inspiring
but mysterious is gorgeous it has like
this beautiful kind of foiled appearance
to it love the way it going onto the
cheeks and I feel like it's like a
bronzer built into a blush and you get
this sort of like it's kind of reminds
me of narcissus orgasm you get a little
bit of like that peachy glowy color
really really beautiful and then the
actual eyeshadows that we have here are
curious which is the base we have
captivating which is the highlight shade
daring which is the lip color
feisty which is for the crease and
magnetic which is the liner and again
magnetic is the fail in the bunch
it's that plummy color and it just
literally it does not go on very nicely
like at all it might look like it's very
very pigmented and pretty but it feels
crispy and again like such a weak so
watch with those with those particular
shades and then the other ones just go
on like freaking butter so I'm like I
don't know what's going on with that key
I don't really know about that and it's
just kind of bothering me but for the
most part you guys can see these are
beautiful this one's like but it starts
like tugging too on your eye like you
can't really properly blend it out
like today when I am wearing the fair
and light palette like I said I have
that deep chocolate color which is
called the lam rest like on the outer
corner of my eyes and you just felt like
I could not blend that out like it
was just like it feels like a boy
tattooed on there which is kind of
bothersome all right and then the last
palette we have which is definitely
probably my favorite is the tan slash of
deep you are getting a deep mahogany
almost red blush in here with the
gorgeous peachy shade like this is
beautiful the color selection in here is
amazing and let's see here what are the
names of these the deepest color is
called Witte which is that gorgeous kind
of like maroon blush and then we have
vibrant which is that gorgeous kind of
peachy one so vibrant and then we have
Wicky so there they are together
look at those aren't those beautiful
like these are so pigmented you gotta
use a light hand with these especially
if you're fair and you want to get the
deep palate use a light hand because
these ones are super super um they're
very very pigmented all right and then
as far as eyeshadows go we just have
some more like kind of warmer tones here
we have on let's see here imaginative
which is the base we have brilliant
which is the highlight adventurous which
is the lid shade and mesmerizing is the
liner again really weak shade and then
we have flirty which is the crease shape
and this one is definitely just like
this veil and I don't even like it
because it's not a true black color it's
like a Navy weird black color I don't
even know how to describe it let me try
and build this up you guys will see when
I swatch it literally it's just like why
like it's so patchy like I just don't
get it it's so fatty it's almost like
see-through on the skin it's the
weirdest thing I swear it's the weirdest
thing on the anyway and then we have
let's see here this kind of peachy color
which is like the base color I love this
so pretty and I'm sure that if you did
have a really really deep skin tone like
that would be a gorgeous gorgeous base
color but all of the other ones again
they just go on beautifully so it's
really just that particular one that
goes on sort of strange as you can see
it's patchy and then the other ones just
glide on like butter so overall I hope
this watches are okay you guys know I'm
pretty darn bad at swatches but
overall I think that these are really
really wonderful palates again because
they're around 35 or 36 dollars and you
are getting so much in here you're
getting two blushes and five eye shadows
and I feel like you're getting nice
color arrangements like preset color
arrangement so you basically can go just
pick out the palate if you don't want to
sit there and be like what's gonna look
good on my face they literally just
decide it for you or if you have like
fair skin like I do and you want to play
the deep one or if you have you know
like deep skin tones and you want to
play with like the medium tone one you
basically can do whatever you want and I
just think they're beautiful they're
very very travel friendly I think
they're really really cute I love the
packaging and I really really like the
concept so I'm super super happy with
these I hope you guys enjoyed this quick
little review and swatches I definitely
give these aid two of those up for sure
because I think they're just really
really wonderful and although you know
yes there is one shade in each one that
doesn't work out that well I'm still
wearing it today still felt like I could
do it it just wasn't like an amazing
product um but I feel like for the most
part you are getting like a really
really nice good palette here and if one
shade out of like literally what's in
there we have seven different products
in there we've one product out of seven
in there doesn't work I'm okay with that
I can make it work and yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this little review and
swatches thank you for joining me and
I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
