review unfortunately this time it is one
i do not like this is the Stila a
portrait of a perfect eye palette really
really nice cute packaging very sleek
like this would be perfect for travel
but these are the swatches and it took
me three tries on each to get that kind
of color so not a fan I like pigmented
eyeshadows I like really smooth I
shadows these are not like that they're
kind of chunky and glittery the only one
that I really really like is that deep
chocolate Matt Brown it's very silky but
that's the only one which is surprising
because you know the Stila in the light
palette is super creamy and easy to work
with so I'm pretty disappointed with
this one um of course you know you can
build up the color but I mean 33 times
to get that kind of color and let me
tell you you know this dark shade that I
love that chocolate brown one fallout
city like I'm all over I mean it's all
over my cheeks it's all over my face
it's really just the messy little
palette which is unfortunate because it
is so compact and it is so cute and it
really has those nice colors that are
really in right now another thing I have
to complain about us I think they did
these light shades are very similar um I
don't know you know I just I'm not a
huge fan of this little palette um of
course I will work with it more and i'll
see if i can now get to know it better
awesome can I just complain about this
in here they have a little picture of a
brush just a little picture of it it's
not like they put it right in here not a
fan not a fan um just pigmentation is
not good I think if you're like a
beginner and makeup and you don't want
to use something super you know heavily
pigmented and just like because you know
you use too much this would be nice and
these are nice colors there are nice
shades but I could dupe these out of the
drugstore easily so it's too bad because
look house limited
this would be perfect for travel but I
don't feel like working at my eyeshadow
when I'm traveling you know I want
something like my lorac you know palette
that can just get it done in two minutes
so didn't love this um if you guys have
tried this and you know you liked it or
you didn't like it let me know down
below and um we can talk about it
alright guys see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
