have another holiday 2016 review for you
guys in this video this time we are
reviewing and swatching the new Stella
starlight Starbright highlighter palette
this is new it is limited edition and it
does retail for $39 on the Sephora comm
website inside of here you are getting
three bouncy ultra smooth cream
highlighters they are supposed to melt
into the skin for a barely-there feel
and they do have light diffusing
particles in them and they are meant to
be layered on top of each other the
actual packaging is very reminiscent of
the Stila aqua glow line I have an aqua
glow blush here and also the all top of
lo alto girl okay the Aqua glow primer
here as you guys can see they just have
a nice matte gold box the other
packaging just tells you exactly what it
does on the Sephora comm website on the
back and then it shows you these three
different shades that you are getting in
here transcendence is an opalescent pink
that you are supposed to add on top of
the kitchen shade for a bolder more
ethereal glow kitchen is steel as iconic
shimmery nude pink that brightens and
illuminates the skin and then the bronze
shade adds a radiant sunkissed glow they
say right here the usage is to wear
alone or blend together on bare skin or
on top of foundation and it says you see
TLAs wonder brush for face and body or
fingertips whatever blah blah blah so
here is the outer packaging like I said
you do get a sticker on the back and
issues you'd be three different shades
that you are getting you open it up and
you do have a nice sized mirror which I
do appreciate as always and here are the
three shades that you are getting inside
of this palette so right away I think
you can tell by how glossy they look
that these are definitely a cream
product they're kind of reminiscent of
like a color pop highlighter where they
have that almost cream to powder finish
they don't necessarily look like cream
on the skin but they definitely have
that really bouncy texture and if I were
to kind of push in right here you guys
can see it will make a dent so they're
very similar to those Maybelline Dream
bouncy blushes if you ever got your
hands on one of those this is very very
similar I will say the formulation is
actually very similar to that as well
because these are not ultra ultra
pigmented now I'm a Sephora calm website
they don't really claim to be they say
that you are supposed to go ahead and
layer these products
I definitely think two out of the three
in here are actually quite beautiful but
I will say this transcendence
shade right here transcendence yes this
particular shade which is the pinky one
this one does not show up on the skin
very well at all
I think it would be better as like an
eyeshadow on your actual eyes than on
your actual face because it just seems
like this one has a little bit of a
different consistency texture it's got a
little more powdery of a touch to it and
on top of that I think there are a
little bit more shimmer or glitter
chunks in here than the other two the
second shade that you are getting in
here is kitten and I love kitten kitten
is one of those gorgeous shades that is
one of steel as like fan favorite shades
I will say I do notice that the kitten
shade changes a lot I do have a
full-size of the kitten eye shadow right
here you can tell right here this is
more of like a champagne e color and
then I have this Stila all-over shimmer
illuminator in the shade kitten as well
I feel like kitten is always changing
it's either champagne color it's a
little more gold or it has a little more
pink I would say this one is very very
pretty I like this one the best is
definitely just a true champagne shade
and then the bronze shade in here is
also really beautiful so I think that
they're hitting up all sorts of
different skin tones here this will work
for all sorts of different skin tones in
my opinion this shade right here will
work as a highlighter on very very deep
skin tones the kitten shade in the
middle will work for fair skin tones and
also medium to light skin tones and then
of course the pale people get the
transcendent shade which happens to be
kind of like the shittiest one in the
palette I just don't really like the
formulation on it I feel like it's so so
so kind of almost chalky looking I don't
really understand what happened here
with the formulation but the other two I
do think are quite cool so I want to say
right away and this is one of those
products where you want to be wearing
pretty minimal makeup when you're using
this I wish they had released this
particular palette during the summer
time because my favorite way to apply
these is with my damn fingers I don't
know the last time that I applied a
highlighter with my fingers I just
normally don't do that even with my
color pop highlighters like I like to
apply them with a elf small stipple
brush or something that's a little more
densely packed than like a fluffy fan
brush or something like that but what I
like to do is literally just rub my
fingers in here and I will go ahead and
I will put this down the bridge of my
nose on the inner corners of my eyes on
my Cupid's bow my chin and then also
obviously on
cheekbones I just think it looks the
most natural and the best when you do
that I think I just got it on my chin
anyway I think it looks the most natural
and the prettiest when you do that they
do have that really kind of silicone
2-methyl cone touch to them so they're
very very creamy and soft very easy to
blend with your fingertips unlike say a
powder highlighter but I did want to say
right away these do not layer very well
if you are a girl who wears a whole lot
of foundation like I do on a daily basis
I wear probably about one to two layers
of foundation and on top of that I seal
everything in I have combo to oily skin
and especially during this time of year
I'm starting to get a little more dry
but for the most part I'm still pretty
oily and I do have to set in my
foundation no matter what foundation I
use unless there's a really really good
foundation that keeps seeing that all
day for the most part I do set in my
face so what I notice is that any time I
go in with a cream highlight or even
something like this which is almost like
the color pop texture or consistency
anytime I go in with something like this
on top of an already set face that is
full of powder these just start to look
really really cakey and they actually
start to break through my foundation so
you can literally literally see a
difference between where I put my powder
and then you start to see my skin kind
of showing through it's very very
strange and that's one of the reasons
why I tend to stay away from cream
highlighting products because I just
think they don't layer well so what I
think of this is if you are going to
wear like a skin tint or even the other
day I was wearing the Clinique pepp
start blurring moisturizer and then I
went ahead and I dip my fingers in here
I put it on you know down the bridge of
my nose on my chin wherever and then I
went downstairs to workout at the gym
this is best for really really natural
makeup days because I feel like it does
start to look cakey and kind of break
through your makeup if you are wearing a
full face of makeup so if you're someone
who loves natural makeup you don't even
wear foundation or maybe just a light BB
cream on a day to day basis and you also
don't set it in with powder you're
really gonna like these highlighters
they're very very very like barely there
they're very very pretty they do give a
nice like ethereal glow to the skin but
don't expect super super high impact or
anything like that now one way that you
can also use these is you can go in with
your foundation then you can put these
on then you can powder your face and
then go in with a powder highlighter on
top I have tried
I feel like these make a kind of nice
tacky base for the powder highlight that
I put on top but for the most part I
think these are really really pretty
when they're worn alone with very very
light makeup I will be going ahead and
keeping this palette because I do like
the formulation
I think the wear time is pretty darn
good I just don't like the way they look
when I layer them on top of a full face
of foundation it just doesn't look right
so I do think the formulation is cool
it's very innovative it's very very
different and I like I said I just think
it's a nice palette is it something that
I'm going to be reaching for on a daily
basis absolutely not but this will be
the perfect little highlighting palette
to bring with me when I go down to visit
you know my family's condo in Florida or
something like that somewhere in an area
where you're not going to be wearing a
whole lot of makeup but you still want
to have a nice glowy skin this is a good
pick so like I said the wear time is
pretty darn good on these I think it's
better if you do lock it in with a
powder highlight so if you want to go in
with these and then lock it in with a
powder highlight on top obviously you're
going to have a longer wear time but I
would say for a cream highlight these
last anywhere between five to six hours
on my face now you may be thinking
that's really really bad but I think for
me someone who has combo to oily skin
and I'm wearing a cream highlight I
think that's pretty darn good so not
much else to say like I said this
particular shade right here
I'm transcendence I don't think it's
very pigmented it's not very pretty on
the skin it's got a little more
chunkiness to it but these two shades
right here kits in and out so on bronze
are very very pretty and they can still
make your skin no matter if you have a
very fair complexion they can still make
you look very glowy so let's go ahead
and do some swatches right here we have
transcendence which I showed you guys
and if you look really up-close you can
kind of see there's a little bit of
chalkiness going on there so I'm going
to go ahead and swatch it for you guys
this is one swipe of a swatch as you can
see it goes on really seamlessly very
very pretty if I if I didn't know that
this was like a cream formula I would
think that that is a big jewel a
highlighter like a powder highlighter
but of course it's not but you know it
still goes on very smooth obviously the
next shade we have here is kitten which
is more of that champagne color there is
kitten probably my favorite one out of
the entire palette and then the last
shade that we have is bronze and this
one's also really beautiful it's got
more of a golden undertone than a
straight-up bronze color
you guys will see when I swatch it but
it's so pretty so there are the three
shades we have transcendence we have
kitten and then we have bronze I'm going
to go ahead and build them up now so
that you guys can really kind of see cuz
those are just one swipe swatches but I
do think that they could be layered
nicely I mean I don't particularly like
to use the transcendence shade like I
said but I do think that the bronze
shade and the Stila are the kitten shade
the Stila shade yeah the bronze shade
and the kitten shade do you layer it
nicely together so that is what they
look like swatch like I said they don't
have the longest most incredible wear
time since they are a cream product if
you are extremely oily maybe you just
want to use this on a day where you're
not wearing a whole lot of makeup you
just put it on lightly with your fingers
you can even tap it into your skin I
just don't think it looks good on top of
an already powdered face so overall I
would say it's a good palette it is
something that I'm going to use on those
barely there no makeup kind of days I
like it
but it's definitely not my favorite item
that has come out this holiday season so
I will be keeping mine again probably
going to stay away from this particular
shade but these two shades here I think
are beautiful I do like the formulation
and they're very innovative and cool so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and swatches on the new Stila
starlight Starbright college don't have
too much to say it's not something that
I absolutely do test it's not something
that I absolutely love it's just
something that I think is ok so anyway
guys thanks for joining me and I will
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
