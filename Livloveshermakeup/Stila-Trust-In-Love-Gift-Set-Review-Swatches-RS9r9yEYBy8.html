thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
today i will be reviewing and also doing
swatches for you guys on the new stila
trust and love gift set this goes for
forty dollars on the alto calm website
and in store in ulta stores you can only
get it at Ulta so you cannot get this on
the support website however stila did
put together a pallet with support on
the Sephora website that is an exclusive
only to support that you can't get it
ulta and that one includes four blushes
and more eyeshadows the reason I am NOT
purchasing that one is because the
eyeshadows do overlap so this one came
out first this was just the one I
grabbed like I said it is forty dollars
it is a hundred and five dollar value so
really really great value in this little
kit the other one I believe on the
support website goes for 59 or sixty
dollars so if you do want to spend that
extra twenty dollars you can get a wider
a range of eyeshadows and also for
blushes it looks really beautiful but um
this one came out first and I was
looking on the support website and I was
comparing I shadows and they just looked
very very similar so anyway um this is
the one I picked up I'm going to read
for you guys a little bit about what it
says on the altar calm website it says
the Stila trust and love gift set is
forty dollars it says nothing says love
like a special delivery of romantic
makeup essentials that take you from
morning to midnight and anywhere you
dare to dream this must have set
includes expertly selected shadows for I
looks for from safta sultry Steelers new
bestseller huge extreme lash mascara for
thick flirty lashes and a deluxe lip
glaze to make your lips mistletoe ready
the vintage-inspired packaging evokes
the beauty of expressing messages from
the heart and will make this collection
as pressured as a love letter so in here
you get an eye palette and there are 12
shades you get a deluxe huge extreme
lash mascara and a deluxe lip glaze and
apricots so i'm going to show you guys
like i said this is the outer packaging
stila has recently kind of revamp their
line and everything kind of has like
this gold matte look to it really really
beautiful it shows on the back what you
get and also you get these shades on the
back here they are not on the palate
which I don't like but you do get these
shade names back here so when you open
it up
you get this okay this is the packaging
you guys it looks like a little envelope
isn't that sweet like a little love
letter so it's really really cute it has
a magnetic closure so you just open it
up like that yeah and you get a nice
little mirror and then you flip it and
you have 12 gorgeous eyeshadows you get
the lip glaze and the mascara so this is
what they look like you guys I am loving
this palette I feel like the color
arrangement is so well put together the
shades are gorgeous you get a few kind
of jewel tones like that purple and that
beautiful blue but overall really
neutral really natural i am wearing it
today and just gorgeous you can put
together such easy pretty looks and they
are so pigmented so creamy they wear
very well if you you know use an eye
primer and i'm just absolutely in love
with this not so much because of the lip
glaze and the huge extreme lash mascara
if you guys saw my review on the huge
extreme lash mascara i actually did not
give it a good review i did not like it
alone on my lashes however about a week
later I paired it with the Urban Decay
subversion lash primer and I loved loved
loved the way it looked with that so
that is what I did today i'm wearing um
all of these products will not every
single shadow but a few of the shadows i
am wearing the lip glaze on my lips and
i have the mascara on but if you pair it
with a primer the mascara looks the best
with a primer so that i'm just going to
say that about the mascara it has a
interesting kind of wand it kind of
looks like the Too Faced better than sex
but the formula is different it's very
very wet and inky and so it can tend to
make the lashes look very very very
clumpy if you don't use a lash primer
with it and I'm okay with clumpy lashes
but i'm talking like extreme lumpiness
like you know that commercial for the
colossal maybelline colossal Lasher
whatever I never picked up that mascara
but when they're doing like the thing
over the eyelashes and they're all stuck
together that's what this looks like
without a primer so you definitely want
to pair it with a primer you can get one
at the drugstore I'm sure the L'Oreal
double extend tubes that one would be
good or you can get to the Urban Decay
subversion whichever one you want this
needs to be with a primer for it not to
look completely gunky on the lashes i am
wearing about one coat of it today i
think it is really beautiful with a
primer these Stila lip glaze is really
really nice if you don't know this
formula it is a little tacky it is a
little sticky it's basically like a lip
gloss and it has this nice little lip
brush and this color I think they really
were smart by doing this I am one of
those people that does prefer um you
know what just like spit all over I do
prefer a darker lip I'm I was just one
of those people I would rather have a
darker lip than a neutral lip but I
think they really did a good job with
this because this apricot shade is very
very neutral and I think more people go
for neutral lips then like a pop of
color so I think they really did put
this kit together berries like smartly
it's not gonna work right um they put it
together it was very very smart the way
they put it together is what I'm trying
to say but um the formula of these are
kind of tacky they're a little sticky on
the lips they're more like lip glosses
than you know like a lipstick they're
not full on color but they give tons of
shine and they stay that way I've been
wearing mine for about an hour and a
half and it's still very glossy on the
lips but this app apricot shade is just
really really nice and kind of like just
very very neutral and I feel like anyone
could wear it and yeah I mean they wear
pretty well you do have to reapply and
you know it does kind of get stuck in
your hair if you bring your hair down so
if you don't like that you know you
probably won't like this but then again
really the standout product in this
little kit are the eyeshadows so let me
talk a little more about the eyeshadows
like I said you really really can see I
mean I don't know if you can see but
these were really really well thought of
like the way that they're sitting next
to each other like this little quadrant
right here is like little like cool
toned you could put a look together with
that just purple and this blue go
gorgeously with this really really
pretty like I'm kind of penny color it's
just so beautiful you get a matte color
here another mat here that's great for
the transition just these shades go
together so well the ones I'm wearing
today I put this color right here in my
crease as my transition color
I have this color right here on my brow
bone and the inner corner of my eye I
then went ahead and put this in color
into my crease and then I also put this
one on my lid so overall I absolutely
love the shadows this is probably one of
my favorite kits so far because of the
eye shadows I just think they blend like
a dream they're so seamless you don't
have to put a lot of work into it you
don't have to blend forever and ever
they just blend out beautifully like
naturally on their own and yes so you
know they're super super buttery so they
do get a little bit of kick up so you
will have to kind of tap off your brush
before you put it on your eye because
you really don't want fallout underneath
but it's not like horrible it's not like
the Urban Decay advice for where I
literally get fallout and it's like very
very stuck on my face these are so
buttery that they just kind of swype off
really easily so really really really in
love and impressed with this kit mainly
because of the eyeshadows I highly
highly recommend getting this one so I'm
going to go ahead and swatch them for
you guys and let me tell you the color
names first so i guess i'll just go as
like they kind of number them back here
they go one two three four five six so
i'll do it that way so the first one is
called warm silver and it is a beautiful
well in my opinion kind of cool tone
silver but it's just a really buttery
silver color gorgeous has lots of
shimmer in it lots of like silvery
shimmer in it that is warm silver that's
number one I don't like that they don't
have the names on here I feel like I
have to keep the box now but of course I
won't because I don't like to keep the
box uh-huh number two is called fog this
is a matte cool toned gray really
beautiful gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
that one right there is fog oops didn't
do a great job is watching that
fog the third one is called nude shimmer
and it's kind of like a peachy it looks
very similar to steal as kitten I almost
thought this was kitten huh I have this
one on my lid today but it's right there
and that one again is called nude
shimmer really really beautiful the next
one is called clay and this is that like
beautiful transition color that I use
today it's just a like pinky neutral
neutral dusty rose kind of color perfect
for you know transition shade in the
crease all right so we wait put this off
continue on all right the next one is
called wait where am I i just did clay
so the next one is number five and that
one is called golden topaz this is the
one that i have in my crease today that
i'm absolutely in love with it is such a
amazing amazing color and honestly you
guys like the way that these feel they
are also butter even the mats and the
ones that have chunks of glitter and it
feel like absolute butter and they just
are so pigmented and beautiful and i
just i love them alright so that is
golden topaz the next one is called plum
and this is that deep purple kind of get
your like jewel tone sort of color
really really gorgeous as well it's kind
of got like a bit of your dessins to it
like a blue iridescent this one is matt
and they have all sorts of textures in
here and i really do like that um all
right after plum you get black pearl
this one has a micro glitter in it but
it still feels really really nice like
very very creamy it's kind of like a
grayish black color with tons and tons
of silver shimmer right there
hey let me wipe those
alright the next one is called stone
number eight and this one is kind of
like a warmer gray in my opinion it's
kind of like a I describe this kind of
got like a taupe undertone kind of Toby
gray color but it's really really pretty
it almost has a bit of like red or like
um I don't even know how to like golden
in it it's hard to describe can you guys
see that very very interesting color
like that a lot the next one is called
sapphire this is that gorgeous gorgeous
blue color oh love it and you know these
this one and the purple one are great
for like a pop of color underneath the
lower lashline gorgeous
really really pretty and then let's see
here we have number 10 which is metallic
bronze and this one's also really
gorgeous it's kind of like a deeper um
not so much like copper is just like
kind of like a ready brown metallic sort
of color right there wait them love just
love the textures in here you guys if
you are someone who like looked at the
Urban Decay vice for palin you were like
there's too many pops of color in there
but you still like pops of color once in
a while this one is a great palette for
you because you do have that blue you
have that purple but everything else is
neutral alright the next one is called
snowflake it's number 11 this is the one
I have on the inner corner of my eyes
and my brow bone today is a beautiful
shimmery like whitish color with like a
beautiful beautiful pink undertone you
guys see that it's so opaque it's
amazing and the last one is called light
pink and this one is a matte and I think
that this could be really really nice on
the brow bone for a lot of different
skin tones it just kind of brightens up
that you know brightens up that area if
you don't want to go with the shimmer it
is a little like pink toned and honestly
for fair skinned people like me it might
not be light enough to really like give
like lift underneath the brow so that's
kind of a bummer I wish they had gone
with maybe like a matte white but it
will show up for most people so anyway
those are all of the eyeshadows swatched
like I said absolutely gorgeous I'm
loving the pigmentation I'm loving the
texture the texture is like identical
for the mats and the shimmers and the
micro glitters it's just amazing that
they really kind of figure it out any
formula that is so beautiful like you
don't even have to think about like oh I
putting micro glitter on now it just
feels the same all of them feel the same
so they are absolutely gorgeous I would
say definitely pick up this palette
mainly for the eyeshadows the lip glaze
is great I mean those are nice to have
and if you're going to use the mask here
you might want to try out a primer or
have a lash
comme ready to kind of unclamp your
lashes but overall get this for the
shadows just amazing like I said the
Sephora one does have color overlap with
the shadows so if you are interested you
can definitely look into that one you
get even more shadows with that one
which is so excited and you also get
four blushes so anyway I'm absolutely
loving this this is probably one of my
favorites that I have gotten so far this
year for holiday kits I just think the
eyeshadows are amazing so I hope you
guys enjoyed my thoughts and my review
and swatches on this new little kit from
stila um I will see you in my next video
I guess bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
