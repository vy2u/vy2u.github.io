this video I'm sharing with you guys
this kind of warm subtle toned look I
guess you could say that I have over
here on this side of my face I have done
my cheeks on this side my eyebrows and
my lips as well but I wanted to show you
guys the I look on this side it was
requested by one of my subscribers that
I do something like warm based like kind
of like a warm I look and I personally
have a cool undertone in my skin so
normally I reach for cool toned colors
but I thought because i am doing the one
month one pallet challenge with my Too
Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
this month I could put together a warm
toned look using some of the warm tone
colors in here like peanut butter bonbon
caramel and I just thought that that
would be really really nice and pretty
and I did add in a little bit of Urban
Decay glitter eyeliner I know that this
is a um i think is it discontinued
products but i know that nyx has
something very very similar to this this
is in the shade baked it's kind of what
I put all over my lid just to add a
little bit of sparkle and yeah I thought
I would just walk you guys through how
to put this little look together really
quickly I want to walk you guys through
and the products that I already used on
my face I'm sorry if I have a little bit
of a sniffly nose um I keep thinking I'm
coming down with a cold and then it goes
away and then it comes back again but
anyway so the first thing that I used
was my time bomb face primer from the
bone and this is really nice it had a
very um how would I describe it very
silicone like texture but it's very
light on the skin and then on my eyes I
used the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion and then I went in with my
foundation and concealer i used my Laura
Mercier handle glow soft luminous
foundation in the shade shell and I used
one layer of that all over and then I
used my tart rainforest of the sea aqua
sealer in the shade fair and I used that
on any little acne scars bumps used to
highlight my face all that kind of stuff
and then I went in with my Rimmel stay
matte long-lasting pressed powder in the
shade transparent and then I also went
in and did the buffing technique with my
it cosmetics bye bye pores poreless
finish HD micro powder and then I went
in on my cheeks and I probably should
have shown this on camera I just I did
it in the mirror and then I was like oh
I understand that I'm
but I went in with warm tone blushes so
you could put together this whole look
like and have really really nice warm
tone cheeks as well as lips so I used my
NYX blush in the shade cinnamon and then
I just used a tiny bit of that as a
super super pigmented and then I went on
top of it with my mask sheer tone
shimmer blush in the shade Sun Basque
I'm sorry i forgot to do this on camera
or you guys I probably should have but I
totally forgot and then I was like oh I
already did the blood on the side of my
face but anyway and then I went in with
my baked bronzer in 129 T key from hard
candy to highlight my face it's a very
warm toned highlight very pretty and
then on my lips I used my x 2 dual ended
lipstick in the shade date which is a
really really nice kind of peachy nude
shade and then I topped it with my NYX
butter gloss in the shade tiramisu so
anyway that's kinda what's going on with
my face I apologize I probably should
have just done like this side and then
done this side on camera but that is
what is on my face so anyway let me show
you guys how I put together this really
kind of subtle lightweight um I look I
want to say it's lightweight but I feel
like because there's glitter on it it's
kind of not but it's settled there's not
too much going on with like lashes or
anything like that so let's just get
right into it the first thing I'm going
to do is go ahead and put on my next
slide on eyeliner in the shade SL 16
golden bronze it looks like this and I'm
going to put this all over my watch her
line and I just love this shade it's so
so so so pretty you guys it's like a
beautiful kind of just golden brown
shade I don't know how else to describe
it so we're just putting that all over
the water line and you can go on a
little messily it doesn't matter it's
just there is kind of like a little base
and then I'm going to go in with my
Sigma e-40 brush and I'm going to go
right into my Too Faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette and I'm going to
take this shade right here called
coconut cream I'm going to tap it off
and then put this all over my eyelid all
the way up to my brow and even a little
bit underneath my
I and on the inner corner just like that
and then I'm going to go into the shade
nougat I'm going to take that with the
same brush tap off the excess and use
that as my transition shade right into
my crease I'm just putting it on really
quickly a little sloppily it doesn't
matter i just want to have a nice kind
of base in the crease just like that and
then the next thing i'm going to do is
go in with my sigma tapered blending
ether t5 brush and I'm going to take
this shade right here called peanut
butter which is a beautiful kind of warm
tone to almost orangie shade and I'm
just going to place that right into my
crease and put it down a little bit on
to my lid as well I'm just going in back
and forth why purse why promotions I
never know how to say that oh good Nancy
guys know I'm not a makeup artists or
anything I know they say like windshield
Swiper wiper motions whatever it is
that's what I'm doing going back and
forth kind of gently in the crease just
putting down a nice amount of color
right there and then I'm going to go
into my more fees with this m4 for one
which is basically a Duke for the sigma
e35 if you're looking for one and I'm
just going to go back and forth and kind
of blend out that color make sure there
are no harsh lines doing a little bit of
circular motions as well all right and
then I'm going to go in with my morphe
I'm sorry my Sigma blending e25 brush
and on one side I'm going to go into the
shade bonbon and I am going to put that
all over my lid I love this shade it's
beautiful and it's just really really
pretty it's really going to make the
eyes look nice and warm I feel like the
peanut butter shade the caramel shade
and the bonbon shade in here are all
really really pretty and warm toned and
I'm just going to flip that brush over
and go into the shade caramel and we're
going to do kind of like it inside out
outer V if that makes sense so we're
actually putting a lighter color than
the one we put in our crease and I'm
just putting out onto my outer V just
like that and then I'm going to go back
into a clean a difference efore t a
blending brush from sigma and just go
back and forth do circular motions
whatever I need to do to blend out all
of those colors together
alright and then i am going to go in to
this little brush that I got in my Urban
Decay reloaded palette it looks like
this and I'm going to take this side
right here and I'm going to dip into
peanut butter and I'm going to put that
on the outer parts of my lower lash line
and then I'm going to dip into caramel
I'm going to put that on the middle part
and I'm going to dip into bonbon and put
that on the inner part all the way in
just like that and then I'm going to go
in with my Urban Decay glitter eyeliner
in the shape baked I'm just going to pop
this all over my lid I really really
like it I think it's pretty and sparkly
and you could just leave it here and put
on your mascara and it's a nice kind of
settle warm toned look but i thought
it's just fun to add a little bit of
sparkle right onto the lid so i'm just
putting that on you have to put a few
layers on for it to really kind of build
up but i think it's so pretty it's PE
and again it is a glitter eyeliner you
could use this with just a straight-up
of glitter I just don't have a glitter
that has like a warm tone shade like
this all of them were cool toned and I
really wanted to keep the eye look very
very warm tone so I'm just going to
putting this all over and then I'm going
to go back to that morphy &amp;amp; 441 brush
and I'm just going to blend out any
little edges or harsh lines that we
might have tipped back into coconut crab
hit that right underneath the brow and
then i'm going to go ahead and curl my
eyelashes i'm just going to let it sit
for a sec because this is a glitter
eyeliner so it needs to dry a little bit
and then I'm going to curl my eyelashes
for 10 seconds I use my Revlon lash
curler if you are curious it's like that
and then I'm going to go in with my
Urban Decay subversion thicker longer
stronger lash primer i'm going to apply
this to my upper and lower
ashes and we're going to go in with two
separate drugstore mascaras I love this
eye primer or this eyelash primer you
guys it is the best one it makes my
lashes thicken up so nicely and the
little fibers like don't get into my eye
sometimes you get fibers in like um in
these kind of like lash primers you get
like the actual fibers that let go into
your eye and it hurts so bad days but
this one's nice because it stays really
really nice and wet and I'm gonna let it
sit there for a second get a little
tacky and I'm going to go in with my
physicians formula sexy booster cat I
collection mascara and ultra black look
at these colors look at this it has like
a velvet on it without a/c sexiest
mascara packaging ever and then I'm
going to go in with this wand and I'm
just going to put this on my upper
lashes it's a really really big chunky
wand so I have issues putting it on my
lower lashes because I literally poke
myself in the eye every time that really
doesn't feel good so I like this because
it doesn't really lengthen or anything
like that all it does is really volumize
the lashes but i like that i think it
looks pretty so just putting one layer
of that on and then i'm going to go in
on the lower lashes with my wet wild
this is the max volume plus mascara I
love this such a good mascara and I'm
going to take this on my lower lashes
and then maybe a little bit on the upper
if I feel like they need to be a little
separated this one just defines a little
more and I really like the way the wand
fits right onto my lower lashes
hopefully I'm still in in a frame on the
camera still need to figure out the
whole mirror situation for what I do
tutorials all right I'm just gonna take
a little bit to kind of define the upper
ones and that is it not too much mascara
I'm just trying to keep it a little I
mean I feel like that was kind of a lot
of Asterix but he's like three different
mascara products but usually I really
like really defined lashes so I really
like to clump them up but I like the way
that this looks I think it looks nice
and yeah so that is the I love you guys
and I told you guys what I'm wearing on
my cheeks and my face and everything I
hope you enjoyed this little warm toned
makeup tutorial and let me know if you
would like to see any other tutorials

bar palette I will be doing I think I
get ready with me later this hour
this coming week but i would get ready

I'm going to do i'll probably just
randomly pick products out of here and
pick I shadows out of here and just kind
of do look on camera with you guys but

would like to see with any particular
