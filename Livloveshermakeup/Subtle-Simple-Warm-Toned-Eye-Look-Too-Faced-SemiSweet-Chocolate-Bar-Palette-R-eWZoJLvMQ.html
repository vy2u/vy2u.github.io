this video I'm sharing with you guys
this kind of warm subtle toned look I
guess you could say that I have over
here on this side of my face I have done
my cheeks on this side my eyebrows and
my lips as well but I wanted to show you
guys the eye look on this side it was
requested by one of my subscribers that
I do something like warm base like kind
of like a warm I look and I personally
have a cool undertone in my skin so
normally I reach for cool toned colors
but I thought because I am doing the one
month one palette challenge with my Too
Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
this month I couldn't put together a
warm toned look using some of the warm
tone colors in here like peanut butter
bonbon caramel and I just thought that
that would be really really nice and
pretty and I did add in a little bit of
Urban Decay clitter eyeliner I know that
this is a um I think is it discontinued
products but I know that NYX has
something very very similar to this this
is in the shade baked it's kind of what
I put all over my lid just to add a
little bit of sparkle and yeah I thought
I would just walk you guys through how
to put this little look together really
quickly I want to walk you guys through
the products that I already used on my
face I'm sorry if I have a little bit of
a sniffily nose um I keep thinking I'm
coming down with a cold and then it goes
away and then it comes back again but
anyway so the first thing that I used
was my time bomb face primer from the
balm and this is really nice it has a
very how would I describe it very
silicone like texture but it's very
light on the skin and then on my eyes I
used the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion and then I went in with my
foundation and concealer I used my Laura
Mercier hambo glow soft luminous
foundation in the shade shell and I used
one layer of that all over and then I
used my Tarte rainforest of the sea aqua
sealer in the shade fair and I used that
on any little acne scars bumps they used
it to highlight my face all that kind of
stuff
and then I went in with my Rimmel stay
matte long-lasting pressed powder in the
shade transparent and then I also went
in and did the buffing technique with my
it cosmetics bye bye pores poreless
finish HD micro powder and then I went
in on my cheeks and I probably should
have shown this on camera I just I did
it in the mirror and then I was like
understand that on camera but I went in
with warm toned blushes that you could
put together this whole look like and
have really really nice warm toned
cheeks as well as lips so I used my NYX
blush in the shade cinnamon and then I
just used a tiny bit of that because
it's super super pigmented and then I
went on top of it with my mask sheer
tone shimmer blush in the shade Sun mask
I'm sorry I forgot to do this on camera
for you guys I probably should have but
I totally forgot and then I was like oh
I already did the blush on this side of
my face but anyway and then I went in
with my baked bronzer in 1:29 Tiki from
hard candy to highlight my face it's a
very warm toned highlight very pretty
and then on my lips I've used my bite
too dual ended lipstick in the shade
beet which is a really really nice kind
of peachy nude shade and then I topped
it with my NYX butter gloss in the shade
tiramisu so anyway that's kind of what's
going on with my face I apologize I
probably should have just done like this
side and then done this side on camera
but that is what is on my face so anyway
let me show you guys how I've put
together this really kind of subtle
light weight I look I want to say it's
light weight but I feel like because
there's glitter on it it's kind of not
but it's subtle there's not too much
going on with like lashes or anything
like that so let's just get right into
it the first thing I'm going to do is go
ahead and put on my next slide on
eyeliner in the shade SL 16 golden
bronze it looks like this and I'm going
to put this all over my watch her line
and I just love this shade it's so so so
so pretty you guys it's like a beautiful
kind of just golden bronze shade I don't
know how else to describe it so we're
just putting that all over the waterline
and it can go on a little messily it
doesn't matter it's just there's kind of
like a little base and then I'm gonna go
either with my Sigma e-40 brush and I'm
gonna go right into my Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette and I'm
gonna take this shade right here called
coconut cream I'm gonna top it off and
then put this all over my eyelid all the
way up to my brow and even a little bit
underneath
I and on the inner corner just like that
and then I'm going to go into the shade
nougats I'm gonna take that with the
same brush tap off the excess and use
that as my transition shade right into
my crease I'm just putting it on really
quickly a little sloppily it doesn't
matter I just want to have a nice kind
of base in the crease just like that and
then the next thing I'm going to do is
go in with my Sigma tapered blending a
35 brush and I'm going to take this
shade right here called peanut butter
which is a beautiful kind of warm tone -
almost orange shade and I'm just gonna
place that right into my crease and put
it down a little bit on to my lid as
well I'm just going in back and forth
wiper wiper motions I never know how to
say that
oh goodness you guys know I'm not a
makeup artist or anything I know they
say like windshield wiper wiper motions
whatever it is that's what I'm doing
going back and forth kinda gently in the
crease just putting down a nice amount
of color right there and then I'm going
to go into my more fees look at the m4
for one which is basically a dupe for
the Sigma e35 if you're looking for one
and I'm just gonna go back and forth and
kind of blend out that color make sure
there are no harsh lines doing a little
bit of circular motions as well alright
and then I'm going to go in with my
morphe I'm sorry my Sigma blending e25
brush and on one side I'm gonna go into
the shade of bonbon and I am going to
put that all over my lid I love this
shade it's beautiful and it's just
really really pretty it's really gonna
make the eyes look nice and warm I feel
like the peanut butter shade the caramel
shade and the bonbon shade in here are
all really really pretty and warm toned
and I'm just gonna flip that brush over
and go into the shade caramel and we're
gonna do kind of like it inside out
outer V if that makes sense so we're
actually putting a lighter color than
the one we put in our crease and I'm
just putting out onto my outer V just
like that and then I'm gonna go back
into a clean a difference efore t ab
blending brush from sigma and just go
back and forth do circular motions
whatever I need to do to blend out all
of those colors together
all right and then I am going to go in
to this little brush that I got in my
Urban Decay reloaded palette it looks
like this and I'm going to take this
side right here and I'm going to dip
into peanut butter and I'm going to put
that on the outer parts of my lower lash
line and then I'm going to dip in to
caramel I'm gonna put that on the middle
part then I'm going to dip into bonbon
and put that on the inner part all the
way in just like that and then I'm going
to go in with my Urban Decay glitter
eyeliner in the shape baked and I'm just
gonna pop this all over my lid I really
really like it I think it's pretty and
sparkly and you could just leave it here
and put on your mascara and it's a nice
kind of subtle warm toned look but I
thought it's just fun to add a little
bit of sparkle right onto the lid so I'm
just putting that on you have to put a
few layers on for it to really kind of
build up but I think it's so pretty and
again it is a glitter eyeliner you could
use this with just a straight up of
glitter I just don't have a glitter that
has like a warm tone shade like this all
of them are cool toned and I really
wanted to keep that eye look very very
warm tone so I'm just kind of putting
this all over and then I'm going to go
back to that morphe and four-for-one
brush and I'm just going to blend out
any little edges or harsh lines that we
might have dip back into coconut creme
hit that right underneath the brow and
then I'm going to go ahead and curl my
eyelashes I'm just gonna let it sit for
a sec because this is big glitter
eyeliner so it needs to dry a little bit
and then I'm going to curl my eyelashes
for 10 seconds
I use my Revlon lash curler if you are
curious like that and then I'm going to
go in with my Urban Decay subversion
thicker longer stronger lash primer I'm
going to apply this to my upper and
lower
relax and we're gonna go in with two
separate drugstore mascaras I love this
eye primer or this eyelash primer you
guys it is the best one it makes my
lashes thicken up so nicely and the
little fibers like don't get into my eye
sometimes you get fibers in like in
these kind of like last primers you get
like the actual fibers that let go into
your eyes but this one's nice because it
stays really really nice and wet and I
am gonna let it sit there for a second
get a little tacky and then I'm gonna go
in with my Physicians Formula sexy
booster cat eye collection mascara and
ultra black look at these colors look at
this it has like a velvet on it we
thought it's the sexiest mascara
packaging ever and then I'm gonna go in
with this wand and I'm just gonna put
this on my upper lashes it's a really
really big chunky wand so I have issues
putting it on my lower lashes because I
literally poked myself in the eye every
time doesn't feel good so I like this
because it doesn't really lengthen or
anything like that all it does is really
volumize the lashes but I like that I
think it looks pretty so just putting
one layer of that on and then I'm gonna
go in on the lower lashes with my wet n
wild this is the max volume plus mascara
I love this such a good mascara and I'm
going to take this on my lower lashes
and then maybe a little bit on the upper
if I feel like they need to be a little
separated this one just defines a little
more and I really like the way the wand
fits right onto my lower lashes
hopefully I'm still in in a frame on the
camera still need to figure out the
whole mirror situation for what I do
tutorials
alright I'm just gonna take a little bit
to kind of define the upper ones and
that is it not too much mascara I'm just
trying to keep it a little I mean I feel
like that was kind of a lot of mascara
but he's like three different mascara
products but usually I really like
really defined lashes so I really like
to clump them up but I like the way that
this looks I think it looks nice and
yeah so that is the I love you guys and
I told you guys what I'm wearing on my
cheeks and my face and everything I hope
you enjoyed this little warm toned
makeup tutorial and let me know if you
would like to see any other tutorials
with the Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette I will be doing I think I
get ready with me later this
or this coming week but we've get ready
with me videos I don't really know what
I'm gonna do I'll probably just randomly
pick products out of here and pick a
shadows out of here and just kind of do
look on camera with you guys but if you
have any sort of look that you would
like to see with any particular shades
