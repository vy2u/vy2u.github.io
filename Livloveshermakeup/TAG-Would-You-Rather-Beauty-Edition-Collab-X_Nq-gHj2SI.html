you so much for joining me i hope you
are all having an absolutely fantastic
day this video is going to be a
collaboration with one of my younger
subscribers here on youtube she's
adorable and sweet as pie her name is
Julia and she reached out to me on my
email sent me a beautiful little message
and asked if I would like to do a
collaboration with her and I said
absolutely so we put together a really
fun little collaboration video for you
guys today it is actually a beauty tag
and it is called the would you rather
beauty edition tag from head to toe so I
think this is a really cute idea I'm
going to go ahead and link Julia's
channel and her video down below so you
guys can go over and say hello to her I
know she is much younger than me however
I do have a lot of subscribers that are
in like high school age range so
definitely go check out her channel tell
her I say hello and let's just get right
into this tag shall we I have run over a
few of the questions and I already know
I want to type through people so the
first one is Tiffany from Tiffany dawn
the second one is hailey from hailey row
27 and the third is of course Amy from
makeup by AV Michelle so let's just get
right into it the first question is
would you rather lose all of your
mascaras eyeliners lipsticks and lip
glosses or lose all of your palettes and
eyeshadows I would much rather lose my
eyeliners lipsticks and lip gloss since
you guys like seriously i love my
eyeshadow palette I've spent a lot of
money on I shadow palette there is no
way in hell that I would get rid of
those so definitely I would rather lose
my eyeliners lipsticks and lip glosses
the second question is would you rather
chop off all your hair are never be able
to cut it again so I actually had a
shaved head when I was a freshman in
college and it was not my choice it was
actually the first time that I went into
a lupus flare-up it was very unfortunate
I went into a lupus flare-up I wasn't on
the proper medications yet and i lost
like a huge huge amount of my hair so i
went ahead and pulled a britney spears
and i shaved my own head I've donated it
to Locks of Love it turned out to be a
great situation and honestly I never
felt more free with having short hair
like a buzz cut it was amazing I really
enjoyed it and yeah so that question was
would you rather chop off all your hair
or never be able to cut it again and
definitely I would rather
top it all off because I am very very
long hair and honestly it tangles up
like a rope and I know if it was any
longer than this like all the way down
to my butt it would be very difficult to
deal with so definitely I would rather
chop it all up and have a cute pixie cut
or like a bob you know my little chin
Bob all right number three would you
rather have a coral cheek or a pink
cheek well I got fair skin so I would
much rather have a coral cheek I just
think it's a very flattering on my skin
tone so yeah definitely coral number
four if you had a thousand dollars to
spend would you rather buy clothes or
makeup makeup for sure I literally spend
like no money on my clothing so
definitely make up number five would you
rather apply lipstick and eyeliner or
eyeliner of lipstick okay um eyeliner as
lipstick that would just wait wait wait
Lil Wayne let me read that sounds like
wait a minute apply lipstick as eyeliner
okay yeah I would rather choose eyeliner
is lipstick because putting a lipstick
on my waterline like that is that would
be a disaster so definitely I behind are
as lipstick because I feel like you
could get like a pink eyeliner or a
colored eyeliner and put it on your lips
oh definitely that one all right number
6 would you rather only shop at mac or
sephora well I basically have nothing
from Mac I'm just one of those people I
don't have a lot for them I don't think
they're that fantastic so definitely
Sephora you know what I think the
question should be would you rather live
in sephora or all top because i would
like to live above them they should have
a question like that would you like to
live in like you know what beauty supply
store or something would you like to
live in i would probably choose for him
because I would seriously live in there
all right number seven would you rather
only use one eye shadow color or one lip
color for the rest of your life
definitely one lip color I have so many
eyeshadow palettes and I love them so
definitely one lip color I feel like
that would be doable for me I'm not huge
with lip products even though I have a
lot of them it's not like might like
tried-and-true sort of like treasure in
my collection definitely my eyeshadows
are all right moving on number 8 would
you rather wear winter clothes and
summer or summer clothes in winter okay
so I actually wear winter closes summer
and I don't know what it is I think it's
because I can't get a tan and I've
always embarrassed to be showing my
appeal as legs in the summertime so I
seriously wear like jeans and
sweatshirts during the summer so that's
my answer let's see here number 9 would
you rather have dirt nails or bright
nails all
year-round definitely bright nails I'm a
bright kind of girl and that's just the
way I roll number ten would you rather
give up your favorite lip product or
your favorite I product to definitely my
favorite lip product for sure would you
rather only be able to wear your hair in
a ponytail or a messy bun definitely a
ponytail and I think that I wear my hair
in a ponytail all the time that's like
my go-to hairstyle I'm just one of those
people I've always really thought it was
comfortable just having a pony right on
top of my head I think that wear my hair
in a pony more often than wearing it
down altogether so yeah I would much
rather have it in a pony than a messy
bun number 12 would you rather never be
able to paint your nails again or never
use lip gloss well I don't use lip gloss
that often so definitely um that one
yeah I don't need lip gloss but I do
like to paint my nails I'm just not good
at it yeah whatever alright would you
rather shave your eyebrows and have none
at all or sharpy them in every day oh
dear God that is really difficult okay
shave your eyebrows have no eyebrows
whatsoever or sharpy them in every day I
guess Sharpie them in everyday girl
eyebrows are like the frame to your
whole face like you need them so
definitely I guess I'm gonna sharpen
them in every day all right would you
rather live without makeup or nail
polish and nail polish for sure for sure
all right and then that was it so those
are all 14 questions I felt like I went
through that actually really really
quickly but i am quite opinionated on
these matters I guess I know exactly
what I would choose I'm curious to see
what you guys would choose let me know
down below like I said I think Julia is
so sweet she's just sweetest pack please
go check out her channel tell her I say
hello and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
