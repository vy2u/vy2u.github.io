happy Friday today's video is going to
be a youtube maybe buy it on the tart
shape tape concealer I did purchase the
shade fair and I can't remember if I
purchased it on the sephora.com website
or the torte com website but it does
retail for $25 you get a large amount of
product in here which is awesome and
there are 14 different shades to choose
from I feel like if you do have a fair
complexion or medium complexion to shade
range looks really really good if you do
have a deeper complexion it doesn't look
as diverse so definitely let me know if
you have a deeper complexion and if
those shades work for you I am very
curious but yeah this is what the actual
packaging looks like it comes in a
really really big tube like I said
definitely think it's worth the money
you do have this nice little imprint
right here and then on the bottom as you
can see my shade is fair which is the
lightest out of 14 and this is what the
little box looks like Tarte says that
this is cruelty free and also it does
have skin invigorating ingredients like
shea butter sunflower oil peony licorice
root and vitamin e in it so this is
supposed to be one of those products
that you dot onto the skin and then you
kind of blend it in now today if you are
curious my kind of review is going to be
a true review it's not going to be a
first impressions because I have
actually been using this concealer for a
week I know normally when people do
these they do first impressions but I
know you guys prefer reviews so if you
are curious as to what I do have on my
face right now I have three pumps of the
laura mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation on I wear these shade of fair
and the reason why I wanted to wear this
was so that you guys could see what kind
of concealing properties this concealer
has so that is all that I have on my
skin I know I look a little weird but we
will go ahead and demo this towards the
end of the video but anyway yeah my
thoughts on this you guys I think this
was a really really solid concealer is
it absolutely the best thing that's ever
happened to me no my all-time favorite
concealer is actually from Tarte but
it's the rainforest of the sea aqua
sealer I'm I also do wear the shade fair
and the reason why I love this is
because it just has such a beautiful
nice light consistency and feeling on
the eyes it blends in like a dream and
it's not too thick and cakey I am NOT
someone who likes really cakey makeup on
a day-to-day basis but I am someone who
also is a performer I go on stage I'm a
flutist so you know it is nice to have
more of a full coverage concealer and
what I think that this compares to is a
mixture of these two products right here
the Kat Von D lock-it
tat what is this called not tattoo
locket crumb can
sealer mixed together with the master
conceal from Maybelline I feel like if
the two of these made a product it would
be the Tarte shaped tape it has the nice
kind of blend ability of the Maybelline
but it has the coverage of the cap on
dia and I think that's absolutely
awesome but I really only like this
concealer underneath my eyes now I do
have hyperpigmentation along this area
where I do get hormonal acne as well as
some active breakouts and I find that
this really doesn't look good on pimples
especially if they are starting to kind
of heal up and crust over and it was a
horrible word graph Alber I hate that
word but you know when they start to get
a little dry I feel like this actually
emphasizes that area and it doesn't look
good whatsoever so what I really like to
use it for is underneath my eyes but I
got to say you guys I think people put
way too much of this on and it is not my
place to tell people how to do their
makeup I mean I went on camera yesterday
literally looking like a damn Easter Egg
slash unicorn I piled on so much
colorful highlight on to my face in the
Aurora review so of course I'm not
judging anybody who you know wants to
take their face in this that is totally
up to you but I think the reason why
some people are not liking this is
because a lot of Beauty vloggers and you
know beauty gurus put a big amount of
this product underneath their eyes and
on their eyelids and honestly it may
look good on camera but I promise you it
does not look good in real life all you
need for this is three little dots
underneath your eyes and what's funny is
that on the actual chart com website
they say dot it onto your skin so you
may see your favorite beauty blogger
really putting a lot of this on but I
would highly recommend going ahead and
applying it the way the tart tells you
to the reason why it has this
interesting little applicator where it
has like a little dip or crevice right
here is so that you can literally dot it
on it's not meant to be swiped
underneath your eye again you can do
whatever the hell you want I'm not here
to judge but I really do think that this
is made to dot so I find that underneath
my eyes all I need is three little dots
and then like half a dot or one dot on
my eyelid and I am good to go if I apply
too much of this if I do the triangle if
I even just swipe it I am left with
creasing throughout the day it looks
cakey it doesn't look good it looks
great on camera but it doesn't look good
in real life so I really like to just
dot it on I think that the wear time is
really really fantastic it wears
absolutely all day but my biggest
complaint again is that I don't think
that it sits very nicely elsewhere on
the skin it's really just
nice underneath the eyes so I think that
I am going to go ahead and just kind of
hold on to this for like an under-eye
concealer it's definitely very
brightening it blends beautifully but I
do want to tell you guys really quickly
the item that it blends the best with is
definitely a damp sponge
I have tried multiple different kind of
brushes with this I'm a little artiste
brush here or a dupe for the RT special
amount of paper in our teeth brush I
have the deal for the artis brush and
then I also do have these like pointed
kind of foundation guys right here you
can tell this one right here from crown
brushes I like to put like my color
correctors on with I thought this would
really go nicely and kind of like tap
the concealer and that is a lot better
with a more lightweight concealer kind
of like the rainforest of the sea or
even the Maybelline I feel like with
this thicker consistency you really have
to use the sponge for it to look like
one with your skin so overall I think
it's definitely a really good concealer
can you get something at the drugstore
that is similar probably but you know I
think that a lot of people just apply a
lot of this and I think it looks
absolutely like perfection on the skin
when you're lino on camera but I think
you do have to be aware that for actual
day to day life I think less is more
with this like less is way more with
this so anyway let's go ahead and a zoom
you guys in and we will go ahead and get
started on the demo part so I did
already like I said put on my primer as
well as my foundation and what we are
going to be using to apply this today is
this little sponge it is damp and this
is from NYX Cosmetics the reason why I
like this so much is because it's very
very dense and I don't feel like it
takes any sort of coverage away so what
I'm going to do is take the Tarte shape
tape and I am going to apply like I said
three little dots underneath my eyes and
then like a half dot on my eyelid and I
really feel like that is all I
personally need this may even be more
than you need like seriously a little
goes a very long way with this so what
I'm going to do is go ahead and blend
that in with the sponge and you guys
will be able to see right away what I'm
talking about it's very very brightening
very very pretty on the skin and those
three little dots are going to be enough
to take it all the way down to this area
so you really just don't need to be
applying a huge amount all the way down
to your nostril again you can do
whatever the hell you want
to tell you what to do with your makeup
but I'm just saying for a day-to-day you
know living lifestyle makes no sense for
day-to-day life I just don't think it's
necessary to have a huge amount so there
it is you guys can see how beautifully
that blended in it really looks natural
even though it is full coverage and I
think it's because less is more with
this particular product and I do a
little bit of looking up to make sure
that I really can kind of get and press
the product into my fine lines I've seen
a lot of people say that this crease is
on them it only creases for me if I
apply too much product I think a lot of
people are confused as to the difference
between creasing and fine lines we all
have little fine lines underneath our
eyes especially like if you're in your
mid-20s like I am and a lot of people
say oh my gosh it's creasing its
creasing I think they're like confusing
that with fine lines so this definitely
does kind of sink into my fine lines but
I do not find that it creases if I just
apply it these small on that so there it
is guys that is what it looks like I
feel like I instantly look a little more
like awake and very very nice I just
think it's beautiful underneath the eyes
now I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys
what it looks like to spot conceal again
this is not my favorites because I do
feel like it looks slightly drying and
again less is more with this seriously
let me zoom you guys out just a little
so you can kind of see what I'm doing
here with my forehead less is more with
this you will see how far that little
dot goes here and this fair shade right
here honestly is a little light on my
particular skin tone which again is
probably why I don't personally like to
apply it elsewhere on my face I really
only like it for brightening my under
eye but I don't know if you guys can see
it just looks slightly drying on areas
where I do have active breakouts and I'm
just not a huge fan of that again it's
okay but just not a huge fan I'm going
to take the tiniest amount on my nose to
kind of help with a little bit of a
redness and you guys can see again a
little go such a long way just a little
bit there especially in my nose crevices
I don't find that this sits particularly
beautifully in my nose crevice area so I
do kind of swipe it when I get around
there and then finally I will show you
guys what it kind of looks like on area
where do you have a little more hyper
pigmentation which is more around this
area because I do have hormonal acne all
right and we will blend that in I think
it does sit better around areas where
you do have acne scarring but like on
active pupils it just doesn't look very
good it doesn't look very flattering let
me know if you also seem to have it that
issue but yeah overall I would say
coverage is beautiful they sit still
maintains that nice creamy feel but for
me I feel like this is going to be one
of those products that I personally use
you know around my eye area the most and
of course you can build it up some more
if you feel like you need more coverage
absolutely go ahead and do that just be
aware that it can get a little cakey
looking and it looks really nice on
camera but it won't look really nice in
real life in my opinion always on my
face all right now I'm going to go ahead
and set this in because I do find that I
have to set it in I'm going to take this
morphe flat tops foundation brush as
well as my essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder and I always set my eye
area in first and I really kind of look
up and then tap it in you can also do
this with like a angled foundation brush
to really get in that area but I do find
that I have to set this in or it does
start to kind of disintegrate on my face
I mean I have combo to oily skin so if
you do have common to oily skin or if
you have oily eyelids I would set this
in but if you are dry I feel like you
can get away with not having to set this
end so anyway guys that is pretty much
it that is my little review on the Tarte
shaped ape definitely a good product but
I feel like a lot of people use way too
much of it and if you really wanted to
look natural and look everyday friendly
three little dots is all you need so
thank you so much for joining me guys I
do hope you enjoyed this video and yeah
I will see you guys tomorrow for a full
a face of only samples which is going to
be so fun bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
