channel today I'm going to be testing
out some indie makeup with you guys from
the brand touch of glam of beauty yet
now I recently found a me and touch of
glam a beauty on Instagram chap around
13,000 followers on there and she does
have her own Etsy shop where she sells
indie cruelty-free of vegan makeup she
does ship worldwide as well I'm going to
have all the info on the products on
this show in this video linked down
below in the description bar so you guys
can find everything but every single
products I'm going to share with you
guys by itself is under the $15 marks
boy so like this is really nice like
drugstore price curls be free of vegan
makeup and it's handmade in the USA in
LA which i think is awesome so basically
Amy reached out to me and asked if I
would like to try out 1004 different
highlighters as well as each of her
different eyeshadows and I said
absolutely because I have had this
series in my mind where I wanted to test
our indie makeup from milk cosmetics and
dose of colors and all these different
easy brands so we're going to start
today with those not tones of colors
with touch of glam Beauty here are the
age of different eyeshadows that she
sent my way at the top force here or duo
chromes and the bottom four are foiled
eyeshadows so very excited to play with
those I have not even swatched them yet
and then she did send me ten different
highlighters you can get the
highlighters in the actual packaging
like this or in just the pan by itself
they did swatch three of these already
I'm pretty darn impressive they're
really really pigmented and beautiful
and then you guys thought we would put
them on at my face as well so let's go
ahead and jump right into it I do have a
bunch of brushes here for highlighting I
thought I would go with my lefty 522 tee
for highlighting brush as well as a
unicorn brush from wet and wild which I
feel like because these are a little
more like a big shoelace or the texture
this is going to be the one I want to
use and then for eye brushes I did
choose that just an assortment of
different stuff so that we can play
around with the formula and this is the
sigma e35 brush so we have a little
smudger brush here from morphe we have
biloxi 231 and small tapered blending
brush
what else did I choose out a morphe m5
13 this is a crucial sense BRC soh brush
i don't know a blending a 25 brush from
sigma i also have an 5:11 from morphe as
well as a beach cosmetics fluffy crease
brush and i do want to go ahead and pull
in at this little palette right here
from sonia kashuk called the ion neutral
palette so that i can have a transition
the brow bone color but yeah I'm super
excited let's go ahead and jump right
into this we're going to starts watching
everything and then I will go ahead and
put it on my face ow
I'm definitely to do a follow-up for you
guys because I am NOT someone who likes
first impressions without follow-up so
when I do it in these series I will do
like well one two three four or five
whatever I will have my follow-up in my
fails and holy grails on Sunday so
anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it we're going to start by watching
the highlighters the first one I have
two is called Treasure Island this is
what it looks like it's called a
shifting pearl highlighter and there is
0.17 ounces or five grams of product in
here which it really doesn't look like
five grams of product I will say I'm a
little nervous about this packaging I
don't feel like it's super super secure
in this tiny little compact here so I
would recommend maybe buying the pans
that you're going to go for it and then
putting it into a magnetic palette but
let's go ahead and swatch this Wow look
at that just reminds me of this you're
glowing Gardens highlight in glowing a
pink there's only a little bit of
chunkiness but not anything that I can't
work with I feel like once you get it
onto this space it will look really
beautiful so there is a first one at
this one is called Treasure Island
alright moving on we have the next one
which is called a white lies this is
also a highlighter it's just listed as
highlighter called white knives again I
don't feel like it's super super secure
in the piano those make me just a little
bit nervous but I do like these contacts
do you have a nice sized mirror so let
me go ahead and squash this one oh my
goodness you guys like a little goes a
very long way you clearly do not need to
be digging your finger or your brush
into these highlighter so definitely a
little bit of follows but there is the
shade white lies this one reminds me do
you see the chunkiness and this one does
it remind me a lot of honey golden light
highlights from I believe it's called
it's not makeup revolution yeah makeup
revolution and also the council like
glow highlighter from cubase so yeah
that is these are stunning like I said I
think I'm digging a little too deep into
these because a lot is coming out at
once so let's go with a little bit of a
lighter hand for the next shade of the
next one we have here called witch full
thinking this is so cute do you guys see
this this is obviously a holiday themed
aka Halloween themed highlighter and it
is just adorable it's like a little
spider web so cute so I'm going to go
really really lightly to squash this one
that's a lot that area I feel like you
get full pigment right over
so no need to dig your grubby little
fingers in there like I'm doing I just
really I I'm the ruler luck or whatever
with my make up some embers dig in there
too quickly but here is a new shade
which full of thinking oh my god these
are blinding and these are literally of
blinding and I love the she makes
everything handmade herself so cool
alright the next one that we have here
is kind of like a holidays each one as
well for Christmas one is called craving
if they can became highlighter I did
already swatch this one it is so acute
and actually does have scent to it so I
would say the scent is kind of like a
sweet candy like Sons I mean honestly
employers smell kind of like a candy
cane a little minty a little sweet
really really beautiful a nice kind of
peachy color I like this one a lot maybe
even more than this guy up here so this
one reminds me of lots of these your
growing gardens in the glowing pink
shade this one's a definitely a little
more peachy tone super super beautiful
though you guys see the pigment on these
it's just insane alright the next one we
have here is another one that have like
that little flower packaging this one is
called illusion
I have swatch this one this one is a
dupe duochrome a drone prom build it and
do a chroma this is that what it looks
like and it kind of reminds me of that
other one that have a little bit of like
that yellow and gold ship to it but it's
a little bit of like propylene or
blueish undertones to it it's very very
interesting so there they are maybe just
a little icier than this one right here
but so beautiful oh my goodness so so so
beautiful very blinding alright the next
one we have a super cute this what I
call pie in the sky is a pizza
highlighter yes you heard that right a
pizza pie highlighter so here is what
the packaging looks like for pie in the
sky and this is what it looks like on
the inside it was like a little pizza
pie but I already need to watched it I
just couldn't resist you guys but this
one I will say is very very chunky I
don't know I'm not welcome a good fan of
that but I will say if you have a deeper
complexion this is going to be a
beautiful highlight for you it's like a
rose gold with a little more of like a
pinky undertone going on there so you
guys can see some of these are very very
light this one will be great for a
deeper complexions
I feel like if you go in here with a
little bit of a lighter brush something
that's a little more fluffy it would
pick up a little better because it goes
a very long way but yeah I did just want
to let you guys know that one was a
little bit only chunky side
a little bit Arisa next one that we have
here is really cute too this one is
called 50 shades of pink and it is like
kind of like a little hearts highlighter
again kinda reminds me of the Dior
glowing gardens so that's one is just a
Valentine's Day highlighter it
definitely has a little bit of like an
icy pinky tone to it which i think is
beautiful and this one feels super super
soft and smooth that one's like a true
bitch delay you guys see that very very
interesting to see the kind of formula
she has going on here a lot that is so
stunning this is like the perfect cool
tone of pink so this one's definitely a
little more cool tone Pinker than this
guy right here I hope it's showing up on
camera I would say this one has more of
that pinky color whereas this one's
actually a little more white toned and
then this one is a little more peachy so
there is that shade and the next one
that we have here again comes in kind of
woodsy floral contact and this one is
called Purple Haze that's what's so
beautiful do you see this it's like a
lilac really really pretty lilac let's
go ahead and swatch this again super
smooth this one kind of feels like a
facially as well very very interesting I
don't know if she's working with
different formulas on all of them Holly
 needs to go on my face you have to
see to go on my face look at that
do you see that oh my god is like a
purple with like a blue ship this is
like what I wanted purple horseshoe from
the anasazi Beverly Hills which I'll
locate to be like so these two over here
are really really smooth and creamy so
that one right there again it's called
Purple Haze and then the 50 shades of
pink of those two are definitely I'm
looking to put those on my face the next
one we have here is called Color Me
sparkle this is a kitchen towel
highlighter and this is what it looks
like this one looks a little on the
glittery side to me beautiful little
embossment there but like go ahead and
swatch it technically doesn't feel too
chunky okay it's definitely got a
visible sparkle to it this is probably
not going to be something that I'm in
love with I don't love super super
sparkly highlights but if you want to be
blinding I can imagine this is beautiful
you know what do be gorgeous on the eyes
and you could probably foiled it and put
it on the inner corner of your eye as
well so that is the sparkle kind of
shade really really pretty does a little
bit of a shift to it as well so there
are all of the highlights so far and
then finally we have this guy right here
which is called a tie-dye
kaleidoscopes hi guys so there is and
this is what it looks like kind of like
a soft yellow is a little bit of a pink
running through it alright let's watch
it again have a super super silky
formula oh wow that looks really
interesting on the skin that's actually
very very pretty I honestly thought some
of these we're going to be overlapping
in color I have no idea how it's picking
up on camera but these do have different
undertones to them so let me make sure I
got all of them one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten all right guys
that is all ten of these highlighters
I'm super excited some of them felt a
little more on the chunky side length of
darker shade over here maybe the little
this one right here the bluish color was
a little bit on the Left pigmented side
but these two right here these are the
ones I think I want to go in with on my
cheeks because they're just beautiful
they seem like that facial a formula
again I'm not really sure about what
kind of formula she's working with I
would love to hear a B if you're
watching this video let us know if
you're looking into like foil sort of
finishes or what you're doing with your
finishes because this is really really
interesting but some of them seem like
powder some of them seems like big
Shanaya
but yeah there they are guys so here we
have those highlighters and over here we
have the others I will have all of them
listed down below again with links to
the actual Essie shop alright now let's
go ahead and swatch out these eyeshadows
I'm just going to remove these really
quickly and make sure that I don't have
any excess residual like water on my
hands sometimes I can make eyeshadows
look even more pigmented if you up like
a little bit of like a wet base going on
kind of like an uber to foil them so
anyway here are the eight different
eyeshadows that I have so let's go ahead
and starts with the duo Chrome's on top
the first one that she sent here is
called Aloha and I will say I don't
think that these are filled up all the
way can you guys kind of see with the
pan I know that I'm being very nitpicky
I know that she is a one-woman show but
I did just want to go ahead and say that
really quickly alright interesting they
feel pretty soft look at that it's so
pretty I think they're just blinding for
someone who is just you know an envy you
brand I'm I'm just really amazed alright
so there it is I do feel look like this
went on just a little maybe
Tad's patchy it's not anything crazy but
that is beautiful so this is like a
pinky color with a little bit of I would
say a purple shift to it hopefully you
guys can see that all right the next one
that we do have here is called love
child
another duochrome which is kind of like
an icy blue color and I don't know if I
can even see the ship yet you know what
it's a gold shift alright so there it is
Chris you don't like coffee they're so
bright oh my goodness that was like a
mermaid color right there oh hell yeah
hell yeah I want this on my lower lash
line I need to put this on my lower lash
line oh so there is love child and it
has that little bit of gold ship to it
you guys see that blue gold blue gold
oh oh that is so pretty yes Amy yes girl
alright the next one is that we do have
here is called a diva and this one is
gold and maybe purple doesn't have
purple it reflects to it I can't tell
until I actually swatch it out but there
is a shade diva go ahead and see it a
little more on the chunky side again I
don't know she just needs like better
binders or fillers for some of these
products but again she's a one-woman
show and she is a startup brand so I'm
not going to be too nitpicky with that
but look at that so this is like a gold
with day I would see a purple shift a
light lavender purple shift ooh yes yes
all right and then the last one that we
have here as far as duochrome are
concerned is called your majesty and
this one's kind of like a purple with
I'm going to say a pink and maybe silver
shift to it
I really can't tell in the pan until I
actually swap it I've been waiting Supes
a lot of these you guys I haven't been
able to do it yet I want to do an on
camera with you but yeah that's
beautiful teal alright I have to say
love child is definitely my favorite as
far as the duo crumbs are concerned but
there are all four absolutely stunning
again I'll have all of them linked down
below alright let's go ahead and swatch
out those foil shades now which I'm
really excited about I heard that these
are super super pigmented and creamy so
the first one is a beautiful beautiful
kind of copper color is called
firecracker which is like the perfect
name for it let's go ahead and swatch
that oh my gosh
it's so soft
oh wow wow wow wow wow wow wow this this
is an excellent formula I can already
tell from watching it I'm like I'm
feeling it there is firecracker that's a
day that they won types watch okay all
right the next one that we have here is
called Pharaoh which is a gold really
beautiful maybe a little bit of like a
green undertone in here
wow these are so soft and buttery you
guys oh my goodness I'm really shocked
really shocked definitely preferred this
formula over the duo crumbs like these
are not bad but there are a lot more
chunky than these look at those foiled
eyeshadows wow wow what a great formula
she's got going on there alright the
next one is called how do you go
disclosed called a honeycomb which is a
beautiful soft gold Wow I'm very
impressed right now not going to lie
pretty impressed
there is honeycomb kind of like a soft
gold wheat color I guess I would call it
look at that Pharaoh shade we need that
in my crease like right now and then
finally we have this beautiful purple
which is called it passionate and the
point is like a deep plum kind of purple
there is the shade of passionate Wow
the foil finish you guys this is
probably what has impressed me the most
of everything that I swatch so far
including the highlighters look at those
foiled eyeshadows these are one swipe
swatches can we please can we please oh
my gosh I think these are about $8 per
pan which really isn't that bad for this
kind of pigment so amazing really
beautiful alright
well yeah let's get some of this on our
face I want to start with highlights so
I do want to jump into that beautiful
purple haze highlighter just because
it's really calling up my name so I'm
going to go in it with my wet and wild
unicorn up brush I'm just going to pick
this up very lightly if you guys can see
it's a little bit of a baked chalet
formulas on being a little bit of
fallout but it's not anything crazy to
look at it kickback maybe
alright let's go ahead and
hi this see what it looks like holy crap
alright well maybe I should have gone in
with the other one this is a straight-up
beautiful purple true highlight holy
crap okay let's go ahead and I'm just
gonna and I honestly do not know what
kind ignant way we're going to be
working with you guys so I'm going to
take this kabuki brush here from ELF and
just kind of blend it together this is
what I use to apply my powder today Wow
Wow if you're into purple highlight oh
yeah I think you would like this a lot
beautiful alright let's do that on the
other side as well and I think I want to
maybe layer a few shades so we shall see
I am these are incredibly pigmented
incredibly pigmented I think they are
going onto the skin a lot better than
they wash I mean these were the ones
with felt super super or this particular
shade was the one that felt super super
smooth and kind of foiled so maybe we
should layer on top I want to be more
not like crispy shade but you know one
of those shades that was a little more
crumbly I guess you could say or a
little more texture it I'm just that
they're crumbly I'm trying my best to
describe this kind of formula here
just a little more powdery you guys know
I love you some base you like
highlighters but I want to try both so I
already feel like I'm going to the guys
I don't know if I can layer highlight on
top of it but let's do it anyway I'm
going to be Alexi uh let's see here
let's take it let's eat by 22 I'm going
to go into that kaleidoscope tie-dye
which was a little more on the chunky
side just pick a little bit of that up a
lot of fallout but I mean I just feel
like it's so pigmented you know so
okay I don't want to like overdo it but
I mean these are these are pretty these
are pretty these are pretty pigmented
especially those other those two that
kind of have that baked she'll a formula
so the two that I'm leaning it towards
the most are definitely this Purple Haze
I mean that was beautiful going on I
just I I feel like a little fairy
wearing this and then this guy right
here which is the fifty shades of pink
absolutely beautiful the other ones I
think using a little bit more of a
fluffy brush because they are a true
sort of powder formula is probably the
best way to go but I mean it's actually
really really beautiful I just to run it
over my face one more time with a kabuki
brush because I feel like I'm really
really kind of glowing right now but
that's okay I wanted to try these out
and see how they look so now let's go
ahead and jump into some eyeshadow shall
we I would like to start first of all
with my Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral
palette so I need a base shade I'm going
to take this top one right here I'm
going to go in with EBG cosmetics a
fluffy crease brush I'm going to pick
that up and just put that all over my
eyelid all the way up to my brow so I
can have a little bit of base I'm super
excited those foil shades look like they
might actually work in the crease area
I'm also going to take just a little bit
underneath my eyes though the foil
shades look like they could actually
blend out in the crease sometimes you
get that really foiled formula it's hard
to blend like those dual chrome I don't
think are going to work in the crease
but I would like to try the dual
Chrome's on the lower lash line and
maybe on the lid all right I'm gonna go
ahead and take a vitiate right here I'm
going to work back in as my transition
with the same brush just out a little
bit of a definition and something to
blend on top of I hope she comes out
with Matt that would be amazing because
they seemed especially before I'll show
you seemed really really nice all right
now let's go ahead and jump into some of
these alright I want to take this shade
right here which is called a Ferro that
really beautiful gold I'm going to take
a now to something densely packed I'm
gonna take a looksie 231 small taper to
blending Mick pick out that product
which is insanely at pigna
saying I'm kind of scared tap off that
excess and let's go ahead and work that
and she with the crease and see if that
will blend a little bit not bad
build up just a little more see
sometimes would like those foiled
eyeshadows you know you want to use
something super densely packed as far as
brushes are concerned something that's
really really precise because it can be
hard and you get like a little bit of a
line like in your crease area I don't
feel like that's happening here I'm
gonna take it onto my lid as well okay
liking this not getting any fallout
which is great she's taking that up into
the crease all over the lid alright now
I'm going to build on top of that with
the same a brush I want to go in it with
that beautiful firecracker shade which
is totally calling up my name so I'm
just going to dig into layer tap off
that exhales when you start working that
into the crease as well
super cutting the shape the shape is
everything the shade is real all right
back and forth with that same brush
creating maybe a little bit of a line
but it's not anything that crazy
usually I do prefer to put more like
mass in my crease but this is going to
be just fine alright I'm going to take a
morphe and five eleven and I'm just
going to blend everything together doing
the back and forth motions they actually
are a little more subtle of the eye
which i think is quite nice but I feel
like you could definitely build these
and I like that when it comes to a
foiled eyeshadow because it can be hard
to go in and have that full-on pigment
like right here I mean that's that's a
little difficult to blend out alright
now let's go ahead and it go into the
shade of passionate which is that
beautiful kind of purply shade again I'm
going to take that same brush picking up
that color up and I want to work that
into the outer V I'm just going to kind
of tap it on and then go into the outer
V and outer crease kind of blending in
circular motions of a beautiful color I
hope it doesn't muddy together just feel
like those dark purples dark turquoise
is gray color definitely muddy
gather from me so just kind of stippling
that on there I don't have any fallout I
feel a little bit right there but that
is really really nice because usually
foiled eyeshadows do have quite a bit of
fallout going backing up with that
morphe brush just going to blend in
circular emotions now see how this looks
I actually like that they're not overly
a pigmented because I feel like you can
build them up on your actual eye and it
looks nice alright so again it's kind of
blending all right now I'm going to go
in with oh let's see here you know what
I'm going to take Barrow again the time
they dip my finger in there I'm gonna
tap this onto my lid oh my goodness yeah
I'm just going to tuck these right onto
my lid to get that color it's so
beautiful it's like the gold gray not
gold gray it's like a gold green
gorgeous maybe these are better for just
tapping onto the lid and putting on the
lower lash line but I like that they did
actually blend into the crease like that
makes me happy look at that pigment so
now I'm just kind of tapping it on I'm
not getting any fallout which is great
so that is super super nice alright
it definitely would probably recommend a
primer with these because I feel like
they are cruising just a little bit not
anything crazy zealous you get Sigma e35
brush just going to blend in that area
really quickly okay lit again super
pretty super super pretty I definitely
think those soil eyeshadows are meant
for the lid or the lower lash line but I
wanted to try them out either way
alright now let's go ahead and take this
little guide this is one of the duo
crumbs in the shade Aloha I'm just going
to tap that onto my finger let's put
that on the inner corner of the eye holy
 oh god oh god Wow well that went on
that clearly went on probably should use
a brush that is okay I did not know that
that would just stick on there so well
I'm just going to take that and kind of
blend it down with my finger such a
pretty eye-opening shade and I'm sure
you could use a lot of these
highlighters as well for the inner
corner of the eye but that looks I like
it a lot I'm into it I'm into it alright
now let's go ahead and take a plant we
take this little market guy right here
this little flat shader I'm going to go
into this shade at first which is called
your majesty I want to pick this up and
I want to put this on the lower lash
line expecting a little fallout he I'm
getting a lot of fallout so what I'm
going to do is actually spray it down
with some Smashbox photo finish primer
water so I can get it a little sticky
go back in there and let's see how this
looks on the lower lash line not as
pigmented as I thought it was going to
be let me just pick up that excess here
and not a stigmatism I thought I was
going to be but that's okay I also want
to go in with that other shade that
really beautiful kind of turquoise these
days I'll put that on on top of this one
let's see
it's pretty though it's kind of I got
periwinkle you know like that perfect
periwinkle color that's what this is
remind me of that is what this is
reminding me of all right so like I look
crazy so I like warm tones on top cool
tones on the bottom may go one more time
with that fluffy crease brush from BH
Cosmetics just kind of hit this upper
area here and then let's go ahead and
kind of blend the bottom part so
everything is blended together and a lot
of people like to see like exact
precision on where colors are but I like
everything blended together all right
now I'm going to go ahead and again it
spray down at that same a brush and lift
up into that really beautiful shade
called love child which looks like that
really gorgeous blue and gold duochrome
and pick that up let's do that right on
the lower lash line so pretty
oh my gosh yes the shade is so gorgeous
oh I love that I love love love that
yeah this is what I like that sparkling
on that is super super super pretty
definitely getting some fallout with
these duochrome that did happen with the
foils but that is okay you definitely
have to foil these though the heads up
all right
very pretty really really like that now
let's go ahead and put a little eyeliner
on I'm going to take my Laura Geller eye
brightener and me shade a banana I
believe it's called and put that on to
my waterline really quickly to get a
little bit of brightness going and we'll
go in with some mascara first
impressions wide you guys I would say
unimpressed with the highlighters super
impressed with these oil eyeshadows I
thought I was going to like be
highlighters more as then zo2 Faced
better than sex mascara I have this
little to luck size that I need to get
through because starting to dry out so
that's what I'm going to use but I
thought I was going to like these
highlighters the most out of everything
but I think I actually like the foiled
shadows the most i love how versatile
they're I love that I could put them
into my crease I can put them on the lid
I like that they're really bright and
bold but they still were buildable when
I do work them into the crease and a
derby
but that duochrome right there that love
child shade is super beautiful as well I
really liked highlighters I mean I think
everything is pretty damn good
especially for such a small little
company I think Amy are doing a great
job if I had any sort of constructive
criticism it would be that I think that
the pans that need to fit a little
better into the actual contact and also
you know making sure that the pan is
filled up all the way so people know the
exact amount of product they're going to
get because there are 50 people out
there like me who look into that kind of
stuff so just want to put that out there
but overall I really like it I really
like this I think it looks really really
nice to stab myself in the eye so if it
looks like it's watering that's why but
yeah you guys I think that those
highlighters are really beautiful super
super pigmented the majority of them you
want something a little more fluffy to
apply with and just because you know
they're super powdery and you do get a
little bit of kick up but as far as more
like a big should lay the highlights are
concerned I feel like that heart one as
well as that lavender shade that I used
was really really nice and silky and I
just love that formula again I don't
really know what she has going on with
all those different formulas but this
one collide so on really really
beautifully so anyway guys that is my
first impressions on the touch of glam
Beauty pretty damn and breath I will say
I think that's just so cool that she can
makes these cosmetics by herself and she
shifts everything out and I just think a
you know go you girl go you so very
impressed so far
I will definitely play with these
products some more and then I will give
you guys my final thoughts on it Sunday
and my cells and Holy Grail I hope you
