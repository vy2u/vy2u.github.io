channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you guys are all having a
fantastic Friday so far I'm so happy
it's Friday anyway today's video is
going to be all about the best and the
worst of colour-pop I have been
promising this video to you guys for
quite some time now
I'm very very excited to do it because I
feel like I'm not the typical person who
had that sort of like love thing going
on with colour-pop I do have quite a few
products from them I have their
sculpting sticks I do have a few of
their blushes I'm gonna show one in this
video I have their eyeshadows I have
their bronzers I have their highlighters
and I also have their lippie stix so
I've tried out a nice amount of products
from colour-pop but there are definitely
some that I love and some that I don't
love now you probably saw in my
declutter series video that I'm
decluttering pretty much all of my color
pop stuff except for my lippie stix
which are like my top bitch item from
them so I will just say that right away
the reason why I may show some of the
items that are being decluttered and I'm
showing them as like the best from
colour-pop is because I'm trying to
share with you guys what I think are the
best products from colour-pop and the
worst products so I'm not comparing it
against other things in my collection I
will be going ahead and decluttering all
of these highlighters here because
compared to other products in my
collection or other highlighters in my
collection they do not compare but when
you're looking at just color pop as a
brand I do think they're worth it so
anyway if you're curious about that and
you're kind of like girl I'm skeptical
because I saw that you're decluttering
those that is why we are looking at
color pop just as a brand we are not
comparing it to anything else it's just
as a brand so anyway let's go ahead and
get started
like we said my all-time favorite
products and color pop are their lippie
stix these are beautiful amazing I love
all of the different finishes and my
favorite is the hyper glossy I also do
you like these statins and also be matte
so the ones that I have here in the
hyper glossy formulation are tuxedo and
also confetti tuxedo is a really really
beautiful bright bright bright pink
color it has a little bit of a blue
undertone and I definitely want to
swatch everything for you guys cuz why
the hell not so there's this shade
tuxedo what I really like about this
type or glossy formulation is the fact
that they do not dry out your lips I
feel like they are just very very
comfortable on the lips here is the
shape confetti which is a beautiful
beautiful kind of like a reddish color
true red has a little bit of a pink
undertone really really gorgeous love
the formulation on these I just feel
like they're very juicy very
moisturizing on the lips
and I do feel like these ones last quite
a while now they do have satin finishes
as well which are in between a hyper
glossy and the matte formulation very
very comfortable on the lips the one
that I have here to share with you guys
oh it's a little eyelash or something
little piece of fuzz the one I have here
to share with you guys for this video is
called raw and this is obviously and not
the typical color that you would wear
like on a day-to-day basis but it is a
beautiful beautiful turquoise color I
love the way that these go on these
definitely do wear a little longer than
the hype or glossy formulation because
they do have a little more of a matte
slight finish and then finally like I
said I think that the matte finishes are
great as well I probably will be
decluttering this one right here which
is called Westie this is a matte it's
called Westie like I said only because
of the color I feel like I have so many
colors like this in my collection but as
you guys can see we have really glossy
here a little bit of like a mixture and
then here they start to kind of dry down
Matt I would not say that the matte
shades actually dry down completely
matte which is probably why I like them
so much because I am NOT the kind of
girl who loves a matte lipstick but I
will say their matte formulation which
is a little like a demi matte is very
comfortable and beautiful and these are
definitely the most long wearing out of
all of the lipsticks that they have this
shade right here is called tutu and I'm
just gonna swatch all of them because
why not right guys they come and then
the last one that I have here to share
is called tipsy so tipsy is beautiful I
love this shape probably my favorite out
of all of them even though I do love the
hyper glossy finish I wish they would
have this shade in me hyper glossy
finish because this is beautiful it is
like that cool toned
taupey nude color perfect for those of
you who do have a cool undertone
especially if you are a fair skin so
here are the lippie stix that i'm
sharing in this video I think they're
beautiful like I said my favorite
formulation and the one that I would
recommend the most is the hyper glossy
if you are someone who likes a very
comfortable lip product if you are okay
with wearing the masks and like that's
great I think that you would love these
matte finishes just know they don't dry
now completely matte I never feel like
they completely set on my lips but
they're beautiful I feel like you don't
need to get the matching
pairing lip liners with these I have
picked up a few the lip liners I
decluttered them last year I don't think
it's worth it I think that these stay in
the lip line really well they wear
incredibly long and they're beautiful so
that is the number one thing that I
would recommend from colour-pop
to check out definitely their lippie
stix are absolutely amazing I will
continue to purchase these alright
moving on the next
that I think is also a best from
colour-pop is definitely their pearlized
highlighters that come in the packaging
like this like I said it empty
cluttering these because compared to
other highlighters in my collection
they are nothing they really just don't
stand up to it but if you are looking at
color pop as a brand as a whole I think
these are beautiful I have three
different shades here the first one
right here is called smokin whistles and
if you guys have been following color
pop or immunity know what I mean if you
would have watched videos on YouTube
basically you know that color pop has
this really interesting sort of
formulation where it's kind of like a
cream to powder not even a cream to
powder
I do find this hybrid alike formulation
that they do to be different with their
blushes their bronzers are eyeshadows
and their pearlized highlighters and
these tend to have a lot more moisture
in them and you guys probably see every
time you order something from colour-pop
they say screw that lid on tightly and
that is because these do dry out quite
quickly but I will say these
highlighters in my opinion never ever
dry out they go on so beautifully
they're very very soft and satiny on the
skin and if you are someone who does
have dry skin and mature skin these are
gonna sit beautifully on the skin like I
said I am decluttering them because they
just do not compare to other
highlighters in my collection but they
are beautiful if you do you want a
really nice lightweight buttery creamy
highlight this shade right here is
called monster it's got a little bit of
iridescent undertones and these can be
built quite nicely on the skin so here
we have smoke and whistles there is
monster and then the last one that I
want to share with you guys is called
hippo and hippo is really beautiful as
well here is what hippo looks like has a
little more of a purpley undertone
beautiful if you do have fair skin with
a cool undertone so these build really
nicely on the skin if you are looking
for something from colour-pop I would
definitely recommend their highlighters
and also their lippie stix I do have one
more thing that I want to recommend from
colour-pop that I think is definitely in
the best category and that is definitely
their sculpting sticks in the contour
excuse me I think abundant flew into my
throat in the contouring a virgin I do
not like their highlights I think the
highlights are crappy but I do have two
of these sculpting sticks in the
contouring versions the ones I'm going
to share in this video are the shade
doves so this is what double looks like
really really beautiful love this shade
especially if you do have a fair
complexion with a cool undertone this is
beautiful this is what they look like
just a nice little retractable thing I
because it's tiny and I'm not great with
contouring so when I go into my head
what's crazy when I go in I really want
to make sure that I'm going in lightly
and then building up because I am so
fair complected if I go in with
something that's really really chunky I
just feel like it looks messy on my face
so I do like the way that these are
sized you aren't getting that much
product in here but colour-pop overall I
would say is really really well priced
so I did want to put that out there but
yeah this is beautiful I love the shade
up I also have a more chocolatey warmer
color that I do enjoy as well when I
have a little more of a tan in the
summertime but overall I would say that
these sculpting sticks when it comes to
the contouring products are very good
now let's go ahead and get into in my
opinion the worst of colour-pop the
first is definitely the sculpting sticks
in the highlighting versions I have this
one right here which is called releve
and this one definitely has it's the
same sort of format it has a little more
Sheen to it I wouldn't call it a
pearlized finish I would just say
there's just a little more Sheen in
there I feel like this accentuates my
pores my fine lines everything all over
my face it looks pretty when you first
apply it and then you blend it in and
you notice it starts to clean it to
certain areas on your face so if you
have texture of you've got fine lines
wrinkles anything really it's gonna look
like crap I also do have another one
that is like more of a matte finish and
have a yellow undertone same exact thing
looked very very chalky on my face not
good at all so if you really want to
check out the sculpting sticks go for
the actual sculpting colors do not go
for the highlights all right another
worst of colour-pop for me is definitely
their eye shadow so and this is gonna be
where it gets a little controversial
because I know a lot of people love and
the colour-pop eyeshadows I do think
that some of them are quite good and I
will talk about the finishes that I do
prefer but I have about six here to
share with you guys these do not last on
my eyes at all now I am NOT someone who
has dry skin I also don't have the
oiliness of oïleus skin types you know
I'm right in the middle I have
combination skin and for some reason
these just do not last on my eyes I have
tried literally everything you guys I
have tried pairing them with concealers
not with concealers with double eye
primers not with primers just putting
these on without primers absolutely
everything and they do not work for me
if I smudge them out on the lower lash
line base much they move if I put them
on my lid they budge they move I can
barely work these into the crease
because I feel like it looks a lot
easier on camera and then you
Brian attempted at home and it's hard as
 so I will say that is the one thing
that I'm not as impressed with with
colour-pop is definitely their eye
shadows because I think that they are
harder to work with them they look I
think if you are going to get a color
pop eyeshadow I recommend getting a
color that you would wear all over your
lid these are really like lid kind of
eyeshadows it is much harder to work
these into the crease than it looks um
there are some wonderful makeup artists
here on YouTube that are great and
putting stop buffing it into their craze
than doing all this kind of stuff with
these kind of creamy products but
honestly it's just a lot harder it's a
lot harder than it looks so if you are
kind of like just you know I'm not gonna
say a beginner I don't feel like I'm a
beginner in makeup but I do feel like
I'm definitely not professional by any
means if you were like me and you're
just kind of a basic everyday bitch with
your makeup these are hard to work with
if you do want to work them into your
crease so I would recommend getting
shades that are just pretty lid kind of
shades I did pick up this one right here
which is called bandit and I will say
out of all of the eyeshadows I do think
that their matte eyeshadows are
beautiful here is the shade bandit this
is beautiful again like you could put
this I I got this with the thought of
putting this on my lower lash line and
it just it's smudged everywhere I tried
setting them in with powder I've tried
everything so I don't really know what's
going on with that because a lot of
people love these eyeshadows and they
work for a lot of people so don't just
take my word for it definitely try
something out but if I were to recommend
a certain finish for you to try out I
would recommend going with the mattes
also these satin finishes which look
like this this particular shade is
called sour these are also really pretty
I like the way that these go on so there
is the shade sour and then the last
formulation and that I want to recommend
to you guys is the or is it super shock
pressed pigment not the metallic version
just the pressed pigment version this
one right here is called too shy
this goes on really really really nicely
as you guys can see so I would say the
matte finish the super shock pressed
pigment and out of these satin finishes
are the best the ones that I think are
the worst are definitely the super shock
pressed pigment in the matte version and
this one right here is called daddy and
this just dried out so quickly and I I
screw things on tight okay I just
put that out there this dried out so
incredibly quickly it has a very strange
consistency to it now it's almost kind
of like hard and very very chalky
looking and I've only had this for I
believe who maybe 2 or 3 months now
which is crazy so yeah this this this
one is just not really good in my
opinion when I do put my finger in there
it's really hard to move it around which
is very odd for a colour-pop products
usually they feel really really soft and
buttery and creamy so that is definitely
the kind of finish I would stay away
from and I would definitely stay away
from the metallic finishes these are the
super shock shadow metallic finishes I
know they have a lot of different
finishes but these ones I do not think
are very good these are very chunky they
tend to have a lot of glitter in them
you would think metallus eyes would mean
that it would be super super smooth but
I do find that there's just a lot of
chunkiness going on here these are hard
to work with and then I also have this
one right here which is called bubbly
this has been my current project pan
video you guys can see the chunkiness
going on there I'm trying to use it up
and bam it's hard so I basically been
using these as a basis because they
don't stick on my eyelid but again this
is just my personal opinion there I
shadow do not work for me but I would
still try them out and I would check out
to the satin finishes and the matte
finishes the most all right the next
item that I want to talk about I see is
right in the middle I don't hate it and
I don't love it it is the super shock of
bon voyage cheek so this is like their
matte bronzer I think this is pretty
this does have a different formulation
in my opinion and then their blushes and
I know some people will argue with me if
you go onto the website you can read the
ingredients are different so even though
everything seems to be the same from
colour-pop they have different finishes
and they do have different ingredients
so this is right in between I would be
decluttering this to my friend or
Rochelle it has a really nice color to
it this is bon voyage like I said it is
a matte finish and it really feels soft
and pillowy and I think this looks
beautiful on the skin but I don't know
my cheeks just eat this up it's this up
I put this on and it's like gone in like
literally 20 minutes and you guys know I
mean I do have combo to oily skin but
during the winter time this should be
able to stick on my cheeks so I feel
like you really really have to get in
there definitely use something like a
stippling brush with this but I think if
you have dry skin you would really like
these super shocked cheeks and also at
these bronzers so I will say this one is
okay it's not my favorite product
because it doesn't last
long on my skin but it's also not many
least-favorite and then the last one I
want to talk about is the worst of the
worst from colour-pop in my opinion I
believe I used to have six of these I've
covered three last year and I'm
decluttering 3 this year they are these
super shock cheek blushes I hate these
this is so weird
they smell like playdough they feel like
playdough this is just the weirdest
weirdest consistency out of everything
and they never felt as smooth as my
bronzer or even the pearl eyes
highlights these are really really nice
and moist too like I said these are a
little bit in between like a satiny kind
of feeling and then these are just hella
dry so this is what it looks like and
it's like goop like you just can move it
around and you can see there's texture
there and sure you can like smooth it
back together but then it's just it's
just a strangest thing I don't know what
it is with this it's very dry it's kind
of chalky and it almost feels rubbery
and I have had this one for I want to
say about six months I have kept this
really really nice and tightly closed
and I just feel like the consistency is
very strange so I don't like the way
that this sits on my cheeks I feel like
these are too pigmented they are too
pigmented and it's just not really
worthwhile for someone like me who does
have really really fair skin so when you
actually do a swatch of it as you guys
can see I did pick up a lot of product
but I do feel like this starts to skip
and jump a little bit and you do get a
little bit of chunks it's very hard
especially when you're fair-complected
now I know I chose that shade but trying
to buff that into the skin when you do
have a little bit of texture going on
especially if you do have combo or oily
skin trying to buff a cream kind of
product in over an already set face that
has powder on it is actually really
really difficult now I don't always
recommend buffing these in I used to use
these with a stippling brush and I would
just stipple over the apple of my cheek
I thought it looks really nice but my
face just eats this up so anyway that is
definitely the worst of colour-pop in my
opinion at the bronzers the blushes the
eyeshadows and then the best in my
opinion are at the sculpting sticks in
the contouring versions the highlighters
and the lippie stix so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and my opinion
kind of on colour-pop not crazy about
color pop products I just feel like my
face eats these products up so I'm
guessing that it has to do
with the kind of finish that finishes
that they have in the different sort of
I guess cream to powder finish I guess
that's kind of what's going on here so
let me know down below what kind of skin
take you have and what are your favorite
products from colour-pop and what are
your least favorite what works for you
and what does in I do notice a trend
that a lot of people with dry skin seem
to love color pop products and people
with more combo to oily skin I also like
color pop products but I noticed that do
people who have like the oiliest of
skins don't so I wonder if it has to do
with the actual cream to powder finish
but anyway thanks so much for joining me
guys I'm sorry this was a little chatty
I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
