my channel today I'm gonna discuss five
different eyeshadow palettes in my
collection that are insanely insanely a
powdery know I feel like this can be a
good thing it can also be a bad thing I
want to know what your thoughts are down
below but I thought different eyeshadow
palettes here that have the tendency to
really kick up a lot of powder so no
matter what brush I use I get the colors
and mixing together one of my biggest
pet peeves with eyeshadow palettes is
when you have the pans really close
together and then the colors start to
muddy into one another I don't like that
I don't like the cross-transfer of
product I'm not into that especially if
you have a more like diverse color
selection and you're going from a light
shade into a dark shade that's not gonna
work well so that is definitely a con
when it comes to powdery eyeshadows but
I have to say there are definitely pros
very very blendable super super
pigmented usually you know so it's kind
of like a hit or a miss I'm gonna walk
you guys through these five palettes so
let's go ahead and jump right into it I
want to start with a drugstore eyeshadow
palette now I feel like a lot of
drugstore eyeshadow palettes tend to be
very very firmly press and they're not
super stocked now the covergirl true a
naked line is actually super super
blendable and very beautiful I'm not a
huge fan of these anymore just because I
feel like there are better at drugstore
eyeshadow palettes out there that are
cruelty free now that I gravitate
towards Mara but I do love the color
selection in here I never liked my Urban
Decay Naked 3 palette so I like having
this and you know the revealed 2 palette
from Coastal Scents but anyway this is a
really really Airy light texture to it
but unfortunately these are really
really tiny little pants as you guys can
see I notice that if I pick this product
up say I want to go in with this guy
down here and I pick it up with a brush
and I want to work it into my crease
I mean without barely tapping it in you
can see it's already going into the next
pan over that's very very difficult when
you have those dark shades because
they're just all going to muddy together
and I do feel like you have to do a
little bit of building in the first
place when it comes to this eyeshadow
palette because it is from the drugstore
and there's not a huge amount of pigment
so that's kind of a lot so when it comes
to the actual formula but overall I
wouldn't say it's a crappy palette I
think it's good quality from the
drugstore it's just not usually what we
see from the drugstore all right up next
guys I have to talk of course about did
the Anastacio Beverly whole subculture
palette so
I actually really like mine I feel like
it the formula in here that I'm really
not a fan of are the duo Crohn's which
are electric and cube those are way more
problematic for me personally than the
maps now again if you're gonna go into
this palette and you're really gonna did
your brush in there as you guys can see
yeah I can dig in there cute
yeah I can hit pan if you know I mean
obviously if you're gonna take a really
a really densely packed brush and you're
just gonna swirl in there for days
you're gonna have some issue is now
again you can see the cross transfer
here we have access which has now gone
into edge which is more of like a like a
mustard shade what I feel like I have to
do is actually go in and kind of like
some watch the actual access out before
I put it back on to my eyes because I
don't like what it muddies together I
don't like when I have to take a really
dark color and then I want a yellow and
then suddenly there's like blue running
through it so that's definitely
troublesome but I will say these are
incredibly pigmented
I don't think I have an eyeshadow
palette in my collection and that is as
pigmented as these subcultures so I feel
like if you use it the right way if you
use small and densely packed and brushes
you really tap off the excess you're
very careful and you don't go swirling
your brush in there you should be okay
with the Anasazi and Beverly Hills
subculture palettes all right up next we
have the color pop yes please palette
it's got subculture all over it to come
from that access shade but this is what
it looks like on the inside now I have
to say the color pop press formula is
actually very very firmly pressed no I
don't want to see friendly but it
doesn't feel like stamp paper but it's
firmly press but very smooth when you
just watch these you don't think there's
gonna be any issues that you do go in
with a brush a fluffy brush a more
densely packed brush you will notice
probably almost the same amount of kick
up has a subculture palette so I find it
very interesting that a lot of people
rave about this formula over here and
the mats over here yet they really
really batch this guy because I feel
like if I'm going to go into like this
red shade right here I really pick it up
with like my morphe and 5:11 or
something I mean the product just
spreads all over the place so that's
definitely something to know what these
color pop palettes are rather small as
well so if you are looking into the FM
Barroso palette or this guy or even the
new I think I love you palette that is
just something to be aware of these do
have a lot of kick up and finally guys
we have to talk about the lorac pro a
formula look at this sad palette I mean
I can't keep these void palettes like
to save my life there's a--they lorac
mega pro 3 i really love the color
selection in here but one thing I will
say consistently across the board with
LaRocca is that a lot of this stuff just
starts to muddy together I mean you can
over blend this and I'm not someone who
spends a lot of time at blending my
eyeshadow but I do feel like this is a
palette where I really can over blend a
lot of these shades end up looking very
similar so if you're gonna go in with
your brush and say you pick up eggplant
dark navy and a little bit of that guy
right there I mean aren't they gonna
look different on the ice probably not
so it's okay if they transfer into one
another but you guys can see that little
guy made it all the way down here this
is this is the brush I'm using okay this
is a coastal sense I have two in front
of me right now I mean it is a little
more densely packed but I don't feel
like this should be happening I don't
feel like that should be happening with
the subculture either or the color pop
but yeah you know if you're someone who
hated their subculture and you want to
try out a lorac Pro palette I would not
recommend it I think you're not going to
like the formula either no these guys
aren't like I said super super blendable
easier to blend than the subculture in
my opinion and they're just as soft and
the actual settings in here as well this
ends and mats are created equally which
is really interesting a very unique
formula but you know I just noticed that
the more I reach for my at lorac Pro
Palace the more I realize I get the same
sort of I love no matter if the palette
is the tiny little original Pro or if
it's a huge one the same sort of I love
unless it's the lorac pro 2 because that
one has like pops of color but these
just type somebody together so anyway
guys that is kind of my little video on
five different eyeshadow palettes that
kind of muddy together they have a lot
of pickup a lot of kickback I would love
to know your thoughts on this down below
let me know if you have liked products
like this and that have a nice amount of
pigmentation that are super super super
soft and you don't mind the powder or do
you hate it let me know down below and I
guess I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
