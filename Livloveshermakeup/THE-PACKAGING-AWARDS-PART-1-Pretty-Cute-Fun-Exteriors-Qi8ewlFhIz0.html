today's video is going to be kind of a
fun and silly one we are talking about
all about the outside of packaging we
are not talking about products on the
inside we are talking about the
packaging awards we're talking about
those really beautifully packaged makeup
items they even if you didn't really
like the products on the inside you love
what's going on on the outside and
chances are maybe you even bought the
product because of what was on the
outside we all fall victim to this and I
just have some really beautiful makeup
in my collection that I want to dedicate
a whole video to of course it's not
always about what is on the outside you
guys you want to be pretty and smart
okay as far as makeup is concerned and
in life but I will be doing a video
dedicated to pretty plus smart packaging
in the future probably when I get home
from my trip in January so anyway let's
go ahead and jump right into it let's
give out some packaging awards alright
so the first item that I want to give an
award to is the Russia clot blur primer
from YSL look at this baby I mean this
is just luxury in a bottle you can see
the actual product itself has little
gold flakes sitting in there it is
beautiful it's a heavy glass bottle it
says YSL on the cap here I love white
and gold I love the pump everything
about it screams luxury and I'm all
about that life so that is definitely
the first item the second item that
definitely deserves an award is the
Sephora collection blush bronzed and
ready to blow face palette look at this
I love this I love love love this now I
will say I really wish they could have
done something a little different on the
inside I feel like the inside packaging
seems a little cheap but on the outside
it's beautiful I really really love the
sparkles I love the little patterns that
they have going on here and I really
love the colors I feel like that really
draws in my attention when I am looking
for makeup in my collection and it's
actually quite helpful because I have a
lot of makeup and sometimes when
something looks a little something like
this it's easy for me to see it so this
is the turn to big blush book too now I
wasn't a huge fan of every single shade
in here as far as the actual products
are concerned but the packaging really
drew me in it's beautiful it's bright
it's colorful I just love it I've really
really enjoyed that as far as
highlighters are concerned of course my
dior highlighters I mean look at this is
this not like luxury I feel like I'm
holding like $800 highlighter I mean
that's what it feels like I feel like
Dior is like the queen or king of
packaging they really really are amaze
and even the smallest details like the
little imprint on the front of the
actual highlight everything is just
there's so much detail it's beautiful I
feel luxurious I feel beautiful when I
use that the Jacqueline held back up
champagne collection all the packaging
was amazing I pretty much bought this
collection due to the packaging I don't
even watch Jacqueline Hale on YouTube I
bought this because of the packaging the
white and gold this is like my aesthetic
goals okay it is absolutely beautiful as
you guys can see they have little
champagne bubbles around there it is
like a soft gold mirrored thing on the
back and then on the inside it is all
soft gold and mirrored and have just
like this is this is life I love it
absolutely adore that and I love what's
on the inside too all right the
hourglass 2016 a palette was beautiful I
mean I really really am into this marble
thing now because of this I mean this is
just gorgeous
so you open it up and even at the
representation or the packaging on the
inside is gorgeous the products are
obviously very very beautiful but the
fact that they thought of like a marble
thing on the outside and even though it
is plastic I mean even from close up it
doesn't look like real marble I love
that I think that's beautiful so that's
definitely something I hope to award I
do have two mascaras here they really
draw my attention in every single time
I'm shopping my stash the first is the
YSL baby doll mascara again at these
luxury brands really know how to do it
as far as packaging is concerned it
really draws me in it's beautiful it
feels nice and weighted I really like
that and then one from the drugstore is
the Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
I love a lacquered look especially when
it's red or pink so this has both red
and pink on it it is so cute it almost
looks like it's a double ended mascara
but it's not and it's just beautiful I
love that outer packaging I'm a very
simple foundation that I just love
because of the packaging is this Laura
Mercier candle glow soft luminous
foundation so it has this gunmetal kind
of lick here you open it up and you do
have a pump I love the look of frosted
glass bottles I don't know what it is it
feels really good in my hand and I'm
just more prone to reaching for this
because I really like the way that it
feels like I like a glass bottle when it
comes to foundation so definitely giving
an award out to that one Too Faced oh my
god their packaging is everything their
bronzers their blushes everything is
just absolutely impeccable and adorable
here are their little love flushed
blushes they
and all different sort of shades I have
all six of them I take pictures on
Instagram of them they're just so cute
absolutely adorable they're chocolate
bon bons palette as well really really
love this I think that is adorable even
on the inside all the little hearts like
come on does that not draw you in I know
some people thought that this was
slightly childish I think it even said
in my review video I was like I don't
know I mean I guess I feel kind of
childish if I'm like putting on my
makeup and I have like a bunch of
friends around me that are like older
and they're like oh like that's the kind
of a childish palette but at the same
time I feel good when I'm using this
when I'm by myself and I'm putting like
digging my brush in there I feel cute
it's smells great like yes two-faced
you're doing it alright I'm at the vice
4 palette from Urban Decay in my opinion
is absolutely gorgeous you guys see that
I love this this is basically like an
oil slick or like a cobweb love this I
love the way this looks and it's
absolutely beautiful
a lot of this makeup I really just wish
I could just pile up and back of me and
it could be in like the backdrop for my
videos that's how pretty it is I'm the
cap on D metal Matt's palette I love the
way this looks and the way that she did
this so metal max like a genius
absolutely so cool and fun I really
enjoy that
and even on the inside the way that she
laid these out I actually think is so
beautiful I love looking at this is like
the color of the rainbow
I absolutely adore that again to face
with their sugar pop palette look at
that look at that those are little
macaroons on there oh my god like
seriously even when you open it up
the way it's presented look at this
sugar pop I mean come on it's not not
the cutest thing you've ever seen
I love that all right I do love really
simplistic packaging too sometimes
the Bobby Brown what is is called
afternoon glow highlight I love this
this is just very classy to me I love
that rose gold with the black you open
it up and you have this mirrored finish
here and it's a rose gold
I mean stunning love the way the actual
product looks as well this is a
beautiful beautiful highlight so that is
very very sophisticated and nice in my
opinion recently I picked up this little
Sephora the delicate eyeshadow palette I
love this this is so cute but look at
this is this not the most adorable
packaging it's a tiny little pink
triangle with like gold on the top and
pretty sure I just bought this because
of the packaging like most of these
items
aurilla the next items that
really really enjoy that I think is very
cool is the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation fluid the shade I wear as
dynamic did you see that it reminds me
of like what is that candy like the
swirly hard candy that you eat that's
like a um and then I say like a popsicle
that's like a lollipop that is what it
looks like it is a super trippy bottle
but I love it I love the way that looks
I think that is absolutely awesome
another part of the Bekaa Jacqueline
Hale champagne collection or the split
pants oh my god why can't Beco just do
this all the time they have a little
like flying saucer packaging with this
beautiful tarnished silver in the middle
and then like the white gold here again
love that it draws me in also the rose
quartz highlighter yes like the pink rim
and everything like that absolutely
beautiful and then even on the inside I
mean that just looks gorgeous I love a
highlight next to a blush I don't know
what it is but those just look gorgeous
to me and the second I saw those I was
like I'm buying those because of that um
the Urban Decay electric palette really
really fun as you can see on the outside
here it's just like a little I don't
know looks like smoke to me but again
it's so colorful it draws me in this is
something that I noticed right away when
I open up with my eyeshadow palette
drawer also the Tarte artists blush
palette it's like feathers do you guys
see that I love one torte does stuff
like this where it's very very um like
artistic so you could see it however you
want to see it it looks like feathers to
me some people say it looks like the
ocean I love it I really like how they
do this kind of bright in-your-face
packaging another little something I
want to talk about is the tartlet in
bloom packaging again people say this
looks like feathers to me looks like
little petals like in bloom absolutely
beautiful and I love the way they play
with colors as far as packaging is
concerned I really really like that with
the pinks and the purples it's a very
bright it's very in-your-face and it
makes me want to grab it especially with
that mirrored finish on the back even
though it does get like your
fingerprints on it I really love the way
that looks
z-bone cosmetics uh their blushes I feel
like the balm cosmetics is amazing with
packaging they do really really cute
packaging so this little guy right here
is called frat boy it's an amazing blush
their blushes are very very good but
yeah super cute packaging really enjoy
that also let's see here at the Y itself
alep teens in oils of course I have to
give a mention to these guys because
they are my all-time favorite lip
products they are absolutely beautiful
and the packaging is what drew me
the first time that I saw these they
never would have tried these if it
wasn't for the packaging so you can line
them up all together and just look at
that they look like little pieces of
candy don't they so look it's like
silver and then you have the actual
color of the lip product and I don't
know what it is but why I sound like I
said those luxury brands sure know how
to make you feel good when you're using
this makeup there is something about
that quality of digging into is
something that's really really
beautifully packaged that makes you feel
very womanly when you're putting on your
makeup at least for me and the final
thing that I want to give mention to you
again is another 90 M palette from Too
Faced the peanut butter and jelly I mean
come on is this not the cutest little
thing you've ever seen look at that
piece of toast
absolutely adorable and it does smell
like peanut butter which again the whole
scented thing everything like that I may
sit here and be like oh it's kind of
childish but I love it I love it okay
alright guys so that is it for the
packaging Awards please let me know down
below I know this was kind of a silly
video but please let me know down below
what your favorite packaged items are
have you ever bought a makeup product
based on what it looks like on the
outside
and don't forget we will of course talk
about pretty plus smart packaging in the
future but yeah these are just some
items that really make me feel good when
I'm using them either they're super cute
they're super beautiful or they're super
luxurious so anyway I hope you guys
