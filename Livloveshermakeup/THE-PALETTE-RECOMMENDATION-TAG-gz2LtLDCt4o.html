happy Wednesday I hope you are all
having a fantastic day as you can tell
from the title of this video today we
are doing a tag we are doing a pellet
tag this was created by my friend Kaylee
here on YouTube I'm going to go ahead
and link her channel down below in the
description bar as well as her video
where she introduced this particular tag
she put a lot of time and effort into
this I would love you guys went over and
sent her some love but yeah that would
be the first thing that you see in the
description bar I would also personally
like to tag a few people the first one
is my friend Jess the second is hailey I
would also like to tag Lisa and also
Haila so I will have their channels
linked down below as well in the
description bar and of course any of you
who want to do this tag even if you
don't even have a youtube channel you
could just write your answers down below
in the comment section I would love to
hear so there are 10 different questions
that 10 different questions look go
ahead and jump right into it the first
tag question is number one best palette
for beginners so I would say this is
definitely a palette that registers in
my mind as a palette for beginners this
is from the Sephora collection it is
called the Sun bleached filter palette
now they do have quite a few variations
on these filtered palettes they have
this one which I would say is really
good for those of you who have a fair to
light complexion maybe even medium skin
tone if you do have a medium to dark
complexion they have two others that are
also really really good the reason why I
say this instead of like a drugstore
palette is because you want your first
palette to also have a nice big sized
mirror and you want them to be blendable
smooth and creamy but you don't want
them to be too outside of your comfort
zone I feel like honestly with a lot of
the wet and wild palettes I would
recommend those however I will say they
have a lot of defining shades a lot of
darker shades and the last thing you
want to do when you are a beginner and
makeup is go ahead and attempt a smoky
eye it's just going to turn out very
muddy and very difficult so one of the
reasons why I like this palette is
because you are getting so many neutral
shades in here it's really foolproof and
honestly all of these will go on to the
eyes it cannot look overdone or messy
they don't blend together in like a
mushy mess you have some cool tones you
have some warm tones in here it's just
absolutely beautiful so I would
definitely recommend this for beginners
it's just wonderful because you do get
your nice little mirror in here it's got
great little packaging and like I said
they do have three different variations
of this palette so I would recommend
this one if you do have fear to light
skin tones or medium skin tones
then the other two are better for darker
complexions but very much foolproof very
easy to blend very buttery and I just
feel like these colors you can't really
you can't go wrong with them so
definitely back palette the second
question is best drugstore palette
hands-down I would have to say the wet
and wild comfort zone palette mine is
all oh my gosh it's just used and abused
look at the segment and I have been
using this for years now this was my
go-to palette when I was a sophomore in
high school I mean sorry a sophomore in
college I used the crap out of this I
think it's beautiful you're getting a
lot of gorgeous neutral tones in here it
is the best quality that you can find at
the drugstore I would say second-best is
probably the covergirl true naked
palettes I'm wearing the Roses palette
today on my eyes love the way it turned
out but this is even more buttery even
more beautiful you're getting a lot of
dupes for high-end eyeshadows in here
like this definer shade right here is a
dupe for the Mac blue brown pigment and
also I believe it's called ooh lounge
from Urban Decay and then just a lot of
gorgeous colors in here you're getting
neutral tones you're getting some
greenish colors this is just a fantastic
palette it blends out beautifully on the
eyes and they are very very soft and
creamy so I would say that is the best
palette from the drugstore and the third
question is best palette for work school
so I really tried to think of this one
at first I wanted to show you guys the
tartlet in bloom palette because I think
that's very neutral very beautiful you
could wear it if you were in a
professional setting if you were in high
school even middle school I started
wearing makeup when I was in Middle
School it's something that's just very
neutral and basic but then I thought you
know what did I wear on stage when I was
playing at Carnegie Hall what do I wear
when I have you know like work
conferences things like that I always
always reach toward this little palette
right here this is the Too Faced and
natural matte palette and I feel like
matte colors are just very very
professional-looking so if you are
someone who you know is in a
professional environment I would highly
recommend checking out this palette one
of my most requested eye looks of all
times like was created with this
particular palette it is beautiful
you're getting lots of different tones
in here it's just gorgeous they're very
easy to blend
I love the 9 pan palettes from Too Faced
but I would say that this is great for a
professional work environment now if you
are in high school or something like
that and you want a little pop of color
I would say the tartlet in bloom palette
because you do have a few little
shimmery shades
they're mixed in with some matte shades
but yeah I would definitely say the two
facing natural palette moving on let's
see here we have in number four which is
best palette for a natural way to play
with color I would definitely go with my
violet Voss Pro eyeshadow palette in the
drenched metals version the reason why I
love this palette so much is because you
are getting pops of color in here
however you are also getting neutral
tones so if you just want to take a
slight pop of color and put it on your
lower lash liner onto your lid you can
actually blend them out with the more
neutral shades in here which i think is
awesome so you can take the shade come
through or dark desires or this really
beautiful I'm so fancy color and then
you can blend it in with these more
neutral colors over here or even this
bottom row here you know it looks
beautiful and I think this is a really
nice way to play with color these are
quite foiled and they are quite heavily
pigmented however like I said if you
were to just pop them on your lower lash
line or all over your lid and blend them
out with more basic colors I think that
that's a really fun and easy way to play
with some color alright moving on the
next question is um biggest bang for
your buck hands-down I would have to say
my mix button naked palettes this one is
just the original version I also do have
the underneath a tall version this one
is great if you do have a fear to light
complexion or medium skin tone if you
are anywhere between a medium and darker
in complexion I would highly recommend
checking out to the underneath it all
palette it has just a little more depth
and warmth to it and those colors will
probably show up better on your eyes but
in here you are getting a huge mirror
you are getting 50 nice shadows and then
you open up the bottom you are getting
four blushes two highlighters and a
bronzer and this is around $25 when you
can get it on sale so you are getting a
lot of product in here I think the
eyeshadows blend out really beautifully
onto the eyes I think the blushes are
gorgeous the bronzer is a little too
warm tone for me personally I still use
that I'll use that as an eyeshadow but I
would say this one you know I just I'm
not a huge fan of the bronzer color but
the two highlighters here show up really
nicely on me so yeah for around 25 or 35
dollars I would say this is definitely
the biggest bang for your buck and all
in one palette that is perfect for
travel as well
alright moving on the next question is
best palette for insert your skin tone
here so I would have to say for my fair
complected skin definitely the perfect
mate perfect hue palette from Stila in
the fair / light version this
obviously creative for those of you who
do have fear to light complexions
especially if you do have a little bit
of equal undertone this is what it looks
like you are getting two different
blushes in here and then you are going
Lisi or one two three four five
different eyeshadows really beautiful
like I said if you have fair to light
skin tones this is going to show up
beautifully on you now if you do have
darker complexions they do have four
different options of this palette so
they have the affair to light late to
medium medium to deep and the deep /
dark they're all gorgeous I own all four
of them so no matter what you can find
something that would work for your skin
tone but yes for fear to light
complexions I would say the perfect meet
perfect to you in the fair to light
version all right moving on the next
question is best palette for insert your
eye color so I obviously have kind of
like bluish grayish eyes I would say
anytime I wear the Too Faced peanut
butter and jelly palette my eyes pop it
is probably because you have a lot of
warm tones a reddish brown colors in
here lots of bronzy colors look really
really great if you do have green and
blue gray colored eyes so the shades in
here that I love the most are peanut
brittle nuts about you peanut butter cup
peanut butter and also bananas those
look amazing on blue eyes so if you
really want to make your blue eyes pop I
would highly recommend checking out the
peanut butter jelly time palette alright
moving on the next question is best all
in one palette hands down I would say
the Urban Decay Naked on-the-run palette
this is what it looks like it is
absolutely beautiful I love this
packaging did you open it up and you are
getting let's see here well let me take
these little items out quickly so you
are getting a blush a bronzer and also a
highlight in here I'm not a huge fan of
the bronzer in here I feel like it is a
little too warm toned however if you
dust it on really lightly it actually
looks beautiful and you can mix it
together with the blush to get a little
more of a cool tone vibe going on the
highlight is pretty good you are getting
five at different eyeshadows and then
when you first purchase this you are
getting a deluxe sized Urban Decay
perversion mascara you are also getting
one of their eyeliners and also a lip
gloss in the shade C so I believe I
already use those products up but I
wanted to show you guys the reason why I
still love this is because you can pop
anything in there so you can still take
an urban decay eyeliner and pop that in
there you can take a mascara and you can
pop that in there and you can even take
the urban decay color correcting fluids
and pop those in there so I would say
this is just absolutely fantastic for
travel if
want something that is all-in-one you
practically have your whole entire face
here except for your foundation I would
recommend looking into that palette
alright the next one is best for travel
so I feel like it could go either way I
feel like I could say the NYX butt naked
underneath it all palettes the Urban
Decay on the run are obviously great as
well but I want to say right off the bat
I would say the lorac Pro palette
anytime I travel I would say 70% of the
time I am using the lorac Pro palette
these are just very very slender and
sleek you can take one of the pro
palettes if you want a little more color
but the lorac pro pellets are fantastic
I do have let's see here the first one
and the third one just depends on what
kind of colors you want to use if you
want something a little more dramatic
you can go for this one you have matte
shades on the top shimmers on the bottom
and if you want something a little more
neutral you can go for the three and if
you want something a little more cool
toned you can go for the two I still
don't have the two but yeah this is
absolutely beautiful I feel like you can
create every sort of look for this with
this particular palette and as far as
being travel friendly is concerned this
is like right at the top of my list and
the final question is one palette that
you would not recommend and I've already
talked about this but I have to say
these Smashbox on the rocks palette this
goes in and out of being on stock on the
all TOCOM website I know that the
packaging is absolutely stunning you
guys but please do not pick this up I do
not think that this photo op eyeshadow
palette photo op eyeshadow formulation
is any good you do get a nice mirror
here and it looks absolutely stunning on
the inside you're getting some purpley
shade some cool tone shades and then
some warm tone shades but I promise you
these do not blend very nicely at all
they do not look good on the eyes and I
just do not think it is worth the price
so anyway guys that is the pilot
recommendation tag I hope you enjoyed

check out Kelly's video as well send her
some love and I will see you guys
