this video I am doing the ride-or-die
tag this was created by Jaclyn hill here
on YouTube I mosey down over to her
channel I watched her video and I was
like I like that a lot so the concept is
basically you are choosing your top
bitch products from each category like
just stop bitch products so your
all-time favorite like I know that we
all have favourites I mean I do weekly
favorites I have a lot of favorites but
these are the products that you would
bring onto a deserted island with you
even though that wouldn't really be
makeup would not be my first concern if
I was on a deserted island but this is
what I would bring with so anyway I
started at the top of my Alex series 9
drawer I worked all the way down and
then I chose one lip product so let's go
ahead and start with the lip product yes
I only chose one not a lip gloss and a
lipstick and this only one if I have to
narrow it down it would be this it is
the YSL if the left engine oil in the
shade cherry my Chevy it is absolutely
beautiful it smells amazing and it tints
your lips so basically goes on glossy it
tastes like watermelon I need to get all
of these after I do my declutter series
remind me to get every single one of
these because I use this constantly I'm
all about comfort when it comes to lip
products and I have a lot of lip
products ok but this is just topic top
bitch habits and that is what it looks
like it starts to kind of darken up
after the oil parts kind of like I guess
it dissipates on your lips and then
you're just left with a beautiful kind
of like pouty pinkie stain absolutely
perfect absolutely perfect alright let's
talk about highlighter it came like
that's no surprise that this this was
the one I was going to choose it was
just kind of like love at first sight
with this particular product not only
because of the packaging which by the
way you will see tomorrow in one of my
videos which is the packaging Awards but
also just because I put it on my face
and I was like you know when you know
you know what can I say this is the Dior
nude air glowing gardens powder
illuminator in 0:01 glowing pink it is a
baked slate formulation and I've had
highlighters for a long time now but the
second I put this on my face I was just
like that's it that's the one so there
it is absolutely beautiful I do have a
cool undertone so this looks really
really stunning and they also had like a
nude shade and I believe right now
because the
limited-edition but they have a new one
out right now that looks gorgeous - and
it's more of like a bronzy shades so if
you do have darker skin tones or if you
have more of like a Borum undertone you
might want to check that one out but
this is just my holy bro
my Holy Grail it is top bitch I need to
stop saying that but seriously it is all
right as far as eyeshadow palettes are
concerned this was actually very easy
for me at first I was like oh
probably the violet Voss palettes or
something like that if I had to narrow
it down maybe the Holy Grail palette but
then I thought but no you just started
using those this year those are like
yearly favorites if there's something
that I dig into every single day and
something that I have had for years and
years and years it's the Too Faced
natural eye kit and this is what it
looks like this is like I said from Too
Faced I have the old cardboard packaging
and the reason I ended up picking this
one is because take a look at this look
at all those dents
hello I'm obviously in love with this
I've completely emptied out that pan
right there
pan pan almost pan on that one almost
pan just like yes I really really
absolutely adore this palette and I know
they have changed around a little bit of
the the formulation but the colors like
in the new tin packaging but I'm still
gonna get it I love this palette it is
everything best eyeshadow palette I own
alright let's talk about contouring
palettes I wanted to include this
because before I got this palettes like
a few months ago I honestly wasn't
really wowed by contouring products I
don't really wear contour on a daily
basis and I think it's because I wasn't
too impressed with what I had I think
there's still good products and I made
show them as like a Holy Grail in my
weekly favourites videos but for the
most part it was not love at first sight
until I got this it was just like I put
this on my face and I was like now that
is how you should contour this is the
you sculpted universal contouring
palette for face and body from it
cosmetics and what I love about this is
that it's so natural it's so natural all
of these are so so so buttery you know
like on a daily basis I like to use this
soft contouring shade I think it's
absolutely stunning you can go really
really deep they are these softest
contouring powders I have ever ever ever
touched in my life and I like that they
have different tones we have more of an
ashy tone here or more of a red tone
there it's just the perfect pallet and
you can even bronze with this if you
want to but yeah I don't think I really
fell in love with contouring until I got
this product so that's how
this was definitely like my ride-or-die
I'm speaking of bronzers this is super
super new to me but I had to include it
because I literally think I'm going to
declutter like 85% of my bronzers this
is the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
in the shade light bronzer and this week
I'm using the other shade which is just
called bronzer it's a little more cool
tone I like this one it has kind of like
a readi undertone and even though I do
have like a cool undertone in my skin I
am self stand right now and I think this
is beautiful this is by far the best
bronzer I have ever used I have like the
two Facebook of bronzers thing I have
like I have so many bronzers but this is
the best one I have ever used it is
super super silky and buttery it smells
amazing and what I like about it is it
looks so natural it's very hard to find
a bronzer like this that looks very
natural and is not insanely pigmented
because I use like a heavy hand and I
don't like what I'm going to like hoola
and put it on and it's like whoa that's
like so obvious it looks like I punched
myself in the face like I have bruises
or something so and this is amazing and
I really really really really love this
all right moving on I'm setting powder
the same is no surprise to me I was like
right away elf tone correcting powder in
cool this has been my ride-or-die of
holy grail for I want to say five and a
half years now I would say this and also
that eye shadow palette that I showed
you guys I have been using since
probably my freshman year in college so
this is the elf tone correcting powder
in cool it is so finely milled I swear
to you I try all of these high-end
powders and I'm just not impressed first
of all I'm an oily beast so I go through
setting powder very very quickly and
second of all they're just so they look
like there's pattern on the skin this
sets in your makeup all day it really
helps to extend the wear of your makeup
and it's just absolutely phenomenal so I
love that as far as the finishing powder
is concerned I've tried a lot of the
like I was using micro silk the HD
powders you know like the silica powders
I've tried a lot of them that make up
forevers I've tried at the Tarte one the
it cosmetics 5 by pores is by far the
best this is the loose version in
translucent I don't really like the
pressed version I only like this one
it's amazing for using the buffing
technique or even just using as
finishing powder I don't use it to set
my makeup all that often just because
it's so loose and I feel like this does
a better job but this is a great
finishing powder definitely my all-time
favorite all right foundation now this
one I guess was a little tricky so
immediately I went and grabbed my
L'Oreal Pro mats because that is like
amazing
I love the coverage you can build it up
it looks amazing I love the shade and
then I was like no it must be the Tarte
Amazonian clay and then I was like no
this one this is the best foundation I
have ever put on my damp face this is
the josie maran vibrancy foundation
fluid really cool kind of trippy bottle
I will repurchase this over and over and
over again this looks like skin but it
has coverage the shade I have is dynamic
it's a perfect perfect match for me
during the winter time I don't wear it
as much during the summer because it
does have argan oil infused in it but
this is the best foundation that I have
ever seen on my skin it just is
absolutely absolutely incredible this is
it alright moving on to brow products
I'm not that into brow products I do
like my BH Cosmetics brow pencil and the
one from Revlon I don't really like the
Anastasi of Beverly Hills one but this
year I started using the Maybelline brow
drama cran pomade and instantly things
were different you guys probably have
seen this a bajillion times in shop and
swatch my stash because I want to fill
in my brows I have never wanted to fill
in my brows because I just don't really
feel like I need to all that often they
look a little flimsy if I don't but I've
never really cared but I reach for this
all of the time it's very very easy to
use you guys know I'm a no-fuss kind of
makeup girl I like things that are quick
basically and this is just definitely
like Holy Grail status right there that
has been very very impressive and
although it is new to me this year it's
just automatic that's like that's the
brow product alright mascara this
shouldn't have come as any surprise to
you guys the Sephora outrageous curl
dramatic volume and curve mascara so for
a house brand makeup some is good some
is bad this is excellent absolutely
outstanding and this is what the wand
looks like it's super super tiny and
precise I look like I'm wearing false
eyelashes when I wear this I really do
I'm not worried at today but I do look
like I'm wearing false
is when I have this on two coats of it
you have these big pretty like dull like
looking lashes it's absolutely amazing
and I love the packaging so that is on
my favorite all-time desert island
desert island deserted island right
desert island
there's islands of the desert you guys
know what it means this is doesn't it I
talk about it all the time alright
moving on let's talk about blush I love
blush I love blush and you guys know I
love the Too Faced love flush blushes
those are my favorite blushes of all
time however love hangover this
particular shade is the best blush I
have ever put on my skin it's very
strange because it actually has like a
warm undertone to it and I swear to you
it looks completely different on the
cheeks than it does when you actually
look at it in the pan or swatch it so it
really doesn't it look like it's
anything too special it almost looks
like it has a little bit of like a
reddish undertone and I don't know I
think that if you have fair skin you
would look at this and think like oh no
I don't want to do that but I swear to
you the second I put this on my cheeks
it just looks like I don't know it looks
like magic it looks like magic I've
never had a blush make my cheeks look so
beautiful and I feel like sometimes you
just like put on a product and it's like
meant to be with your skin this is meant
to be alright moving on let's talk about
concealer this is relatively new to me
again but I have what like 28 open
concealers right now nothing really
Wow's me you guys have probably seen in
look of the week I sometimes just
actually most of them don't even use
concealer I just don't feel like it's
not that I don't need it I definitely
need it but I just don't feel like they
meet my standards all the time either
they crease or they're cakey or they're
not the right shade but if they charge
rainforest fec aqua sealer has
completely blown me out of the water
again new to me this year but right away
I was like this is amazing the only
thing I don't like about it is the
strange smell it smells like paint it
smells like paint it really has a big
like doe foot applicator which is kind
of huge and I at first I was like I
don't like that it's all over the place
but I really like it because you can get
right underneath your eye really really
quickly it's very very lightweight and
just beautiful on the skin and you
later this I swear you could put like
five layer five layers of this
underneath your eyes and it would not
look cakey so that is my favorite
concealer I have an eye shadow single
here I have a lot of eye shadow singles
but this is the one that I reach for it
the most often and the one that is just
tapash this is the NYX let's see here
what are these calls prismatic
eyeshadows yeah and this is in the shade
girl-talk which is a beautiful kind of
pinky I don't even know it's like a
pinky whitish color you know what and
actually I'm pretty sure someone told me
that it is a dupe for the Dior glowing
burdens highlights so let's go ahead and
swatch those next to each other so look
how similar so there is Girl Talk from
NYX and there is the glowing gardens
highlights no wonder I like both of
those I think they're absolutely
beautiful very very similar to each
other I love that facial a sort of
formulation and that is just ride or die
right there alright let's talk about
color correcting because I've been
really into color correcting if I had to
choose like a color correcting concealer
it would definitely be my Maybelline
instant age rewind in the brightening
version I haven't even cracked into this
one yet but I've gone through seven or
eight of these like full size I used
this all the way through college
even before color correcting became such
a trend I was using this to brighten
underneath the eyes I love the
brightening effect of the pink one so I
really really love that but I have to
say the Urban Decay Naked skin color
correcting fluids blew me out of the
water this year these are products that
I would repurchase every shade of but if
I had to pick one it would be the shade
pink is beautiful if you have very very
fair skin you would absolutely love this
if you have a cool undertone get the
pink one if you have a warm undertone
get the yellow shade they're stunning
and this has been my favorite color
corrector of the year
alright moving on the next item is a
face primer and this is kind of this I
guess this one was kind of hard I chose
the it cosmetics fields a moment
anti-aging ultra hydrating sensory
awakening primer serum and I didn't
realize at first that it was going to be
this one until I really was like okay I
like this one for this I like this one
for this and then I got to this one I
was like I like this one because oh it
does everything literally it does
everything it hydrates your skin you can
use it as a
while skincare in the morning it smells
amazing a little goes a very long way it
is so beautiful the consistency of this
is amazing if you do have common oily
skin like me only use a tiny bit I just
rub my hand down the outside of the
actual dropper but this is this is the
best primer I've ever used
alright moving on to eyeliner um my
provider dies
favourite eyeliner is definitely the
Maybelline New York master drama by eye
studio you're probably thinking what
what about the Urban Decay 24/7 I do
like those but I prefer this shade this
is the dark color in Midnight master
this is blacker and darker than zero or
any of the black eye pencils from Urban
Decay 24/7 glide on eye pencil
collection it's amazing and I feel like
this defines my waterline like nothing
else so that is the top product and the
final products I want to talk about is
an eyeshadow primer and it is the one I
have on today again wasn't super
impressed with eyeshadow primers until I
got this this is the Maybelline master
prime long-lasting eyeshadow base in the
shade 115 I prefer this over my high-end
primers over anything else it's
beautiful it's beautiful you can still
blend your eyeshadows on top of it it's
silky it's soft it has a little bit of
like a pink undertone it helps with
creasing it helps to prevent um just
like wrinkling around your eyes it's
absolutely amazing I can take this
underneath my eyes as well to prep for
concealer it's just the best eyeshadow
primer I've ever used so alright guys
those are all of my ride-or-die top
pitch products let me know down below
which are yours and I will see you guys
tomorrow but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
