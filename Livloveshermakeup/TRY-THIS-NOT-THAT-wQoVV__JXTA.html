my channel I'm gonna throw up a time
stamp really quickly if you want to
fast-forward and get right into the try
this not that makeup edition part 1 but
I have a little bit to talk about really
quickly here because I want to give you
guys a heads up that this is going to be
an incredibly busy month for me and I
usually I'm pretty busy if you didn't
know I teach full time I am a
conservatory flick teacher so I'm a
music teacher on top of that I teach
every single weekend privately through
my own home for soprano alto tenor bass
recorder as well as a modern flute as
well as baroque flute and then I also do
about five to seven pickup gigs every
single month well I have a substitute
teacher that teaches at my school she
actually fills in for my classes she
also works part-time at a clinic she's
currently out of town for the whole
entire month and I am covering her
second job so technically I have been
working three jobs this whole entire
week and let me tell you honey that
is hard especially when you're already
working full-time I literally on my
lunch breaks have been going over to
this clinic and you know doing things
and then going over to the clinic after
I'm done with work and it has just been
a lot of work and I am exhausted
and I have not been able to use my time
very well so I wanted to say I'm sorry I
wasn't able to get the mystery video up
this week I'm sorry I wasn't able to get
a video up yesterday I'm going to try at
my best to pre film this whole entire
weekend so that next week I just have
pre filmed content going up for you guys
but that is kind of why I have been a
little absent willing to let you know
keep you in the loop with what's going
on especially because I've been a little
more open on this channel I just want to
let you guys know where I'm at
also my best friend is getting married
and she's getting married soon over
shell is and I'm going to be her maid of
honor so I'm starting to put some stuff
together I actually visit her for a
whole week over Easter so let me know if
there are any specific videos you would
like me to film when I'm with her I'm
very excited to see her at the end of
March but yeah that's kind of what's
been going on with my life off-camera
and then we've got that out of the way
let's go ahead and jump into the try
this and not that video I think this is
gonna be part one out of like two or
three I have a lot of products I want to
talk about I want to do a whole separate
one just on eyeshadow palettes as well
but I'm really excited for this I don't
know if you guys have ever caught emily
noel 83 series which is try this not
that giving her full credit as always i
will link her a series up in the cards
but she talks about products that are
kind of like a dupe it's not like it's a
spot on dude because she's kind of like
me when it comes to do but if it's a
Duke I want it to be a finished dupe a
color tube I wanted to have the same
sort of texture all that kind of stuff
but if this is a way of getting a
product that is very very similar except
for a cheaper price and this is the NYX
board to glow illuminating a primer in
the shade white and this is the Becca
backlight priming filter I have been
trying to pan this for a long time
now as you guys can see I have made a
lot of progress and I'm very very proud
however I have never been in love with
this primer I have tried it when I had
more combo oily skin I've tried it down
here in the desert when I having
extremely dry skin and there's something
about it that just looks very artificial
on the skin and I think that that's just
something that happens a lot when it
comes to illuminating primers sometimes
they just look way too shiny on the face
and it gives you this very very
plasticky sort of look now I've really
gotten into a very very natural makeup I
mean I don't wear nearly as much
foundation as I used to or concealer or
color correctors or anything like that
and I feel like this NYX a born to glow
illuminating primer and the shade of
white is that perfect amount of glow
that I want for my skin I love the way
it goes on it actually has a little bit
of slip to it so if you want to fill in
your pores just a little bit this is
going to help you get a nice amount of
product in here I love the squeezy
bottle they do have three different
shades to choose from so if you do have
a deeper complexion you worry that this
is gonna be a little too light for you
they do have a tam sheet and then a deep
shade and they just really go on nicely
they don't leave that artificial kind of
cast it really just looks like a glow
from within sort of product and this is
about a fraction of the price that they
Becca backlight priming filter so that
is the first product that I want to
recommend to you guys try this nothing
let's move on to the Urban Decay Naked
skin weightless ultra definition hi and
makeup I feel like a lot of people ask
me to dupe this out and I've never been
able to find a spot on dupe for this
particular foundation however the uLTA
Beauty HD soft focused liquid foundation
which retails for around $14 basically
half the price of this actually looks
very similar on the skin now I will say
they have a little
of a different texture this one really
feels very very liquidy and light and
this one does as well however it
definitely has a little more silicone
slip to it so in my opinion this is
actually easier to blend and then this
guy is no they both look very very
natural on the skin they have a soft
focus sort of effect and I believe of
both of these have a nice a shader range
it's not spectacular it's not amazing
orbit decays shave range is definitely
better than this guy right here but if
you can't find your shade this is the
foundation that I would recommend
looking into before you go for the naked
skin I think a lot of people hear about
the naked skin and they think it's going
to have phenomenal coverage and that is
not what the naked skin line is about
from the urban decay this is light to
medium coverage very very natural finish
looks like skin but so it does the HD
it's soft focus liquid foundation so
yeah definitely try this before you try
this while we are talking about urban
decay you guys know I'm a huge fan of
their naked skin color correcting fluids
in fact I'm just a huge fan of the Naked
skin line in general and this one right
here is ingrained this one is in
lavender I use lavender to kind of lift
my fine lines and wrinkles and then
green to conceal redness now my two
favorite shades from the Urban Decay
Naked skin color correcting formula are
definitely pink as well as yellow those
are great under the eyes especially if
you do have a very very fair complexion
however I feel like if you want a color
corrector that has concealer built into
it the NYX color correcting concealer
palette is just as good and you are
going to get six of different shades in
here for basically under the price of
one of these now as you can see you have
yellow you have green you have peach you
have a lavender you have a contouring
shade down here as well as the concealer
I have hit pan on practically every
single shade in here and you can see
that I really do enjoy this now would I
go ahead and repurchase the lavender or
the green from the urban decay and no I
would not I would repurchase the pink in
the yellow but if I needed a lavender or
if I needed a green I would definitely
just repurchase this palette right here
again I feel like a lot of color
correctors do not have that built-in
concealer effect but both of these do
and yeah I would definitely say it try
this not bad all right let's move on to
our glass you guys know I'm a huge fan
of their hourglass ambient lighting
powders this one right here is the
serial light which is great if you have
a fair complexion with a cool or neutral
undertown however the elf illuminating
palette
this is very very similar you're not
going to get that spot on color dupe
going on but you are going to get a very
very similar texture and feel as well as
a look on the skin these are one of
those kind of powders that really
diffuse light nicely you can build them
up a lot on the skin and get a wham bam
and your face kind of highlight or you
can just dust them on lightly set
underneath your eyes this shade right
here is very similar to dim light from
hourglass of this one is pretty similar
to a mood light which has a bit of a
yellow undertone the other two are just
really really beautiful in my opinion I
like this a lot and since I did purchase
this I have not been purchasing as many
of my hourglass ambient lighting
counters I already do have quite a few
full sizes of these as well as a few in
palettes but I just wanted to let you
guys know very very similar sort of
product so if you want to test out in
that range and see what the hype is
about when it comes to the hourglass
ambient lighting powders I would
recommend trying this out first but
before going ahead and purchasing this
Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting
powders 399 $4.99 depending but where
you pick them up I know you know where
I'm going with this the dior $54
highlighters which I will be
decluttering to my friend Brittany in
the shade zero zero one glowing pink as
well as zero zero one nude air very
similar to these and I mean it's
basically a spot-on dupe this time this
is actually a dupe would highly
recommend you try out this formula
before you go and invest fifty four
 dollars okay these like I said
are three ninety-nine 4.99 this one
right here is precious petals which is
very similar to the nude air shade and
then this one right here is called
blossom glow which is very very similar
to zero zero two or zero zero one
glowing pink which was from the limited
edition a Dior 2015 holiday collection
so these are beautiful they go light on
just as nicely they have the same amount
of pigmentation and if you want to get
into the base gel a sort of formula and
you're not going to if you're gonna like
it if you have the right brush this word
or anything like that go ahead and spend
under five dollars before you invest in
a over fifty dollar finally try this not
that again I have been
about this powder like crazy recently it
is the elf HD setting powder you get a
nice amount of product in here for about
five dollars I'm gonna go ahead and say
it is just as good as the Becca
under-eye brightening setting powder
which retails for what twenty eight
thirty dollars I mean you can get so
many of these for the price of this and
it is just a basic silica powder I do
notice maybe this has a few more
brightening effects to it but I feel
like the way it goes on the way that it
sets my under-eye I absolutely would
recommend going in with the elf HD
setting powder in fact I would recommend
any sort of silica powder that's in that
sort of really silky finely milled realm
that you would kind of use as a
finishing powder just go ahead and
replace it with this because it is the
same god damn thing it is such a good
powder I love it underneath the eyes I
love it to use the buffing technique all
over my face and even on days where I'm
just wearing like a CC cream kind of
like I did today this is what I have it
that set my whole entire face in and it
just gives this beautiful flawless soft
focus look to the skin and it is really
really nice so would highly recommend
and you scoop this one up and keep that
one at the store so anyway guys that is
my first dry that's not that video I
hope you enjoyed it I hope you enjoyed
hearing the little update at the
beginning of the video if you didn't

channel is changing a little bit and

of you are not but I just want to be
more open on here to let you guys know
