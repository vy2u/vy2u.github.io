thank you so much for joining me i hope
you are all having a really really
fantastic saturday i am here to share a
little target haul with you guys i did
some shopping yesterday I picked up some
skincare items some bath items some hair
care items and some makeup items yeah a
few makeup items nothing just two so two
makeup item so anyway i thought i would
share with you guys what I got two ND
let's get ready to it the first two
things I picked up were repurchases
these are the up-and-up premium cotton
opal see so I'd be compared to brand at
target I love these for using micellar
water taking off my makeup and using
toner they're just amazing they're super
super like thick and quilted they have a
textured side and then a soft side
they're amazing love them the second
thing I picked up is something also a
repurchase this is the dry shampoo from
the suave professionals line it is the
keratin infusion one this is amazing it
leaves no white cast in your hair no
residue no tackiness or stickiness
absolutely amazing i love it and i think
it's only like three dollars really
really good deal alright the next thing
i purchased i have never tried before
these are the meat bath papaya nectar
mini bath ice creams so these are
basically just little bath bombs I
really love taking bath I actually take
a bath every other day and I make sure
that I do like that's my time to just
kind of unwind and I always make sure i
might take a bath put a face mask on so
anyway I love taking fast and I thought
these looked really really promising I
think this little thing that has a 27
here or six one two three four five six
it has six I believe this was like 999
which is really not that bad compared to
other bath bombs like that pump that
lush are like 99999 a piece so I feel
like these are actually really well
priced the papaya and necroshade just
sounded really really delicious and they
do have a moisturizing six oil blend in
them purifying minerals indulgent
fragrances and epsom salts so we shall
see how those go let me know if you guys
would like a follow-up hall on these
items are on this haul because I can do
that in like a week or two once i get
through everything alright the next
thing I picked up with the makeup item
from maybelline this is a brow drama by
I studio pomade cran in 250 blonde I
personally don't like a brow
pomades I don't like brow powders I only
use pencils but I liked this because
it's in like pencil form so I'm gonna
try this out we'll see how it goes it
seems like it's a very very slick and
like an oily sort of consistency which
would make sense since it is a pomade
but I hope that it just goes on really
easily and it's kind of like a no-fuss
brow products because I'm a no-fuss kind
of girl when it comes to my brows
alright the next thing I picked up with
a toner and a really really expensive
toner this is the pixie skin treats glow
tonic exfoliating toner and has five
percent glycolic acid in it aloe vera
and ginseng I have gone through I think
five deluxe I samples of this I
absolutely love it but literally 3.4
fluid ounces is fifteen dollars that is
so expensive for a toner so I just never
could justify the price but I finally am
getting it because it really is good and
I love the way um makeup sits on top of
it like if you use it in the morning it
really does exfoliate your skin take off
any residual makeup or any residual like
products from the night before and then
you put your makeup on and just sit so
beautifully on top of it so I absolutely
love that toner and finally went ahead
and splurge the next product I got with
the Pantene pro-v moisture mess this is
the detangler and I need detangler in my
hair my hair literally tangles if the
wind blows the wrong way okay like it
just tangled up into a rat's nest it's
disgusting I hate it but anyway I
thought this one was nice because it is
from Pantene I'm sure it smells amazing
like all panting products do and also it
said that has light conditioning like
properties to it so it will also
moisturize your hair so I'm super
excited to try that the next thing I got
to wear these aveeno active naturals
clear complexion daily cleansing pads
these have point five percent salicylic
acid in them I wanted to compare these
to the rock resurfacing discs I love the
rock resurfacing disc I've used them
after I remove my makeup kind of to get
off any residual makeup and also just
cleanse my face like one time they're
super super nice so I wanted to compare
these ones I know they don't have the
same ingredients but these are cheaper
so I wanted to see if they were similar
and then I also picked up these cerave
or sarahfey makeup removing cleansing
cloths these were so expensive these
like 899 but they are new their ultra
gentle they are accepted by the National
eczema Association I just wanted to try
them I like using makeup removing cloth
like this when I travel they're just so
easy to use and they're very very you
know quick and easy to grab for if that
makes sense it says they gently remove
dirt oil and even waterproof mascara
they also have ceramides in them and the
cerave or cerave brand is very similar
to the cetaphil or cetaphil brand so I
know that it will be very gentle on my
skin and hopefully won't make me break
out or anything like that so I will let
you guys know about those ones and then
I also picked up a facial cleanser it's
not actually for my face this is the
good Reggie the naturals purifying
facial cleanser it has willow bark in it
which is just a fancy word for salicylic
acid but this gently removes impurities
and improves complexion for fresh clear
skin I've heard of people using this
particular product for cleaning their
makeup brushes lately I have been
cleaning my makeup brushes with baby
shampoo and I've noticed that I've been
getting breakouts in weird areas that I
normally don't break out in like my
t-zone I normally just break out along
this area like on my neck and stuff like
that from hormonal acne but I've been
getting weird stuff on my forehead so I
thought maybe it was from like the
residue of the baby shampoo that dried
Omni brushes so I thought I would try
this I will keep you guys updated I
think this was 5 99 or 699 so it's kind
of like the same price as they make up
what is it like a brush cleanser would
be like it's pretty much around the same
price range so we shall see I like that
there's a pump and let me smell it yeah
it doesn't really smell like anything it
is supposed to be very very natural it
says dermatologist recommended ninety
percent natural derived ingredients so
hopefully it won't make me break out or
give me any sort of rashes on my face I
just want something to clean my brushes
really really well and also not make me
break out on my face alright the next
thing I picked up was at this NYX color
correcting concealer like little sextet
this is what it looks like you have your
green color your yellow your purple your
lavender or whatever you have the peach
tones and then a contouring shade I am
doing a color correcting collab next
week with my good friend Amy or make up
a mu Michelle here on YouTube i'll link
her channel below
description bar but anyway we are doing
a collab basically talking about all of
the color correctors that have come out
like in the past month between the two
of that between the two of us we
literally have picked up every single
wine so I thought it would also be nice
if we both picked up a drugstore want to
try out and let you guys know if it
works so she's picking up the makeup
revolution wanted and I picked up the
next one so we will keep you updated on
if those are like as good as the you
know high-end ones that have been coming
out and then I also picked up these
suave professionals intense moisture
masses as they repurchase i purchased
this last time i did a target haul it's
amazing i have been using it all week
the other tub is in my shower right now
it smells amazing it smells like coconut
is super thick and luxurious really
really cheap like literally like under
five dollars at the drugstore or at
target it just moisturizes your hair so
nicely and I feel like it really really
helps with frizz as well so really
really good product this has become like
one of my new favorite mass so I had to
pick up a backup and then as a last
thing I picked up it was the Neutrogena
oil-free acne stress control power cream
wash this has micro clear technology and
two percent salicylic acid in it my skin
has been responding very well to sell us
that like acid lately for whatever
reason normally when I have breakouts I
do prefer benzoyl peroxide but I used up
my benzoyl peroxide wash so I thought I
tried this one out I really enjoy the
toner from this line the acne stress
control toner so I thought I'd try that
one out and see how it goes so anyway
thatÃ­s men will fall from target I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
if you would like to see a follow-up all
in a week or two on these products and
yeah I will see you guys in my video
that will go up later today bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
