video is going to be a target haul I
went to target because I needed the
necessities like I don't know food and
water and I ended up with going and
wandering into the beauty aisle and I
swear to you like target is like a trap
target Walmart any sort of place like
that is a trap I always end up going and
i'll be shopping for food and like drink
and whatever and i end up going into the
beauty aisle just wandering in there and
getting a bunch of beauty products so i
didn't pick up any makeup a lot of this
stuff was actually necessities like
products that i needed to pick up but i
thought i would just share with you guys
because it ended up being a little bit
of a collective haul not a collective
haul a halt so let's just get right into
it the first two things that i picked up
were here mass i actually ended up
picking up for hair mask but these ones
were the first two ones and the reason i
got these was because Pantene has
recently released this like three minute
miracle line kind of like the aussie
three minute miracle products and they
all have like a different sort of
property that they're supposed to be for
like sleek and shine or like this in
that you know so basically i saw that
they had to give to other ones that i
hadn't gotten i actually have two that i
will be talking about looking at my
empties been right now so i picked up
the sheer volume 1 and also the which
one is that this is the one I used up
let me see this one I used up it is the
three minute miracle repair and protect
and I really really like these they all
smell really good like candy and I just
feel like they're really nice on the
hair and I love that they're in squeezy
bottles so when I thought that there
were cute other ones I was like I have
to get those so i picked up the moisture
renewal deep conditioner and i also
picked up the smooth and sleek deep
conditioner so I'm exciting to try goat
I think that they smell the same yeah
it's all the same as the other two that
I tried out and I really like to all of
them I don't feel like there's
necessarily huge differences between all
four of them but they were really a nice
price and I like that that you can like
squeeze them out pretty much all right
moving on I also picked up a dry shampoo
my friend meg I'm from one proud pinay
yeah that is her username here on
YouTube she was talking about this dove
hair therapy refresh mascara volume dry
shampoo in
of her December favorites was it her
December December or January favorites
video and she said this was really
really nice and she has dark hair and
she said he didn't leave any sort of
residue or color in her hair so I
thought I would try this I always look
for anything that can give me volume and
almost out of my batiste or batiste dry
shampoo for the month so i thought that
i would go ahead and pick that one up
and try not see if it works for my fine
limp hair alright moving on another deep
conditioner that I picked up was the
swab professional salon proven intense
moisture coconut milk infusion it comes
in this little container I swear this
was like two dollars and ninety-four
cents and i have to tell you guys my
all-time favorite or I can make open it
open okay my all-time favorite hair like
product you're pregnant dog I don't know
what I'm talking about my all-time
favorite shampoo is the suave
professionals Moroccan infusion care
shampoo for color-treated hair that is
my all-time favorite shampoo out of any
shampoo I've ever tried in my life so I
was like how have I never seen this swab
in polite professionals hair mask
because they love that line and it
smells really really good it looks like
it's really thick like I said this was
under like three dollars i don't know if
it was on clearance or something but it
was under three dollars you get 8 fluid
ounces a product in here which is the
same amount that you get in the Pantene
ones these are just in squeezy tube form
i do prefer the squeezy tube form and
you guys may be like why are you picking
up so many hair mask but i have
basically started to use only hair mask
to condition my hair um mostly because i
have been bleaching the hell out of my
hair lately and it's just has gotten
really kind of i mean it's still healthy
it's just a little more crispy than i'm
used to so I'm really trying to put
moisture back in and just make it nice
and healthy so I basically use a deep
conditioner every single time I wash my
hair now and I'm really like what is sin
doing for my hair so like I said I did
pick up a lot of deep conditioners but
the other one that I got is also in a
squeezy tube form and this is new from
garnier fructis this is the grow strong
mask it's a fortifying treatment for
stronger healthier shiny ohhhh hair it
smells amazing just like all of the
Garnier Fructis products like kiwi and
citrusy and just delicious and it says
it is a concentrated yet lightweight
rinse out mask with a high level of
active fruit concentrate and ceramides
that in check is a inject strength deep
into hair and for 25
the inside out so I'm really really
excited to use this and I just like this
squeeze into I'm really into that right
now I love that they're making these
hair maps to come in a sweet do all
right that next thing I picked up I am
so happy I finally found these because
everybody raves about these and I had
not been able to find them anywhere they
were not even in the skincare aisle
these were in the hair care aisle these
are the garden a scan active micellar
cleansing solutions or my seller waters
this one with the pink cap is for
sensitive skin it looks like this and
this is the one I heard the best things
about but the other one is for a
waterproof makeup and it looks like this
it has like a dual action it claims to
be oil free but my friend Mellie I was
watching her video she did a review on
these she was talking about how like
they're obviously is some oil in this
product so I don't really know what's
going on with that but this is what it
looks like it's kind of one of those
dual property where the oils at the top
and then you have the solution at the
bottom and this one is for waterproof
mascara so I love my simple micellar
cleansing water that is my all-time
favorite cleansing water it was in my
2015 holy grail skincare product video I
absolutely love it it just leaves my
skin so fresh and soft with absolutely
no residue so I'm hoping that these do
the same just because I am almost out of
that um simple one so I'm hoping that
these will be the same they have more
product in them and I just thought they
would last me longer so if I like these
that maybe they will be my new favorite
so I picked both of those out finally
found those which was great and then the
next two things I picked up were shaving
creams I was just out of shaving cream I
did open this one up and smell it
already um I'd like squirt a little bit
out on the back of my hands look how
cute it's like bubblegum pink this is
the Gillette Venus olay sugarberry bliss
this is a moisturizing shaving cream and
I love this one well I don't love this
one I had never tried it before oh god
it smells so good you guys smells like
candy umm it smells kind of similar to
the Pantene mass actually now that I
think about it but anyway not have it
all over it smells really really good
and i love the violet swirl one it's a
very very moisturizing and nice on the
legs I never get any nicks or any sort
of like bleeding on my legs like I never
caught myself when I use those so I
really enjoyed that and I also picked up
look at the color of this I don't even
know if it's showing up on cam
the way it looks in person but if Barbie
shaved her legs she would be using this
like look how bright it is so cute this
is the EOS evolution of smooth shave
cream it brightens an even skin tone it
has natural shea butter and vitamin b3
that nourish and soften the skin and
this scent is raspberry pomegranate I
have not tried this one I'm sure it
smells amazing i just have shaving cream
all over me now that's okay i want to
smell it and we just thank you wait i
can just open it okay oh yeah it smells
really really good super super fresh and
kind of florally like perfect for spring
I'm really getting into like spring
products now so yeah I'm really really
excited to use that I have tried the
lavender Jasmine one and it's amazing
it's got a great consistency also trader
joes makes a fantastic fantastic it's
called the honey mango shave cream that
one is amazing as well so yeah I picked
those up and then I just picked up some
cotton pads because i already opened
this one because they needed to use it
this morning with my toner but i love
these up and up premium cotton ovals
they're super super strong and durable
they're very very thick this is the
compared to brand at target these are
the only ones that i will use i have
completely become a snob when it comes
to cotton pads ever since i tried those
i cannot use anything else and then the
last thing that i got were three packs
of of course baby wipes just because I
wipe my hands after I do swatches while
I'm doing my makeup I just like to clean
like my hand so I picked up three of
those and that is the balance of my
little like target necessities hall I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and i'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
