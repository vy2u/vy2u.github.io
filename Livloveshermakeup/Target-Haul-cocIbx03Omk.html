right let's just get started the first
thing I got was this covergirl bombshell
volume eyelash last big sexy bombshell
lashes mascara so you get a dual sided
mascara wand to the first one volumizes
and the second one intensifies I know
that seems like a lot of work to have to
do two layers of mascara but I'm willing
to try it out so we'll see how that goes
the second thing I got was the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips custom
eye enhancing eyeliner trio that is
quite a name it says it enhance it
defines blue eyes and it has 24-hour
wear it looks like this it looks like
you get a nice bronzy color a navy blue
and a black with blue shimmer next I got
a Sonia Kashuk what is this dual fibre
crease brush it's number 205 it looks
like this I've heard a lot of good
things about Sonia Kashuk brushes so I
picked that up next I got one of the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte 24 hour
foundations I picked one of these up the
other day as well but the shade is a
little dark so I was using it to kind of
contour and define my face a little more
so I ended up picking up the lighter
shade this is 101 classic ivory I
believe that is their lighter shade
actually so next I picked up a another
one of these Maybelline matte lipsticks
this one isn't ravishing Rose I heard L
is for living talk about this color and
she was talking about how she really
liked it and was one of her fall
favorites so I thought I could take that
up it looks really really beautiful on
that the next thing I picked up it was
another Sonia Kashuk brush this is the
large crease brush number 116 it looks
like that it looks like it has a really
nice tapered top and I believe I've
heard quite a few people talk about it
next I got an elf eyelash and brow brush
it looks like that I love those for
coming out I brought my brows next I got
an elf eye crease brush it's really
really tiny and tapered it looks great
and yeah that's we got another little L
thing I got what do you know this is the
elf prison eyes shadow palette but this
one is in naked I did pick up about a
week ago I picked up the sunset one but
this one is a naked and it's just more
neutral colors but very very shimmery
gorgeous I like the other one so I
thought I'd have to get this one um yes
I got see here oh yes I got a whoops I
have a key visiting hello yeah next I
got the Revlon lip butter in pink
truffle I heard Emily Noel 83 talking
about how this is like a really marsala
kind of color and Marsala is the color
of the year for this year so I thought
I'd go ahead and pick this up and try it
out I don't have this color I love the
formula of the lip butter so I'm sure I
will like that next I got this little
custom eyeshadow palette thing from else
it looks like this it's the custom
compact and you get four you get to pick
four different eyeshadows to go in here
and thought it was kind of fun to field
your own so it just looks like that and
then it opens up you have a little brush
a mirror and four little spots so what I
did was I picked out four colors to quit
them there the first one I picked out
was wisteria number a250 one is this
beautiful kind of purply color next I
picked up pink ice which is just a nice
like champagne color you guys see that
yeah champagne color I also picked up
peach fizz which is the darker I would
call it like a bronzy color and then I
also picked what is this wheat which is
also kind of a bronzy color but it has
more of like a green base to it
next I picked up these Garnier green
class soothing makeup removing cleansing
towelettes I picked up the what was it's
lotion cleanser the makeup removing
lotion cleanser and I loved it so I
thought I'd pick up beat-matching
makeup remover wipes I also picked up
these band total refreshed fully body
cloths I love these for after I work out
- you just kind of rub them all over
your body they smell good
they keep your skin nice and clean and
soft and they smell good and also
they're very cooling next thing I picked
up was a deodorant I needed one this is
the secret clear gel scent expressions
it so very summer berry and it smells
amazing seriously it's not really really
good and the last thing is this last
thing yeah last thing I picked up with
this big package of what is this extra
large cleansing cloths this is from the
up-and-up brand which is just like the
target compared to brand and these are
ultra soft and strong with chamomile
fragrance free hyper allergenic there's
48 pre-moistened cloth I'm going to use
these for my makeup so what I do is I
don't remove my makeup with these but
when I'm doing my makeup by hand oh you
get really really dirty especially if
I'm applying foundation with my
fingertips so I usually like to use baby
wipes but I usually end up using like
four or five of those even one
application of makeup so I thought I get
these because they're so big you know
the actual clock is so big so I thought
actually let's go one out I can show you
guys how big you see how big that is
this thing is huge
so I thought I could get one makeup
application done with just that so you
guys know if you see them in my empties
you'll know that they probably worked
well um and that is my haul I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
