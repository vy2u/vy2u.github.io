right let's just get started the first
thing i got was this covergirl bombshell
volume by lash blast a big sexy
bombshell lashes mascara so you get a
dual sided mascara wand to the first one
volumizes and the second one intensifies
I know that seems like a lot of work to
have to do two layers of mascara but I'm
willing to try it out so we'll see how
that goes the second thing i got was the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips custom
I enhancing eyeliner trio that is quite
a name it says it enhance it defines
blue eyes and it has 24-hour where it
looks like this it looks like you get a
nice bronzy color a navy blue and a
black with blue shimmer next I got a
sonia kashuk what is this duo fiber
crease brush it's number 205 it looks
like this I've heard a lot of good
things about Sonia Kashuk Russians so I
picked that up next I got one of the
Loreal infallible Pro matte 24-hour
foundations I picked one of these up the
other day as well but the shade is a
little dark so I was using it to kind of
contour and define my face a little more
so I ended up picking up the lighter
shade this is 101 classic ivory I
believe that is their lighter shade
actually so next I picked up a another
one of these niggling matte lipsticks
this one is in ravishing Rose I heard L
is for living talk about this color and
she was talking about how she really
liked it and was one of her fall
favorites so i thought i could pick that
up it looks really really beautiful on
the next thing I picked up was another
Sonia Kashuk brush this is the large
crease brush number 116 it looks like
that it looks like it has a really nice
tapered top and I believe I've heard
quite a few people talk about it next I
got an elf eyelash and brow brush it
looks like that I love those for coming
out I brought my brows next I got an elf
I crease brush it's really really tiny
and tapered it looks great and after
that I got another little elf thing I
got a
I'm out of the packaging what do you
know this is the elf prison eyeshadow
palette but this one is in naked I did
pick up about a week ago I picked up the
sunset one but this one is in naked and
it's just more neutral colors but very
very shimmery gorgeous I like the other
one so i thought i'd have to get this
one um next I got to see here oh yes I
got a scoops I have a Kiki visiting say
hello yes if I you next I got the Revlon
lip butter in pink truffle I heard
emilynoel83 talking about how this is
like a really marsala the kind of color
and marsala is the color of the year for
this year so I thought I'd go ahead and
pick this up and try it out I don't have
this color I love the formula of the lip
butters so i'm sure i will like that
next I got this little custom I shadow
palette thing from else it looks like
this it's the custom compact and you get
for you get to pick four different
eyeshadows to go in here and that was
kind of fun to build your own so it just
looks like that and then it opens up you
have a little brush a mirror and four
little spots so what I did was I picked
out for colors to put in there the first
one I picked out was wisteria number 2
501 it's this beautiful kind of purply
color next I picked up pink ice which is
just a nice like champagne color you
guys see that yeah champagne color I
also picked up peach fizz which is a
darker I would call it like a bronzy
color and then I also picked up what is
this wheat which is also kind of a
bronzy color but it has more of like a
green face to it
next I picked up these Garnier clean
plus soothing makeup removing cleansing
towelettes I picked up the what was it
lotion cleanser the makeup removing
lotion cleanser and I loved it so I
thought I'd pick up the matching makeup
remover wipes I also picked up these
band total refreshed fully body plots I
love these four after i work out you
just kind of rub them all over your body
they smell good they keep your skin nice
and clean and soft and they smell good
and also they're very cooling next thing
I picked up was a deodorant I needed one
this is the secret clear gel scent
expressions it so very summer berry and
it smells amazing seriously it's not
really really good and the last thing is
this last thing yes last thing I picked
up with this big package of what is this
extra large cleansing cloth this is from
the up-and-up brand which is just like
the target compared to brand and these
are ultra soft and strong with chamomile
fragrance for you hyper allergenic
there's 48 pre-moistened cloths I'm
going to use these for my makeup so what
I do is I don't remove my makeup with
these but what I'm doing my makeup by
you oh you get really really dirty
especially if I applying foundation with
my fingertips so um I usually like to
use baby wipes but I usually end up
using like four or five of those in one
application of makeup so I thought I get
these because they're so big you know
the actual clock is so big so I thought
actually let's go one out so I can show
you guys how big you see you'll be that
is this thing is huge so I thought I
could get one makeup application done
with just that so I thought that'd be
good I'll let you guys know if you see
them in my empties you'll know that they
probably worked well um and that is my
hall I hope you guys enjoyed this and
i'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
