you so much for joining me this video is
going to be a review and swatches on the
new what is this called Tarte to bling
it on Amazonian clay blush palette this
is basically part of their 2015 holidays
da ze collection so this is part of
their holiday collection they always
come out every single year with a blush
palette that features five of their
Amazonian clay blushes and basically
like I would say more than like a deluxe
size you get a pretty good amount of
product it comes in like little strips
unlike their normal blushes which come
in like the little compact but anyway
this is the packaging for the outside of
the packaging this year the outside of
the packaging the box for this year's
what I meant to say it looks like this I
think it's pretty it's very interesting
it's not super super holiday II
holiday-ish to me I don't know but I do
think it's pretty I really really like
the gold in it of course so that is the
outer box and it does say here in the
Tarte holidays get up and glow all
season long with this limited edition
palette of Amazonian clay blushes they
sleek the obviously black sequent
palette features five fan favorites and
brand new shades so the sheets that you
get are fetching which is a rose shade
Dollface which is a cool pink you get
prim which is a plum nude smashing which
is a coral pink and beaming which is an
apricot - pink formulated without
parabens mineral oil fatal aids trisko
trysts balsam triclosan trick was then I
think that's right sodium lauryl sulfate
gluten and it is dermatologist tested
Curtis now he's very good at being you
know animal friendly you know not
testing on animals just being really
good with their ingredients they tend to
be a little more natural so Nate for
Turk's so I'm going to read you guys a
little bit about what it says on the
Sephora website very quickly this is
exclusive to Sephora I believe I have
not found it on the alto shaam website I
personally purchased mine for $44 on any
sephora.com website but just so you guys
know I think that Tarte huge are yeah
tarte usually like collaborates with
Sephora for the blush
whereas they collaborate with Ulta for a
different kind of holiday palette they
have I think a kit that has four or five
full-size blushes so if you guys are
interested in the full-size blushes go
check out Ulta but if you are interested
in this little palette it is on the
support complex site so it says the
Tarte bling it on Amazonian clay blush
palette it is sephora exclusive and
limited edition and it is $44 it is $110
value so this is a really great deal it
is a sleek chic palette featuring five
full-size Amazonian clay blushes are
they really full-size maybe it's just
the way they're shaped I think I said
that they weren't full-sized but
normally you get them in the actual
little light compact which is round but
these come in like little strips so
maybe they are full size um so they it
says five full-size Amazonian clay
blushes what it does this sleek
statement-making palette features five
long wearing pigmented powder blushes
the full-size flattering mix includes
all new stunners and blushing favorites
powdered powered by tarts iconic
Amazonian clay which helps to balance
and replenish skin for better longer
truer wear for a party perfect flush
treat yourself to this limited-edition
bestseller encased in an accessory
inspired palette designed to delight and
dazzle through any festive adventure so
it says you get 5.15 ounce and some you
clay blushes infection dull face prim
smashing and beaming and yeah it is also
dermatologist tested so anyway like I
said this is what the outer packaging
looks like and I'm not huge and keen on
the outer packaging that I love what the
actual packaging looks like so this is
the packaging for 2015 I want to show
you guys really quickly this is 2014
packaging so the difference here is
they're about the same size when you go
like this but when you go like this you
can see that the one on the bottom which
was from last year is much thicker much
more bulky and the one on top for this
year is a lot more sleek so it's got
kind of like this like textured kind of
sparkly thing going on but it doesn't
like rub off on your fingers maybe a
little bit but not too much so it's not
going to get all over your stuff and it
says right there it's in the little
gold-plated it says tart
and then on the back it just says what
it is the blue mana bling it on
Amazonian clay blush palette you open it
up and get a nice mirror and it's one of
those palettes that's so sleek you can
kind of just go like that and this is
what it looks like on the inside so
these are the shades that you get this
year so you get five shades and one of
them has shimmer in them the others are
all matte but they feel more like a
satiny kind of finish they're really
really beautiful
so the difference with this year's
packaging is that they made it obviously
a lot more sleek and compact but also
they put the names of the actual colors
on the bottom I'm going to show you guys
last year's talent really quickly so you
can see what they did first of all the
packaging was a lot more bulky I
actually liked last year's packaging a
lot of people complained about it and
said it looks like an old like Grandma
packaging I don't know it was kind of
like a little clutch I thought it was
cute it was bulky but I never really I
don't know it never really bothered me I
brought this a lot when I traveled I
love this palette so this was something
that I just overlooked I overlooked the
packaging because I loved it so much but
it had the same size mirror but um as
you guys can see this was last year's
palette they did not have the names on
the bottom so this year the difference
is is that so you know the packaging is
a lot more sleek and they do have the
names on the bottom so today I am
wearing the shade doll face which is
that cool toned pink shade that you guys
can see here I just want to say a few
things first so I'm the Amazonian clay
formula is amazing it really is long
wearing it goes on really really
beautifully it's very very blendable so
I already knew that I was going to like
this palette based on the formula so if
you do want you know a blush that is
very pigmented very pigmented very long
wearing and you know stays on all day
this is a great great great formula and
I think this is a great way to try out a
whole different kind of array of their
shades if that makes sense now this
year's palette I must say when I saw it
on the online website and looking at it
in person it really really kind of
personally I think would cater more
towards like medium
light skin tones there's not a lot of
deeper darker like mauve kind of shades
in here this year whereas last year they
did have a few shades that were you know
dunker and like I said you do get
formats in here and one shimmer whereas
last year you got I believe three max
and two shimmers but you guys can see in
last year's palette there really were
some darker shades in there you know and
I don't know I felt like this one kind
of gave a better color arrangement for
all different kind of skin tones
whereas this year's palette it's more
peachy pinky tones which I feel like
don't actually show up on all skin tones
so that's kind of that's unfortunate but
overall the quality you know of the
actual powders is great they're really
long wearing I really love them and yeah
so I'm going to go ahead and swatch
these for you guys really quickly so the
first date shade that you get is called
fetching it's kind of like this sort of
mauve it's it's a matte it's like a
mauve kind of plummy dusty rose sort of
color so I'm gonna go ahead and swatch
these I am going to build them up see if
I can really see the color but just so
you know when you wear these on the
cheeks they shear out but they are very
pigmented this is a wonderful wonderful
blush formula so this is a fetching
really really really beautiful love it
and the second one is called doll face
that is what I'm wearing on my teks
today it is a very very light cool toned
pink it's right there and you guys these
are so silky if you have never tried the
Amazonian clay formula you really should
because they are amazingly beautiful and
silky
so that is doll face really really
pretty very nice cool toned pink the
next shade is called prim and it is kind
of the neutral one of the palette it's
also matte so stall face the only one
that is shimmery is this one here
beating but prim is really nice it's
kind of like a it's not completely like
neutral and it doesn't really have like
a beige undertone I almost have a bit of
a dusty rose undertone but it is
probably the most neutral color in the
palette lets me go ahead and swatch that
one so there is creme
very very pretty you like those I can
continues to watch it the next shade is
called smashing and it's kind of like a
you medium a warm toned pink it's got a
lot of warmth to it and it's just really
really beautiful that one look how
beautiful that is
gorgeous color and the last shade you
get in here is called beaming and that
is the one that has shimmer in it and
it's got tons and tons of flecks of
silver shimmer however when you swipe
your finger over it or when you apply it
on your face you really really can't
feel that shimmer it's very very finely
milled which I love so this one's also
kind of neutral it's sort of similar I
mean not similar to prim but it's
definitely neutral but this one
definitely has more of a peachy
undertone whereas prim has more of a
dusty rose undertone I'm going to build
that one up but you know the shimmer
here is so finely milled you just can't
even tell the difference watching the
ones that are like the satiny matte
texture compared to the shimmery one so
there is smashing so those are all the
shades you get I'm going to go ahead
really quickly and just show you guys
the two palettes side by side because I
think that there are a few shades in
last year's palette that looks similar
to this year's palette but honestly I
don't know like when I ran them on my
cheeks I see the differences if that
makes sense but let me just show you
guys you guys can see the top palette is
this year's 2015 and the bottom one is
last year's so you can see a few shades
in there like fetching looks kind of
similar to this color I don't know what
this color is called because it came
with a sheet that had the names on it
and I tossed that ages ago but fetching
looks kind of similar to this shade down
here and they are kind of similar but
honestly there are differences I know
that they look probably very very
similar but there are differences and
you
really really tell the difference when
you're wearing them on the cheek so I am
going to say that if you have last
year's palette it is not completely the
same as last year's but you know there
are a few shapes like I said there are a
few shades that do kind of overlap or
look similar and then the neutral color
in here prim does look a little similar
to the neutral color that was in last
year's palette except prim is a lot more
rosy toned and that the neutral one from
last year is a lot more beige undertones
so the only ones that I would say are
really really similar are that fetching
shade and this one the other ones
definitely have a different you know
undertone to them so it's not the same
kind of colors that you're getting I
would recommend if you did love last
year's palette which I did I bring this
all the time when I travel and I'm
really excited to travel with this one I
would recommend checking it out just be
aware that if you do have medium to
deeper skin tones um this year's palette
doesn't really you know it doesn't get
that deep deep deep color like last
year's they had this color in there the
darkest color you're gonna get in this
palette is this one right here so you're
never gonna get to like that kind of
deep deep beautiful kind of plummy color
which I really love and I have to be
careful with because as someone with
fair skin I have to go very light handed
with those but I just I don't know I
kind of felt like they could have thrown
in something with a little bit of like a
reddish undertone or something with a
little more mauve for this year's
palette but overall I'm very very happy
I already knew I would love the formula
I was very excited for the colors I
think they are very flattering on fair
to medium sort of skin tones but
anything deeper than medium I think that
you know you want to go in and swatch go
ahead and swatch them at Sephora and
make sure that they show up on your skin
first but anyway that is a little
comparison and swatches and my thoughts
on this year's blush palette from Tarte
I really love it I think the packaging
is really cute I didn't really have any
with last year's packaging but this
year's really really takes you know the
I don't know it's like the cream of the
crop it's a really really cute same
sized mirror but it's just so much more
sleek it's gonna be great for traveling
and I really really love it so I hope
you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches and comparison if you did
please give this video a thumbs up and
I'll see you next time fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
