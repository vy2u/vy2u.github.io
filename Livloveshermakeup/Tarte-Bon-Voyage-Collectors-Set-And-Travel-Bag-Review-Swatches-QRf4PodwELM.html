to do my review and swatches on the tart
bon voyage get this is like the
collectors edition of the little like I
don't know whole set is like a you know
holiday thing so um it comes like this
on the top you have this little pouch
that had the palette in it with
eyeshadows like this and then in the
bottom you have some nice like full-size
and deluxe sample sizes of some of the
best selling products from door so um I
guess I kind of wanted to do like
swatches as I went along just because
there are no names for I believe I mean
there's no names on here I don't
remember seen any information on the
names of these colors um I couldn't find
anything so I thought that you know I
would just go through and swatch a few
of them also because there's so many I
probably have to go like all the way up
my arm so I thought I would just swatch
them as I went along and um you know
just pick the ones i think are
switchable so anyway so let me just
start off with the packaging so
packaging is really really cute I think
um you know once I after I do this you
know review i'm probably going to empty
this out and have just like you know the
marcos oil and things like that like in
my bathroom and then have the palette
with my other palettes but i'm totally
going to keep this little like train
tasting for travel I think it's perfect
for traveling and it really can fit a
lot of stuff so definitely going to keep
that I have no issue with that
whatsoever so really happy about that
and I guess we should you know let's
start with the stuff on the bottom
because there's a few things I want to
talk about when it comes to that so down
here you get a I'm glad to finally take
this apart after I can push these out
it's kind of hard to get the model
packaging but so you get a full size of
a lip sergeant tint which is awesome
because this kid i think was like sixty
dollars you're getting i shadow palette
full-size this full-size gloss and then
all these other products so it's really
worth the money so you are getting this
and this is in the color romantic and
then you are getting a lipsurgence lip
gloss full-size and this is in the color
of visionary so these are both similar
in color I think they did that on
purpose because of the actual you know
palette like they wanted you know a
certain color in there you guys can see
that oh I hope the swatches from my bite
Beauty Collection aren't showing up
underneath but that is the lipsurgence
the tint and this is the lip gloss I do
have a complaint about this loss so like
I think it's nice and it's pigmented
that's not really an issue and it gives
nice shine but honestly like every time
I pull it out there's like goop at the
top you see that there's like loose
product I really don't like that in a
lip gloss so not a fan of the package I
guess but these are the swatches that's
the lip tint and that's the gloss really
really nice I don't really have issues
with them I think the lip surgeons like
lip tints are amazing super moisturizing
they feel good on the lips they last a
long time and they do stained pretty
well you know so that throughout the day
you do have color basically all day so
not a lot of you no complaints there I
would just say I think it's awesome that
you do get full size but I would say the
packaging on the lip gloss kind of
crummy I don't really like that so
overall though right there I think those
are like forty dollars together so
you've almost met the actual price of
the palette just by using two of the
products in the bottom the next thing is
one of the tart mascaras this is the
lights camera lashes looks like this got
pretty cute packaging not to be mistaken
with the lights camera flashes in the
gold package I mistaken it for that at
first but this is a different wand it's
nice and sleep um it does coke lashes
nicely uh I don't have a lot of issues
with mascaras it's probably because i
already use products to help like my
eyelashes to be healthy and grow so i
really can use a lot of mascaras but i
liked this wand a lot better than the
gold one that i had a
the love which was the lights camera
flashes that thing was way too big I
just couldn't like it would I made a
mess every single time but I really do
like this one um I think it's a nice
formula Afghanistan waterproof is just
regular and it's just a black color and
you know always good to have more
mascara guys can never have a past era
the next thing is something that I'm
kind of unsure about and it's only
because of the coloring um or the color
that they chose or I guess you could say
my coloring and the color that they
chose um this is the tart Muse cheek
stain super cute packaging and i love
that tart has those cheap stains I think
it's nice to use a different formula
once in a while other than just powder
but this is the color and it's just like
against my skin tone best dark this is
dark you know that's almost like that
could be like a contour shade if it
wasn't so uh shimmering but this is dark
and you know I think they were trying to
go along with like you know this kind of
color like that ma vie you know area of
color that wall of color there but um
this is just I don't know I love the
consistency the formula it's super easy
to use I use it with my ELF small
stipple brush but honestly I just think
it's just uh no it's too much on my skin
tone right away you can see that it goes
on pretty you know dark but I do love
that it has that nice shimmery look to
it it's like a built-in highlighter it's
gorgeous but this is this is dark I'm
just gonna leave it at that it's a
little dark for my skin if I use a light
hand I can work with it but it is hard
to build like you know it's hard with
cream products to not take too much at
the beginning and then you have to get
rid of it and it's harder to get rid of
cream in my opinions on powder products
so um it's hard to kind of back off at
this after you've applied too much so um
that's really my only issue love the
formula beautiful love the sheen I think
it's gorgeous but the color is just not
not my cup of tea and it's probably just
because of my coloring again if you were
like darker than me and had like a nice
tan that would be gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous board
gorgeous on you um alright the next
thing is the tarte maracuja oil i have
used up a whole like normal size of this
before i use this for a while i would
say probably about last year am i used
up a whole jar of it um i noticed that
it really helped to moisturize during
the day I did not notice any anti-aging
benefits and I did notice that sometimes
if i apply too much i broke out a little
bit so i was pretty careful with it but
i did use up the whole thing and then I
just didn't repurchase because i was
just using it as a moisturizer and i
have tons of moisturizers you know but i
do like the thought of an oil i think
oils are really wonderful marcos oil is
basically just I think passion see
passion flower seed oil or something
like that you can get it at like any you
know whole foods or anything like that
you don't actually have to go and spend
the money on the tart one um you know if
you get it like at Whole Foods is
probably even more like unrefined which
is really good when you get oil so you
want them to be virgin on process you
know that kind of thing but um I think
tarda has like made a name for
themselves when it comes to the maracuja
oil and a lot of people swear by this
and um you know I did get a sample of
what is it the fresh see Barry oil and I
must say it like that a lot better than
this I think this is just a little too
thick um it just I'm not a huge fan of
the smell and I think it is good for
moisturization but honestly besides that
I don't notice that it has an e and even
after using a big you know a big jar of
it and going through the whole thing did
you notice any difference and you know
radiance and my skin or wrinkles or you
know things like that so um I'll
definitely go through this I have no
issue with that it's a great little
moisturizer but um that's why I probably
won't repurchase like a full-size again
unless you know it's the future and I'm
just feeling it again and I want to go
try again I know but as far as like
right now um not really interested in
that I really do like that fresh see
Barry oil though which is funny because
on makeupalley the mark pooja oil gets
like amazing reviews and I don't really
like it and then this bberry oil gets
like two percent good reviews but I
really like it
so I think it really just depends on
your skin the other one you just take
two drops and it sinks in right away I
think I like that better because i do
have combination skin I don't want to
have to think about having an oil than
putting my makeup on and then having the
oil seep through even more if that makes
sense so probably won't we purchased a
full size of that but I'm happy to have
the little trial size I think this is
great you can take this you know when
you're traveling and I could use this
you know this could be my moisturizer
when I go on winter break I have no
issue with that that's fine and the next
thing that's in here the last level
thing at the bottom not going to throw
this out just right I think it's stuck
in the bottom there this is the tart
what is this the smooth operator
Amazonian clay finishing powder this is
just one of those loose like silica
powders um you can get the elf one is
the same exact thing for what a fraction
like even more than a fraction of the
price it's literally like five dollars
for a big tub of the HD like micro
perfecting or whatever it's called and I
mean every brand kind of has this now um
you know I guess who started it really
was probably make up for ever um with
that HD powder but I mean I I like it I
like to really set my face like with my
powder I don't just like swipe it all
over when I'm setting my foundation I
like tap it in with a stippling not a
stippling brush eight kabuki brush so I
don't really feel the need to get an
even more like flawless or you know help
with oil control I don't think this
helps with oil control I think it's
really just to go on top of everything
with a really really like fluffy brush
just to equal likea I don't know it just
it gives it a really nice effect it's
kind of like a soft focused effect so if
you like that and if you have time for
that extra step every day you could get
this i would recommend getting the elf
one cuz its way cheaper and you get way
more they're all the same you should be
warned though i did get a white cast
with this which is interesting i'm
pretty white i'm surprised that i get
wet cast with things but if i get a
white cast then you may also and if you
have to risk in them me you want to be
careful so either use a really small
amount or even take like a powder like a
little um
powder puff and just tap it in the areas
that you want to like Phil imports and
things like that but overall I would not
um you know repurchase full-size but
I'll take this with me when I travel
it's a nice little deluxe I like that
alright so that was everything on the
bottom step at this little silica pouch
right so on the top we have the pilot I
just slipped it out of there like I said
there are no names on the back of this
but what I love about this palette is
how sleek it is I think it's so nice I
am thinking about bringing this with me
when I travel I brought the return of
sexy from too faced last time and it was
a disaster it's just too chunky too big
this is really nice because it's just
like yeah so sleek you can pack it in
anywhere um so I'm super super excited
to use that um I would say the one thing
that's really disappointing about this
salad is that you open it up and there
is no mirror so I won my cast is nothing
by so um there is no mirror which is
like weird because you they really could
have put in a nice big mirror there I
would have been very happy but no mirror
but um you get some big big big shadows
here these are like you know a quarter
and a half inside so really really nice
gorgeous colors as you can see they're
kind of like those pink tones I kind of
think of naked 3 when I see this um
sorry my cat keeps walking in front of
the camera she's messing up the lighting
really okay Danny go okay so like I said
naked 3 I kind of see you know some of
those like pink tones in there that
reminds me of the naked 3 and then the
darker smoky color is kind of like the
smoked palette from urban decay but um
so you do get like a variety of you know
she's here um I'm really happy with them
i would say some of them don't actually
swatch as beautifully as i had hoped but
all of them feel nice and creamy and
good and there's only really a few
shimmery shades and I guess we'll just
watch a few of them free size because um
you know as well this a nice green color
or just kind of
this is one of my favorite colors like a
gold with like a greenish undertone love
that oh I think it's just gorgeous it's
almost like a topi gold I don't even
know but I love it ah lighter shades
like a matte pink you can't really see
that but it has great pigmentation for
what it is which is a light matte color
so I yeah I mean I'm really really happy
I think that it's definitely where I
mean this whole kit was definitely worth
you know the money I paid for it I would
say this is my favorite part of the
whole thing I love I palette so this
mine definitely the favorite part of the
actual kit and that is my favorite shade
right there that's the topi gold when I
/ there but um I think you get a really
nice like variety of colors I would say
the only miss was that they didn't have
a mirror and that there are no names for
the shadows which makes it hard to
swatch because you know people won't
know what I'm talking about but um I
guess I'll also swatch some of these
darker colors again super super
pigmented super creamy I like those like
maybe blues and things like that that's
really different to me not a lot of
pallets are doing those kind of colors
this year so interesting I really don't
get any fallout with these they're so so
soft and they just like I don't know
they just they blend so easily so um I'm
really really happy with this palette I
think it's great um I would say that if
anything um I need a mirror in the
palette for sure and also I think that
may be changing around some of the
colors but then again that's just a very
personal thing and I knew what I was
purchasing but what I'm talking about is
like you know the cheek tint and things
like that um other than that I think the
bar kuja oil is great to throw in there
people love to try that and it is one of
their best selling products um you know
the micro finish HD thing that's nice
they threw in a little face thing and
then of course you get 2 full sizes of
the lip surgeons lip gloss and the lip
tint which is awesome it's awesome to
get full size of these because these go
for around 20 apiece separately so
that's really great and then
where's the mascaras good it's nice to
always have you know smaller little
sizes of my girls like that and I love
the packaging I will definitely be using
this level travel case when I travel I'm
thinking just loading all my makeup up
in there and I think you know I think
this is the probably the palette I'm
going to bring I just think it's very
Universal and I can go deep and smoky or
I can keep it light and flirty and cute
so anyway that was my review and some
swatches of the tart boom wash a little
collector's edition I hope you guys
enjoyed this and if you have gotten this
and you also like it or you don't like
it or whatever let's have a discussion
below about what it is you would change
about it or you know if you loved it so
much so anyway I'll see you guys in my
