have another holiday review for you in
this video we are going ahead and we are
reviewing swatching and after doing a
comparison on the new Tarte cosmetics
color wheel Amazonian clay blush palette
and this is what it looks like I did
purchase this for $44 on in the Tarte
comm website and also is currently
available on the sephora.com website as
always I will leave a link down below in
the description bar where you can pick
it up if you are interested this is new
and it is limited edition although it is
$44 it is a $150 value this is an
exclusive double sided cheek palette
with 10 blush and highlight shades it
says color your way to the perfect glow
with this custom blush and highlighter
palette it features 10 deluxe limited
edition blushes in mattes Luster's into
a micro pearlescent highlighters
all-in-one complexion enhancing palette
with its dual sided design it creates
five warm and five cool shades so that
you can mix and match with your cheek
wardrobe to create the perfect custom
look it says the neutral in bold
Universal shades spotlight a variety of
complexions with a built in cover for
mess-free portability powered by tarts
long wear Amazonian clay the iconic
best-selling formula this balances and
replenishes the skin so I was very
excited to get my hands on this I
believe this is the Tarte blush palette
for the year for their holiday
collection normally they do come out
with one of those longer palettes like
the 2014 or the 2015 palette I
personally really adore those but I have
to say I'm also really liking this a lot
so this is what the outer packaging
looks like it just comes in this nice
kind of purply pretty box right here on
the back it says works of tarts holiday
2016 as you guys can see this is
formulated without parabens and mineral
oil fatal aids triskele and sodium
lauryl sulfate gluten and it is
dermatologist tested I believe that this
is actually made in let's see here China
but it's not actually telling me on the
box but I'm pretty sure I saw that this
is made in China you guys know how I
feel about these ballots that Tarte
makes over in China I feel like they
really really are not consistent I think
a lot of their palettes like this
particular one the big blush book -
which I will compare that since this
particular palette - the one that we're
talking about in this video but I feel
like this
not very good quality these were super
powdery not what I would expect from an
Amazonian clay blush and also I never
pick up their holiday eyeshadow palettes
because they're all made in China and
guess what they're all shi'ite like I'm
sorry but they're crappy I know some
people really like them I do not and
it's not because they're made in China
it's literally just because the quality
is not there so anyway like I said we
are definitely going to go ahead and
make some comparisons against against
this tarts big blush book - I will link
my review for this down below and also
my comparison video where I kind of
duped out a few shades for you guys if
you would like me to try and find dupes
for this particular palette let me know
down below and I can do that in a couple
of weeks for you guys I will be doing
another video called then and now
holiday palettes from last year versus
this year and also a top 5 series video
on my favorite holiday palettes that
have come out so far and you guys may
see this featured in there um so this
particular palette here was made in
China and like I said the quality was
just not there this is a lot different
this is a really nice quality palette
and really enjoying it this is what the
outer packaging looks like same sort of
thing that's going on with the box on
the back you can see we have the
mirrored gold finish you open it up and
this is what it looks like so when I
first saw this on the website I was like
how the hell is that going to work like
I didn't know that they had this slip
here that was actually physically
attached to the palette and I was like
are you kidding me like you're gonna
have to keep that slip but yes as you
guys can see this little slip here is
here and it is actually attached to the
palette so when you close it up they are
not touching each other because my first
like I got anxiety looking at this I was
like how does that work I was really
really thinking that you know they were
just gonna be sitting there and you
would have to keep this little piece of
plastic but yes the piece of plastic is
completely attached and as you guys can
see you are getting basically
a double-sided blush palette here I hope
I'm not blinding you guys because it is
mirrored but I have to say this is a
really well thought out blush palette I
feel like a lot of the time start just
does what they always do and let's be
honest with their holiday collections as
well I just feel like it's the same
thing over and over and over again and I
feel like I see the same colors I see
the same finishes I feel like this is
finally a little different this is the
warm tone side this is the cool tone
side if you guys are curious I I'm
wearing the shade ironic today which is
this one down here which is a beautiful
kind of berry shade and
do you feel like there are a few shades
in here that I have never seen in the
tar collection I feel like they really
really tend to stay neutral with their
eyeshadow palettes that are blushes all
that kind of stuff and I think this is
different and I think this is good
quality I will say the blushes that are
in here they're not full-size but I will
say they are very comparable to the
Tarte blushes that I do have in
full-size I feel like they don't have a
lot of powdery kick-up which is great
because like I said the big blush book -
this thing was just like a powdery mess
I still do like these blushes I think
they're good quality but they're not
what I would expect from an Amazonian
clay formulation so they're definitely
not like the one in the big blush book -
I think these are very nice they are
pressed a little more firmly but I like
that with Tarte blushes because you
don't get a bunch of kick up so you're
getting a lot of different kind of
colors here and they're very very smooth
and they're very very pigmented this is
what I expect from the Tarte Amazonian
clay formulation so overall as far as
formulation is concerned I'm very happy
that this is exactly what they have come
out with the last two seasons as far as
like holiday pallets are concerned and
also what they come out with with
full-size blushes so anyway I would say
that the formulation is really good like
I said I like the staying power if you
have never tried in Amazonian clay blush
from Tarte
they stay on very very well on the
cheeks I do still prefer my Too Faced
love flush sixteen-hour blushes I think
those we're incredibly long but this is
definitely second in line I think they
do wear a very long time on the skin
especially if you are wearing a nice
tacky foundation or primer and a setting
spray and I think overall this is very
compact and portable and lovely I always
enjoy Tarte holiday blush palettes in
general just because I do think they are
so travel friendly I really really love
the 2014 one and let me know if you guys
would like me to do a comparison against
last year's and the year before like I
said I will be doing a separate video
called then and now holiday palettes
2016 and 2015 but today I thought for
comparison wise we would just go ahead
and do the big blush book too so if you
are worried about these being similar to
the big blush book - they are not they
are very very pigmented they are not
like a powdery kick-up hot mess Express
kind of thing going on I think the
shades are different I know everybody
tends to look at Tarte blush pilots and
think I can do that I can do that I can
do that I would say with about half of
this particular palette yes I can dupe
that you know it's one of those kind of
things where it's like they really don't
go outside of their calm
it's own however I will say I think they
threw some new stuff in here they did to
highlighting shades they have different
finishes going on in here and I think
they did a good job with this so if you
are someone who is looking for a nice
holiday blush palette I do think this is
worth it you are getting quite a bit of
product in here even though it's made in
China and it probably took them I don't
know maybe ten minutes to make and ten
dollars to make I still think it is a
relatively good value so definitely
something to check out if you want to if
you guys are curious this is the same
size as their little round ru shadow
pellets and also their Tarte rainforest
of these see eyeshadow palettes so
anyway let's go ahead and start doing
some swatches we're gonna start with the
warm side we're gonna do mod deco
surreal culture and Idol these are what
these shades look like and this is the
side that I feel like can be duped out
and also that can be duped out with
other tarts palettes and ostrich's other
tart blushes I feel like the cool side
is what's really really interesting and
kind of different so the first thing we
have here is mada this is just a
beautiful peachy nude color very very
typical tart nothing too special in my
opinion and this is a very nice kind of
matte or satin e finish I never feel
like Tarte blushes are completely matte
when they say mat I feel like they have
a little bit of a satiny quality so if
you're curious as to why I'm saying
satiny matte that's why so there's the
first shade which is called mod
definitely has more of a peachy
undertone the next shape we have here is
deco and deco reminds me a lot of the
shade let's see here the shade perky in
the big blush book - here's perky and
then here's deco they're very very
similar in my opinion I will go ahead
and swatch the two side by side here's
deco and then here is perky so that we
can just do our comparison side-by-side
just a nice kind of pop of peach eNOS
and also a little bit of like a hot
coral shade I do like it I think it's
quite pretty okay I'm gonna take that
comparison off and we're gonna move on
to the shades - real surreal is a nice
cool toned pink again nothing that we
haven't seen from Tarte before a very
very reminiscent of a lot of their
shades I would say and this one is
definitely very similar to a shade
called soulful in the big blush - here
is soulful in the big of blush - book
and I will go ahead and swatch those
next to each other as well so here we
have a soulful and then we have
surreal so here is surreal and here is
soulful as you guys can see very very
similar same sort of consistency that
satiny max shade again going to remove
that comparison swatch moving on we have
the shade culture I think culture is
beautiful I've never had any sort of
Tarte blush like this it's a beautiful
beautiful peach color with tons and tons
of golden shimmer this actually reminds
me a lot of narcissus work Adam so if
you are a fan of that I think you would
absolutely adore this particular shade
it's so beautiful like I love the sheen
on this and obviously this has like a
little bit more of a satiny or glimmer
sort of finish to it so there easy shade
culture they've actually if we have is
idol and Idol is very very similar to
the third big blush a book to shade
called breathless so there is breathless
right in the middle it's that kind of
highlighting shade so here we have Idol
and here we have breathless I'm gonna
swatch them next to each other so you
guys can see so there is Idol and there
is breathless not exactly the same sort
of color but they're very very very very
very similar so I do like it I think
it's nice it is technically more of a
highlight shade depending on your
particular skin tone it can still give
you a really glowy skin though even if
it is too dark on your actual skin
alright and then moving on we are going
to go to the other side of the palette
this is the cool toned side as you guys
can see we will start with this shade
right here which is ironic I think
ironic is the one that stands out of the
palette I don't think I really have any
sort of Tarte blush that is this color
you may look at it and think it's very
similar to the shade dreamy in the big
blush book - which is right there but
they're not when you swatch them side by
side they are not similar so I really
like the shade I think it's beautiful it
has a nude undertone with a little bit
of berry in it so there it is absolutely
gorgeous ironic is that shade and again
that is the one that I am wearing on my
cheeks today then we have montage
montage has a little bit more of a kinky
undertone not so much of like a purple
or berry color going on so there is
montage again it could probably easily
be duped by last year or the year before
as palette and I will show you guys when
we do that separate video then in now on
how
palates I'll show you guys the actual
comparisons then we have machine icon
icon definitely has more of a mauve
undertone so we have more of like a
berry than a rosy and then more of a
mauve as you guys can see very very
similar the three of those right there
but still very nice they definitely do
have that more cool tone thing going on
at this a little more warm toned
probably could go over here with these
guys but I still think they are quite
pretty and then the next one that we
have here is called concept concept is
very very similar to I would say any of
the Noddy Newton they're easily released
and again when I do a comparison video I
will show you guys which ones exactly I
think is kind of similar to it reminds
me a lot of seduced so that is the shade
right there again kind of more on the
warm side I wouldn't necessarily
consider that like a cool toned color
it's a little more peachy but that sheet
is called concept and then finally we
have this highlighting shade right here
called crafty and if you do have very
fair skin like I do you would absolutely
love this particular highlights because
it will be an actual highlight on you go
figure and I'm actually gonna swatch
that on the other side since I am
running out of space so that is the
highlight I would say the highlights are
probably the weakest part out of this
particular palette I think the blush is
really stand on their own the I adult
shade which has more of like a grayish
like a grey sort of undertone I think
it's kind of strange just like how I
thought this particular shade breathless
was kind of strange
in the big of blush a book - I just feel
like not everybody wants kind of a ruby
really neutral highlight like that but I
do think the color is very similar to
our glasses ambient lighting powder in
the shade mmm
what is it that really really basic kind
of gray color you guys know what it is
please let me know down below in the
comment section I'm having a brain fart
but overall I think this is a really
nice palette so like I said I you know
have been on and off about tarts
products lately if you have been
watching my channel I've been giving a
lot of Tarte products kind of bad
reviews I just haven't really been
impressed with the quality although
these aren't made over in China I still
think that this is a good palette it is
good value and it's perfect for travel
it's the actual packaging like really
really good and decent I don't know if
you did brave this little particular
thing off or it came off I think that
the actual colors would start to
actually enter
checked with each other but for the most
part I think it's on there pretty darn
well and I don't think you have to worry
about that but yeah those are kind of my
reviews and my review and thoughts and
swatches on this particular palette
definitely let me know if he was like a
comparison video before these N and now
video but yeah I do think that these are
due pible I definitely want to find some
dupes on these but I think that at the
same time you know tart went out of
their comfort zone when they did the
cool the cool tone side over here so the
warm tone side you definitely could do
these out in some of your other holiday
palettes from tarts but this side I
think is actually quite unique so
overall pretty darn impressed with this
is it my all-time favorite blush palette
from them absolutely not is it my
all-time favorite blush palette of life
absolutely not but I do think it is a
good one and I think that it is worth
the value so anyway guys that is it for
this video um thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
