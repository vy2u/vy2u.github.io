welcome back to my channel so today we
are doing a project pan at featuring
some of my Tarte cosmetics products that
I have in my collection and now if you
saw yesterday's video I did let you guys
know that I am boycotting a Tarte
cosmetics obviously I do have quite a
few Tarte cosmetics products in my
collection and I feel like the best way
to really really show them that hey I
don't want anything to do with you is
use these products up and never
repurchase the best way to hit them is
with your pocketbook and make sure that
you do not give them any more money now
obviously not everybody is going to be
boycotting Tarte cosmetics like me but I
was incredibly disappointed with the
turqu shape the tape foundation release
now there are a lot of reasons why I
also wanted to boycott Tarte cosmetics I
will link a videos above of me nine
months ago twelve months ago complaining
about Tarte cosmetics when it comes to
their inconsistent formulas so if you
feel like it's just one reason why I did
that no there's many many reasons that
have built up over probably the past two
to three years and I'm just done that
was the last straw the Tarte shake tape
foundation release was my last straw so
anyway I plan on doing three different
Tarte project pan videos I will not be
purchasing from them anymore but I feel
like if I have the products in my
collection I should go ahead and use
them up so I will be giving myself four
months for each project pan now I am
well aware that when I gets to you know
obviously powder products like eye
shadows as well as a blushes and
highlighters it's gonna take me a little
longer to get through those so my goal
will be to hit pan on those but we are
actually going to start with what I
would consider the easier items which
are my base products my concealers as
well as my foundations from Tarte
cosmetics I'm going to start with an
item I'm actually just gonna go ahead
and declutter this is the Tarte CC
colored clay eye primer I do not like
this enough to actually continually use
it for the next four months so I'm just
gonna go ahead and let that guy go I
have very very dry skin right now since
I do live in the desert and it is winter
time and that just really emphasizes
crevasses increasing and texture around
my eyes so that's just gonna go but this
guy right here is the Tarte shaped tip
concealer the shade I do have right here
is fair it's a little too late for me
currently so what I'm gonna do is go
ahead and try and use this up probably
within the next two months it's very
hard for me to see exactly where I am
heart-shaped tape concealer I know
there's a lot of people that pan this
super super quickly when I first tried
this out I wasn't the biggest fan of
this concealer I feel like Beauty
vloggers and just beauty youtubers in
general where a lot of this stuff and
I'm not one of those people that wear as
a shit ton of concealer underneath my
eyes so I'm gonna go ahead and and try
and use this up like I said within the
next two months I really can't see where
I am with this product but yeah we're
gonna go ahead and get that out of the
collection now I do have a powder
foundation here from Tarte and this is
called the Amazonian clay full coverage
airbrush foundation but this one is
tricky because I could never find a
proper shade match for me so the shade
is called fair honey
it's very very yellow tone for me
personally but I truly feel like I could
use this up probably in a month if I
used it as a setting powder so I could
get extra coverage by setting in my
foundations with this product so we'll
see how that goes up next we have the
chart's Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation with broad-spectrum SPF 15
sunscreen as well as the Tarte BB
Amazonian clay tinted moisturizer this
one is in the shade ivory this one is in
the shade fair beige this is full
coverage so I will go ahead and use that
up I feel like I'm about halfway through
here even though it doesn't seem like it
kind of feel like I am so I feel like I
can use that up within the next two
months and then when it comes to the BB
tinted moisturizer this is pretty darn
full so I'm gonna go ahead and use this
as a primer if I want more coverage I
can put any sort of foundation on top of
it or I could just use it as an everyday
sort of foundation and finally guys we
have the Tarte to be be tinted primer
treatment with broad-spectrum SPF 30
sunscreen in the shade fair and this
really doesn't look that great on my
skin right now because I am so dry so
actually both of these little items
right here from Tarte I'm just gonna go
ahead and declutter to someone and then
these are for items I will go ahead and
I will try and use up within the next
four months so that is pretty much it
guys please let me know down below if
you are going to join me in this project
pan video so we can finish off some of
these products that we have from Tarte
cosmetics ah yeah thanks for watching
and I guess I will see you guys tomorrow
