video is going to be a review swatches
and comparison on the new Tarte
rainforest of the sea of volume to skin
twinkle lighting palette versus the
volume one so I did purchases for $42 on
the Tarte au pomme website as of right
now it says it is a limited edition
however they also said that this was a
limited edition and the eyeshadow
palette was limited edition like my
months ago and they're still on the
website so I have no idea these are
going to show up at Sephora the
rainforest of the sea collection did
momentarily show up at Sephora so we
shall see but this is what the outer
packaging looks like you do have some
pretty like abstract waves going on here
and a little bit of purple or pink
towards the bottom it is the same exact
packaging as the first edition as you
guys can see on the back you do have a
mirrored finish and then on the inside
you are getting four different
highlights I want to say right off the
bat even though I don't love this I do
think the versatility in the shades are
really really good so you're getting a
really nice kind of darker shade right
here called candle light which is more
of like a warmer tone you're getting
spot light which I think would be great
on like medium tone skin and then for
fair skin tones these two shades are
really really good the shades are sky
light and also daylight so sky light is
going to be a true highlight on those of
you with a very fair complexion like me
and even this one right here which is a
little more yellow tone is beautiful
this particular shade reminds me a lot
of the Becca what is it moonstone
however I will say the formulation is
just completely off so the first
addition palette had a setting powder
with two different highlights one of my
subscribers recommended that I dig into
this a little more because this was just
horrendous I could not believe they
threw a setting powder in there that
felt so scratchy so I kind of dug into
there more and now it is a really
beautiful buttery I'm setting powder it
does lean a little more on the yellow
tongue side so I don't use it all that
often but it's still pretty good
you also got this highlight right here
which is called a Sun light and then you
got this one right here which is called
moonlight I felt like both of these gave
me really really nice glowy skin as sure
they did they weren't like a true
highlight on me they did darken up a
little bit but they were absolutely
beautiful I really love this
highlighting palette and the formulation
in my opinion was impeccable very very
smooth very very creamy and honestly
they just glide on like absolute butter
so here is the shade moonlight and here
is sunlight as you guys can see they
just give that really wet finish sort of
look to the skin and if you are someone
who does like more and
actual highlights I think you would
enjoy that now the new one has this
really really chunky gritty kind of
texture to it and I don't want to say
gritty because it's not gritty but it
feels like an Anasazi of Beverly Hills
glow kid now right off the bat go ahead
and buy an Anasazi of Beverly Hills
bloke it for $40 instead of purchasing
this you are getting more product in
there I believe and also I feel like
even though those are kind of a thick
texture and finish they go onto the skin
beautifully and they really do blend out
these in my opinion really really do
emphasize fine lines texture things like
that on the face so I think you guys can
even see when I hold it up that where I
have dipped in my brush there is
literally like little chunks of like
missing pieces it doesn't really pick up
normally on a brush very well I feel
like I have tried so many different
brushes with this this week I thought
because it is a little more of a foiled
finish I said I should use something
that's a little more densely packed so I
tried it with my Sigma tapered
highlighting brush let's see here my
Luxy brush which is a little more fluffy
I tried it with a fan brush which is my
favorite and then also I did go ahead
and try it with my ELF blending brush
which is really densely packed and I
feel like if you really blend it out it
looks okay but throughout the day I
don't feel like these we're incredibly
well they start to really seep into fine
lines and wrinkles so if you have a
really really nice complexion with not a
lot of breakouts very very smooth skin I
think you would adore this my friend
Trina on Instagram I will link her
Instagram down below she is the next
trend mode you guys should follow her
anyway she has really really smooth like
normal skin not too oily not too dry
this looks amazing on her and she really
likes it so if you do have just non
really problematic skin I think this
would work for you but if you are very
very dry or very very mature or if you
have acne prone skin like oily skin this
is going to emphasize texture so it's
definitely not my favorite I feel like
the formulation is very similar to the
new pro glow palette I did not like that
I talked about that in a video that I
will go ahead and link down below but
yeah let's go ahead and swatch these so
although they are very pigmented they
just pick up a lot of product like too
much product so there it is you can see
it's very very very pigmented this is
the shade daylight so actually let me
swatch it on the other side this is a
shade daylight so this is just a really
nice opalescent kind of yellow tone very
similar to moonstone from Becca and we
kind of blend that out a little bit so
you guys can see I just feel like
they're almost too pigmented and the
brush just doesn't pick them up evenly
oh all right the next sheet is called
skylight this is what skylight looks
like it is a really nice cool toned
white color so there it is
swatched and I will blend it out because
that is very very chunky as you can see
so there it is blended out the next
shade we have is a spotlight which i
think would look beautiful on really
really tan skin tones so let me go ahead
and get that so there's one swipe swatch
girl so there is that shade that one
probably have the most fall out in the
most kick up and finally we have
candlelight which is a deeper tone which
I think would look great on dark skin or
dark complexions so there there it is
alright guys so there are all of them
swatched here is the skin twinkle
lighting palette Volume one and here is
a volume two a lot more pigmented with
volume two however these just sit on the
skin beautifully I don't feel like I
have to blend a lot they may be a little
more sheer but you can build them up on
the skin these you don't want to build
because it's just going to emphasize
more and more texture so goodness this
literally just got onto this palette and
started giving fall out so overall I
would say that this is not something I
would recommend looking into
although the swatches are very pretty
and they look very metallo sized and I
would just recommend getting an honest
hacia Beverly Hills glow kit or get the
volume one edition if you still can
because this you can build this one you
can't I don't like in the where time I
don't like the texture I don't like the
way it looks on my skin would really
only recommend if you have absolutely
perfect skin so yeah that is my quick
little review on it the skin twinkle
lighting palette of volume 2 I will link
down below where you can pick it up if
you still are interested and yet that's
it thanks so much for joining me guys
