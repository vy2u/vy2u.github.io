channel this video is going to be a demo
on the new tarts confidence creamy
powder foundation the shade I have is
fair neutral and if you are interested
in seeing a review and swatches on this
product I will link the video that I did
yesterday on it down below in the
description bar it will be the first
thing you see but I thought I would go
ahead and demo this a lot of you said
you would like to see it demoed so what
I'm going to do is go ahead and apply
half like half of my face basically I'm
gonna do just the powder foundation so
I'm going to buff it in with the Real
Techniques this is the expert face brush
I'm going to buff in just the powder on
half of my face and then on the other
half of my face if you guys watch my
review you probably saw that my favorite
way to actually use this product is to
set my foundation so what I am going to
do on the other side is put on my Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
with my maybelline superstay better skin
and then I am going to set it with the
foundation so I will let you guys kind
of see you know what kind of coverage
you can get out of it on one side and
then you can also see how it sets makeup
on the other side so let's just get
right into it I have already gone ahead
and cleansed my face I have not I don't
have any primer or anything like that on
I have just cleansed it with the Garnier
skin active micellar cleansing water
this is the sensitive version and yeah
it just leaves your skin really nice and
squeaky clean so I'm going to put my
headband on and we're just going to get
right into the demo okay so let's do
this shall we I am going to start with
just the powder on this side of my face
so I will be using my expert face brush
from Real Techniques and I'm just going
to tap into this product and I'm going
to buff it in on this side of my face
you guys can see the coverage by the way
I'm the nice shade fair neutral I don't
remember if I said that or not so I am
just buffing it in circular motions all
over my face and kind of doing little
sweeping motions as well if you guys
watch the review I did say that this was
a really nice color match for me it
might even be a little lighter than my
skin but once I put all of my products
on like after it blends really really
nicely and I do think it gives a nice
amount of coverage I wouldn't say the
coverage is absolutely amazing or as
good as say like the laura geller
balance and
foundation I think that one gives a
little more but they have similar
finishes they're really really beautiful
on the skin and I think that they have
kind of like a demi mad I don't want to
say Timmy Mac because I know that this
is not a you know liquid foundation but
it gives like a kind of glowy appearance
to the skin so you guys can already see
the difference I'm just gonna keep
buffing that on in areas that I want to
cover a little more but it looks really
skin like and natural and I love it
I love it for setting my foundation the
most but I feel like if you are someone
who has really really good skin like to
begin with and you don't have a lot of
hyperpigmentation or discoloration you
could get away with using this powder
foundation as your foundation I could
use it I mean I think I probably will
during the summer especially when I have
a little more oily instead of putting
liquid on my face which I don't love to
do during the summer I probably will go
ahead and just apply this and I think it
does give a nice amount of coverage but
it's not the amount of coverage that I
love if that makes sense I'm like a full
coverage kind of girl so anyway I put
about a layer and a half or two layers
of this on my skin I'm gonna build it up
just a little more so you guys can see
how nicely it builds and again you can
just kind of do you know back and forth
motions like this like just swiping it
onto your skin or you can buff it in I
feel like it goes on really really well
either way but I think a dense brush
like this one is probably the best way
to apply it alright so that is it as you
guys can see you can still kind of see
some acne scarring and things like that
but it's beautiful it builds on the skin
really really nicely and it does have a
nice amount of coverage for a powder
foundation alright let's do the other
side of my face I'm going to be taking
my Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation in the shade fair beige this
has broad-spectrum SPF 15 in it and I am
going to take a small amount of this on
the back of my hand like this like that
amount right there and I'm gonna take my
Real Techniques expert this is not the
expert face brush what is this they're a
little a sponge and I'm going to apply
this all over my face or at least on
this side of my face
sorry about my wrist guy that have a
look a little bout of eczema right now
so that's no fun so this is just a
really really small amount of this
foundation this is a full coverage
foundation if you want it to be so I'm
going to apply a little more right to
the sponge so I can show you guys this
builds beautifully on the skin as well
kind of like the cotton foundation
actually except you get more coverage
with this one obviously and then I am
going to go in with concealer as well
and just pretend like I am doing my
whole face because this is my preferred
method with this powder foundation is
literally to put on my face makeup put
on my concealer everything like that and
then set it so after I've applied about
one even coat of that foundation I'm
going to go in with my Maybelline
superstay better skin corrector with our
concealer concealer corrector whatever
it's in the shade ivory number 10 the
cat broke but it still works so I'm just
going to be applying this underneath on
my eye area and then on these little
pimples down here so I'm just going to
take this down to my nose and up like
this and then take some on my eyelid as
well and then a little bit right here a
little bit right there you got a little
break on my neck
alright and then I'm gonna go back in
with my damp Beauty sponge and just kind
of tap that in
all right and then I'm going to set it
with the powder foundation so you guys
can see how it looks when you actually
set your found you know when you set
your foundation with the foundation as
that makes sense so I am going to go in
with my it cosmetics Buki buffing brush
and we are just going to go back into
that fair neutral foundation I keep
wanting to say powder and I'm just going
to stipple this onto my face this is my
favorite way to apply it I think it
looks really nice and it just gives a
little boost of coverage and I really
really enjoy it
but for the most part I would say that
this is a good powder foundation like if
you are looking for something that
actually will give you coverage I think
this one is awesome it doesn't make your
face look too matte like it's not going
to dry it out in any way shape or form
but it really looks good alright so
here's the side where I just applied the
powder foundation and here's the side
where I applied a full coverage
foundation with a concealer and then put
the actual powder foundation to set in
so that's just one layer I'm going to go
in with two like I did on it the other
side of my face again just stippling it
on I feel like you get a really nice
amount of coverage with that method so
that is what it looks like so this side
I have put on like I said my foundation
concealer and I've set it with the
powder and then this side of my face I
have just used the powder so I also want
to show you guys how you can go in with
this and also stipple it on to your face
what kind of coverage that gives instead
of just doing the like buffing method I
guess you could say on that side of the
face so I'm gonna go back in and I am
going to stipple it on the other side
where we just applied the powder so that
you guys can see that this also can
build up really nicely you don't have to
have like the expert face brush or
anything like that you can definitely
build the powder foundation by sibling
it onto your skin as well
all right I'm looking super super super
pale right now I can't wait to go in and
color correct my faced with some blush
and bronzer anyway that is it guys so
this is what everything looks like oh oh
oh oh oh okay cute headband but goodness
pull my hair out why don't ya all right
so this is what everything looks like
obviously I look very very pale right
now but this side of my face I just used
the powder foundation and then on this
side I used a full coverage foundation I
used my concealer and then I went in
with the powder foundation so don't get
me wrong great coverage going on over
here in my opinion really really
beautiful if you have like rosacea or
just like um the skin that doesn't have
tons and tons of texture and stuff going
on I think you could get away with using
this as your everyday foundation but for
the most part I really like to use it to
set my entire face after I have applied
foundation and applied concealer I just
think it looks so so so nice like I said
I really really like the shade I wish
there was a lighter shade because I
believe there are people in the world
that are paler than me I even think that
this is a little light on my skintone I
probably could use the shade down from
it but after I put everything else on
like my blush and my bronzer everything
evens back out but anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this demo and you can kind
of see how much coverage this foundation
gifts and I will see you in my next one
