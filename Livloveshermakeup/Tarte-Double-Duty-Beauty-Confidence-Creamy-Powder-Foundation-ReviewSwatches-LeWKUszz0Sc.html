video is going to be a review on the
all-new double duty Beauty confidence
creamy powder foundation quite a
mouthful it is a new tarts product that
recently released on the alto-shaam
website I will link below where you guys
can pick it up if you are interested it
is not a referral or affiliate link in
any way shape or form but tart basically
recently released to their whole spring
collection on the Alta calm website
these products will be available in
store on March 13th I believe that's
what it says yes 3:13 so if you are
interested in getting your hands on
these products and you don't want to
order online you can get them in store
on the 13th but anyway this is a powder
foundation and like I said I did
purchased it for $35 the shade that I
picked up is fair neutral and I want to
touch on the shades really really
quickly there are 10 different shades
and I would say that the shades really
really kind of sit in the middle range
category if that makes sense so people
who have like medium skin tones are
really gonna like this because I would
say eight out of them eight out of the
ten are basically medium tones I would
say there is one really light color and
that's the fair and neutral and then
there's one really really deep color
which is called deep honey yeah that one
looks really really dark as well but I
just don't feel like they catered very
well to everybody's skin tone I just
wanted to touch on that really really
quickly but let me read a little bit
about what it says on the altars comm
websites you guys can get a better
understanding of this product it is a
two-in-one foundation with makeup and
skincare benefits that delivers a double
dose of moisture and anti-aging
ingredients it is a buildable medium to
full coverage powder it says the creamy
hypoallergenic formula mask any redness
dark spots uneven skin tone and access
oil whilst optimizing the look of fine
lines and pores it can be worn wet or
dry for your perfect level of coverage
and it works across skin types for
12-hour wear that's never dry or flaky
this double duty Beauty foundation comes
in a sleek compact and travel pouch with
a double-sided touch-up sponge to mask
and mattify anywhere and anytime it's
perfect for on-the-go glam and it is
port formulated without formulated
and Barb elated without parabens mineral
oil fatal aids sodium lauryl sulfate
Tris : and gluten yummy alright so let's
talk about this a little bit I want to
talk about the packaging first cuz I
think the packaging is a total hitch
this is what it looks like
Tarte has like their typical kind of
purple packaging this is the box that
comes in it says double duty Beauty and
then you open it up and you get this
beautiful pouch and this is actually
what your powder is in and it says make
today beautiful which i think is
adorable it feels kind of soft on the
inside and then the outside is just kind
of like a scratchy texture but this is
what it looks like which i think is so
cute because when you are traveling with
this particular contact if you have it
in your purse you don't want it to break
open and get everywhere so it's really
really nice because you can just slide
it right into the little pouch when you
have it in your purse and then it also
comes with this beautiful little sponge
I don't think it works very well you
guys can see I haven't used it but it's
gorgeous it's like this dark purple
shade and it's like velvet on top and
then just a regular sponge on the other
side I think it is nice to press into
powder if you want to kind of mattify
your face but for the most part I
wouldn't use this to apply or set my
makeup is that make sense so this is
what the actual packaging looks like
absolutely stunning I love the gold I
think it's beautiful very very sleek it
shows your color on the back with a
beautiful beautiful little pink sticker
it says confidence creamy powder
foundation like I said my shade is fair
and neutral and then it just opens up it
does click shut which is nice because
then you know it's actually closing and
you do get a nice little mirror there
and then this is what the actual powder
foundation looks like so like I said I
have fair neutral and I think this is a
perfect perfect beautiful beautiful
color match for me personally I'm going
to go ahead and swatch a few guys really
quickly so you can see it is really
really light and I think it's absolutely
absolutely gorgeous I wish they would
have made one shade that is a little
lighter than this because I know there
are people that are even more fair than
I am and I feel like this does pull a
little bit of a yellow undertone and I
don't think that that's going to fit
everybody's skin like concern or skin
type if that makes sense so I have its
washed right there on the back of my
hand you guys can see the level level of
coverage it gives so I was really
excited when I saw that this release I
person
we don't love powder foundations I
prefer cream or liquid foundations just
because I feel like I get really really
nice coverage and I do prefer medium to
buildable full coverage I'm the only
other powder foundation I have
experience with is the Laura Geller
balance in Brighton and I do feel like
that one gives a little more coverage
than this particular product the way
that I like to use this product is
actually to set my foundation now people
might be like what is wrong with you if
you're already wearing foundation why do
you need to set it with a powder
foundation but it's because it gives
extra coverage and I just think it's
absolutely beautiful on the skin so my
favorite way is to just go ahead and I
apply all my face makeup and then what I
want to set it I will go in with my it
cosmetics Buki buffing brush which came
in the holiday set from last year and I
swirl it in here and I tap it on my face
and I set my foundation and it just
gives that extra little bit of coverage
that is absolutely absolutely beautiful
if you guys would like to see a demo on
this product please let me know below
and I can fit that video in tomorrow and
then if you guys say you do want to see
a demo I will link that in the
description bar in this video you can
come back and you can see a demo but
overall I think it's absolutely
beautiful for setting up your foundation
I would say the coverage level is not
amazing if you have a skin that is
really really kind of naturally like
flawless looking like you don't have a
lot of discoloration or
hyperpigmentation I think you could get
away with using that on a daily basis it
actually has a beautiful beautiful sort
of Sheen to it very very similar to the
laura geller baked powder foundation I
don't know if I have mine out but it has
the same sort of sheen to it it's not
completely matte so that's something to
be aware of if you do have oily skin you
may not like the actual finish but I
have to say it is so creamy and so
blendable it literally feels like butter
on your finger and you guys probably
won't be able to pick up the actual
sheen but let me see if I can kind of
blend it in so I have it right here on
my hand it just has the tiniest bit of
Sheen and I think it's absolutely
gorgeous to put on top of foundation or
on top of CC cream BB cream whatever you
wanted you to set your foundation again
I just don't think it has that like
enough coverage for me personally I have
tried using it with my Real Techniques
expert face brush and buffing it into my
skin I just wasn't comfortable with the
level of coverage it gave maybe if
there's like a day where I'm going to
the beach or something like that or I
really
want natural makeup sure I would go
ahead and do that but overall I think
that it really is not as medium to
buildable coverage as they claim I just
think it's better as a setting powder so
that's really the way that I prefer to
use it I think that the shade ranges are
a little bit of a hit and miss I wish
they had more lighter shades and more
darker shades but overall it's a very
creamy it's very very beautiful on the
skin I love the kind of Sheen that I
guess I think everybody would like this
it does not get cakey whatsoever it is
so finely milled and beautiful you can
barely tell it is actually on your skin
I am wearing it today and I feel like
it's undetectable on the skin it's
absolutely undetectable and I'm wearing
a pretty full coverage foundation
underneath so I feel like it's
absolutely gorgeous on the skin so I
think anybody would really really enjoy
this if you want lighter coverage you
can absolutely use it as a powder
foundation if you want to just set in
your foundation like I do with this I
think that you're going to love the
extra benefits and the extra coverage
that you're going to get from this
product I will say this it really does
wear a very very long time Tarte is
known for having you know like their
Amazonian clay blushes and their
12-hours formula it's amazing it will
literally stick to your skin like tattoo
okay
like I'd tattoo it will literally just
stick on your skin all day long it's
absolutely wonderful I don't feel like I
have to touch up as much with this
product I do have combination skin so I
get oily in my t-zone but I don't feel
like I have to constantly touch up with
this product so I really really enjoy
that about it - I think it's absolutely
wonderful definitely worth of $35 and
yeah I'm loving it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little review on the new
Tarte I have to pull up the name I
literally can't remember the name of
this thing it is so confidence creamy
powder foundation I'm just gonna call it
that such a long name but I hope you
enjoyed this review on it I think this
is a fantastic product whether you're
using it to actually wear as a
foundation or if you're using it to set
your powder I set your foundation I
think it's absolutely beautiful so I
hope you enjoyed this video let me know
if you would like a demo on the product
I can do half my face put foundation on
and then apply this to show you what it
looks like with the extra coverage
coverage and then the other side I can
use just this so you guys can see what
kind of coverage I can get so give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
I will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
