you could probably tell from the
thumbnail I'm not too keen on the
product that I am going to be reviewing
it is the new tart double duty Beauty
empowered hydrogel foundation I was so
excited for this to release I really
thought I was gonna love it and it turns
out that I love its little sister more
this is the confidence creamy powder
foundation I just reviewed this I'll
link it below if you would like to see
the review I'll link that in the
description bar but I love this way more
than this one so anyway a lot of story
short I purchased this for $39 on the
altars comm website I will link below
where you guys can pick it up if you are
interested it is not a referral or a
billions link in any way shape or form
they have ten different shades and just
I'm not gonna go into that right now we
will talk about the shades in a minute
but let me read a little bit about what
it says on the lsat comm website for you
guys this is supposed to be available in
stores on march 13th however I closed my
Ulta a few days ago and I was like do
you have the new tarte collection yet
and they were like we're not getting
that to like the middle of April and I
was like what so I would recommend going
ahead and calling ahead of time to make
sure that your alta actually has them
but this is specifically o me at Ulta it
says smooth skin is in with this radiant
full coverage foundation with skin
loving ingredients wrapped in a
luxurious creamy gel the unique oil-free
blend of smoothing pumping and pori
finding ingredients help a brighten skin
while moisturizing and blurring the look
of fine lines and pores the cooling
hypoallergenic gel feels like a drink of
water for your skin while masking any
sort of redness it also covers dark
spots acne uneven skin tone it's
supposed to have 12 hour wear for all
skin types and it isn't available it is
an it is available not unavailable it is
available in a shade range that matches
any skin tone I really should have said
it's unavailable because it doesn't
match every skin tone it has a rose
scent and a natural radiant finish I
also don't agree with that but it
supposed to have all of these hydrating
ingredients in it like biopolymer
filling spheres which expands fears to
help smooth surface imperfections while
promoting water retention and hydration
is got hyaluronic acid in it which is a
naturally occurring ingredient in the
human body which delivers moisture
firmness and supple
it has barley extract which helps
restore the lipid barrier to smooth over
fine lines and wrinkles and I also have
vitamin C which is an antioxidant free
radical fighter that helps prevent
premature signs of aging and also
brightens your skin it is formulated
without parabens mineral oil fatal aids
sodium lauryl sulfate twist : and gluten
I don't know if I pronounce all those
correctly but those are the claims for
this foundation and I'm just gonna start
not gonna mole down that's I really
don't have huge huge I mean I do have
huge complaints about it but there's
really only two big complaints when it
comes to this foundation I do agree I
think it's beautiful it is a very very
hydrating and luxurious on the skin I do
believe that they have all of those
hyaluronic acid and barley extract and
vitamin C in there because it's
beautiful on the skin my first complaint
is I don't like the way it dries down I
don't like the finish that it leaves on
the skin in the long run and I have
tried applying it with a brush I tried
applying it with my fingers and also
with a Beauty Blender and I hate the way
it dries down every single time and my
second complaint is you know what tart
you know you are a high-end brand you
should know better you should be able to
come out with a product that actually
matches skin tones you know what I mean
I feel like this is going to be part of
their permanent collection which just
pisses me off because I'm like what like
I love the here I love the Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
this is in the shade fair beige this
matches my skin perfectly this shade
right here fair light neutral this is
dark on me I'm going to show you guys
really quickly and you know I think for
$39 I shouldn't have to go and reach for
my Illamasqua white liquid base or rich
liquid foundation or my Mac one like a
white mixer foundation I feel like I
shouldn't have to do that if I'm paying
$39 for a foundation you should make one
that matches my skin tone and I feel
like the ten shades that they are
offering like with this foundation are
either super super like medium skin tone
and then there's either one or two
really really dark shades and then one
or two kinds of light shades but it
never goes to like porcelain I'm not I
mean I'm pretty light I wouldn't call
myself the fairest of them all but I am
pretty light but I feel like anybody
lighter than me this is just not gonna
work for you this is what the color
looks like and once it dries down it
gets even darker so this is what it
looks like freshly applied you can see
there is quite a bit of an orange yellow
under
Chum and I just don't like it I don't
like that this is the lightest shade and
I don't like the fact that I have to go
and fuss around with my white mixer
foundations this foundation is going
back to Ulta I have already decided I do
think that it really is a good
foundation I do love the consistency I
think it's beautiful when you're
applying it you guys can see you do get
one fluid ounce in here which is like
the normal average amount but it's
beautiful it's luxurious it's of water
like it feels amazing it blends like a
dream you literally can put this on with
your fingers and blend it on your face
like a dream but it dries down to a very
very interesting
finish so it starts to thin out like the
more you apply it starts to kind of do
this weird thing where it thins out and
then it just starts sinking in like it's
sinking into your skin and I don't know
if it's because it has all of these
moisturizing benefits to it or what but
I notice immediately like lines that I
never knew I had suddenly appeared on my
face I'm talking they really really like
around my mouth area just like my fine
lines here really really sinking in and
filling in there around my eye area
really really over emphasizing and
exaggerating those lines even on my
forehead and I'm just thinking like oh
that's the last thing I want I feel like
this is such a beautiful formulation
that it actually starts to sink into the
skin and I don't think that's good I
think that foundation should always a
little bit like they should sit on top
of the skin a little bit I'm not saying
you want them to be completely visible
on the skin but it's better than a
foundation literally sinking into your
skin because that's when you can start
to see it settling into areas so that's
my complaint is that I really just don't
like the way that it sets and it will
set in a beautiful kind of luminous sort
of way it never dries down super matte
or anything like that I didn't notice
any like emphasized areas in my t-zone I
do have combination skin so I tend to
get oil breakdown in that area
this never happened with this foundation
this foundation definitely where it's
like 12 hours it is very very long
wearing like Tarte is very very good
when it comes to their like Amazonian
clay formula or even just their
long-wear claim always always always
they hit it out of the ballpark
absolutely it wears all day but my
problem is is that I just don't like the
way that it starts to settle into areas
on my face
and like I said there's like areas where
it's like oh I didn't even know I had a
fine line or a wrinkle right there I
just don't like that so it's definitely
not my favorite I do think it is
buildable you can get a really really
nice kind of luminous Demi matte sort of
finish going on but I just don't like
the way it sinks into my pores it also
starts to really exaggerate in my pores
around my t-zone which are very very big
even if I wear like a silicon primer and
I just don't like that I think that it's
absolutely luxurious and beautiful
I would not compare this to like the
Revlon Colorstay whipped that one is
more of a dry formula this is really
moisturizing and beautiful and I'm just
so bummed that it doesn't stay this way
you know like it dries down to something
different than what they kind of claim
like it really is so moisturizing that
it just sinks into the skin and I just
don't think that that's very good with
foundations you don't actually want
something that sinks into the skin
because that's when you start to notice
like oh it's actually sinking into lines
and pores and things like that you want
it to sit kind of on top of the skin but
in a natural way so that is my first
complaint and again second complaint is
just the shade range for $39 I don't
want to have to pull out one of my voice
mixer foundations I shouldn't have to do
that I don't think that's fair and yeah
this product will be going back I do
believe that they have all of those
wonderful wonderful hydrating properties
in there I feel like a lot of skin types
could use this um like I said I have
combination skin and I never noticed
that I got really oily it never
exaggerated any dry areas in fact I feel
like it really moisturized dry areas on
my face so if you have dry skin or aging
skin you would probably really like it a
lot I think it's so easy to blend I just
don't like the way it dries down so
overall I think that yes it does claim
to be a long wearing foundation it
definitely is it claims to be very very
lightweight and moisturizing I think it
is and it claims to have like a luminous
kind of dewy finish not dewy I don't
want to say dewy it's like a luminous
semi matte finish like the Demi Madsen
semi matte semi matte
whatever I feel like it really does have
that I feel like it is buildable on the
skin but I just don't like the way that
it dries down so I feel like the claims
that they say but this foundation are
true and are right is just not working
for me um particularly because of the
shade range and I might come on
you're a high-end brand like I know that
they can make shade ranges that work for
me you know I mean I know they can make
colors that work for me but yeah so
we'll see I wonder if they will go ahead
and make some more like different shades
like kind of open up the like I don't
know like you know open up the shade
variety more if that makes sense
I wonder if they'll do that I know that
when you first have like a product that
releases you don't know how well it's
going to do so they usually try to do
like five to seven colors but you know I
just was kind of bummed out that this
was so dark on me and it drives even
more dark you know so that was kind of a
bummer but well I think that the claims
that they say it does actually work I'm
just disappointed in it for the finish
and also the color so I will be
returning mine let me know down below if
you guys have picked this up and what
you think of it but for me this was
pretty much of pretty much a fail so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you for joining me and I'll see you my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
