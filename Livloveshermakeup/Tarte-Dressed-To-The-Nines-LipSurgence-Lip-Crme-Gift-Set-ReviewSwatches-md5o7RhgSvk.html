thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a really really
wonderful fantastic day i'm very very
excited can you guys tell i'm sure you
can't because you know I'm so good at
hiding it no but I am very very excited
today to be doing a review and also
swatches on a new holiday product that
released from Tarte I would say a few
weeks ago I've had it for about six to
seven days so I have had plenty of time
to play around with it is called the
tart dressed to the nines lipsurgence
lip creme gift set it looks like this is
a beautiful beautiful packaging and I'm
going to read for you guys what it says
on the website of what this is supposed
to be so this is the tart dress to the
nines lipsurgence lip creme gift set it
is thirty four dollars and it says give
the gift of a party perfect pout with
this luxurious gift set featuring and
nine deluxe lipsurgence lip creams like
a drink of water for your lips the
supremely silky full coverage formula
features lip loving ingredients like
maracuja a hobo seed oil and shea butter
that drench lips in moisture to help
smooth firm and protect treat yourself
to nine new limited edition shades of
this bestseller arranged into three
separate gift boxes that can also be
broken up and shared as the perfect
holidays stocking stuffer um they are
calling this year's holiday like 2015
their little thing is holidays which is
H oli da ze like oh em in a daze like
makeup days so super super cute um they
are dermatologist tested formulated
without parabens mineral oil fat elites
sodium lauryl sulfate triclosan
synthetic fragrances and gluten tart is
really really good at formulating all of
their products without animal testing
and also without just you know parabens
all that kind of stuff so really really
good it is a hundred twenty six dollar
value but like I said this is $34 I did
purchase mine on the ultracaan website I
will link below where you guys can pick
it up and the shades that you get in
here are stunning which is a pinky nude
shade jazzy which is a poppy color
luscious which is a raspberry shade
plush which is a cool pink you get
striking which is a mauve color you also
get glamorous which is a rose berry
shade Loring which is a nude
color pizzazz which is crimson and
rincey which is a golden coral and each
one has point 5 6 ounces so basically
like it said these are all limited
edition new colors and these don't
overlap from the what was it called last
year I think their packaging last year
was called like kissin bell or like
tartan bell I think it was kissin Bell
they had a very cute little lip surgeon
said that I also did review last holiday
season and that included some of like
the matte lip surgeons and also I
believe like a few or maybe two up the
lip glosses but this year this one is
just nine of the lip creme lip search
insist so the lip creme formula is a
little different is a little more glossy
it's not like the mat one which is
completely mad and it's also not what
are the other ones that they have I
think they're plain ones are or just
like the original ones tend to have a
different kind of formulation sort of
thing going on but the lip creme is
supposed to be really nice because it's
very moisturizing it has Mercutio oil in
it which tart loves and kind of started
the whole maracuja um craze or phase I
guess you could say so um yeah so it has
all of these really really nice
ingredients in it lots of oils it's
supposed to be very very nice on the
lips of Barry I'm hydrating supposed to
help firm protect everything that they
said basically in there and also I just
thought you know the packaging was
absolutely adorable for this year last
year's kit was kind of like this and it
was very very cute too I mean all of the
holiday packaging every single brand
comes out with really cute packaging
it's very different but tart always has
adorable packaging and it was more like
this last year and it wasn't as big but
this year I think this is super cute and
I am going to show you guys right now
the cutest part about this little kit is
that they all come in a little trio like
this and they come in this adorable
little box and on the back it says to
and from so basically they're telling
you that you can split each box up so
because there are nine in here you can
split them all up into threes and give
these to your friends and they would be
great stocking stuffers great to just
give to a friend that likes make up a
lot
I did arrange them back into the color
format that they came in uh-huh which
took a while I had to go on the website
and like look at the actual photo to
like put them all back into the right
place but you really could mix and match
if you have a friend who loves like only
nude lips you could put all of the nude
shades in there or someone who likes
darker lips or pinky lips you know you
could put all three in there and you
could give them the sort of color
arrangement that they like but what I
noticed with all three is that they have
a darker shade a kind of nudie shade and
then a pink shade in each one so anyway
I'm really really happy with this kit I
think it is a wonderful wonderful value
like I said it is over a hundred dollar
value and these are two left sides but
you get a nice amount of product in
there i'm going to show you guys quickly
um they do twirl up quite a bit so this
is what the actual size looks like of
all of them but they go up quite a bit
so you are getting you know a good
amount of product in there that's all
the way apps so um yes these are the
size that you definitely could get
through um no problem i'm sure people
would be able to get through these but
if you kept all nine for yourself you'd
have a lot of product to go through but
anyway I me to go ahead and swatch these
for you guys I am wearing a shade on my
lips today this one is called what does
it call luscious I absolutely love this
shade so when we get to that one if you
guys are wondering what is on my lips it
is that shade but anyway I'm going to go
ahead and starts watching them for you
guys like i said i really like these if
you are new to the lipsurgence um
formula i guess you could say or to the
lip creme formula like I said they're
very moisturizing they do they're kind
of like a hyper glossy finish at first
they get really really glossy when you
first apply them and then they kind of
subtly start to fade if they do have
pretty good wearing power I would say if
you're eating or drinking they're
definitely going to be gone in about 45
minutes to an hour but I noticed that
they just leave a gorgeous stain on the
lips and the stain tends to reflect the
color that it was so it's not like
you're going to take a pinky shade and
then it's going to stay like red or
something like that it's going to stain
pretty close um you know pretty closely
to what the color was that was on your
lips so it's a really really nice glossy
formula they
smell very minty and they taste very
minty so if you do not like peppermint
you probably won't like these but I just
think that this these are so easy to
apply and if you already like the
lipsurgence formula you're really going
to like these ones because they're extra
moisturizing but they're just really
lovely they go on really really opaque
they have great great coverage I mean
every single one of them there's not one
that lacks in um you know like
opaqueness in my opinion so I'm really
really happy with this fact I think I
like this one more than last year's
because I'm not a huge fan of the lip
glosses that came in the kit last year
so i really really love that all of
these are lipsurgence and they are you
know all nine new limited edition shades
so you get new shades every year it's
just so great so if you are a fan of a
lip surgeons formula you probably really
like this kid so anyway let's get to
squatching shall we so the first three
that we have here are these shades and
you have glamorous plush and stunning so
they look like that those are the first
three these are the top three shades so
we're going to swatch glamorous which is
this one right here just going to go
like that very very pretty shade I'm
going to kind of make it a little bigger
so you guys can see that is the shade
glamorous so it's this really really
beautiful kind of mavi reddish color
it's definitely got a bit of a red
undertone but super super gorgeous
absolutely stunning at the second shade
that you get in that little kit is or
that little trio is called plush it
looks like this this is more of like a
pinky color oh you guys I'm so bad it's
watching so there is plush I'm going to
build that up just a little more it's
like a kinky sort of mauve colors
definitely got a mob undertone oh they
just smell so minty and some nice you
guys I love it and then the last one you
get in that little trio is called
stunning so you guys can see that they
kind of point with like a darker a
darker color and then the pinkie ER
color and then you get the nude so if
you were to
um give these out in the trio's that
they were like designed to be you
basically would be giving out um you
know like a ready kind of color a pinky
kind of color in a nude which is great
for tons of people so this is more than
nudie sort of shade they bill my gosh
you guys I'm so bad it's watching I'm
going to move this from my arm to like
my hand or something where I can see so
this is more of the pinky kind of nude
color and that one is called stunning
alright so that is the first trio really
really beautiful absolutely gorgeous
colors very opaque no matter what color
you know they were kind of under whether
it be red the pink shade even the nude
one goes on really really nicely so the
next little trio you get looks like this
and it has these shades ritzy jazzy and
luring in it that is what it looks like
we'll take it out of its little outer
packaging but these are so cute you guys
I would love like just you know getting
this is like a stocking stuffer like if
I didn't have it and somebody gave you
know one of these little boxes to means
the stocking stuffer I'd be like oh my
gosh that's so cool so these are the
next three again you guys can see you
get a deeper color you get kind of a
pinky and then a nude color so the first
one is ritzy and a swatch these on the
back of my hand easier for me so ritzy
is kind of like a peachy color and it's
got a lot of gold shimmer in it so
really really beautiful and again even
the light of shades in each little trio
pack have such a wonderful opaque color
payoff so that is rincey the next one
you get in here is called javi it's a
little more of like the pinkish reddish
color and this is really nice I me oh
yeah this is that one that I felt like
the packaging kind of looked a lot
darker than what it came off like it
comes off don't know how to describe it
this one looks like it would be more
with like a red undertone and it
actually comes off as a very like warm
toned medium pink so that's right say
really really beautiful that one is
called jazzy and then you have loring
which looks like this and this is a
gorgeous color and I love this one and
this one I would say is um hard to
explain is kind of like my lips but
better kind of kylie jenner asked if you
will it's very very beautiful and it
just has like this gorgeous like peachy
corley sort of undertone so really
really gorgeous love that one alright so
that is the second trio and the third
Trillo looks like this and you have the
shades luscious striking and pizzazz and
I wearing licious on my lips today I
have been wearing it for about two hours
so you guys are kind of seeing the stain
part of it um so let's put on lashes I'm
going to put on my lips too gorgeous
gorgeous red toned berry shade just
amazing and perfect so this is luscious
you know and I love Barry shades but
this one has like a red undertone
instead of kind of like a purpley one
and it's just gorgeous so there is
luscious beautiful the second one is
kind of the nude in the trio and this
one is called striking kind of peachy
very pretty guys we'll see
dark kind of nudie peach they're
beautiful and then the last one is
called is add this is gorgeous i love
this one this is more of like the bright
cool toned red so it's got a lot of like
blue undertones in it it's really really
gorgeous and that one is right there it
is definitely my second favorite in the
bunch next to lashes so anyway those are
all of them those are all of the
swatches I think the one thing that you
might notice from like looking at all of
these swash if you are keeping these all
for yourself which I am now because I
have switched all of them and warn
basically all of them the color family
is very very similar um and I don't know
if like they really really think that
people will break it up into threes and
give them away to friends and you just
kind of keep one or one but a lot of
these are in the similar kind of color
family if that makes sense you're never
going to get a new that goes to nude
you're never going to get a read that
goes to read or like a pink that goes to
pink they're all kind of muted and um I
mean you look at that you're like really
muted but um if you know what I mean
like they all kind of stay in the same
color family so a lot of them do look
somewhat similar so um I do recommend
you know now I've swapped them and warn
them so of course I'm going to keep all
of them but um i would recommend you
know giving them out as little stocking
stuffers because uh you know they are
very very similar but also it's nice if
you do want to keep it for yourself
because um if you go through one of them
and because you know you get like that
much product like i showed you guys you
could go and find one from each like
trio that matches up in a similar way
and then you could continue to wear that
color so it's kind of like you get even
more product but overall that's really
my only complaint is that they seem to
be very very close in shades but it
doesn't bother me i love the formula i
think um it's a great value and i love
the packaging I just think it's awesome
so
really really love this product um if
you're a fan of the lip surgeons formula
or the lipsurgence in general you're
really going to like this especially
this lip creme formula really really
moisturizing and nice kind of goes on
glossy and then it starts to fade it
fades completely evenly which is like a
huge thing for me I one of those people
that if I'm wearing dark lip and it
starts like fading unevenly I go crazy
so I love that it feeds really evenly
and it does leave a beautiful stained
that is very close to what the actual
color looks like in the tube and yeah so
I hope you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches i highly recommend picking this
up i will link below ever you guys can
get it $34 absolutely a must have for um
you know the lip kits that are going to
be coming out and I don't know what else
is coming out you know a lot of them
start to come out this time of year and
normally you see it more towards like
middle of October I feel like that's
when everything really starts to come
out but this is definitely one that i
recommend so the target dress to the
nines lipsurgence lip creme you accept
is two thumbs up I hope you guys enjoyed
this and i'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
