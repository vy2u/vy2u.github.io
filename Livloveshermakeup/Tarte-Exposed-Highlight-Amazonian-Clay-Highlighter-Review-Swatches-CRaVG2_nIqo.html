this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new Tarte Amazonian
clay exposed highlighter yes I'm going
to read a little bit of information off
of the torch website for you guys in a
second but yes tards finally released an
Amazonian clay highlighter and it
happens to be exposed and exposed is a
very very special blush that everybody
loves if you guys watched my review and
swatches on the naughty nude blush
collection you would know that I did go
ahead and declutter my exposed blush I
am very fair complected and I do have a
cool undertone and for some reason that
blush never really gave my skin a lot of
oomph and never looked that great on me
so I did pass it along to a friend but I
did want to go ahead and still purchase
this because when I saw it on the online
website I could tell that it wasn't a
direct color match for the exposed blush
instead of leaning a little more like
nude rose shade like nudie or rose
colored it definitely leads more of like
a golden almost silvery sheen it's very
hard to describe I want to say really
really quickly before I even get started
it is what I'm wearing on my cheekbones
today down the bridge of my nose and on
my chin as well as my Cupid's bow I did
swatch this on my Instagram and
everybody was commenting and saying oh
my god it's so much darker than your
skin tone it is in fact darker than my
skin tone and I think that I kind of
worded it the wrong way when I was
talking on snapchat I was saying it's
more of a blush topper for me and what I
mean by that is that it's not a direct
highlight for me this shade is not
lighter than my skin tone however it can
still be used as a highlight for very
very glowy looking skin so although this
is darker than my complexion even now
when I have self-tanner on even though
it is darker than my complexion it
doesn't mean that it can't make your
skin look glowy and highlight it in that
sort of way I hope that makes sense I
apologize I feel like I kind of worded
that wrong on my snapchat I was saying
it's more of a blush topper and that is
sort of the way that I use it I do use
it with this Luxy or a tapered
highlighter brush and I take it on my
cheekbones and down to the apple of my
cheeks and that's sort of what I meant
by blush topper because I feel like you
can take it on the hypo
of your face and work it down into your
blush to get really really glowy skin so
anyway this is a vegan friendly 12-hour
highlighter that gives you effortless
incandescent glow to the skin it is $28
and I will link below where you guys can
pick it up from the Tarte comm website
the outer packaging is identical to the
Amazonian clay blushes so here is one of
the Amazonian clay blushes from the new
nutty nudes collection that this shade
is called risque it's the same exact
size you are getting five point six
grams of product or 0.20 once's and it's
the same sort of packaging so you open
it up you do have a nice sized mirror
and then this is your product so as you
can see right away it definitely is not
a color dupe for the exposed blush
exposed blush is more of a nude rose
color I would call it personally this
one definitely leans more of it like a
golden color if that makes sense now
there is a bit of a nude undertone in
there and that is why it's actually
darker than my skin tone I would say it
has like a nude base and then it's got
tons and tons of golden and silver
shimmer in there it is stunning and out
of this whole entire collection that
Tarte has recently released this is by
far my favorite thing ever I think it is
so beautiful on the skin my skin has
never looked this glowy and intense and
beautiful without looking textured and
crazy because anytime I really want to
like beef up my highlights I find that
it starts to emphasize fine lines around
you know the outer parts of my eyes
obviously it starts to emphasize texture
on my cheekbones like even down here
near my chin I get hormonal acne it's
just too much and I see these gorgeous
pictures of girls who really have this
like strong highlight and I'm wondering
what the hell are they using because if
I use that much my skin just looks worse
so it's like you can either have really
really glowy skin but it looks textured
like it looks good from far away but it
looks pretty shitty up close or you can
have just a nice light highlight with a
nice smooth looking skin well guess what
you can have both with this particular
highlight it just has the most amazing
amazing formulation to it the wear time
on this is very strong I would
definitely say say that the claim for 12
hours is totally totally true I think I
wore this maybe
14 hours yesterday maybe 14 hours
yesterday so it stayed on absolutely all
day I filmed in the morning I films when
I got home it was still really really
glowy I had people commenting on my
snapchat saying my skin looked so
beautiful and I was like really I just
learned the really long day but yeah
it's a beautiful beautiful formulation
as you guys can see it is completely
opaque and what I would describe this as
when I touch this it does not feel like
the Amazonian clay blushes at all it
feels much softer but there's a little
bit of grip or texture there and I was
worried about that I honestly thought I
was like whew you know as I'm feeling it
I was like that's really going to
emphasize pores and fine lines and
wrinkles and all that on my face it
doesn't at all I don't know how but it
just blends and glides on like a dream I
wouldn't say it's the consistency of say
like a baked jewel a sort of formulation
sort of like the Dior illuminating
glowing gardens or the new Burberry
highlighters or even the Laura Geller
baked gelatos twirl illuminators I
wouldn't say it feels like that what it
kind of feels like to me is a makeup
geek foiled eyeshadow or a artist shadow
from a makeup forever
yeah an artist shadow from makeup
forever it's a little smoother than that
but I have a little bit of grip but it's
just that really cool like innovative
formulation and a recently tarte did
come out with an eyeshadow palette
called the rainforest of the sea
eyeshadow palette that feels very
similar in texture to this particular
formulation so formulation is beautiful
the opaqueness is so intense this is one
layer on my face right now like I feel
like I'm like beaming with light I mean
it's absolutely stunning and although
this technically is a darker color than
my skin tone the second I turn the right
way the light just beams off of it so
yes when I turn my head like this and
I'm looking over here I can see that
this particular highlight is darker than
my skin I can see that there definitely
is like a beige or kind of a nude
undertone going on but then I dealt it
and instantly you can see the gold you
can see the reflective particles of that
gorgeous silver iridescent and you are
getting so much glow so although it's
not technical
highlighting products for me it still
gives me gorgeous glow and I guess you
could say it gives me technically golden
highlight so anyway highlight be on
fleek with this particular product
highly highly recommend checking this
out guys I really think it's fantastic
where power or where time is really
really strong formulation is beautiful
amazing super buttery super soft my
favorite way to apply this is definitely
with a tapered highlighter brush
anything that is densely packed at the
bottom and then kind of fluffed out at
the top this one is the Lexi 522 tapered
highlighter blush brush I keep saying
blush Jesus brush I like to just go in
there tap off the excess brush that on
and I feel like it's very effortless
like you don't need to really buff it
into the skin you can kind of just go on
and be like Oh naughty naughty duh you
know like I'm having a great day
la-dee-da it goes on so beautifully I
don't know what else to say so I'm
really really impressed with this the
Sigma tapered highlighter brush is
another really wonderful brush for
applying this if you go in with
something that's a little too dense
you're going to get straight-up pigment
all over your face you need to be
careful so I would highly recommend
using a tapered highlighter brush or a
fan brush
so overall guys I can't say enough good
things about this product it is so
beautiful and I do want to touch on one
thing let me check on the website I
believe that this is going to be a
permanent yeah I think this is going to
be a permanent product in the tart
collection so you don't have to worry
about not being able to get your hands
on this but honestly for $28 I would go
ahead and pick it up it is that good
this is probably becoming one of my
all-time favorite highlights and I've
only had it for a few days
so really really beautiful product
highly recommend gorgeous I think that
it would work on a lot of different skin
tones although IM fair-complected it
still works for me because the undertone
is beige and kind of you know nude
colored but then when you actually put
it on your skin you can see that there
are reflective particles in there that
have gold and silver iridescent so here
is the swatch on the back of my hand as
you can see it is very very opaque
there's no streaking it goes on so
nicely and what I like is that it
doesn't bring emphasis on like the
texture that's already on my skin
can't really see we're like the hair
follicles are and all that kind of stuff
it just kind of glides over it a very
very nice sort of dimecaco feel so it is
a beautiful beautiful highlight you guys
and I think it would look gorgeous on a
lot of different skin tones even though
it is darker than my skin tone I still
love it and I think even if you do have
very very deep dark like chocolatey skin
this would still look absolutely
stunning on you so I hope you guys
enjoyed this rave review I'm a new tart
expose highlighter thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
