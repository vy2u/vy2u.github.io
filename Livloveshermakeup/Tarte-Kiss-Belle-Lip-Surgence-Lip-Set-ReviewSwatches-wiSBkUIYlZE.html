i am doing a review on the tart sweet
dreams kiss and belle deluxe lipsurgence
lip set in here you get 4 deluxe lips
urgent Lipton's in dainty which is the
pink color innocent which is a warm nude
dreamy which is a cool raspberry and
alluring which is a mauve color you also
get two deluxe lips urgent map lip tints
in eternal which is the pinky nude fancy
which is a plum berry and you also get
two deluxe lip searches lip glosses in
kiss which is a light pink and bell
which is a raspberry color I absolutely
love this kit I think it is so worth it
it was only thirty four dollars at
Sephora here are the swatches as you can
see these are the lip tints and these
are the glasses the only thing in this
kit that I really didn't love was this
color right here which is the lip gloss
in kiss I think it didn't really have a
lot of pigmentation the other one
raspberry is amazing i think it's called
raspberry right yes raspberry is amazing
but this one just you know and I could
definitely do that easily so um let me
just get started with the swatches and
I'll tell you guys what the colors are
so we'll start here with the actual lip
tints this one right here is called
eternal this one right here is called
dreamy this one right here is called
alluring this one right here is called
innocent this one right here is called
dainty and the last one is called fancy
and then of course you get kissed and
raspberry as the glasses so I absolutely
love the consistency of the lip tints I
think the matte ones are great i think
the regular ones are great they're super
easy to apply they have a nice smell to
them they go on very easily and you get
a really nice deluxe size of all of them
so i definitely think this is worth the
$34 it is still on the support website
if you guys want to go ahead and check
it out and i really couldn't be happier
i think all the colors are absolutely
beautiful those are the swatches again
and i think you should pick this up what
can i say i love it and it's definitely
with the money so i hope you guys
enjoyed this review and i'll talk to you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
