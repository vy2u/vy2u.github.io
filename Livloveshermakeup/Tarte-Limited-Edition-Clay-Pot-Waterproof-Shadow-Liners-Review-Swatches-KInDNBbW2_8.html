channel in this video I am giving you
guys in my review my thoughts and my
swatches on two out of the four Tarte
summer 2016 limited edition clay pot'
waterproof shadow liners quite a
mouthful they do have four different
shades that are available on the Tarte
au pomme website currently and the
shades are mint rose gold white and
cobalt I personally picked up mint and
rose gold and these are $21 a piece on
the Tarte cob website I'm going to link
below in the description bar where you
guys can pick them up right now you do
get 2.5 grams of product in here so a
pretty decent amount and you will be
able to pick these up online on the Ulta
comm website on March 27th online on
Macy's on April 4th and also online on
the Sephora calm website on April 5th so
anyway this is what the outer packaging
looks like typical Tarte packaging just
that dark like purple shade and then you
see the actual names on the top so this
one is rose gold and this one is mint
these are formulated without parabens
mineral oil fat elites triskele and
sodium lauryl sulfate gluten and they
are ophthalmologist tested so tart is
always really good with that they have
some really really nice natural
ingredients in them and they are cruelty
free alright
so the actual packaging is so beautiful
um like I said you do get 2.5 grams of
product in here so quite a bit for a
cream eyeliner this is what the actual
packaging looks like you get a nice
shiny gold lid that has the tarts little
like monogrammed on there and then it's
just in a little glass container super
super easy to use like I just feel like
it's such a small little container you
could definitely travel with this and
this is the mint shade right here which
is just a beautiful creamy kind of matte
mint shade very pretty and then we have
the rose gold one that comes in the same
exact packaging and this is a stunning
shade but this one is a little different
as far as the formula is concerned this
is the only one out of all four that
actually has a little bit of shimmer or
glitter in it now the shimmer and
glitter is a very very minimal and you
don't notice it on the eyes I am
actually wearing this all over my lid
today a little bit and then also on the
inner corner of my eyes
and then I have the mint shade
underneath my lower lash line I am
loving these you guys I literally cannot
say enough good things about these they
have the blend ability of a cream
eyeshadow but then they lock in place
and set down like a cream eyeliner and
they are completely budge proof you
could literally go swimming and these
are not going to go anywhere I did not
have to set in this color the mint shade
on my lower lash line I did not have to
set these in with a powder today with an
eye shadow nothing they are just on
there they have been on there for a
while now and these we're an incredibly
long time if you want to remove these
pop products you're going to need to go
ahead and use like an oil or an
oil-based eye makeup remover because
they are not going to come off with
regular like micellar water or just like
a normal makeup removing cloth you need
something oil-based because these are
budge proof so today when I applied the
mint shade I just used this little
paintbrush right here and I basically
just painted it onto my lower lash line
and literally within a minute this had
completely set into place and it's just
a gorgeous creamy like luxurious opaque
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous mint shade so
there it is kind of globbed onto the
back of my hand and watch how easy this
blends so it literally has the blend
ability of a cream eyeshadow and then
you give it like one minute and it will
just completely lock into place and then
I will not be able to use like move that
around whatsoever it is completely budge
proof and I love it these literally are
putting my other cream eyeshadows to
shame I mean literally not cream
eyeshadows cream eyeliner / shadows to
shame because the like where time on
these is incredible they are completely
waterproof literally you could jump in
the pool I could jump in the pool right
now all my mascara would come off but my
eyeliner like this is not going anywhere
so I think my favorite part about it is
the fact that it is a two in one product
so you're getting that gorgeous
you know blend ability of a cream
eyeshadow with the actual like
consistency of a liner but it's not the
consistency of a liner because it just
completely locks into place and it just
completely sets and it's like unlike any
sort of product that I've ever used
before you can see right now that it is
completely locked into place
I literally
feels very tacky now I can't really move
it I mean if I really really rip like
that then maybe I can move a little bit
of it but it gets a little tacky and
then it completely dries to like a
satiny matte finish gorgeous absolutely
gorgeous now for the rose gold shade
this is the one out of all four shades
the white to be cobalt ooh the mint and
then this one of course that has a
little bit of shimmer and glitter in it
it is not chunky glitter it really just
looks like your eyes like wet like when
you put it on it just looks like it's
very um how would I describe it looks
like a foiled eyeshadow if that makes
sense but again it has that gorgeous
gorgeous formulation where it blends
like a cream eyeshadow but locks into
place like a liner so how I applied this
today was with my obsessive compulsive
cosmetics the lip brush I just wanted
something really really flat and dense
to pack this onto my lid and it's just a
gorgeous shade I mean who doesn't love
rose gold so this is what it looks like
if you apply like a thin layer it's not
as opaque as the white shade the cobalt
shade and also the mint shade because
those three are more like the satiny
matte sort of finish whereas this one
has the shimmers in it so this is what
it looks like as you can see very foiled
and wet looking this is what it looks
like with one layer you can build it up
on your eye today I only have one layer
on my eyelid but you can build this up
and it will just be completely
completely opaque I find that these
actually layer very beautifully on top
of each other which I really really
enjoy and I feel like once they
completely dry down they're completely
set so you literally could go in with
the mint shade wait for it to completely
dry down and then go in with the rose
gold on top and you're not going to have
any problems whatsoever with layering
these liners / shadows so that is what
it looks like with two layers and then
again it has that gorgeous consistency
where you can blend it out and then it
will completely set in about a minute so
I mean I'm just in love with this
formulation I just can't talk about it
enough it's really really awesome and
beautiful I love the shimmery shade I
love the matte shade since these are
limited edition I am definitely going to
go ahead and pick up the white one and
the cobalt the cobalt is like a gorgeous
dark Navy shade and the wife would just
be fun for doing like a you know a
winged eyeliner on top or something like
that when I figure out how to do when
eyeliner but you know just you could
create so many different looks with
these um liners slash shadows I don't
know whether to call them a liner or
shadow I feel like they're a combination
of both I know they're technically a
liner but they're like a cream eyeshadow
as well so anyway if you're not into
these really really kind of springy semi
summery colors they are going to be
releasing or there is toxic of tart
releasing a black shade and also a brown
shade so if you see those definitely
pick those up right away I don't know if
those are going to be limited edition as
well but these ones are and I think
they're awesome so I'm going to highly
recommend picking up one of these or
picking up two or four I really really
enjoyed them and yeah like I said I will
leave a link below where you guys can
pick them up thank you so much for
joining me for this review and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
