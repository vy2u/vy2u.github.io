this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new Amazonian clay
12-hour knotty nudes collection from
Tarte cosmetics so Tarte cosmetics
recently released three new shades to
their knotty nudes collection if you are
unfamiliar with the shade that's been
around for a while it is called exposed
everybody loves exposed now I'm gonna go
ahead and tell you right away I did not
love exposed
I actually decluttered exposed and I did
pass it along to a friend who likes it a
whole lot more than I did it has nothing
to do with the actual formulation I love
the Amazonian clay formulation from
Tarte I own their 2014 holiday palette
to their 2015 holiday palette and quite
a few of their blush singles the reason
I personally didn't like expose was just
because I am fair complected with a cool
undertone and I never felt like it gave
enough Oh for like awakeness to my skin
it always just looked very mundane on my
cheeks and for me personally it just did
it work
so you may be thinking why did you pick
up three of the new shades the reason I
went ahead and did that was because on
the Tarte comm website they looked very
very different in tone and I was very
very excited to try them out I'm gonna
tell you right away a lot of these I may
do them out of the three look very very
similar to each other and I want to say
right away if you are looking for
something that is very similar in tone
to exposed these shades seduce and also
risque are going to be the ones that you
want so these two right here are
definitely the closest in tone to expose
now please keep in mind I did own expose
for over two years so I have plenty of
time to play with it and these are
definitely the two that I would say are
comparable to that color this shade
right here is called seduce this shade
right here is called risque risque have
more of a peachy nude to it and seduce
has more of a rosy nude I do have seduce
on my cheeks today it is my favorite out
of the bunch and I think I like it
because it definitely has more of that
pink quality to it and again I do have
cool undertones in my skin and I tend to
get more pink or red or rosy in the
cheeks
alright so these blushes are $26 a piece
which is the normal price of their
Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes it is the
identical formulation that you know and
love from their holiday palettes and
also from their blush singles if you are
unfamiliar
the Amazonian clay formulation I'll just
give you a quick little overview they
are really really nicely pressed they
are a little firm to the touch however
if you don't have tons and tons of kick
up when you put your actual brush in
there they blend really really nicely on
the skin and they have an incredibly
long wear time I would say that these
blushes honestly probably lasts 14 to 16
hours longer than 12 hours so I'm a big
fans of the band I'm a big fan of the
wear time on these I think they are
beautiful and I love the color selection
that Tarte does have even though these
are the not a nudes collection if you
guys are curious they do have tons and
tons of other shades and I will go ahead
and link below where you guys can find
the other shades and osco is also this
particular collection and I'm also going
to go ahead and link the ingredients
list for every single one of these
blushes down below in the description
bar as well so that you can double-check
and make sure that there are no
ingredients in there that are going to
irritate your skin
these are formulated without mineral
oils parabens fatal aids triskele in
sodium lauryl sulfate gluten and they
are dermatologist tested so if you would
like to use them as an eyeshadow which I
think one of them I'm probably going to
I'm probably going to use this one if
you guys are curious sensual which is my
least favorite out of the three I'm
probably going to use this as an
eyeshadow so you definitely can go ahead
and do that and for the most part I
think that tart is a really good brand
and these particular blushes the
Amazonian clay brand is made in the USA
I do not like when tarts goes off and
makes a lot of their pallets or a lot of
their products in China they are just
not good quality they're really crummy
actually to be completely honest but I'm
happy to say that the Amazonian clay
formulation is made here in the USA so
anyway I just wanted to say really
quickly the three shades that we have
here are all matte just like the
exposure
now when I say matte I don't mean flat
matte I always found that exposed had a
little bit of luminosity to it I'm not
saying shimmer or sparkle it just had a
bit of a satiny quality to it I find
that these three blushes have the same
thing going on they have a satiny
quality to them when you put them on the
cheeks they look absolutely absolutely
stunning so anyways like I said
formulation is absolutely beautiful
where time is incredible they are the
same formulation as the Amazonian clay
blushes that you know and love so I
don't have to
much to say about the formulation
pigmentation is on blend ability is on
everything is really really awesome my
one complaints with the packaging which
by the way they come in these little
plastic boxes like this not bins plastic
boxes like this tart is absolutely
cruelty free brands if you are curious
they have a little bunny here they says
cruelty free very very cute look as
little ears of it anyway they come in
these little boxes they do have the
ingredients on the back I love when they
always have ingredients on the backs
because sometimes you find pallets and
things like that but don't have the
ingredients even listed on their website
it's like Oh what the hell but anyway
like I said I will have all of the
ingredients for all three of these
blushes linked down below in the
description bar or just written out in
the description bar but the outer
packaging is just their normal packaging
for their 12-hour blushes my only
complaint with these they do have a nice
sized mirror by the way my only
complaint with these is that the pans
don't properly fit inside of the acrylic
packaging every single time I go like
this it starts to move in circles and
that's whether I put like my brush in or
my finger in I have always found that
Tarte blushes do that so this is like my
least favorite packaging out of all of
them I prefer obviously their holiday
palettes or their blush talents in
general because you get like so many
blushes and they're all in a row and
they're properly packed into the actual
palette but I've never felt like they're
single blushes are properly like safely
inside of the packaging so definitely be
careful if you are traveling I don't
know if it's because they're just not
glued in there properly but every single
one of them does turn in the packaging
so anyway let's go ahead and swatch
these out shall we so the first one I'm
going to swatch for you guys is sensual
and sensual is the one that definitely
has that golden nude undertone to it
it's a little too warm on my fair
complected skin not to say it's not
beautiful I would probably use this more
as they light bronzer on my skin but I
also am looking forward to using this as
an eyeshadow I think it would make it an
absolutely beautiful transition shade so
here is sensual and let me swatch it for
you guys I think if you do have a warm
undertone in your skin this is going to
be one that you really really want to
probably pick up because it's going to
be absolutely beautiful and you know
exposed definitely had
of that exposed to have more of like
that pinky undertone this one definitely
is just straight-up nude like you know
orange e apricot II sort of undertone
without being too in-your-face like
coral you know so here is the blush
swatched I did it build it up a little
bit just so you guys know let me build
it up a little more for you guys and I
do want to swatch all three of these
next to each other so that you can see
these similarities and the very very
subtle differences so there it is
swatched out on my hand you guys know
I'm shitty of doing swatches so don't
like monami alright and then the next
one that we are going to swatch is
seduce and this one looks like this very
very beautiful do you guys hear that
like when I go like this you can hear
that it's loose in the packaging I'm
like come on alright like I'm scared I'm
scared this thing's gonna fall out not
cool
have you guys notice that with your
Amazonian clay twelve-hour blushes too
because that always seems to happen so
there is seduce and again this is the
one I have on my cheeks today you can
definitely see the difference between
the golden sorta undertone and then the
more rosy undertone and then the last
one we have to swatch is risque and this
one has more of a again loose in there
this one has more of it I would classify
it as like a dusty rose undertone like
yeah probably a little more of a red
undertone than a pink undertone so there
are the three of them swatched as you
can see very very subtle color
differences we got really warm here a
little more cool toned and then a little
more neutral tone so I feel like there's
definitely a nude in this collection for
everyone exposed is a really really
great one if you do have a neutral or
warm undertone I think that this one at
the top which is sorry for giving these
names
sensual is great if you have a warm
undertone if you have a cool undertone
like me you're going to love seduce
which is the wand II in the middle and
then at the bottom we have risque and
erskine is nice because I feel like it
can go
either way it can go for people who have
cool undertones or warm undertones and I
do want to say that I do feel like most
of these blushes will show up on fare to
light to medium skin tones if you have a
really really deep complected like
chocolatey beautiful beautiful skin I
honestly don't know if these are going
to show up on you so that's just like
one of the downfalls now again they do
have so many of their you know Amazonian
clay formulations like their blushes and
I will link below where you guys can
check out the whole collection but I
feel like this nudes collection is
definitely not going to be for everyone
not you know compatible for every single
skin tone but if you do have fair too
light to medium skin I would say that
most of these are going to show up on
you so anyway those are the three
swatches I hope you guys enjoyed this
little review and swatches on this new
lives or collections thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow when I will be reviewing the
exposed highlight which is on my
cheekbone now and also the cream lip and
blush palette alright guys I'll see you
then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
