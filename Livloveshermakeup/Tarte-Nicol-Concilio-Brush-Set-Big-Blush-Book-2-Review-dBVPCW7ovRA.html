video is going to be a two-in-one review
on some new Tarte products one of them
is completely sold out right now so I'm
gonna talk about that second but the
first item we will be talking about is
the Tarte Turkish accent Nicole conceal
EO brush set does this is what it looks
like and then I will give you guys my
review and swatches on the charts big
blush 2 books so this is actually
completely sold out like I said there
have been a few little rumblings or
ramblings that this is coming back for
the holiday season but definitely listen
to my review before you go and actually
purchase this because I think it's just
okay it's not amazing it's not horrible
but it's just okay so anyway we're gonna
start with the review on the brush set
and I'm gonna try and get through these
as quickly as I can kind of make them as
precise as I can I'm still a little sick
you guys so I'm not feeling amazing but
I still wanted to give you guys my
thoughts on these products so these have
been out for I would say maybe two weeks
now this particular one sold out really
really fast this big blush book too and
this actually was like pre-order so you
could get I think they had maybe like 75
is that what Nicole said I think she
said there were like 75 little kits that
you could get I did order one of them
the official release date for the brush
set is actually not for another two days
so I thought it would be smart to go
ahead and review that one first and then
I will have time stamps down below if
you would like to skip ahead to the
actual blush book but anyway the Nicole
conceal EO brush set T is $39 which is
really amazing value you are getting six
limited edition brushes in here and the
official launch date is September 6 on
the Tarte comm website and possibly
Sephora I'm not quite sure and then
September 15th at Macy's so anyway this
is what the outer packaging looks like
you guys can see you have six gorgeous
brushes here I really like the box it's
super cute and then we have Nicole there
with her little bio I really like Nicole
Concilio I follow her I love her little
tutorials but she does on Instagram I
don't personally follow her on YouTube
but I do follow her on Instagram I think
she's just gorgeous and amazing at
makeup so I was super excited to pick
this up and also do you think that art
any time they come out with like a
holiday collection that has to do with
brushes they are a very good value
because like literally one of the
brushes in here told us not to be like
40 dollars almost a horror website so
you are getting a lot of stuff for your
money
but anyway inside you are getting six
limited-edition gold brushes the first
is called the air Buki foundation brush
which again I think that's like $35 just
by itself on the actual sephora.com
website this is what it looks like and
like I said they call it the beauty in
the buff air Buki foundation brush now
this is actually the foundation brush
that comes with the powder foundation
the Tarte Amazonian clay I believe it's
the full coverage powder foundation I
only liquid version but not the powder
up version but this is a really really
nice like bowl onto little kabuki brush
and it's very very dense and very very
soft
the second item you are getting is the
face framer powder brush and the face
framer powder brush looks like this I am
obsessed with this brush it is so silky
and so so so gorgeous like seriously I
cannot even describe to you how soft
this is it feels like a little baby but
or like a little bunny but it's a really
really gorgeous - I love the gold
ferrule or at the barrel um that they do
like during the holiday season I love
when they do the Gold's because I just
think it's super pretty but this is what
it looks like it's perfect for getting
underneath your eye to set in your under
eye powder you can contour with it you
can do really whatever the hell you want
with it it is an awesome awesome little
brush and then the next one we have is
these smooth moves i blending brush and
this is what that one looks like it's
really beautiful it's not like the
softest blending brush I've ever used
this one is actually a little more
crispy but it is quite nice because it's
very very long and thin and it's very
nice for kind of diffusing out the
crease if that makes sense so that is
what it looks like and then the next one
that you get is this set is called the
shade thrower contouring I brush and
that one is right here yes this is the
shade thrower which is a little bit of
like an angled I don't really love
brushes like this I don't really find a
lot of use for them unless I'm doing
some outer the kind of work I like to
just kind of stamp it on because it goes
in the ankle and you know can go right
into the crease and I also get on the
lid but this is what it looks like it's
a very very thin and again I feel like
the face brushes are a lot softer and
smoother than the eye brushes that the
eye brushes are still quite nice and
then we have the let's see here smudged
up shadow smudge brush and this is what
it looks like I really actually like
this one it's a very densely packed
again not super super soft and silky but
it's really easy to get underneath the
lower lash line with this so that
the smudger brush and that the last
verse that we have in here is the
fangirl fan brush which is so cute yeah
this is what it looks like this is
extremely soft and silky which is really
interesting because I have the stroke of
midnight set I believe that was what it
was called
last year tart release the stroke of
midnight brush set during the holidays
with the same sort of packaging and let
me tell you this stippling brush is like
crispy as heck I was gonna say as but
now I feel like I can't say that on
YouTube because of their new realtor
regulations but anyway it's super super
super kind of crispy this is so much
softer so I really notice a big
difference between like last year's
holiday brush collection and at this
particular collection I feel like this
just like oh my god and even last year I
was like oh it's okay it's a good brush
but this one is so so so soft so really
really enjoy this stippling brush and I
do want to say this particular brush
right here at the what is this one
called the face framer brush so much
softer and smoother than the one that
came in the set for the holidays the
stroke of midnight which looks like this
this was kind of like a highlighter
brush I thought it was a very kind of
flimsy which it is it's really nice if
you want to do very light highlights but
honestly if this feels like horsehair
this one feels like silk like a little
baby but so anyway really really
enjoying this brush set overall you guys
I think it's a great value like I said
that air buffer foundation brush or for
the powder foundation this is like $35
on its own I think I'm pretty sure
that's how much it is so for you to get
this whole entire kit for $39 I totally
think it's worth it I really like
buffing in a liquid foundation with this
I really didn't think I would because
for some reason even though it's very
densely packed
I thought the product would just soak
into the actual bristles but it really
doesn't you can buff it in super super
super quickly and I will be using these
brushes this week I'm going to show them
and Shop and swatch my stash tomorrow so
if you're interested in seeing these in
action I will be filming look at the
week on Saturday and I'll show you guys
how I like to use these but really
really nice for buffing foundation in it
you can even stipple on powder really
really enjoy this this is probably my
favorite brush in the actual set second
favorite is definitely this brush right
here like I said it's just so smooth and
nice and you really can blend anything
with this if you just want to dust a
little bit of powder on I really like it
for setting underneath my eye area I
think it's great for that if you really
want to kind of blood
out your contour it's just really
beautiful brush and I have nothing like
this in my collection I have a lot a lot
a lot of brushes but nothing quite like
this it almost looks like it's angled
but it's not because it's like towards
the bottom it's a little more dense and
then it just gets nice and fluffy
towards the top but it's totally totally
soft and it's not flimsy at all kind of
like that holiday one from last year
this one was like super flimsy as you
guys can see this one has a little bit
of give to it and it's just so silky and
it's gorgeous so I really really really
enjoy that one as well but in life I
said the eye brushes are just okay
they're nothing like fantastic or super
super special in my opinion my favorite
one is definitely the smudger brush
because I like how long the actual
bristles are I feel like you really can
get underneath your lower lashline very
very nicely with this and especially if
you want to spray it down and kind of
like foil your lower lash line it's very
easy because it is still a very densely
packed so I really do enjoy that one out
of the eye brushes again it's not my
speed burns a little smudger brush but
it's still really good and then this one
is probably my least favorite this
little angled guy here like I said I
don't really use brushes like this
unless I'm working with a little bit of
like out or the kind of thing where I
literally will just stamp it on so that
you're getting the angled part into your
crease and then you're getting the flat
part onto the outer part of your lid but
for the most part I wouldn't say it's my
favorite it definitely is not the
softest brush I've ever felt and I feel
like the eye brushes are a lot more
crispy feeling than the actual face
brushes which was funny because they
tart stroke of midnight kit last year I
felt like the eye brushes were a lot
softer where's the face brushes were a
little more crispy so anyway not my
favorite but still really nice I have
not noticed any sort of shedding when
I've used these so I think that's really
awesome as well and then here we have
that blending brush like I said pretty
darn good I like that it's very very um
it gives and I know that sounds weird
but when you're using a blending brush
sometimes it's really nice to just kind
of have one that's very very dusty and
kind of floppy just to get like the
upper part of your crease blend it out
so it's very nice if you do like to kind
of diffuse your crease I don't spend too
much time blending my eyeshadow but I do
think it's nice but I want to put a
little extra work and you can just go
back and forth or you can do circular
motions and then I really do like this
fan brush I feel like it's dense enough
to the point where it does pick up
enough highlight and you can dust it on
really nicely but you can still buff it
into the skin so
dense enough to buff it in but you're
still getting that pretty light touch
from a fan brush if that makes sense so
overall I would say I would definitely
go ahead and pick this kit up for $39
what is that I would definitely go ahead
and pick this kid up for $39 when it
does release on September 6th you're
just getting a lot of good length good
value here you're really you really are
this is a made in China I do want to say
that the big blush book too is also made
in China and you guys know how I feel
about the makeup that is made over in
China with the Tarte to brand in general
it's not that it's horrible it's just
that it's possible it's animal tested we
don't really know where everything is
coming from and you feel like you're
getting a great value when you're really
not but for the brushes I really do
actually think you're getting a great
value so I give that two thumbs up
and by the way it comes with the most
adorable tissue wrapping it says Nicole
can see Leo with little lips and then
tart I kept this because I really like
the color alright so for that I would
give five stars absolutely even though
it still is made in China and I don't
necessarily love everything that is made
in China which by the way a little
disclaimer people are always like oh
you're so racist first thing that's mean
in China it's crap no that's not what
I'm saying I'm saying that a lot of the
tarts holiday collections that they do
make in China are crap especially the
makeup but the brushes seem to be pretty
darn good all right so let's move on to
the charts big a blush book too this is
what the actual outer packaging looks
like I love this so colorful and cute
this was a limited edition it is $60
like I said it may be coming back so if
you're interested after watching this
review maybe you want to pick it up you
are getting eight new full-size blushes
which is why like I was like holy
like I need to get my hands on this
immediately because eight full-size
blushes for $60 is amazing it's amazing
and now like I said I did find out that
this is made in China their first big
blush book was actually made in the USA
and from what I have seen that that
looks like it was much better quality
than this I'm not in love with this but
I also don't hate it to the point where
I'm like oh my god but let me tell you
I've had a lot better just feel like
I've had a lot of better blush palettes
from Tarte than this one the tortoise
one is much better even their holiday
palettes which I know like their holiday
blush palettes which I know are
sometimes made in China I still feel
like are better than this so
I don't really know what's going on with
this particular palette I think the
actual colors are beautiful there
definitely do pible if you guys would
like me to do a duping video using this
particular palette let me know but I
feel like you definitely could do pout
these colors from the drugstore they
remind me a lot of the Milani rose
powder blushes the feel and the texture
of these particular ones now but this is
what the outer packaging looks like and
a lot of people are complaining about
the packaging because it just kind of
flips open like that obviously it's huge
you guys can see it but I think the
reason why it's made out of foam like
this is because tart is starting to get
into this whole thing where you can
actually take out your blush pans and
they have this new little pallet
magnetic palette sold at Sephora that
you can go ahead and you just pop these
into so I think the reason why it is
made of like that spongy material is so
that you can basically easily put things
in and out and I think that they kind of
knew that this isn't necessarily the
most travel friendly thing ever I mean
it's very chunky and kind of weird it
doesn't have a magnetic closure so I
think that they were thinking that you
would just pop these out and go ahead
and put them in a different palette so
I'm not gonna spend too much time
complaining about the packaging because
I think that's what they meant to do but
I do love the colors I do love this
whole thing going on here it says
hashtag the blush Authority on the back
and I do just want to say I know you're
I am ranting about the China maid thing
again it does say that this is cruelty
free which was interesting because
normally when products are made in China
they do usually have two animal tests so
I did spot that at the bottom and I
remember ranting on snapchat saying that
these weren't cruelty free but it looks
like this particular one is so that's
great my only issue with Tarte is that
they really claim to be this wonderful
brand that's like ophthalmologist tested
and there is no parabens no this no that
well when you're making things overseas
and you're basically pain literally it
probably made it would probably cost
them $15 to make this palette I'm sorry
I probably did you know they basically
don't get to have all those claims
anymore so I noticed that usually on the
back of Tarte packaging they'll say
ophthalmologist tested paraben free
silicone free all those kind of stuff
all it says is its cruelty free so I
just wanted to touch on that I feel like
I should say that because Tarte really
does claim to be this wonderful
all-natural brand and it's like well
when you make your products over in a
facility where sometimes they do have to
animal tests and they do put more
chemicals into it I you know I don't
know it just kind of makes me think
differently of the brain
so anyway here is what it looks like on
the inside I'm gonna hold it up like
this like I said this packaging isn't
amazing but I think that you know they
knew what they were doing they really
thought that you would kind of take
these out and d-pod them so you are
getting all matte blushes in here except
for the middle shade which is right here
that one gets called breathless it's
kind of like a beautiful it could be
like a highlight or a bronzer or you
know or a blush depending on what your
skin tone is I personally just like to
use it as a blush topper it's quite
pretty and yeah I mean the colors in
here are very pretty I'm not gonna be
sitting here saying oh I don't like the
colors I don't like this I don't like
that
I love the Amazonian clay formulation
from Tarte I think it's one of the best
blush formulations in my opinion I do
prefer my what is it - face - love
flushed 16 our blush formulation but
this probably comes in second now I will
say this is different than what I am
used to like I said I have China made
palettes from their holiday collections
from last year that are better than this
I have their tortoise which is made
there a tortoise blush palette which was
made here which I think is better than
this I don't know quite what's going on
with this but this formulation is
different in my opinion so if this does
come back for the holiday season just
keep that in mind I noticed that when I
put my brush in here or when I actually
swatch it out I'm getting a lot of
freaking kick up and that is so strange
for a Tarte Amazonian clay blush one of
the things that I like about a Tarte
Amazonian clay blush is that I get like
no like powder kick up no fallout
nothing like that they're very very
firmly pressed not to the point where
you like you touch it and you're like oh
my god it's so hard and you get like
hardpan but they are a little more
firmly packed and firmly pressed in
there and I never get like kick up and
stuff and I'm just amazed by how much
powder I probably pick up I get every
single time I use one of these today I
am wearing the shade dreamy which is
that beautiful beautiful color right
there like I said again the colors are
absolutely gorgeous I feel like Tarte
knows how to do blushes they do very
very neutral blushes I do feel like you
could probably do about a lot of these
colors if you do have some of the Tarte
holiday blush palettes or even just any
of their blush palettes and again I will
do a dupe video if you guys are
interested but I just noticed this
formulation is not the same I'm used to
having the Amazonian clay formulation on
my cheeks having it stay on for hours
for hours compared like right next to
the actual two-faced blushes these stay
on almost as long so I'm used to these
stain on for a very long
I don't find the best the case with this
particular formulation and a lot of
people are saying formulations exactly
the same I did look at the ingredients
list I stock tiny little differences
nothing too extreme but tiny little
differences and I don't know I just give
you guys my opinion they could be like
literally almost the identical formula
you know like what they're usually are
what they usually are but I mean in
general I just I don't know I don't know
what to tell you guys I noticed that
they don't stay on my cheeks as long I
noticed that that they have a lot of
powdery kick up and they're just not
what I'm used to when it comes to an
Amazonian clay blush formula so I'm not
gonna spend too much time ranting about
that I could go on for hours and hours
and hours but anyway let me go ahead and
show you guys some swatches like I said
these colors are absolutely beautiful I
feel like Tarte knows how to do blush
colors sometimes they do find that Tarte
can be a little more of a boring brand
when it comes to their color selection
you know what I mean like they don't
really go outside the box but when it
comes to their blushes they're great so
the first shape we have here is dreamy
which is a beautiful beautiful color I
feel like if you have fair skin you
would love this it's kind of like a rose
color with a little bit of a mob
undertone so there is the shade dreamy
the next one we have is the shade
thrilled and thrilled as a beautiful
kind of neutral color it sort of reminds
me of there what is it called there is
seduce blush I believe it's called but
this one has definitely a little more of
like a nudie undertone than a mob
undertone so there is the shade thrilled
the next one we have is lively and this
one reminds me a lot of the shade
I believe joy from their Tartus palette
it's just a nice like hot coral color
again you guys can see these are very
pigmented I'm not talking about
pigmentation I'm just saying they don't
last on the cheeks as long for me and
also you know there's a lot of powder
and kick up like a lot and the next one
we have is soulful which is a light kind
of cool toned pink color very very
pretty so there is soulful the next one
we have here is called quirky quirky is
nice I like this color this is different
I haven't seen a lot of colors like this
from Tarte it's kind of like a peachy
nude color but it's got a little bit of
like a rose undertone and I don't know
if you guys can see when I actually do
it like that but they're definitely like
there's tons of little powder chunks
everywhere and I'm so not
used to that when it comes to tart
blushes like that's weird so there is
the shade quirky the next one we have is
perky and perky actually you know what
no this is the one that reminds me of
the one from the TARDIS the TARDIS blush
palette there it is very very pretty I
mean look at the color selection really
really gorgeous like I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna say that it's not but just in
general I feel like you know formula is
not saying and then we have that middle
shade which is really a little more
powdery and I think it's just because
it's not completely matte there it is
and that one is called breathless and
that's the one that can be used as a
highlight as a bronzer as whatever the
hell you want depending on you know what
your skin tone is actually like you know
erase that one and then the last shade
that we have here is called feisty and
feisty is really pretty as well it's
kind of like a nude and it's interesting
because it's like a nude but it has like
a apricot II sort of undertone so there
it is so absolutely gorgeous they're
very very pretty I'm not gonna sit here
and say these aren't like really ugly
blush colors they're very pretty blush
colors but all I'm saying is that this
is not the formulation that I am used to
I'm not totally crazy about it I will
keep it I'm not in love with it but I
don't hate it I do think you're getting
a lot of product in here again this
probably cost them $15 to make so you
may be thinking oh eight full-size
blushes that's amazing but you know at
the end of the day it probably didn't
cost them that much to make this palette
but yeah I mean I guess I would just say
if you are obsessed with the Tarte
Amazonian clay formulation and you're
expecting these to be identical to what
you're used to they're not at least my
palette isn't so it is still a good
blush palette I do like the colors I
would I am going to go ahead and put
these into probably a Z palette and yeah
I just don't have too much to say about
it I hope I'm not coming off as a
negative Nancy I totally don't mean to I
know sometimes when I rant about a
product people are like oh you're so
you're so rude and why do you hate this
product I'm not saying I hate it I'm
just saying it's not what I'm used to so
yeah anyway I hope this review and
swatches video was helpful for you guys
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you tomorrow for shop and
swatch my stash bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
