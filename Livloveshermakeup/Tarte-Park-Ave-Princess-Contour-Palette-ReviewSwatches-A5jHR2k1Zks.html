have a review of the Tarte Park app
princess contour palette for you guys
today it looks like this I purchased
mine for I believe 34 dollars at the
alte store I got it at the checkout
counter they had a lorac eyeshadow
palette and the Tarte contour palette up
there just kind of you know showing
different products basically at the
checkout and it comes in this nice
little packaging like this it's gold and
it says park park at princess and gold
right there and tart and it opens really
nicely nothing um nothing too you know
crazy I I mean I really think that this
does snap shut very very well so it's
not like it's magnetic or it's gonna
come loose when you're traveling comes
with this nice big mirror very very nice
and inside you get a bronzer a blush and
a highlight and the bronzer is
completely matched the blush is
completely matte and the highlight is
highly shimmery I'm wearing the
highlights and the blush today as you
guys can see the highlight is really
really gorgeous it's like this nice
light silvery gold with gold sparkles in
it I do have its washed right here it
doesn't really show up too well in
swatches but on the face it's really
nice to have it underneath my brow inner
corners I have it right here on my cheek
bone my chin and down my nose I really
do like the highlight I think it's
really beautiful
next to that you get and oh by the way
the highlight color is called champagne
gold and next to that you get that
gorgeous cool toned mauve blush and that
is called posh I have posh swatched
right there I think it's really really
beautiful um it did take a little bit to
build it up honestly I was most excited
about the blush and I was a little
disappointed that the blush was actually
the one that was the least pigmented out
of all three in the palette so um I
think it's beautiful and it does swatch
the way it's shown in the palette but um
you know it just took a little too much
to build up honestly and even on my
cheeks
I went probably two or three times and
that's really not something I'm used to
with Tarte blushes usually
like the Amazonian clay blushes I made
those just go on really in one swipe so
I guess I was a little disappointed when
it comes to the blush now when it comes
to the bronzer um it I love it that one
right there is called parkette princess
which is you know the typical um I think
their best-selling bronzer it's gorgeous
it's matte it's right here swatch that
was just with one finger swipe it is
highly highly pigmented I'm not actually
wearing it today but I can tell you I've
very fair skin and it looks absolutely
gorgeous on fair skin so I will show you
guys that palette up close again as you
can see really really buttery beautiful
creamy you know the only thing that
shimmery or you know hi lady in here is
the actual highlight which is the
champagne gold so again the highlight
color is called champagne gold the pink
color which is the blush is called posh
and par cap princess is the bronzer and
I would say um you know what was that
going to say you know I'm a little
disappointed I like the packaging I like
that it really is nice it clicks
together I'm a little disappointed that
the actual names of the products are not
like ketched on here I really don't like
when they don't do that um and they
don't even happen on the back of the
palette the back of the palette just
says Park a princess contour palette and
um yeah it's a little annoying um I
would like to have you know that name
etched in there so if I'm doing a
tutorial or something I can tell you
guys exactly what it is
I actually memorize these because the
little plastic sheets that came with it
had the names on it but I don't keep
that little plastic sheet because it
falls out every single time I open it up
so anyway that's kind of my complaint so
overall I do like this I'm not quite
sure if it was completely worth the $34
honestly because I rarely wear bronzer
but I love this bronzer and I definitely
could see myself wearing this like on
the apples of my cheeks
I don't contour that often um but I
could see myself using this as well as a
contour because it is completely matte
the blush like I said I was the most
excited about the blush I was a little
upset that it didn't swatches
beautifully and it didn't go on as
beautifully as
I had hoped I'd hoped there would be
more pigmentation and for the highlight
I think it's gorgeous it really is
beautiful um it is a little rough but it
just it doesn't feel as smooth and
creamy as the actual bronzer or the
blush so that's kind of a you know
whatever kind of thing but um
overall I do like it I will obviously
use this um I'm not quite sure like if I
ran out of this or someone stole it or
something I actually don't think I would
repurchase but um that is my thoughts my
review and some swatches for you guys on
the Tarte Park a princess contour
palette I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and I'll see you in my next video
