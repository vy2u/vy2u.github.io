channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day I am here to give you guys
a demo on a product that I reviewed
yesterday it is the new torch of
rainforest of the sea aqua sealer I did
a coal review on this yesterday and I
will link that video down below in the
description bar if you are more
interested in seen how its washes out or
just like having basic knowledge on the
products where I purchased it how long
it wears all that kind of stuff I will
link that down in the description bar if
you are interested but I thought I would
go ahead and do a demo for you guys they
did ask in yesterday's video if you were
interested in seeing a demo on this
products and a lot of you said yes so
that is what we are doing today the
shade that I have is number fair or the
shade is called fair it's number one and
I'm going to go ahead and demo this for
you guys as well as use the brush that
came with it so anyway I just want to
say really quickly all that I have on my
face right now is the covergirl plus al
a CC cream this is the tone rehab
foundation in 1:05 ivory I just have two
pumps of this all over my face and I
applied that with my fingers I don't
have any primer on so I'm going to apply
this concealer and I want to focus it on
areas where I'm having small little
breakouts and you sort of acne scarring
along my jawline and then I'm gonna put
it underneath my eyes as well so you
guys can see like I said I will be using
the brush that came with this product I
purchased mine on QVC so it came with
this lovely little brush and I will be
demoing it with this brush however I
have applied this product with a Beauty
Blender and it applies really really
beautifully as well so if for some
reason you just get the concealer but
not the brush just so you know it
applies really nicely if you use your
fingers and also a Beauty Blender so
let's just get right into it I'm gonna
go ahead and shake this up really nicely
because it is one of those liquidy kind
of water like consistencies and I am
just going to tap this on the areas that
I need to cover so I'm going to put this
right there where I have a little pimple
right here I have a little pimple and
then I am going to go ahead and put it
underneath my eyes like this bring it
down to my nose area a lot of product
comes out at once I notice with this
which I don't really like and the
applicator is so big it's hard to kind
of do like the little triangle but this
is good enough you guys will see I'm
going to get a little more product the
scent of this
kind of interesting I don't know if I
mentioned that in the review yesterday
but kind of smells like pink but anyway
and I got to feel like I'm painting my
face
but anyway I'm putting this here and
then I'm gonna put a little on my
eyelids as well and put a little bit
right here where I have some acne
scarring just a tiny bit yeah let's go
ahead and blend this out so I'm going to
take the larger side of the brush
they're both like densely packed um like
they have lots of hairs in there if that
makes sense so both of them are very
very densely packed each side is that
I'm going to take the fluffier side or
the bigger side and I'm going to blend
underneath my eyes and on my eyelids in
a circular motion and this is my
favorite way to apply this concealer you
can also do like this kind of motion
where you're just kind of blending it
into your skin but I really liked kind
of buffing it in because I feel like I
get a really nice even application when
I do that and I did talk about in
yesterday's video for the review I was
saying that it is definitely one of
those concealers that you can build up
and I said in the video I was like you
can do two or three maybe even four
layers underneath your eye and that's
really just for like dramatic if you
like to wear a lot of makeup I
personally like to wear a lot of makeup
so I just want to show you guys that you
can get like a nice even amount of
coverage in just one application um but
I just wanted to talk about that a
little bit because I had one of my
subscribers Claudia and she was like oh
my gosh you need three or four layers
like what it's not that a concealer is
so expensive I don't want to run out of
it super quickly so no you definitely
don't need three or four layers but you
can build it up that's what I should
have said in that video but anyway so
I'm just kind of doing little emotions
like this where I'm kind of blending it
and then I am doing circular motions and
I just like the way that that blends in
underneath the eye area I'll take a
little down my nose right there and then
a little on my chin as well but overall
I think the brush is really nice I like
this side a lot if this side is a little
scratchy so I don't like to use it
underneath my eye area but I really like
the bigger side so I'm just gonna make
sure all of that is properly blended and
that is just one even layer underneath
my eyes I'll leave
five hours sleep last night so I feel
like this is a true demo on whether or
not this will cover dark circles so it
really really brightens the skin up
nicely and I like the way it looks so
now I'm going to take these shorter side
of the brush right here and what I like
to do is what I'm covering my pimples or
if I'm covering acne scarring I'd like
to just stipple it on there because I
really want to keep the coverage if that
makes sense like I really want to keep
the coverage of the concealer it's not a
full coverage concealer I would say it's
light it's a light coverage concealer
but what I like about it is that it's so
skin like and it really does cover
nicely I will build up a little bit on
those areas so I'm going to go ahead and
do that quickly just because I feel like
acne marks acne scarring requires a
little more concealing than my eye area
so I'm just going to tack that on there
a little bit more so I can really show
you guys what I do and like I said if
this does take a little longer if you're
just going to be tapping it in like this
however what I like is that it really
really keeps the coverage consistent and
so this little shorter side is nice
because it really really stiffles that
product on there and then you can switch
over to the bigger side and kind of buff
out the edges to make sure that there
are no harsh lines and then I feel like
it does cover acne scarring pretty
nicely and I think it looks good so
let's do the other side kind of
stippling and then switching the brush
over and buffing out the harsh lines or
edges and then when it comes to pimples
I have two little active breakouts on my
forehead like they hold pimples and what
I like to do with this is use the small
side again and just stipple that on
there because I really definitely
definitely definitely with pimples want
to keep that coverage I don't want to
blend it in too much I will blend out
the edges but right where the actual
pimple is I want to get as much product
on there as possible so let's do that
first I let it kind of sit for a second
kind of set and then I'll flip it over
and then blend the edges with the softer
bigger side just like that and then what
I have noticed with this concealer is
that it really really does build
beautifully on the skin
I said you can go underneath your eye
area as many times as you want I'm going
for a more natural look today for work
so I'm not going to build it up anymore
underneath my eyes but I feel like four
five hours of sleep this did cover
pretty darn well and I like that it
looks very skin-like
so what I will recommend is going ahead
and setting this product in I always set
my foundations and my concealers in
anyway because I do have combination
skin but I do notice that this is
concealer we're kind of sink into your
skin and not emphasize I'm not going to
say it emphasizes fine lines or anything
like that because it really doesn't but
it just starts to disappear throughout
the day if you do not set it so I'm
going to go ahead and set it with my ELF
tone correcting powder in cool this is
what it looks like and I am going to be
taking my eight cosmetics of Buki
buffing brush they came in the Holiday
Collection and I'm just going to swirl
that in there and I'm going to set my
entire face I'm just stippling that on
putting it down my neck and then setting
my forehead as well so I feel like when
you do set this product it actually
lasts a very long time I'm talking like
nine to ten hours and I know that
because I've worn it to work a couple of
times and it lasted that long so it's
really really fantastic I really do
enjoy the product again if you would
like to see a full review on it I will
link that down in the description bar
and yeah that is the demo on the new
tard to rainforest of these sea aqua
sealer I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you for joining me and I'll
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
