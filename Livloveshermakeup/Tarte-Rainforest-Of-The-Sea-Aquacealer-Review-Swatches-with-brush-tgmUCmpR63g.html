thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day this
video is going to be a review on the new
Tarte rainforest of the sea aqua sealer
I recently purchased this on the QVC
comm website for $29.50 the shipping and
handling is $3 and this is exclusive to
QVC calm right now however you will be
able to get this I believe this is going
to be Sephora exclusive I have no idea
when it's going to release part has not
let anybody know about that yet but it
is released on QVC right now it will
link below where you guys can pick it up
if you are interested I'm sure Tarte
will also have this on their website at
some point because a lot of their spring
collection is starting to release now so
this is the first product that has
released from their 2016 spring
collection and I was really really
excited to get my hands on it so it
comes in a little box like this and then
you also get a dual ended brush that
comes with this product let me read a
little bit about what it says on the QVC
comm website for you guys really quickly
so you can kind of get a better
understanding sorry I just kick the
camera a better understanding of what
this product is all about so it says
this is a luxuriously lightweight full
coverage concealing serum that is
infused with tartes rainforest of the
sea complex and includes a customized
double-ended brush for a flawless
application it is good for anybody who
is looking to mask the appearance of
imperfections and it says the luxurious
lightweight concealer is formulated with
pigments suspended in the deep
conditioning serum and water to deliver
the coverage you desire formulated with
charts rainforest of the sea complex it
offers full buildable coverage to mask
the appearance of dark circles blemishes
redness and other imperfections with a
custom applicator for targeted
application and it says how to use with
the targeted applicator apply small
amount of concealer to the area are
trying to cover use the need of blended
concealer brush to buff and blend into
your skin until the perfect level of
seamless coverage is achieved it is
obviously from Tarte and you get a 0.3
for fluid ounce rainforest of the seat
aqua sealer you also get the double
ended concealer brush and yeah so
basically I was very very excited for
this product just because there have
been so many serum and water-based
products that are coming out lately
like the Abeka aqua luminous foundation
let's see here laura mercier recently
came out with something similar candle
glow foundation Stila recently came out
with a serum foundation and support even
has their own serum foundation so this
is a very popular concept right now
anything that's water based or serum
based is really really very very popular
I think it's lovely to have on your skin
these are usually very lightweight
products and they do offer a nice amount
of coverage without being cakey on the
skin so anyway this is what the little
box looks like this is the aqua sealer
box and this is what it looks like it's
beautiful definitely reminds me of a sea
so it's got purple at the bottom going
up into a blue ombre and it says in your
shade whatever shade you picked up at
the top and let me tell you guys really
quickly how many shades there are there
are one two three four five six so I got
the lightest shade which is called fair
they also have light they have light
medium medium tan and deep and I am
quite happy with the shade range that I
made the shade range I'm happy with this
shade that I picked which is fair I feel
like it is a really really nice color
for me it's tends to lean a little bit
on the pink side which I personally
don't like with my concealers I would
rather have it lean a little more on the
yellow side especially if I'm using it
underneath my eyes but it seems to blend
and work for my skin I am wearing it
right now on my eyes underneath my eyes
on any kind of acne scarring on along my
jawline and then I have a little pimple
up here that I have it on and you guys
can probably see that it doesn't
completely cover pimples but it really
does brighten underneath the eye area
and it is somewhat camouflaging the look
of my acne scarring along my jaw line
so let me said this is what the album
packaging looks like for that and then
this is what the packaging looks like
for the brush so I was really really
excited about the brush especially
because I feel like this is like a QVC
special I'm not quite sure if Tarte is
going to be selling these together when
they start selling them on the Sephora
website or also wherever it's going to
be releasing - or when they start
selling it on their website I'm not
quite sure if this is going to be
included with the Aqua sealer or if it's
something you will have to purchase
separately so I thought for 30 dollars
it was a really really great deal to get
the actual concealer with the brush this
is what the double-ended brush looks
like I made sure that I washed it before
doing this video
but you gave one site that is really
really fluffy and I have to say both of
these are really nicely like densely
packed they have a lot of bristles in
there and you get one site that's a
little shorter and I like it it's a
little stiff like it feels a little
sharp underneath the eye area I
preferred this side underneath the eye
area however what I like the shorter
side for is just to stipple this
concealer onto any acne scarring I have
or put it on top of any sort of active
breakout or pimple that I have so
overall I think the brush is quite nice
I am happy with it I think it's
absolutely beautiful that ombre of the
gold going into the purple I think
that's absolutely lovely but you know I
feel like I still would have purchased
the concealer even if it didn't come
with the brush because the concealer
really is awesome so this is what the
actual bottle looks like for the
concealer it's beautiful it is one of
those little glass bottles and of course
I love the little lid part here it's got
the purple and the gold and it says card
to reinforce of the sea it says at the
bottom your shade and then it also says
to shake well because these are serum
based products or water based products
you really want to make sure that you
shake well so when you open it up I
first when I first open this I pulled
really hard and there was product that
went fine okay when flying on the back
of the wall it was pretty gross because
let me show you guys really quickly this
is what the actual applicator looks like
it is absolutely huge it's like a huge
deal foot applicator and it just kind of
feels like it's really really tight in
there and when you pull it up it almost
just goes flying at you so I didn't
really love that I feel like the
applicator is just really really chunky
and honestly maybe not super super
sanitary but the actual product in here
is absolutely beautiful so I'm gonna go
ahead and swatch this on the back of my
hand so you guys can see this is the
consistency of the actual aqua sealer
it's beautiful as you can see the color
is a little actually it's not picking up
completely true to color on screen it
looks like it's a little more yellow
tone but when I phones it in is a little
more pink base but I don't mind because
it's so blendable it's so workable it's
so easy to use and I feel it it gives a
beautiful amount of coverage it's
definitely a lightweight coverage but
you can build it up you can build up two
to three layers and definitely get like
a full coverage look underneath the eyes
I like to take it all the way down to my
nose
and up to my cheekbones I don't feel
like it covers pimples super super well
I've been active breakout there and I
don't feel like it covered that very
well but I do feel like it covered my
hyperpigmentation pretty well and I feel
like underneath the eyes it's gorgeous
because it doesn't crease it doesn't
make you know any crevices or fine lines
that you have underneath your eyes it
doesn't emphasize them it's really
really beautiful I think if you have dry
skin you would really like this it is a
very very hydrating beautiful formula
and I feel like if you get a nice amount
of product in here like I said the
little doe foot applicator definitely is
not my favorite but I think the shade
match and the fact that you can wear
this underneath your eyes with how it's
settling into fine lines or getting
weird looking is awesome so I would say
my favorite way to use this foundation
for sure is underneath the eyes I just
don't really think it covers pimples
that well and it is okay with acne
scarring but it's not the best so that's
definitely my favorite way to wear this
concealer if you guys would like me to
do a demo on this product please let me
know below and I can make a demo for you
guys tomorrow
but I would say 2 to 3 layers of this
product underneath my eyes is probably
my favorite way to use it I will blend
it in with this side of the brush which
is the bigger one the fluffier one and I
just go in circular motions and I feel
like that blends it beautifully into the
skin I don't get any sort of streaking
or weird lines and I think it's great I
will take the shorter side like I said
and just kind of stipple it onto areas
that maybe I have texture or like a
pimple popping up and I feel like that
keeps the coverage without blending it
away so overall I think the formulation
is fantastic I would say the wear time
on this is a very very strong if you set
it with a powder it doesn't start to
crease like I said underneath my eyes I
don't notice it creases around my mouth
area either I do bring that concealer
pretty darn low and I don't feel like it
creases around this area either which is
great it really is a beautiful
lightweight consistency I love that you
can build up the coverage and I just
think that it looks absolutely skin like
and flawless on the skin so overall I
think this is definitely an a class I
would definitely pick this product up
QVC like I said you can get it with the
brush right now for $30 which i think is
a great deal I have no idea if Tarte is
going to sell these separately when they
do release on their website or Sephora
or also wherever I
no idea they will sell them separately
or together but overall I think this is
a fantastic concealer and I'm very very
happy with it
where time is really nice like I said if
you set it with a powder I would say it
will last a good 9 to 10 hours if you
don't set it with a powder I would say
about half the time because it is that
kind of serum liquidy water like formula
and it won't start to break up I don't
want to say it's gonna break up but it
will just start to kind of disappear or
sink into the skin so oh we're all
beautiful I love the coverage I love
that you can build it up to your desired
like opaqueness and I think it's a
fantastic product so thanks so much for
joining
