video is going to be a review and
swatches on the all new tarts rainforest
of the sea eyes shadow palette I
purchased this for $34 on the tarte calm
website i will link below where you guys
can pick it up if you were interested it
is available right now on the Sephora
calm website but only for VIP and VIP
rouge members it is a sephora exclusive
and this is also a limited edition
palette so if you want to get your hands
on it
I recommend game your hands on it right
now before it sells out completely like
I said it is $34 and you will be able to
get it online no matter who you are on
February 29th and in stores on March
14th so let me go ahead and read a
little bit about what the product is
supposed to be like it is a
limited-edition palette featuring eight
creamy everyday eyeshadows it says
define and defend lids from everyday
aggressors with this eyeshadow palette
introducing plush shades in a velvet
formula they're powered by tarts
rainforest of the sea complex formulated
to hydrate and balance lids with a
creamy powder that is never drying or
chalky each of the pigmented blendable
shades is a blend of liner lid crease
and highlight shadows in wearable mattes
and metallics to define and contour your
eyes it includes a step-by-step guide to
take your look from peachy bronze to a
sea inspired evening eye this palette
contains eight 0.5 ounce eyes shadows in
the shade mermaid which is ain't gold
seashell which is a pink wave which is a
slight shade abyss which is a dark brown
reef which is a copper shade starfish
which is a bronze Cove which is a tan
shade sand which is an ivory it also
includes a step-by-step guide pamphlet
and it is formulated without parabens
mineral oil fatal eights Tris : sodium
lauryl sulfate gluten and it is
dermatologist tested this is what the
outer packaging looks like it is a deep
purple going into a blue ombre effect
with gold print and on the back you can
see what's what it is formulated without
it was not in there and then you have
this little ingredients list which is
pretty darn small so beautiful beautiful
packaging this is what the outer
packaging looks like and if you are
familiar with the tart like round palate
this is actually past the size so I was
kind of surprised when I got it actually
I was like wow that's half the size of
the typical round palettes like the what
is it rainforest of the 9th pallet or
whatever it's called or the Coral Cove
pallet whatever it was I have those and
those are much bigger than this so this
is really small and compact it fits
right in the palm of my hand
really really beautiful cover I love
that it looks like a beautiful kind of
like mural and it's just a gorgeous you
know
like purple and blue color so you open
it up it does have a nice level class
that goes all the way shut you open it
up you have a beautiful big mirror and
then these are the shades that you have
you guys these are amazing eye shadows
they are amazing they are like nothing
that Tarte has ever come out with they
are so pigmented they actually feel very
similar to a makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow if you know what the formula
is like on a makeup geek eyeshadow then
you're probably thinking oh my god I
need to get that right now they are so
creamy and buttery I have never
experienced this kind of formula from
Tarte before usually they have hit or
miss eyeshadow palettes for me um a lot
of the palettes that they do during the
Christmas time like or holiday palettes
basically a lot of their holiday
palettes are actually made in China and
I think that they're complete crap
whereas their other palettes like
they're tartlet palette that Artie's
palette things like that those are made
in the US and they're good quality so I
feel like Tarte tends to have hits and
misses when it comes to their palettes
not all of them are great but this is
great and this formulation this
rainforest of the sea formulation is
absolutely stunning they last on the
eyes pretty much all day long I have
been wearing mine for about I would say
12 hours now and I feel like they still
look really really good if you are
curious I am wearing the shade seashell
which is that light pink shade right
there and wearing that on my lid and
then I have reef which is that nice
copper shade in my crease I did put Cove
which is that nice kind of light
transition color I use that as my
transition color I put sand on my brow
bone and then I also went in with wave
which is that taupe color and I put that
on my lower lash line I will be doing an
eye shadow look with this particular
palette tomorrow so you guys can come
back to this video and I will
get in the description bar if you were
interested but overall I think this is
an absolutely fantastic palette I love
how compact it is I love it for travel I
love that you get a big mirror I think
it's absolutely fantastic I just want to
say it does come with a little pamphlet
pamphlet a little pamphlet that shows
you how to create certain looks if you
are interested which i think is great I
feel like two-face kind of started this
where they show you how to put together
certain looks but now every single brand
does it so they have a beach bum bronzed
look and then they also have the deep
sea dusk look which are both really
really beautiful and I would love to try
and recreate those I am NOT a
professional makeup artist and I know a
lot of people that pick up this palette
probably aren't either so I think it is
fun to have a little pamphlet to give
you ideas and things like that so anyway
like I said I think that the formulation
is absolutely fantastic you get a really
nice arrangement of colors in here from
cool tones to warm tones I do want to
show you guys really quickly a palette
that had released about a couple of
months ago that was very very nude and
natural as well with the lorac knew
necessities palette I just wanted to
show you guys really quickly because I
felt like this palette was a very very
light and tone and definitely wouldn't
work for every single skin tone and I
feel like this is a nude palette that
just doesn't work for everybody whereas
this new part one is a natural and nude
everyday palette that will work for
everyone you get some really gorgeous
shades in there most of them are
shimmery these two right here are the
matte shades matte shades I will say
because the formulation feels like a
makeup geek foiled eyeshadow they're not
completely matte I would call them a
debbie mat or a semi matte kind of
finish they look matte but if they feel
like they're shimmery if that makes
sense so it's hard to explain that you
guys will see when I do the swatches but
I think that tart really did this right
as far as a neutral palette that every
single skin tone could use I feel like
everybody could get use out of this
palette so I'm very very happy with it I
love the size I love the pigmentation I
love the formula of these eyeshadows I
really hope that Tarte it releases more
of these rainforest of the sea eye
shadow so let's just get right into the
swatches shall we so the first one I'm
going to swatch I guess is sand which is
that
kind of oops I'm showing the mirror
which is that light kind of creamy color
right there this is the one that I have
all over my lid all the way up to my
brow bone today I'll go ahead and swatch
it and this is the matte one but again
it just feels like there's a little bit
of a sheen in there it's almost
undetectable on the eye to be completely
honest but it's a beautiful cream color
alright the second one is called Cove
and this is the other matte one or Debby
matte one this is a beautiful kind of
sandy color it's a perfect transition
shade I really really love it and this
is what Cove looks like right there I
pick them on my wrists please excuse
believe excuse the wrists
the next one is called starfish which is
a beautiful kind of cool toned brown
shade and this is one of the shimmery
ones absolutely gorgeous super pigmented
beautiful oh you guys like the way that
these go on look at that look at that I
mean there's no skipping there's no
jumping it's just straight-up beautiful
pigment in color that is starfish and
this one right here is Cove the next one
is reef and this is a deep dark coppery
color it's got a little bit of like a
Reddy brown shape tone to it it's right
there
absolutely stunning put that right over
the eczema there it is look at those Wow
beautiful beautiful beautiful that one
is reef okay and then the next one is
called abyss and I love this it's
actually has like a bit of a purpley
undertone to it which i think is really
interesting that they threw that in
there because I feel like purple is kind
of like a neutral shade but the way that
they mix this purple with like the deep
chocolate brown it really really kind of
works so it's it's a nice way of wearing
purple without going purple so this is a
bisque again it's super super creamy and
beautiful look at that pigmentation Wow
really really stunning so you guys can
see it's like a chocolate brown sort of
base with a beautiful purple sort of
undertone in it gorgeous and then we
have weight which is what I have on my
lower lash line today it's a beautiful
taupe color and it is a shimmery shade
all of them are shimmery except the
first two that I showed you see
to end Cove I love this it kind of
reminds me of Max satin taupe I used to
have that eye shadow and I feel like
this one reminds me of that there it is
beautiful and then the next one we have
a seashell which is that pink color that
I have all over my lid it is so
beautiful it's the perfect lip color is
the perfect inner corner color it's just
a perfect color I don't know what to say
it's got a beautiful opalescent kind of
white undertone as well there it is it's
just absolutely stunning and the the
pigmentation on these is incredible and
then the last one we have is mermaid
which is a beautiful kind of gold dirty
gold almost I don't know there's a
little bit of green in here but you can
barely tell I would say it's a Goldy
light brown shade and there it is so
those are all the swatches of this
palette I love it I love it for travel I
think it's an absolutely perfect size
perfect price wonderful wonderful
formulation this new formulation from
Tarte is absolutely spectacular if you
like to makeup geek foiled eyeshadows
you would love this so I'm very very
happy with this if you have any
questions about this palette let me know
down below and I will answer your
questions and yeah I will see you guys
in tomorrow's videos thank you so much
