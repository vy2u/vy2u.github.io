this video I have a review and swatches
free bags review that came out weird a
review and swatches for you guys on the
new tarts limited edition kiss and blush
cream cheek and lip palette so obviously
this is a blush palette and a lip
palette combined into one it is limited
edition so if you do like what you see
here today in this review then I would
go ahead and pick it up ASAP I did
purchase it for $42 on the Tarte comm
website there have not been any talks
about where this is going to be
available but since it is part of the
rainforest of the sea collection I'm
guessing that at some point this is
going to be available on the sephora.com
website as of right now which is June
14th I have no idea if anybody has said
that it will be available on these
support com website but because it is
part of the rainforest of the sea
collection I'm guessing that it will be
so first of all on it the actual chart
um website nowhere does it say that it
is part of the rainforest at the C
collection so when I saw this box when I
was opening everything up I was actually
quite surprised the actual charge of
rainforest of the C collection released
about a month or two ago so I thought
that was kind of interested interesting
that maybe they had held off on this
particular one but this is what the
outer packaging looks like you have the
blue going into the purple ombré with
the gold writing here this is formulated
without parabens mineral oil fatal aids
Tris : sodium lauryl sulfate gluten and
it is dermatologist tested I'm going to
link down below in the description bar
all of the ingredients that are listed
back here so that you guys can have
those and you can check out to make sure
that nothing is going to irritate your
skin and this is made in the USA if you
are curious so the actual packaging is
so cute I actually matched my little
pink tank top and my pink lip and my
pink eyeshadow today to match this so
this is the outer packaging how cute is
that you have just a pink base with Sam
dollars on the front which is so super
super cute you turn it around you have a
mirrored effect with a little sticker
that does show you the names of the
actual shades in here you open it up and
you do have a large mirror and then here
are the sheets that you get so you are
getting an
arrangement of kind of I would say
neutral shades in here you're getting a
bright pink you're getting a cool tone
pink you're getting a dark mommy color
and then you are getting a highlight
right in the middle so that you can put
that on your Cupid's bow or you can use
it to actually highlight on your
cheekbone really really nice I love the
actual packaging of this palette it is
the same size as some of their eyeshadow
palettes like the coral crush or the
rainforest after dark stain sort of
compact little thing going on here it is
also the same exact sort of packaging as
the Tarte distort artiste contour
palette and also the color correcting
palette that they released with the
rainforest of the sea collection so I
think these are awesome because you can
just toss them in your purse you can
pack them in your luggage and you can
kind of just go on your trip and you
have like a lip palette a contour
palette a color correcting palette like
what else do you really need besides
your foundation and mascara so anyway I
really do like the outer packaging I
just think that pink is so pretty it
makes me so happy to look at and anyway
I am actually quite happy with this
particular palette I did not think I did
not go in having very high hopes if that
makes sense I did order it and it was
$42 and I know that it is a little more
difficult to return products if you
order from the Tarte comm website but I
was thinking oh if I don't use it I can
just go ahead and declutter it well I
have to say I am loving this as a lip
palette this is definitely going to be
my go-to lip palettes I do have two
other lip pellets I have the Bobbi Brown
University lip palette and also one from
Sephora but I find that those really
really start to melt and they get kind
of gross and gunky every time I travel
with them I feel like the formulation on
these is going to stay really really
nice and hopefully I won't have any
issues with them melting so I think I
will take these along with me when I
travel for July 4th but anyway these are
a two-in-one products so you're
basically you know able to use them as a
cream blush or a lip products I have
high hopes for a lip product and I am
not liking them as a blush whatsoever
now I did not think that I would I will
say I do prefer powder blushes I do have
combo to oily skin so cream blushes
don't tend to last very long on my
cheeks first of all I just feel like
they really just kind of glide over my
face and just glide right off like they
just melt right off
and then second of all I do like to wear
a lot of powder on my face because I
have oily / combo skin and I find that
anytime I put a cream product on top of
a powder product it just breaks up on my
skin so I do not like these four blushes
I will say that right away if you do
have oily or combo skin I don't think
you're going to like them either I have
tried this with putting on a foundation
and then just putting this product on it
was gone within two hours I tried doing
just my base putting on my powder
putting these on top it broke up like
you know the actual foundation and the
powder and I was actually wearing a very
very light BB cream so I was surprised
that it broke up that much and I just
thought you know it was breaking up
because of the powder but again I need
the powder because I am oily and then I
also tried it how did I try it oh I put
on my foundation then I put this on and
then I tried powdering that without so a
disaster so overall I don't think the
same powered power I was missing powder
the staying power on these is that
fantastic it is on the lips however I
have been wearing this for about an hour
and a half now and nothing is looking
too bad on my lips right now I do have
this shade down here on right now and
it's called pact and it's just a
beautiful beautiful color I really
really like the shade of it and I yeah I
haven't had any issues with this I think
it's really nice it is not transfer
proof it definitely you know gets off on
your hand if you do like kiss something
or someone or I don't know if you're a
flutist like me and you're practicing
this is probably gonna get on your sleep
head joint but for the most part the
staying power on these is really really
nice is the only shade in here that
obviously has a little bit of shimmer is
that highlight shade in the middle but I
think it's really pretty if you do want
to use it as a lip product you go over
the areas where you want to plump up
your lips like the middle part of your
lip here and at the top or if you want
to use it like down your Cupid's bow I
did try using that cream highlight to
kind of highlight my face today and I
did go over it with this particular
highlight which is the exposed highlight
and I just felt like this particular
cream highlight wasn't really doing
anything on my skin it was a little oily
a little thin in consistency and it was
just kind of like the one product in the
palette
my opinion that really doesn't do much
and it's funny because in the tart test
or tart taste contour palette I also
found that the middle shade which was
the highlighting shade also didn't do
much so not very pigmented and not my
favorite little cream highlight or
highlight in general but yeah I really
do like these as lip products I think
they have a really nice consistency to
them they dry down to sort of like a
satiny texture or a satiny finish I feel
like on my lips right now it doesn't
look too matte I don't feel like it's
over emphasizing any fine lines or
wrinkles on my lips it feels very
comfortable and if you've been watching
my channel for a while you know that I
am a snob when it comes to lip products
because I am Oh flutist
so anyway I'm really liking the color
combination here I like that you get you
know five shades here with that nice
little highlighter in the middle if you
do have dry or aging skin I think you
could get away with using these as
blushes maybe they would adhere to your
skin a little better but for me
personally they just slid right off no
matter what I did and I am definitely
not going to be using them as blushes
but yeah let's go ahead and starts
watching this baby shall we so I am
going to start with this shade right
here which is one of my favorites it is
a beautiful berry color and it's called
saucy and I just love that they threw
this color in here because it's
absolutely stunning this actually
reminds me a lot of the urban decay a
revolution lipstick in the shade is the
calls I think I have it right here
actually in a shade shame it looks very
similar it's got like that deep berry
tone to it it looks a lot darker in the
tube but it reminds me a lot of that and
that is one of my all-time favorite like
fall lip colors so here is what it looks
like as you can see it has a really nice
consistency to it the only shade in the
palette that I found that add like a
little bit of a flimsy or kind of
see-through not so a little bit trick of
Arran see basically or had sort of like
an oily formulation what's that
highlight shade all of the other
products are very creamy they have a
little bit of a sticky or tacky base
which again not something that I'm a fan
of putting on my cheeks
but for my lips I think it's great
because they really do adhere to you
know the area that you put them on so
there is the shades saucy the next shade
that we are going to swatch is called
butterflies and butterflies is a
beautiful nude color with a little more
of a peachy undertone and I think it's
really really beautiful and I did just
wipe off my finger you guys can see that
these actually really sustain so I guess
that's nice if you do have dry skin you
want to use them as the blush they will
stain but for me they just they just
went right off my cheeks so here is the
shade of butterflies just that beautiful
sort of peachy nude color and if you
guys are curious
like I said they kind of look very
glossy in the actual palette and
obviously when you're putting them on
they look glossy but when you do blend
them out I'm going to blend out
butterflies quickly so you guys can see
when you do blend them out on your
cheeks or on your lips they kind of dry
down to this sort of satiny texture so
it doesn't look super glossy like that
it's going to look a little more on the
matte side if that makes sense
alright so the next shade in the palette
that we are going to swatch is of this
one right here wait this one like wait a
minute this one right here and this is
called tickled which is a beautiful
again sort of nude color but has more of
a rose undertone I love this shade I had
a little bit of this was it this shade
mixed together with another lip color
yesterday I can't remember but it was
it's a beautiful one really really
gorgeous so there is tickled obviously
you can see that it has a more of a rose
undertone and let's blend that out so
you can see what it would kind of look
like on the cheeks again like if they
don't want a very very opaque you know
the formulation is nice I can see why
this would go on nicely on to the cheeks
but for the most part it just doesn't
have you know the wear time or the
staying power that I wanted by the way
if you guys are curious I did apply
these for my cheeks with the elf small
stipple brush every single time that I
tried I just feel like that's a really
nice way to pick up products and go
right onto the apples of your cheeks and
then today for my lips I just
applied it with my finger so there is
that shade blended out really really
beautiful I love that sort of rosy
undertone we're gonna switch to the
other hand because I'm starting to get
stained already all right the next shade
that we are gonna go ahead and swatch is
this one right here which is another
sort of nude shade and this is called
smooch and I think this is a beautiful
beautiful color it reminds me a little
bit of this one right here which again
is butterflies but this one has more of
a gray undertone sort of like that Kylie
Jenner your lips but better trend so I
really like this the beautiful color so
there is smooch and let's go ahead and
blend it as you can see what it would
sort of look like on the cheeks very
very opaque there is smooch and then we
have this shade that I'm wearing on my
lips today which is that cool toned pink
and I really love that Tarte threw that
in there because personally I find that
Tarte really kind of stays in their
little neutral comfort zone and I
totally expected this blush slash you
know lip palette to have just a lot of
like neutral shades and for the most
part they do have neutral shades but
they threw in that dark like bold lip
color and then this beautiful cool toned
pink right here which is called pact and
again that is what is on my lips and I
love this shade it's just a perfect like
Barbie pink great color I really really
love that oops
you know what let's do it on the other
hand so here is the shade pact very very
very pretty and let me blend that one
out for you guys you can see there is
Peck blended out on the back of my hand
so really really pretty color I like
this one it goes on very very opaque and
what I like about these two is that you
definitely can build up the color like
let me take a little more here and I can
really build that up into like a hot
almost fuchsia color as you guys can see
so I really like that they are quite
buildable also so if you do want to mix
and match colors like I did
yesterday you definitely can go ahead
and do that all right and then the last
shade that we are going to swatch in
here is the middle shade which is that
highlight shade and it is called cloud 9
and I just don't think it's that great
it honestly feels a little oily and you
can kind of see that it's a little more
oily and it's not just because I have
shimmer in it it's just it's just lately
it's not a whole lot of opacity there
there is the shade you can see it but
it's not it's not like wham-bam in your
face if that makes sense it barely
showed up on my skin today when I
applied it now this little highlight on
the other hand which I will link the
review for this one down below the
exposed highlight this baby really shows
up but that little cream highlight not
so much so those are my thoughts my
reviews and swatches on this new little
palette I think it is really really
beautiful I'm very happy to have it as a
lip palette again for me personally it
doesn't work as a blush palette but I
think it could work as a blush palette
if you do have dry skin or aging skin
you could try it still if you have combo
or oily if you have a technique that you
really like to use to apply cream blush
please go ahead and try let me know how
you do it down below so that I can try
your little technique out as well but
overall I think it's beautiful
I love the way that it wears I like the
creamy the creaminess the opacity of the
colors and I really like the color
selection so I highly recommend checking
this little guy out beautiful packaging
and yeah really really nice little
product so I hope you guys enjoyed this
review when swatches thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
