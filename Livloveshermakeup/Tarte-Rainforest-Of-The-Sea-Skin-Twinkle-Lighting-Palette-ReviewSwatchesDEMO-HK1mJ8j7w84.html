thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be a review swatches
and also a demo on the new tarte
high-performance natural naturals
rainforest of the sea skin twinkle
lighting palette I purchased this Omni
tart calm website for $42 you can also
get it on the Sephora calm website now
only if you are VIP or VIP Rouge and it
is a Sephora exclusive so you can only
get it on the chart calm website or
Sephora like I said it is 42 dollars it
will be available for everyone to
purchase online on February 29th and in
store on March 14th this is a
highlighting trio palette with three
Universal shades for strobing and
perfecting it says brighten up your
complexion with a radiant twinkle using
this sleek strobing and highlighting
palette featuring a versatile trio of
silky perfecting powders you can filter
and reflect light for a soft focus glow
the mineral filtered light shade is your
go-to setting powder in a universally
mattes and shade the brightens and
corrects any darkness underneath the
eyes paired with two full-sized luminous
perfecting powders those are your
highlighters
they're perfect for illuminating the
contours of the face for a natural
looking glow that flatters all skin
tones inside of this palette you gets
the perfecting powder and filtered light
and that is point two zero ounces and
then you get sunlight and moonlight
which are the two high layers and you
get zero point eight five ounces of
those this is formulated without
parabens mineral oil failing to
crystalline sodium lauryl sulfate gluten
and it is dermatologist tested this is
what the outer packaging looks like you
got the beautiful dark purple ombré
going into the blue with the gold print
and then you have all of the ingredients
on the back and the actual palette looks
like this absolutely stunning you guys
so it does click close which is nice
because you know that your powders
aren't going anywhere but beautiful it
looks like the sea rainforest of the sea
just a gorgeous kind of like wave like
really really gorgeous packaging it is
mirrored on the back and then it does
show you your shades you have sunlight
which is a champagne gold color filtered
light which i think is the most useless
in this college but that is the setting
powder for your under eye area and then
you have moonlight which is a rosy pearl
shade and this is just an absolutely
absolute
gorgeous palette you open it up you have
a nice big mirror you do get this little
um this little layout here or what does
this call this little thing you know
that shows the names of like the product
on there I personally don't use it but
that's okay anyway this is what it looks
like the rosy gold shade right here is
moonlight then you have filtered light
and then you have sunlight oh I'm sorry
sunlight so the rosy gold one like I
said it's moonlight filtered light is
that middle setting powder and then the
champagne II gold one is called sunlight
and I absolutely am loving this palette
you guys I did pick up another one for
my 5000 subscriber giveaway and the
reason I think this is worth it in the
long run is because you get so much
product for $42 you get so much
highlighting products the product in the
middle is absolutely useless I'm just
going to say that right away I just feel
like they could have done something more
with this palette I feel like they could
have added in maybe a beautiful kind of
opalescent white shade in the middle or
something like that or even just a cream
highlight this is supposed to be a
setting powder take a listen up listen
to this you guys hear that
sandpaper sandpaper and I just really
really swatch that and look at this
absolutely nothing I mean it's like
there's nothing it just builds up on the
sides and then the pigmentation is drip
pigmentation is horrible this is what it
looks like when it is swatched I know
it's supposed to be this kind of like
ambient lighting sort of powder where it
just glides on underneath the eye area
but I hate it I don't use it whatsoever
in this palette the only reason I think
that this palette is worth it is because
the highlighting shades are absolutely
absolutely incredible and beautiful but
that middle shade I just wish they'd
have done a cream highlight and then put
like a little lid over it so that I
wouldn't interfere with the powder
products I just felt like that was so
useless I have no idea what they were
thinking even just a translucent powder
would have been better this kind of is
like a translucent powder but it just
feels so rough I mean I cannot believe
the texture on this you guys I am just
like what I just can't believe it I
think it's absolutely useless I am not
really going to be reaching for it but
the reason I do think it is worth it in
the end
because of the highlighting powders the
highlighting powders are absolutely
buttery and creamy and beautiful this
one right here is sunlight which is that
beautiful kind of yellow opalescent
champagne gold sort of color kind of
reminds me of Becca's champagne pop I'll
go ahead and swatch that for you guys so
you can see really really beautiful I
love the way it catches the light my
favorite way to wear these and I will
show you guys when I do the demo is to
actually layer them so I will go in with
the rose gold shade and then do this one
on top there beautiful mix together this
one right here is moon light and again
super super buttery they feel nothing
like the middle shade they feel nothing
like the middle shade the middle shade
is the worst one so yeah I mean it's not
even a highlight you know kind of
strange but anyway there is a mood light
and then there is sunlight and the two
of them mixed together it makes a
beautiful beautiful color just beautiful
let me mix them together quickly on my
hand so you can see that is the sort of
color that you get it almost looks like
it's wet on your skin it's absolutely
beautiful it's like literally like
dripping and gold absolutely absolutely
beautiful I would say the wear time on
these is really really fantastic I mean
the powder and not so much but the wear
time on the highlighters is absolutely
wonderful I have worn these all day
yesterday they just stay on they really
stick on like a tattoo especially if you
use like a setting spray the one that I
was using yesterday was the wet and wild
photo focus setting spray so it doesn't
matter it doesn't have to be like the
urban decay one or anything like that
any sort of setting spray will do I
think it really really helps them to
stick on there even though they are
super super buttery and smooth they
still do stick to the skin relatively
well which i think is fantastic
I'm not wearing any of them today
because obviously I'm going to double
them for you guys but I think they're so
buttery they're so smooth I just don't
like that middle shade I just think it's
really really strange I do like the
color concept that they went with
something a little darker for those who
do have darker skin tones something a
little lighter for us pale girls and I
feel like they really really did a nice
job of catering for all different kind
of skin tones and of course you can mix
and match the shades if you want to as
well I will say when you dip your brush
in here a lot of powder comes up there
a lot of kick up but it's just so
buttery and slides and glides onto your
skin so nicely so I don't mind
whatsoever so I really like them I think
they wear an incredibly long time I'm
just not into that middle shade but
let's go ahead and get into the demo I
will be using my Sigma tapered
highlighter f-35 brush and I'm going to
go into that middle color first and I'm
going to set my under eye area I feel
like I'm blinding you guys it's just
with gorgeous packaging so I'm going to
tap into that and then I'm going to set
underneath my eye and I really just feel
like this does nothing it literally just
goes right up in the air and I might
know where to go hmm where'd it go
alright so that is like this literally
all I can really do to be completely
honest let me go ahead and pull my hair
back because I want to really be able to
show you guys what these highlighters
look like so anyway what I like to do
like I said is go into moonlight which
is that rose gold shade I'm going to go
in there tap off the excess and then I'm
going to put that on my chin download
the bridge of my nose and on my
cheekbones
little on the Cupid's bow
and I feel like these can be built up
really beautifully on the skin you can
see they are very pigmented and they
glide on really really nicely I don't
feel like they emphasize my pores
I do have bigger pores in this area but
I don't feel like they emphasize them
then I'm going to go into sunlight I'm
just going to tap into that one tap off
the excess and layer that on top I love
the way these two colors look together
like I said I think they're absolutely
beautiful this is really if you want
like a wham-bam highlight in your face
you do absolutely do not have to layer
both of them but I just wanted to show
you guys so you could see how all the
products actually look on the skin so
overall really happy with the palette
like I said I did pick one up for my
5000 subscriber giveaway and I think
it's worth it because of the
highlighting products in here so as you
guys can see I'm nice and glowy now I
just love the way it looks on the skin
very very luminous and do we looking it
doesn't look like there's chunks of
sparkle on your skin it doesn't settle
into any fine lines or pores it's
absolutely stunning on the skin so
overall really really impressed with
this rainforest at the sea skin twinkle
palette I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and a quick little demo on this
product and I feel so glowy now thanks
so much for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
