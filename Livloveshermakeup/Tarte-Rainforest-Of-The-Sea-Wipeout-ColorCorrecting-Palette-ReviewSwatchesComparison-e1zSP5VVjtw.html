channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a really
excellent fantastic day I am here to
give you five a review and also swatches
any comparison on the new Tarte
high-performance Naturals rainforest of
the sea wipeouts color correcting
palette quite a mouthful this is what
the outer packaging looks like and I did
purchase this for $45 zombie tort comma
website it is now available on the
Sephora calm website as well it is a vib
exclusive and it is also a Sephora
exclusive you will not be able to pick
this particular palette up anywhere
besides the tarte dot-com website and
also Sephora right now it is only
available for VIPs and vib Rouge but it
will be available for everyone starting
on February 29th online and in stores
March 14th so I was really really
excited to get my hands on this you guys
know I've been really into color
correcting lately so I did pick it up
and I am also going to do a little
comparison towards the end of this video
on this particular palette against the
Stila correct and perfect palette
because although I do feel like there
are a lot of color correctors that have
been coming out I feel like these two
are direct competitors because they come
in palette form so I will do a little
comparison for you guys as well at the
end of this video but let's just go
ahead and get started I am going to read
a little bit about what it says all me
sephora.com websites you guys can get a
better understanding of what this
product is supposed to be like and what
kind of claims it has so this is the
tarte rainforest of the sea wipeout
color correcting palette it is $45 like
i said it is an all-in-one palette to
correct discolorations contour and
brighten up the skin it says balance
correct and perfect your complexion as
you wipe out skin discolorations with
these powerful cream complexion
correctors this easy-to-use palette
features numbered shades and includes a
coordinating visual guide to make
professional technique to make the
professional technique of color
correction accessible to everyone it
features six color correcting shades
orange which counteracts darkness green
which neutralizes redness warmth which
sculpts contours and defines the skin
peach number one which camouflages light
to medium skin tone peach number two
which cama flight which camouflages
medium to deep ski
and then you have yellow which
highlights and brightens in the skin it
says these Universal shades work across
all skin tones to offset the appearance
of dark circles redness acne rosacea
while contouring and highlighting with a
creamy texture that helps minimize the
look of imperfections including pores
and fine lines in this particular
palette you get six point 11 ounces of
cream complexion correctors in orange
warmth green peach number one peach
number two and yellow so let me go ahead
and show you guys what the actual outer
packaging looks like I already gave you
a little preview but it is a beautiful
purple like dark purple color that goes
into an ombre beautiful sort of C color
which would make sense as it is the
rainforest of the sea palette so it's
really really beautiful it does have
gold print and when you turn it around
you can see they have a little diagram
here to show you how to color correct
which is great and it says it is
formulated without parabens mineral oil
fatal eights crystalline sodium lauryl
sulfate salt faked gluten and it is
dermatologist tested and then you do get
the list of ingredients on the back
right here which i think is great and it
does come with the little color
correcting pamphlet which shows you how
and where to put certain colors so you
have English on this side and then I
believe I have no idea what this
language is on the other side but you
could do different languages and here
you have the yellow shade and it tells
you that is used to brighten and
highlight the face you have a shade
number one which is the orange one which
helps counteract darkness you have shade
number two which is the green one which
helps neutralize redness shade number
three is the kind of contouring shade
which defines and sculpt the face and
then you have shade number four and five
which helps you camouflage and I really
like those shades because you can
actually mix them in with the other ones
to kind of like mix and match a sort of
color that you would want on your skin
so I think it is really nice that they
have this little pamphlet it can be
helpful for any anybody that is new to
color correcting and yeah let me show
you what the actual packaging looks like
so this is what it looks like it is the
exact same size and pretty much the same
exact packaging as the tortise contour
palette which did release this past fall
it's a beautiful beautiful palette and
it
the same exact size as you guys can see
and they have very similar packaging the
air both mirrored on the back and then
the only difference is that the turkeys
contour palette obviously has gold and
then says part East whereas this one has
the rainforest of the same pattern which
is really really cute
since it is rainforest of the sea so
when you open it up you can see you get
a beautiful nice sized mirror right
there and then this is what the actual
palette looks like it's beautiful you
have the mirrored glass sort of look on
the back and it is basically it looks
the exact same as the turkeys contour
palette when you open up the tortise 20
it looks like this as you can see and
then this one looks absolutely very very
similar obviously in my opinion so I
think it's kind of cool to have the two
of them because they look so similar and
they're really formulated not formulated
but they really kind of look the same if
that makes sense like the way that they
put together the packaging is pretty
much identical so I really like it I
think it's a very very pretty to look at
and you get a nice amount of product in
here so as you guys can probably see
they have shade number one here and then
you have number two it shows number
three four and five so you're kind of
supposed to work your way around the
palette I want to tell you guys how I
personally use these really really
quickly I will be doing a demo on this
product tomorrow so if you are not
subscribed to my channel you can come
back to this video tomorrow and it will
be linked in the description bar
but anyway so how I personally use these
is I started with number one which is
this shade right here which is the
orange color and it looks like this I'm
going to go ahead and swatch these for
you guys this is the one that I use
underneath my eyes to contract any sort
of blue tones and I will say really
quickly the formulation on this one and
the green shade are a little oily
they're a little they're a little share
compared to some of the other ones in
the palette I wouldn't say they're as
sheer is the ones in the Stila palette
like I said when I get to the comparison
I will make exact in Paris ins of them
but I will say that the green shade in
here the yellow shade and the orange
shade are a little thinner in
consistency to the creamy like kind of
peach shades and also the contouring
shade so anyway that's okay there's
still very very humectant and I feel
like they do blend underneath the eye
really really nicely so that is what I
like to do with the orange
the next shade is the red shade and I
like to use the red shade the next date
is the green shade and I like to use
this to counteract of redness so I will
use this on any active breakouts I have
in anywhere around my nose that I have
some redness it is a little more sheer
than some of the other correctors that
have come out like the Becca ones or
even the urban decay ones even though
the urban decay ones do you have a very
pastel like quality to them this one
still looks a little darker in the pan
than it actually comes off on your skin
so there it is swatched right there but
I do feel like it still does cover
redness breakouts and any sort of maybe
rashes or rosacea you have on your skin
I do think it covers it very very nicely
the next one we have here is number
three which is this beautiful creamy
contouring shade and I like to use this
too well contour my face you guys are
going to be able to see when I show you
really quickly how much creamier this is
then the other three it's just
absolutely beautiful and I feel like it
is a really really nice kind of a she
toned contour so I think it's gonna work
on a lot of skin tones it personally
works on my very fair skin and I was
pretty nervous because I was like first
of all I'm kind of scared of cream like
contour products and second of all I
just thought that was gonna be really
dark and muddy on my skin but
surprisingly it worked really really
well I am wearing it today I contoured
with it and put it all around the outer
perimeter of my face and I actually
think it looks really really beautiful
so I think the formulation on the
contouring shade is absolutely stunning
and I really really really actually love
that one alright the next one is four
and five and step four and five are kind
of similar they can almost be concealers
depending on what your skin tone is like
they are basically classified as a peach
shade and normally when you use a peach
shade you will use it on any areas that
you have hyperpigmentation or age spots
personally what I like to do with these
two shades is mix them together and let
me show you quickly the formulation very
very thick and creamy just like the
contouring shade but this is the two of
them they are really really nice you can
actually mix and match these depending
on how you want to use them if you want
to use them as an
bass or if you would like to use them to
go ahead and I don't know mixed with
like the orange chain to kind of create
your own peach day for hyperpigmentation
or whatever that's what I like about
this palette is that you can mix and
match everything and really kind of fit
it to your own skin tone so I feel like
they did a really really good job with
that but this formulation is exactly the
same as the contouring shade really
think really creamy and what I like to
use these for is mix them together and
go along the areas where I have
hyperpigmentation from acne scarring I
think their luxurious they're creamy and
they're very very easy to use with the
Beauty Blender and that is what I will
show you guys in the demo tomorrow and
then the last shade that you get in here
is the yellow one which is right here
and this is for brightening it has the
same sort of consistency as the orange
shade and also the green shade so it's
not as thick and creamy as the
contouring shade and the two peach
shades but it still is really really
nice and I like to use this underneath
my eye area I will kind of go so if I
put the orange one kind of on the inside
of my eye where I get really really blue
tones I will take the yellow one and put
this in the triangle to really really
brighten up my eye area so that is what
it looks like and again it's kind of
similar to the green one it's a lot more
sheer when you actually put it on the
skin which can be nice I think that
these pastels sort of correctors that
are coming out are easier to work with
so if you are new to contouring I think
you would actually probably really enjoy
this palette so that is what it looks
like and I really do think it brightens
up the under eye area nicely it doesn't
really take care of tons and tons of
dark circles but it will brighten if you
put it in the upside down a triangle so
overall I think the formulation is
really fantastic
I love the pigmentation I think these
are really really good
yours are just really really well
formulated in my opinion even though
these three right here at the green
shade the yellow shade and the orange
shade even though they are a little bit
thinner than the two peach sheets in the
contouring shades they still work and
they're easy to blend and they do what
they're supposed to do my favorite way
to apply these is with a damp Beauty
Blender and I like to wear them
underneath my foundation because I do
find that they will peak through if I
wear them on top of my foundation so
they're not similar to the urban decay
ones in that aspect the urban decay ones
are very very um the color correcting
fluids by the way they are a very very
pastel
so you can wear them on top of your
foundation but these ones are a little
darker so I would recommend wearing them
underneath again I will show you guys
that in the demo tomorrow but yeah I
think these are fantastic they do wear a
very very nice amount of time if you set
them in I do have combination skin I
don't notice that they start to break up
anywhere near my nose or on my chin or
anything like that I think they wear an
incredibly long time I think they're
absolutely beautiful and I love that
these peach shades you can mix and match
into the green shade or the orange shade
and kind of create your own color
I feel like Tarte really did a good job
with catering to everybody's skin tone
with this palette so overall I'm really
really happy with this one I want to
show you guys really really quickly a
quick little comparison next to the
Stila correct and perfect if you guys
are not familiar with this palette I did
do a review and swatches on it I will go
ahead and link that below as well as the
demo this is what it looks like you get
to powder products and then you get one
two three four five different cream
products my complaint with this
particular product was the fact that
they were very very oily the actual
cream products were very slippery very
oily I didn't think they worked very
well for my combination and slash oily
skin and I feel like this particular
palette is much better if you want
something that is travel friendly and
you want something that you can mix and
match and has definitely a creamier
consistency to it and will wear a longer
throughout the day I would go for the
Tarte one over the Stila one I just feel
like these didn't have very good stain
powder power powder they didn't have
very good staying power I felt like they
were very oily and the consistency I
felt like I had to build it up on my
skin whereas these are a lot creamier if
you still get the travel friendly
palette and I just think the formulation
is better on these ones so if you are
looking at the Stila palette or the
Tarte palette I would recommend getting
the Tarte one I am very very happy with
it I think it's great for travel
beautiful packaging beautiful
formulation and I love that they
included a contouring shade in there as
well so that is my review and swatches
on the new Tarte to reinforce of the sea
wipeout color correcting palette I hope
you enjoyed this video like I said I
will have a demo on this product going
up tomorrow and I will see you guys then
