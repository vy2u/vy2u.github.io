my channel today's video is going to be
a three-in-one comparison on the Tarte
rainforest of the sea eyeshadow palettes
Volume one two and three I'm going to
try and keep this as short and concise
as possible I did already go ahead and
press watch out the majority of these
shades for you guys so over here we do
have all you one over here we have
volume three because I know a lot of you
have been curious how these are similar
or not similar and then I will go ahead
and swatch out a few shades of volume
two I've talked about volume 1 and
volume 2 and a lot of videos before so
I'll either go ahead and link those down
below or throw them up in the cards if
you guys are interested to see more
swatches things like that I also do have
swatches on my Instagram of these
palettes so I'll go ahead and link those
down below I'll make a comment down
below in the comment section and pin it
to the top if you would like to see a
photos but anyway let's go ahead and
jump right into it all three of these
palettes do retail for $36 on these
sephora.com websites the first two were
listed as a limited edition like
recently I would say I feel like the
second one was listed as limited edition
for probably 4 or 5 months and then the
first one was listed as limited edition
for about a year they're saying that
this third one is limited edition but
limited edition my ass like come on
these are obviously all permanent so I
wouldn't like worry about it if you
really want the third one I feel like
it's going to be permanent I will be
doing that limited edition my ass video
for you guys soon by the way when we
move into the new apartment but yeah
basically they are limited edition as I
said and they are a really beautiful
formula I have been very much intrigued
by these particular eyeshadow palettes
ever since I tried the first one out so
although I feel like I have kind of been
dragging Tarte into face lately there
are still products from those lines that
I absolutely adore I know a lot of
people feel like I'm very negative about
those brands but it's just because
recently I have been noticing a huge
decrease in like the overall
presentation and the overall products
that they have been releasing they just
haven't been very good quality but I
will say this is a really nice formula
right here although they are a little
different palette to palette the actual
ingredients are similar they are listed
in different order but they are pretty
darn similar so anyway let's go ahead
and jump right into which we are going
to start with volume 1 this is what
volume 1 looks like if you guys are
curious these palettes do fit into
basically the palm of your hand you open
them up you do have a nice size
you're the kind of stands up on its own
and here is what ball you want it looks
like on the inside I'm going to try and
make sure I can kind of tilt this you
guys can see the true colors this is
obviously a very very like a mirrored
sort of packaging so I want to make sure
you guys get the right kind of colors
but anyway this is a beautiful neutral
palette just like every other dark
palette out there it pulls a lot of
purple undertones and it's very very
pretty in my opinion so that is what the
first one looks like the second volume
is definitely my personal favorite I
love the formula in here as well as the
color selection over here you can see
you have a lot of lots lots of kind of
like warmer tones but then right here
you get three different shades that you
are not going to get in the volume one
or volume three edition so let's see
here Riptide breezy and siren are
definitely my favorite to this
particular shade right here is so
freakin stunning and gorgeous worked
into the crease and outer via this
particular formula is a little more
firmly pressed it's definitely the best
out of all three in my opinion this is
the one I would recommend to those of
you with a deeper complexion and also
just to everyone in general because I
feel like this one is the standout it
has a nice color selection if you do
like more cool tones you're going to
love this palette really really
beautiful and on the front it does have
a little coral reef which i think is
adorable and now here is the new one so
we have a little like peacock sort of
feathering thing right here on the back
it is a mirrored gold you open it up
same size mirror and here are what these
shades look like so very very similar to
the first edition when you first look at
it in the pan but as you guys can see
with swatches it definitely is different
in the first edition so here is volume
one here is volume three these are a lot
lighter in tone although they are
similar and you may not be able to see
that much of a difference once you get
it on your eyes in my opinion these are
more highlighting kind of shades so I
feel like these are going to show up the
best for those of you with like a fair
to medium complexion it is a really
beautiful palette I am wearing both as
like highlights and eyeshadow today I'm
wearing this palette as eyeshadow and
highlight and I really really like its
but I will say I feel like this is
probably the sloppiest formula out of
all of them very very hard to actually
work on to the eyes but very very pretty
on the skin so this is like the true
kind of highlighting palette over here
so anyway let's go ahead and do like I
said the side by side swatches so here
is volume one as you guys can see lots
of beautiful kind of warmer
over here but still like a little bit of
like purpley undertones here you do get
two different kind of like satiny
matched sort of shades and then the rest
of them are foiled I will say between
all three of them all three of the
pallets I do feel like the majority of
the shades are this beautiful foiled
sort of appearance which is so
indifferent for tart it's a gorgeous
gorgeous formula I would say they feel
very dim at the cone like very very soft
and creamy the only thing I will say is
that this new formula I'm noticing a lot
more sparkle and glitter I am NOT a huge
fan of glitter in my eyeshadow I'm not a
huge fan of glitter in my highlight so
that is where I'm noticing that this one
is a little different hopefully you guys
can see when I bring you up a little
closer these do tend to emphasize just a
little bit of texture I mean even on my
arm right now you can see a little more
texture then when I show you the first
edition these are very foiled they go on
very very easily these are two swipes
swatches I have no primer on my arm
they go on it they glide on beautifully
absolutely stunning these guys just have
a little more texture to them they are a
little more glittery and you can
definitely see a little sparkle now I
think because they are marketing this as
an eyeshadow palette slash highlighter
palette I think what they were going for
is okay we want like a wham bam sort of
color so that you can actually wear it
on the cheeks it looks incredible as a
highlighting palette I am for sure
keeping all three of these palettes but
I will say this one right here I wish
they would have gone ahead and made this
third edition into an actual
highlighting palette just made it the
pan size is bigger and kept it as is
because it is gorgeous on the skin I
don't notice a lot of sparkle it does
not emphasize fine lines and texture or
anything like that on my skin I am
wearing this shade right here which is
called compass which is a soft gold as
my highlight today but practically every
single shade in here I can wear as a
highlight they only have one sort of
satiny or matte shade and it is this one
right here that makes a beautiful
transition on fair skin but I do worry
about this particular palette being
really good on the eyes for those of you
with like a medium to deeper complexion
if you have a medium complexion I feel
like a lot of these are going to blend
into your eye area but maybe they would
work for highlighting I mean I really
don't know I feel like overall they
could be pretty universal you just have
to pick whichever you no shades you're
most attracted to but overall I would
say I wish that they had made this into
an actual highlighting palette instead
of a shadow my biggest issue is that I
find I cannot work these into my crease
one of the things that I love the most
about the rainforests of the see volume
to eyeshadow palette is how beautifully
these work into the crease I told you
guys this one right here works
beautifully like I literally can work
this into the crease into the outer V no
problem whatsoever there is a little
swatch so you guys can see goes on super
foiled really really nice I get
absolutely no fallout I do they fall out
with the first volume I do get fall out
with the third volume like crazy on my
eyes so I just find it a little more
difficult if that makes sense now
because these do go on foiled I don't
feel the need to actually foil my
brushes what I mean by foiling is
actually spraying them down with some
water or setting spray before going in
so that you don't get any sort of
Fallout 2 underneath your eyes I said on
snapchat this morning I feel like it's
literally like a pile of dirt underneath
my eyes if I try and take these into my
crease now today with the volume 3 I did
go ahead and take the shade jewel which
is this nice kind of golden color took
that into my crease you probably can't
tell because as I was blending it it was
just blending away and copy right down
onto my cheek bone which was so
disappointing and then I went in with
the shade Malibu which is kind of like a
purpley brownish color put that in my
outer-v
again you probably can't see that much
definition cuz it just didn't work out
then I did take this one right here
which is heat wave one of my favorite
shades in here beautiful as a
highlighter beautiful to Pat onto the
lid
tap that onto the lid love the way it
looks and then I took the shade jewel
and I put it on my lower lash line and
it really stuck beautifully so you
really just want to use these little
guys right here if you're gonna use them
as eyeshadow I would recommend just
tapping them on you know to the lid and
things like that they are really really
hard to blend it to the crease really
really hard to blend up just in general
but they somehow work when you are using
them as highlighters now my other
complaint that I do kind of have with
this is the fact that obviously it's a
little difficult to get your
highlighting brush into this particular
palette I am wearing compass today like
I told you guys that soft kind of
opalescent bold shade and I had to
really kind of like scrunch my brush
together and pick it up and kind of put
it on I use any sort of tapered
highlighting brush from Luxy or Sigma I
feel like anything that is a little more
densely packed goes in really nicely and
picks those shades up beautifully so
overall I would say with volume 3 I
really do like it I just prefer it as a
highlighting palette let me tell you
guys really quickly what these shades
are in case you are curious so the top
one that we have here is T key
underneath it we do have heatwave which
is that beautiful pinky
and then we have Malibu and then we have
rays then we have compass and then we do
have jewel treasure and escape so
hopefully you guys can see all of those
like I said to swipe swatches they are
very very pretty but I do feel like they
are relatively different from this
palette over here and obviously and
these like smoky shades from volume to
completely completely different now I do
feel like all of these do have
overlapping shades no matter what they
are super super similar and close talk
about heatwave over here from the third
volume of that pinky shade very very
similar to the shade of seashell right
here which is from the Volume one
eyeshadow palette so they are slightly
similar but I do feel like you get more
depth you get more purpley and kind of
deeper tones that you can actually work
into the crease and into the outer V
with the first volume but the second
volume is still my favorite although
these shades over here are kind of
similar to the first and second volume
they're just so beautiful these like
deeper shades over here you just can't
beat them you really can't they go on
beautifully they blend beautifully
they're different it's something
completely out of tarts comfort zone so
hands down you guys still would
recommend volume to the most easiest to
work with you can use it on your eyes
you can use a few of these shades over
here definitely as highlights as well
this one right here which is called
pearl very pretty very very pigmented
let me go ahead and swatch that for you
guys goes on very foiled very very
gorgeously and as you can see up close
so there is pearl here's the volume of
three kind of see this is just a little
more chunky you know what I mean and I
just love something that's super foiled
that I can use on my eyes and cheeks I
love when I can double any sort of
product on my eyes and my cheeks if I
can put it on my lips if I can put it on
my nose if I can decorate my whole face
with it even better okay so overall um
yes I would still recommend volume to
the most I think this is the best
eyeshadow palette hands-down absolutely
beautiful really love the tones in there
seconds I would go with volume one I
just feel like it's really good formula
very very nice and soft and buttery I do
like that you do get those two kind of
satiny shades but for the most part
these shades over here with the purple
the depth kind of colors you can work
into the outer V you can work on the
lower lash line you can actually wear
these as eyeshadows volume 3 is just
giving me a little bit of weird vibes
over here because I'm like you're
beautiful as highlight I'm keeping you
for that but at the same time I'm having
a really hard time working these onto my
eyes so like I said volume 2 then volume
1 then
three they're all really good you guys
they're all really good okay don't get
me wrong
definitely go in-store swatch them out
see what you want but yeah I hope that
was helpful again here are the swatches
so over here we have some of the volume
to swatches right here is volume one all
eight shades and then over here is
volume three so they definitely are
different I know they look very very
similar in the pan I think because they
have such a mirrored finish to them
sometimes when you would turn them a
certain way they can look a little
darker but this is definitely like a
true highlighting palette very very
light tones in here great for those of
you with a fair to medium complexion a
volume 2 is going to work for everyone
because you have some deeper shades of
swilled work on deep skin tones on
medium skin tones light and fair and
then volume one is good too I feel like
this will work for a ferret light and a
medium of skin tone so I hope this was
somewhat helpful thank you for joining
me guys like I said I will have swatches
of all three palettes down below that
you can check out on my Instagram if you
are curious and yeah that's it I guess I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
