changed my hair a bit I did a box die
last night so my roots don't look as
incredibly horrible I will be
progressively going lighter and lighter
with my hair I hope you guys like it but
anyway I took care of those horrible
roots those are really bothering me
anyway today I'm going to be reviewing a
product you guys that I picked up from
Sephora calm it is the new Tarte
showstopper clay palette the box looks
like this really really cute kind of
like lizard or alligator print and the
actual palette looks like this again the
cover is kind of like that alligator
lizardy kind of skin print and on the
inside you get this gorgeous palette
look at it look at it so beautiful so
inside here you get a highlight a
bronzer you get a blush and you get six
shadows these are this palette is very
very similar to the other ones that tom
has come out with like the round ones
for example this one right here is the
coral crush palette I believe this was
out last year maybe the summer before
and it basically has the same concept
you get the blush the bronzer and the
six atto shades so I think this cover is
way cuter than this one this one's a
little plain and plain-jane little
boring but actually when you look at the
palette on the inside you can kind of
understand what they were going for this
is very much a neutral neutral palette
usually when tarte comes out with these
little round palettes they're usually
kind of bright and they have like a nice
fun poppy kind of shade in there the
only shade in here that really really
pops when you look at it is that blush
color so yeah that's what I'm seeing
this is much different than like I said
the coral crush palette or some of the
other ones that they've come out with
during the spring or summer months but
um I think it's awesome I think it's
great like who doesn't like a really
nice neutral look for the summertime
um I am wearing it today I am wearing
let's see here that darker shade this
shade right here in my crease this in my
crease that as a highlight and then I am
wearing the blush also um I just want to
tell you guys right away the only thing
that kind of bothers me about these
palettes is that it doesn't come with
the names on the thing you have to keep
this little sheet which I never do
because I hate that I hate when you open
the palette and it pops out
just I get so annoyed with that I don't
know if I'm the only one but um I will
let you guys know the names right now so
the blush is called Fame the bronzer is
Park a princess which they're very much
known for the highlight is champagne
pink and then you get um the colors here
you get showstopper copper this one is
go to the gold you're a natural steal
the scene rose to the top and did the
lights so I think that's nice if you're
doing like a tutorial on things like
that maybe I will try and keep this it's
just so annoying I hate this I just
don't like it I wish to think would
somehow maybe like I feel like there's a
room to like at you in the names you
know like right there I don't know maybe
they could think about it because they
also don't have that with the other you
know clay palettes that they have like
the coral crush one also I feel like
there's room and they didn't put the
name so that's kind of annoying but
that's okay
so this goes for $38 on the Sephora
website you can also get it on the tarts
com website I believe both below so you
guys can pick it up like I said it is
new for I think spring/summer collection
2015 what I love about it is just how
neutral it is this is not the kind of
palette you're seeing right now that's
coming out you're seeing really really
bright colors that are out right now
this is almost like on the verge of
being a fall palette if you took that
blush color out it's almost on the verge
of being a fall palette let me swatch a
few things for you guys quickly that's
the park at princess the highlight is
super creamy and super super pigmented
and then the blush is amazing you guys
look at that isn't that beautiful
and I'll swatch a few of these um just
don't have enough fingers now but
there's a few of the shadows really
really pretty
everything's super pigmented super
creamy tart is kind of known for that
you know they're known for having a
really nice formula when it comes to
their powder products kind of like
two-faced like most of the higher end
brands so I just wanted to show you guys
to in the Box it also came with this
little you know like little pamphlet on
how to do an eye look which is like kind
of taking after the whole two-faced
two-faced is really in
to showing you how to do a certain I
look for what I like about this is that
they actually use like realize like you
can tell that that person is actually
there like they it's not like an
animated I that's what I'm trying to say
um I feel like to face all of the ones
that they have are like an animated eye
and it's like yeah it looks perfect like
that but it's computer-generated so of
course it looks perfect but um this one
is real eyes so that's kind of cool they
have a workday look and they have
soirée so I do like that those are both
really pretty looks and I could see
myself attempting to recreate them so
let me read for you guys a little bit
about what it says on the support
website it says tart to showstopper clay
palette $38 a long wearing Amazonian
clay and infused eye and cheek palette
it says this chic palette includes a
liner with a lid crease and highlighter
I shades to play up your glamorous stare
from work to evening on the town looks
these form flattering eye and cheek
shades features six never-before-seen
shadows a full-size blush and
highlighter slash bronzer duo that's
perfect for creating camera-ready looks
infused with tarts iconic Amazonian clay
each fade-free blendable formula is
inspired by the glitz and glam of
Hollywood and is perfect for
camera-ready makeup looks it says it is
formulated without parabens and fat
alights fatal eight so I don't know how
to say that word and it says what else
you need to new know what this product
is Dermott dermatologist tested which is
awesome so it's really nice to note that
if you are sensitive to certain eye
products which you know a lot of people
are either face products this is
dermatologist tested so it should be
pretty good for you so like I said I am
wearing it on my eyes today it's so
natural it's so basic um I think the
blush is really like a standout in here
I mean I just love that color isn't it
beautiful it's really really pigmented I
have it on my cheeks I feel like it just
gives a really really nice glow and
flush to the cheeks and especially if
you are fair like I am um it really
really kind of brightens it up and just
looks really beautiful
perk up princess which is that like
bronzer it's just the one that I think
they're the most well-known for a tart
in my opinion it's just matte it's
medium toned it's
effect I can use it for contouring which
means a lot of different shades a lot of
different complexions like can use it
for contouring and I love that the
shadows have a mix of like satin kind of
glitter shades and to mattes so I'm
really really impressed with this
palette I love that they kind of went
out of the book and went for a really
really natural palette because there's
nothing more beautiful than in the
summertime they weren't a really like
natural I have some nice light color on
your cheeks I think that that's kind of
like the epitome of summer I think
people think of the summer as being like
really bright poppy shades and things
like that but Tarte really is showing
you that like you know you can wear this
to the beach you can you know wear this
when you want like a no makeup makeup
kind of look so these are really really
great shades I'm really really loving
this palette and um I like the inside of
the packaging I like the gold the gold
rim and everything don't let the outside
but I think that it's awesome you can
use this to travel it's got your cheek
products it's got your eye products what
more do you want in a palette anyway I
will link below where you guys can pick
this up like I said again it is $38 on
the square website and also on the tarte
dot-com website i will leave the links
below and i'll see you guys in my next
