thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
today I will be doing a review for you
guys on a new who I have this time to
take a little squint eos on a new brush
kit that recently launched from Sephora
this is the Tarte stroke of midnight
brush set and this is a $44 product it
comes in a really cute little box like
this and it is a hundred and fifty-six
dollar retail value so you're getting a
lot of stuff a lot of bang for your buck
basically and here you are getting five
limited edition full-size brushes so
four full-size brushes you know $44 it's
basically like I don't know like ten
dollars piece it's a really really
awesome really really good deal and the
reason that I picked this up I really
really wanted to try off the buffer
airbrushed finish foundation which is
one of them that is in here and I have
been wanting to try that forever it just
looked amazing so many people talked
about how great it is at buffing in
foundation and I just wanted to try it
forever and I think that that brush goes
for like what like 28 or 38 dollars by
itself so for you know like ten dollars
more or something you can basically get
four other full-size brushes in here so
I thought oh my gosh is the perfect
perfect reason to get this little set so
when I found it I wasn't really thinking
like oh you know I really hope that
stippling brush and you know concealer
brush everything's really good I was
really just thinking okay just want that
one I just want that you know air but
air buffer I think that's what they call
it what do they call it the buffer
airbrush finish foundation I'm looking
at the Sephora website over here on my
computer but overall that's just what I
really wanted I was really excited so
this is what the outer box looks like
and in here you get five limited edition
gold brushes so the ferrule is gold it's
really really cute very holiday asked in
here you get the buffer airbrush finish
foundation brush a concealer brush an
eyeshadow brush a complexion brush and a
fluffy Bluff blush brush fluffy blush
brush really hard to say that but anyway
like I said this is the outer packaging
and it's super super cute I put
everything back in here they my brushes
are dirty because I use them today but I
wanted to show you guys what I use them
for because some of them
not using for I'm not using them the way
that they suggest I guess you could say
it's but this is the little packaging
that it comes in really really cute I
have said already that the tart
packaging for this year I feel like it's
not super super like holiday ask if that
makes sense
I feel like if this was all gold it
would be much cuter but I really like
that it stands upright
and I do think the pattern is pretty it
just kind of reminds me of like a tribal
like summer prints I don't know
but overall really really cute this you
know you get this - for the 44 dollars
and then inside when you first get it
and I wrap them back up so you guys can
see you get the tissue wrapping that
says heart on it and it has the five
brushes inside here so let me read for
you guys very quickly what it says on
the actual Sephora website so I can give
you guys as much info as possible so it
says the Tarte stroke of midnight brush
set it is of 44 dollars and it is new
and limited edition you can really only
find it on the Sephora calm website I
have not found it elsewhere maybe on the
Tarte comm website I'm not sure but what
it is it's a seeking sequined brush box
filled with five full-size
limited-edition makeup brushes
it says buff primp and create a globe
print well I guess that crimp Bob crimp
and create a glow with this chic
collector set of high-end performance
tart application tools dress up your
vanity or give the gift of beauty tools
with this set encased in a sequined
collectors brush box with a foundation
concealer eyeshadow complexion and blush
brush each one has a glamorous gold
handle to celebrate the holidays and
this giftable brush box has extra room
for your beauty must-have so if you want
to carry extra stuff in there you can
and it says you can create a full face
for every festive occasion like I said
it has the buffer airbrush finish
foundation concealer brush eyeshadow
brush complexion brush wash brush and
then the sequin brush box formulated
without parabens and petal AIDS so um
yeah it just kind of gives you an
overview of what's in there again I
think the case is really really cute it
doesn't remind me completely apologies
but I really really like that it stands
upright and like I said it comes in
little wrapping like this and I'm going
to show you guys everything so this is
the
how do they call it against the buffer
airbrushed finish foundation brush it's
a long name but this is what it looks
like and you guys can see the ferrule is
gold and it's really really cute it's
not heavy it's like very very light so
it's very easy to kind of buff in but
all of them have that gold ferrule which
i think is actually really really cute
and they have the little tart logo right
there but anyway this is the brush that
I really really wanted and I'm so glad I
got it you guys I love this this is
amazing I would purchase this even if it
didn't even come in this kit I probably
will purchase another one just because
I've been dying to try this but when I
saw that it had come out in the kit I
thought wow I can get more brushes too
and a better value so this is what it
looks like I'm not quite sure I guess
that this is a full-size I remember in
store looking at this and thinking that
it was maybe a little bit bigger
um but overall it's very very dense and
it is a very very silky and soft I can't
even tell you guys very very silky and
soft it feels very similar to like the
Sigma you know what is it like the you
know the buffing brushes things like
that really really similar to that very
very silky soft I really really love
that it actually feels very similar to
my boogie buffing brush from is it
cosmetics that's actually a really good
way to think of it so really really nice
it feels amazing and this is great and
so easy at buffing in any kind of you
know wet products that you put on your
skin I used it today to buff in my
concealer underneath my eyes I just took
it and I go like this in circular
motions and it literally bust into the
skin within 30 seconds like this is the
fastest fastest brush I've ever used I'm
one of the people that likes and prefers
my Beauty Blender a lot over any kind of
foundation brush because I find that I
just get streaks and I can't seem to
apply it really really well without it
getting streaky with a lot of foundation
brushes so I prefer my Beauty Blender
but this is amazing it really cuts down
on time if you're in a hurry you can
just buff in your concealer and then
buff in your foundation and um I will
say it does take cup it does take away a
little bit of coverage but I feel like
when you are doing circular motions and
kind of buffing it into the skin that is
always going to take away a little bit
of coverage in my experience I
find that brushes like foundation
brushes versus a product like the beauty
blender that you kind of stamp on your
face are always going to take away a
little bit of the coverage but overall
this is an amazing brush I've been
loving it I mean I'm just I'm totally
obsessed it is as good as everybody says
and you can actually stipple it on also
if you like that but the quickest way is
to just kind of buff it in really
quickly it's awesome it is really big so
it takes up a lot of space at once so
it's very very easy to just get your
whole face done quickly so absolutely
adore that definitely definitely worth
it the second brush in here is this
little stippling one and I think they
recommend this one for I think
foundation but as you guys can see it's
got some pink on there I've been using
this as my blush brush so I will swirl
it into whatever blush I'm wearing today
I'm wearing the Milani rose blush in
tiros mm-hmm excuse me guys you know
I've been a little sick so I'm sorry if
my voice sounds a little weird but I
kind of swirl it into my brush into my
blush and then tap it off and I just
kind of Pat it on to my cheeks and it
really really is nice because this is a
very dense stippling brush and it has a
lot a lot a lot a lot of little hairs
and it really just clings on to product
really nicely and I feel like I can just
stamp it on and you know precisely put
it exactly where I want it so I really
really love this I have tried this with
foundation however I'm just one of those
people like stippling brushes the
foundation and that whole thing like I
get streaky and I did with this one as
well even though it is very very dense
but overall of really really like this
brush as well it is very very silky and
soft and of course you get that little
gold ferrule that's so cute the next one
they this is their blush brush and this
thing is like Wiggly okay it's like not
dense at all it doesn't feel nearly as
soft it's really really just kind of
like a weak brush and I cannot imagine
putting blush on with this I did try and
it really really really didn't look good
I just couldn't get it on the way I
wanted to because every time I can't
right
and it went like this and I just didn't
like that so what I like to use this for
is highlighting its really really fluffy
and easy and you just kind of dip it in
your highlighter just kind of dust it on
your face and it's awesome so I am
wearing today the UM what is it the
vivid baked highlighter from oh goodness
makeup revolution yes in pink lights and
I just kind of dust it in there it's
really nice for if you have a highlight
that's really really heavy and very
pigmented excuse me which the vivid
baked ones from makeup revolution are so
this is really really nice so I do like
it I would never use this for blush I
just feel like it doesn't have enough
like I don't know it's just not stiff
enough you know it really kind of gives
when you go like this but overall really
really nice for a very very pigmented
highlight so I do like that not my
favorite but it's okay and then we have
an eye shadow brush here this is just
kind of one of those that you can pack
like on the lid I did use it today to
pack on an all-over color on my lid the
color was heaven from the natural matte
palette from Too Faced and it's really
really nice it's just a normal kind of
like C eyeshadow brush you know that
once I kind of go like that and it
really does pack on color really well I
have no complaints with that so I do
like it overall I think it is good to
have I have a lot of these so it's not
like I absolutely needed this oops
not like I absolutely needed this but
overall I'm happy to have it so that is
what that one looks like again very very
soft and then the last one we have is
probably my least favorite this is the
concealer brush and it is like not very
soft it is very very dense but it
doesn't feel a silky I don't know the
blush brush and this one don't feel as
silky they just like I don't know they
feel kind of hard almost like not really
comfortable you know to put your
under-eye concealer on with or anything
like that so I don't like to use my
under eye concealer with this I actually
just use the buffer foundation brush but
for this I like to Pat on my under eye
like setting powder so I will set my
whole face with you know whatever powder
I'm using and then I will go in and take
a little extra and Pat this underneath
and it really really fits right under
they're very easily and I like that a
lot but like I said it's overall it's
not really really supersoft or anything
like that it does have a nice shape for
the eye area but overall you know out of
the kit I would say these two are
probably not the must-haves
however these three are really really
awesome so those are my thoughts and
kind of my opinions on the whole kit I
do think it's worth it because it is $44
you get this cute little case you get
this awesome awesome awesome airbrush
foundation brush you also get the good
stippling brush which can be used for
foundation again it just depends on how
much you kind of like put on it if you
stamp it on or blend it in but overall I
like this buffer one more and then you
do get the nice full-size eye shadow
brush they're all really really light
because this I don't know it's like
metal or something it's not heavy it's
like very very light so I most like
aluminum so the you know brushes are
just very very easy to use and work with
and I think it's just an overall really
good deal so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review on the new Tarte stroke of
midnight brush set from their holidays
collection and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
