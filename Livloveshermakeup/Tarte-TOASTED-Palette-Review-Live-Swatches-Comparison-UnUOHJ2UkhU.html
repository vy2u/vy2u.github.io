my channel today I am finally sharing
with you guys my review swatches and
comparison on the new tartlet toasted a
palette now I did purchase mine for $46
on the Tarte au pomme website it will be
available at Sephora and Ulta in stores
and online the first week of November
possibly in the last week of October but
we're kind of sort of basically in the
last week of October and I haven't heard
any news yet so keep your eyes out for
that to kind of in the next few days as
well as the first week of November if
you would like to go ahead and to get it
up at Sephora or at Ulta and this is a
party in a palette or at least that so
they described it as a honey the Tarte
comm website it says we're taking 12 all
new warm and cozy shades to celebrate
our tartlets and the wearable shades
they asked for what does this do it says
it lets you mix and match 12 warm rich
eyeshadows 7 wearable maps and 5
lustrous shippers arranged in separate
rows to make three easy DIY looks these
super blendable Amazonian clay infused
powder formula glides on like a cream
providing long wear intense payoff
that's never chalky or patchy it does
include 12 different eyeshadows the
first one is called some mores which is
a pinky beige with yellow undertone and
then you have sunrise which is a golden
beige eye of sunset which is a bronze
crackle which is a brown with gold
flecks cashmere which is a pale peach
warmth which is a terracotta flame which
is a metallic arrest cozy which is a
brick at kind of shade a candle is
champagne colored latte is a tan shade
as shimmer is a copper and fireside is a
deep plum so here is what the outer
packaging looks like it is beautiful
this is amazing packaging for a palette
in the $40 range and a very very similar
to the Tarte like you bloom packaging
some of my favorite packaging right here
and before we get into this I do want to
say I know that this has been a little
more of a controversial palette to the
past week or so there have been some
smaller youtubers that have been coming
out and saying these are hard to blend
or they're very very powdery and I just
want to put it out there right away I
hope you guys can trust me and my review
but I really like this I'm giving this
palette a 4 out of 5 star rating now you
guys know I am pretty hard on Tarte and
when I say it's good I really mean it's
good however you shouldn't just take my
opinion and say that's it that's the
be-all end-all
you should always go watch multiple
reviews a watch of multiple different
videos on the product at the end of the
day no beauty vlogger can actually know
what exactly you want in your eyeshadow
palette you are the only one who can
give it a thorough thorough review and
what I would recommend is going ahead
and waiting til it comes to Sephora Ulta
so if you don't like it you can always
go ahead and return it but I am
personally very impressed with this
palette okay so the first thing I want
to touch on is the overall color
selection in this palette compared to
the tartlet in bloom palette which is a
little more neutral or cool tone and
this is definitely more warm toned now
it doesn't have those really really deep
of burgundy and red shades in it I would
describe this more as terracotta and
kind of I don't know terracotta oranjee
shades if you're looking for a palette
that has the terra cotta the Gold's the
neutrals and a little more of cranberry
shades I would go for the balm cosmetics
nude beach palette I normally am not a
huge fan of the balm cosmetics
eyeshadows but I feel like this one will
give you exactly what you want a lot of
people are saying this is very similar
to the Urban Decay Naked heat palettes I
would not know I do not own that palette
I hated the naked formula from Urban
Decay so I did not go ahead and pick
that up but overall I would say that
these are actually very very everyday
friendly they may not look like it but
if you like a darker warm tone smokey
eye or even just everyday natural kind
of shades if you were to cover up these
two rows right here you can see you have
some really nice maps as well as
transitions that will give you an
everyday friendly sort of look so for
shade selection I would say this is a
pretty nice palette again if you lean a
little more on the warmth come side or
if you just really love warm tone
eyeshadows I think you're gonna like
this a lot compared to the tartlet in
bloom which do I prefer I'm gonna have
to go with the chart LED and gloom and
it's not so much because of the formula
I'm loving the formula in the new
tartlet toasted palette but it's just
because of the shades in here they're
very very neutral but they do have that
tiny tinge of a cool tone running
through there and I'm the kind of girl
that loves me some cool toned eyeshadows
so yes out of the two of them I still do
prefer at my tartlet in bloom palette
but if you prefer warm tones you are
going to love this baby right here
alright guys let's go ahead and talk
about the formula shall we I really
really do enjoy the formula on it the
new toasted palette
I do prefer the color selection when it
comes to the tartlet in bloom however
there are a few things that were wrong
with this palette in my opinion these
three shades right here which are called
activist leader as well as smoke show
tend to be very very firmly pressed now
I feel like it's something that Turk
does and they're matte shadows have
never been super super creamy and
buttery but I have to say in the new
toasted palette they are but you're very
soft they are very creamy they're very
buttery and there are a lot more
pigmented so you have to be careful when
you go in with your brush if you do not
like powders or eyeshadows that do kick
up a little bit of products you're not
going to like this but for me personally
I'm not having the about to kick up that
like Hickey Chanel had which she is I do
enjoy her channel if you guys are
curious she's a cruelty free beauty
vlogger here on YouTube and she did a
review she did not like this palette
whatsoever
it seems like she kind of got a bad
batch and unfortunately this is not the
first time that has happened when it
comes to Tarte so definitely go in store
swatch this out make sure it's something
that you'd like but I would not say
these are as powdery as subculture in my
opinion they just definitely are not but
they are a little more powdery however
they're way more pigmented they're at
least five times more pigmented and then
some of these shadows here in the in
bloom palette so although I really do
love the color selection in here I
prefer the formula on the new toasted
palette now another thing that some
people were complaining about when it
came to the Tartelette palette was that
some of these more I guess shimmer
shades or they called them blusters aka
rocker firecracker and funny girl
definitely were a little loosely pressed
so you had to use like a glitter glue
you really have to tap them on like with
your finger you get a lot of Fallout
basically I don't find that I'm getting
that with this guy so these shimmers
over here don't feel as soft and buttery
as the tartlets however and they stay on
better and I don't get fallout so I
almost feel like the formula in here was
recreated from what people really wanted
to see with this guy and I think Tarte
listened and I think they did a damn
good job okay and there are a lot of
things that I don't like about Tarte and
you can go back in my videos and see but
I think that this palette is fair
all rounded and they did a great job
with the formula now one thing I want to
say is some of these metallic shades
such as sunset and flame you do want to
go ahead and foil your brush down if
you're going to use a brush or you can
just go ahead and tap them on with your
finger today I do have on these shades
latte which is more of like a transition
shade I used warmth in up my crease and
then I did go in with flame on my lid I
tap that on with my middle finger and
then I took cozy on my lower lash line
you can see these barely look like
they've been touched so if this was the
same formula as some of those really bad
subculture pallets you would see there
would be a dent in here but I've been
using this for more than a week now and
I've been very very happy so overall
formula wise I feel like these are
fantastic they stay all day
they really don't crease all that bad
for me I feel like a lot of eyeshadows
do crease on me throughout the day and
just because I have a little bit of like
hooded lids or because I have a little
bit of skin that kind of like hangs over
on my lid I don't feel like a primer
could fix that and I don't feel like any
eyeshadow pallete is ever going to get
rid of that problem but I feel like
these were just as beautifully if not
better than the tartlet in blue my
palette now as far as pigmentation is
concerned these are a lot more pigmented
than the in bloom palette if you don't
like to work up your color on your eyes
you are not going to like this palette
because it is pretty wet back in your
face I wouldn't say it's as pigmented as
subculture but it is a few steps down
okay these are very very pigmented so if
you're gonna go into this shade right
here a latte and you have a fair
complexion expect to see that okay it's
not necessarily gonna be the breast
transition because it is a little darker
but like expect to see it I feel like
with the chart light in bloom palette
there's more room for mistakes like it's
not it's a little more about forgiving a
palette so if you aren't more of a
beginner or if you really don't want
something that's too pigmented I would
go with the tartlet and bloom but you
guys really really I'm happy with the
mute toasted palette so I would give
this a 4 out of 5 star rating let me
know what you guys think of this palette
down vennett below hello and I guess now
we will go ahead and jump right into
some swatches I'm all zoomed in let's go
ahead and start watching out the new
toasted a palette we are going to start
with the top row the first shade that we
have is called some Moors this is so a
buttery and soft and creamy and
beautiful it is a neutral kind of color
with these strong yellow undertone
so there is the shades amours the next
one we have is called a sunrise sunrise
is very beautiful it has a little bit of
a sheen to it but it mostly looks matte
once you actually get it on to your skin
and sunrise definitely has strong strong
yellow yellow shift to it or like yellow
tones to it so at the top right there we
have some Moors and then we have sunrise
mixed up we have sunset which is a
metallic finish absolutely beautiful
very very soft and buttery but not as
soft as the mattes and again I think
they press these a little more firm just
to make sure that they would actually
stay on the eye a little better than
like the shades or the lustrous shades
in the tartlet in bloom palette and then
finally we have the won a glitter press
shade now this isn't actually as bad as
some glitter press shades out there
sometimes Viktor like they lack
pigmentation this one certainly doesn't
but I mean I'm not I'm not a huge lover
of glitter and few shadows okay I feel
like with these it just ends up falling
out on your face throughout the day so
what I like to do with this is go ahead
and foil it my brush down spray it down
with a little bit of setting spray and
then I go in pick up the color I tap off
the excess then I just smoke it out on
my lower lash line that's all I like to
do with that particular shade so at the
top we have some ores that we have
sunrise that we have sunset and then we
have a crackle all right guys moving on
to the second row in the toasted a
palette we are going to start with the
shade cashmere which is a really really
beautiful soft peachy color so this guy
right here is a matte and again so soft
and smooth and buttery I just I cannot
get enough of the mattes going on in
this palette okay a very very pigmented
as you can see I enjoyed that shade a
lot as a transition up next we have the
shade warmth so this is the one that I
do have worked into my crease today
again very soft very buttery and very
very pigmented a4h art shadow so at the
top but we have cashmere and then we
have warms up next we have the shade
slain this is the one that I do have on
at my lid today it is a beautiful
metallic eyes kind of copper shade maybe
a little bit of like a cranberry hue
running through it but yeah that is what
it looks like and then finally we have
cozy which is a deep deep kind of burnt
I don't even know how to describe this
like a warm brown there it's a warm
brown so that is a shade cozy and this
is what cozy looks like so
again at the top we have the shade
cashmere then we have warmth than we
have flame and then we have the shade at
Cosi all right guys now let's go ahead
and swatch out the bottom row of the
toasted pallets starting with this shade
over here which is called I'm sorry this
shade over here which is called a candle
candle is a really really nice metallo
size color it's a little on the chunky
side and actually this reminds me a lot
of funny girl from the tartlet in bloom
palette so if you remember that's sort
of high shine impact but a little bit of
chunkiness going on you're going to have
deja boo' with this shade this is the
one metallic eye shade in the palette
that I feel like could have been pressed
a little firmer but it's still really
beautiful tapped all over the lid
especially if you're wearing a glitter
glue and especially if you do foil your
brush all right up next we have latte
latte is the transition that I have on
today it is a matte shade and it's kind
of like a sable color you know it's just
got that really really nice neutral vibe
going on there not too warm tone not too
cool tone really really great
up next we do have the shade of shimmer
and shimmer is just it's this I'm sorry
simmer like right simmer simmer is a
really really beautiful kind of neutral
gold color again not too warm tone not
too cool tone so that is what simmer
looks like and then finally the last
eight that we have in the palette is
called fireside and this is just a
really really deep purpley Brown a color
this is everything that I wanted those
darker shades in the in bloom palette to
be this one is just a lot easier to
blend in my opinion so at the top there
we do have candle then we have latte
than we have simmer and then we have a
fireside so that is the whole entire
palette swatch now I want to go ahead
and kind of compare a few shades from
each palette that are similar and we'll
go ahead and live squatch those but yeah
hope you enjoyed the swatches let's go
ahead and compare some of these shades
from the tartlet in bloom to the toasted
palette the first one I want to swatch
out it's firecracker from the inner
bloom and this is what firecracker looks
like it's actually my all-time favorite
shade from the Tartelette in bloom
palette and that is what the shape looks
like and I know a lot of people have
been saying that this shade right here
sunset is similar but I don't feel like
it is at all sunset really really has
more of like a gold vibe going on but
since people were asking I thought I
would go ahead and show them
side-by-side
at the top we have firecracker from the
in bloom and then underneath it we have
sunset from the toasted palette the next
to that I would like to swatch our hair
let's do a rebel which is from the in
bloom palette rebel is definitely like a
cool tone sort of plummy color and then
let's go ahead and swatch it next to
fire side from the toasted palette now
you guys will be able to see here what
with the tartlet in bloom one was just a
little battery there you guys will be
able to see a rebel definitely it's a
little lighter in tone and actually
let's go ahead and swatch lead or two
because leader from the in bloom is kind
of similar but I hope you guys will be
able to see when I'm actually swatching
these out I just feel like the way that
they go on from the toasted palette is
just a lot smoother and a lot more
pigmented but at the top but we have
leader I'm sorry at the top we have
rebel then we have fireside and then we
have leader so basically in bloom and
then toast it and then in bloom and then
finally I guess we'll go ahead and see
there's not that many similar shades I
know when I hold them up you might think
oh my god there's so many overlapping
shades but they're really not that close
when did you swatch them out but I think
what we should do now is go ahead and do
funny girl from at the Tartelette in
bloom palette so here is funny girl and
not super super ultra pigmented and then
here is um candle and this one is from
the toasted palette you guys will see
they both have that kind of chunkier
consistency but this one is definitely a
lot more pigmented so overall guys I
really love both of these palettes I do
prefer the colors in the in bloom I
prefer the formula of the toasted I hope
you enjoyed this review I always hope it
was helpful to you guys and that is
pretty much it I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
