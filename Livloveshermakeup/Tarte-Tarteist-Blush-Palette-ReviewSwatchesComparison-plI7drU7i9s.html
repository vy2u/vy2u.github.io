in this video I am giving you guys my
thoughts and my swatches on the brand
new tarts summer 2016 limited edition
tortise - blush palette first of all do
you guys call it tortilla store torte
East I'm pretty darn sure it's tart
taste like artiste because you're like
painting your face please let me know if
I'm saying this wrong I'm pretty darn
sure it's Party style but anyway this is
$38 on the chart calm website it will go
ahead and link below where you guys can
pick it up if you are interested and
these are four new shades that you
cannot purchase separately so if you are
interested in the four new shades by the
way the shades are called live laugh
love and dream then you do need to go
ahead and purchase the palette because
they are not available separately on the
website this is also limited edition so
if you want it you should get your hands
on it right away
alright they will be available online on
the alter SATCOM website on March 27th
on the Macy's com website on April 4th
and also the sephora.com website on
April 5th so anyway this is what the
outer packaging looks like super super
pretty
it's like feathers that's what it
reminds me of but again it's like an
artiste tour taste palette so I guess it
is whatever you want it to be but I
think it looks like feathers and then on
the back you can see it's just shiny and
gold typical tart these are formulated
without parabens mineral oil fatal aids
triskele and sodium lauryl sulfate
gluten and the art dermatologist tested
all four of the blushes and you do get
4.5 grams is that correct yes 4.5 grams
of product in here so it is the same
size as the holiday palettes from Tarte
that released so this is the 2015 bling
and on blush palette and then also I
have a 2014 holiday blush palette I want
to touch on this really quickly because
if you guys have been watching my
channel for a while you know that I'm
not a huge fan of the tart holiday
eyeshadow palettes they are made in
China they are not the ones that are
like the little circular palettes or
like the new rainforest of the sea
palette or even the tartlet Palace those
ones are made in America but a lot of
their holiday items are made in China
and I just think they're not good
quality at all however these like
Amazonian clay blush palettes are
definitely the exception I think they
are absolute
fantastic every single year I always
make sure that I pick up the pallet that
comes out during the holiday season but
yes just so you know the new to artis
palette is made in China as well as you
know all of the other holiday blush
palette so anyway in here you get this
beautiful packaging first of all this is
what the outer packaging looks like it
kind of reminds me of the outside of the
in bloom palette but not really I mean
kind of it has like that watercolor sort
of thing going on and it's just pink and
it looks like feathers it's beautiful on
the back it's shiny and gold again you
open it up you have a really nice sized
mirror here and it says the blush
Authority and then you get four gorgeous
shades three of these are matte and one
has golden shimmer in it and it is the
shade that I'm wearing today the one
that has the shimmer in it and that is
the shade left so you get live which is
a beautiful kind of this is probably the
most like the brightest color I've ever
seen out of any of the Tarte blushes
it's just a hot coral color absolutely
beautiful it does have kind of like a
satin finish to it I wouldn't say these
are completely mad they're just very
very I mean they are matte they
technically are matte but they feel like
satiny on the skin because they never
look dry or ashy or cakey so here is the
shade Liv swatched on my hand kind of
blend it out beautiful really really
creamy absolutely love the formula and I
already knew I would because I love that
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush formula by
the way I want to say really quickly the
full sizes of the Amazonian clay blushes
or B 12-hour blushes are 5.6 grams so
you are not getting a full-size of blush
in these palettes or in this particular
palette but yeah I just wanted to point
that out
the second shade we have here is laughs
which is the one I'm wearing today and
it's just a gorgeous kind of brown
reddish color like terracotta color with
gold shimmer in it and the shimmer is
super super finely milled so it's not
noticeable on the skin I love the
formulations of these blushes I mean
they just sit really nicely on the skin
this also has a little bit of a silver
iridescent to it there is the shade
right there absolutely absolutely
stunning that is laughs and then the
next one we have is a really really
neutral natural color it kind of reminds
me of the exposed shade if you are a big
fan of expose you were gonna love it
they shade love you're gonna love the
shade love so love is this gorgeous kind
of neutral II I don't even know how to
describe it kind of deep mauve color it
is a matte and it's just beautiful it's
really beautiful it's like a wearable
mauve if that makes sense so there it is
on my finger and let me go ahead and
squash it for you guys it's just
gorgeous and it just has a beautiful
kind of satiny sort of look to it on the
skin I'm just in love with this shade
this shade is beautiful although I am
wearing um laughs today is it laughs
yeah I think love is probably one of my
favorites it's just so neutral this is
the kind of blush that literally could
pair with any sort of I love any sort of
lip look you could wear a bold lip and a
bold eye and you could still wear this
blush like it's so neutral that
everything goes with it and then the
last shade we have in here is a warm
raspberry color and it is called dream
and it's the one right there it is also
a matte and it's very very beautiful
I feel like Tarte does a lot of colors
like this but it's just a gorgeous color
they do the high-performance natural
things so well still any let me anyway
let me go ahead and swatch this so there
is just a beautiful beautiful sort of
warm raspberry color so overall I love
the formulation on these I already know
that the quality of these blushes are
amazing because I'm used to getting them
in you know the holiday blush palettes
and also just in the singles they're
absolutely amazing they really do wear a
full 12 hours they are very blendable
very creamy you don't get a lot of kick
up when you put your brush in there I
for some reason I have another I can't
remember what it is I have another blush
from Tarte where I get so much kick up
like when I put my brush in there it's
not the Amazonian clay formula but it I
just get so much powdery kick up you
don't get that at all with these they
never go on super ashy or cling to dry
patches on your skin they just go on so
beautifully I actually think that every
single one of the light Amazonian clay
blush palace that I have I think they go
onto the cheeks better than when i
swatched them there's just something
magical that happens when you
put them on the cheeks they just look so
beautiful the colors transfers so
gorgeously onto the skin so overall I
think this is a really really good deal
like I said you do get 4.5 grams of
product in here and that is the same
amount that you get in the holiday blush
palette so even though these ones look
bigger because they are taller and
skinnier you do indeed get the same
amount of product so here you have the
kind of like chunkier wider ones and
then here you have the holiday palette
so let me go ahead and see if I can kind
of hold them like this to show you guys
a little bit of a comparison like color
wise so here is the tart taste on top
with the 2015 bling it on blush palette
so you can see there are quite a few
similar tones but I feel like Tarte
always does that you know but they are
very very different but in a very subtle
way so that's the comparison it with the
2015 palette and then here is the
comparison with the 2014 blush palette
the holiday palette so we have the Tarte
East on top and then in the what is this
the 2014 on the bottom so there they are
again very very subtle but I mean there
are differences I know that it looks
like there isn't but there are very very
subtle differences so overall I'm really
really happy with this palette I
actually love this because this is like
half the size of the holiday palace to
be completely honest I remember this one
the 2014 when this thing is a chunky
monkey it is big and I feel like this is
wonderful because it's super sleek and
compact and then also here's the 2015
bling it on I feel like again like half
the size maybe a little wider than the
holiday palette but again like half the
size so very very travel friendly I like
that you get the same amount of product
that you do with the blush palettes that
were from the holiday season even though
like it looks like they're not the same
size they are the same size and I just
think the color selection in here is
really really beautiful I personally was
a little disappointed in the Tarte 2015
bling it on palette because I felt like
a lot of the colors in here could not be
worn by every single skin tone like not
everybody could wear these colors
they're a little light
I personally really like them right now
for the springtime but I feel like
someone with deep or dark skin tones
really couldn't wear a lot of those
shades now the 2014 palette I thought
was great because there were some really
really deep dark shades in here and I
really really loved this one and I feel
like the nutria taste one is really
really good because you are getting a
nice arrangement of colors I think they
all go together very very beautifully
you get this kind of the lid shade right
here is really the one that kind of pops
out and is very very summery but I feel
like a lot of different skin tones could
wear at these shades so overall I think
this is definitely worth it for the $38
it's a beautiful compact little palette
the blushes the quality of the
pigmentation the blend ability
everything is just so there so I really
highly recommend picking this particular
palette off since it is a little bit in
addition and these are all four new
shades that you cannot get separately so
if you really really liked one of these
shades I would definitely recommend
purchasing this palette like I said I
will link below in the description bar
where you can purchase it and yeah I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
