review today this time it is going to be
on the new tart tart east clay paint
liner it looks like this cut it with a
little brush like this it's angled and
then it comes with the actual product
which is like a gel eyeliner product so
really really nice I got this for twenty
four dollars on the Sephora website it
is currently sold out on the support
website so if you wanted I would
recommend going and looking on the tart
com website I will link both of those
down below so you guys can look and see
where you can get it basically let me
read for you guys a little bit on the
support website of what it says it's
supposed to do it says an innovative
waterproof cream eyeliner with a unique
blending tip that it's inspired by an
artist palette think outside the lines
when you define eyes like a pro with
charts clay paint liner inspired by the
ease of an artist palette this
one-of-a-kind squeezable cream liner
offers a seamless non budge application
simply squeeze line and define the
unique formula features fewer waxes
cushing pigments and a special
development yes and a specialist
development process that allows for the
creamiest texture and smoothing
application the tube was created with an
innovative artistic delivery system a
taper tip and a flat blending stage so
that you can simply pick up the ideal
amount of product and blend for a
foolproof perfection look the sketcher
featured I'm sorry the sketch or angled
bamboo liner brush easily glides the
plush triple black formula along the
contours of the eyelid um it says
featuring the same waterproof 12 are
aware as the tarts signature claypot
liners the next generation liner has
cushion slide technology that lets you
custom create your own signature lines
without ever pulling or transferring ok
how it look like a long thing there I am
wearing it on my upper lash line today
and I have to say I am obsessed with
this product I'm one of those people you
guys oh this is the packaging it comes
in by the way so you can see you can do
like winged minor and just so cool um so
let me just tell you guys I'm really bad
at putting upper like a like you know
like liquid line or anything on my upper
lash line that's usually why you guys
don't Stevie with
you know any kind of eyeliner on the
upper lashline I'm just not good at it
it looks bad it gets shaky this I did
today and I think it came out really
well I wanted kind of a thicker line I'm
not good yet with the little little wing
so I didn't even attempt to do that but
I am so happy this product has just made
it so easy to get a nice like fluid
thick line on the top which I absolutely
love it also works really really well on
the lower lash line today I'm actually
wearing one of the color molten by I
studio from Maybelline on the lower lash
line but you can also use this this
brush is wonderful as you can see it's
like got a little bit of a curve in it
so just hits right there really easily
and also underneath so I really really
love that I think the brush is really
all what you know what it's all about
it's really really wonderful but also
the formula is great the only thing I
don't love is that when you squeeze this
out you get excess product on the top as
you guys can see and that's gross and I
know how to get it back in I've tried
kind of shoveling it back in with the
brush it doesn't really work um so
that's one thing I don't like and I
don't want to wipe it up because then
I'm just wasting product I guess maybe
hopefully over time it won't like a card
or crispy on the top there cuz that'd be
really gross but um I hope that I can
find just a way to just let out the
smallest amount because you really have
to squeeze edit and then it kind of just
come shooting out so maybe if you don't
over squeeze it will come out nicely but
it really is a very very deep pigmented
black color like there is nothing as
black as this it's really truly amazing
let me read on the back of the box the
directions that it has so it says number
one gently squeeze a small amount of
product onto the blending stage surface
so it does say to push it on to that
actual surface um and then it says pick
up the liner by fully coating the
bristles of the included angle brush
glide brush along the upper and lower
lash line to create your perfect looked
so I'm not quite sure what they were
thinking when they thought that like you
know I guess some people are just not as
clumsy as me and don't pull out that
much product but I really gotta
a lot out on there every single time
I've done it so hopefully we won't dry
and get all disgusting but anyway I'm
super impressed with this i'm so happy i
can finally wear like stuff on my upper
lash line without it looking horrible
this is really easy to use I love the
brush if they didn't have the brush I
don't think this would be complete and
yeah I highly highly recommend it I will
leave links below where you guys can get
this again this was only twenty four
dollars on this bar website I'm pretty
sure it's the same price on the tart
website I don't know why it what it be
but i highly recommend this if you are
not good at applying you know upper like
liner to your lash line this is just
like the best way to do it so i hope you
guys enjoyed this review and i'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
