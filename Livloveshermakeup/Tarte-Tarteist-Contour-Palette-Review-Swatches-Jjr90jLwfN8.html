thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day as
always today I am doing a review and
swatches for you guys on the new tart
taste contour palette this recently
released from Tarte you can get it on
the turtlecom website or on the
sephora.com website which is where I
purchased mine for $45 on the
sephora.com website right now it is
exclusive only to vib and vib Rouge it
will open up to everybody I believe
pretty soon they did not actually
specify on the website but it is a
limited edition product and it is
basically exclusive to Sephora I believe
yeah its exclusive to Sephora and of
course the Tarte comm website but the
outer packaging it looks like this like
I said it is $45 just their typical kind
of tart packaging they do a lot with
that purple and gold theme so that is
what the box looks like but the actual
packaging of the product looks like this
and it is stunning it is absolutely
gorgeous you guys can see it's kind of
like this faux leather thing like on the
top here it's really really pretty and I
love the gold and black I think it's
absolutely stunning I'm really happy
that they didn't do purple and gold I
just think the gold and black is
absolutely beautiful so this is what it
looks like if you guys want a comparison
any sort of palette that tart comes out
with they come out with a lot of these
face and eye palettes that are in these
little round compacts this is the exact
same size so this is what it looks like
um these palettes this is the coral
crush palette it's an Amazonian clay eye
and cheek palette they also have like
the rainforest after dark palette things
like that anything that you may have
that looks like this is basically the
exact same size as this new tortise
contour palette so anyway the outer
packaging is absolutely stunning and
it's got this kind of reflective mirror
thing going on in the back it's just
beautiful and when you open it it has
that nice like clicky thing so you know
that it's completely closed
can you guys hear that yes so you get
that nice little clicking motion going
on there it is a little difficult to
open honestly I'm worried I'm gonna
break my nail off but inside you
a nice-sized mirror it does say tart
taste on the bottom and then inside this
is what it looks like now when I saw
this on the sephora.com website I was
like look at how beautifully that is
packaged I just thought the packaging
beautiful and I will say right away the
packaging is absolutely gorgeous when I
looked at this on the website I thought
immediately that looks really similar to
the Michelle Phan like life palette the
way that it's set up I really like the
concept I think the concept is really
beautiful everything is kind of just
like you know it's not like in a row
it's not like oh it's like a little box
you know it's a circle and it's just
kind of I don't know it looks very
appealing to the eye if that makes sense
I really thought that this was beautiful
but the first thing I thought of was ooh
the one thing I've heard of about the
Michelle Phan life palette is that a lot
of the shadows start to kind of like
mold together because it is kind of like
this beautiful circular display
everything kind of starts to get into
one another so that was something that I
was worried about with this palette and
unfortunately that is one of the cons
about this palette anytime you are using
a certain product you kind of like dip
it in it can get into the others and all
of these are matte this one right here
this highlight shade the blush shade of
both contour shades and this correcting
shade are all matte but this one in the
middle this really kind of pearly white
shade does have a little bit of shimmer
in it and I have noticed that a few of
these after doing swatches and using it
have started to get the smallest amount
of shimmer it's not like it picks up on
the skin but they have started to
accumulate a small amount of shimmer
from that middle shade so that's kind of
annoying to be completely honest but I
think that the packaging is stunning I
think that it was executed as well as it
could be if that makes sense I love the
concept of course it would have been
easier if they were maybe spread out a
little bit more but overall I really do
like the concept so anyway inside here
you get a beautiful matte highlight
shade and they have that written right
there number one which is highlight you
get this yellowy banana shade right here
which is called number two correct you
get number three and four which are
contouring shades one is described I
believe as a
soft brown and the other one is they
deep like chocolatey Brown both of those
are matte as well all of these on the
outside are matte and then you get the
accentuate shade which is number 5 which
is a beautiful beautiful blush color I
love this palette you guys I am wearing
it today I am wearing every single shade
except for this deep deep contour down
here I noticed that even with my fair
skin tone I am able to use everything in
here when I use this is deep deep kind
of chocolatey contouring shade I notice
it does get a little muddy with my
complexion I am quite fair but what I
love is that Tarte really is going for
the contour palette that everybody can
use you know an issue with a lot of
contouring palette says that either it
gets really really muddy and it doesn't
pick up very well on fair skin tones or
it's too light and it doesn't pick on
pickup on medium to deep skin tones and
people complain so I love that they put
this really really deep dark dark
chocolaty shade in here as they
contouring you know product for those
who have medium to deep skin tones and
then they have this lighter shade here
for people like me who have fair to
light skin tones but overall every
single shade in here is wearable and
easy for me to wear personally as
someone with pale skin even this
beautiful beautiful kind of yellow
correcting shade I can wear and I can't
wear like the Ben Nye you know banana
powder or things like that it's too
yellow and anytime I put it underneath
my eyes or if I want to do the baking
method things like that it just doesn't
work out for me but this one does so
today I have the highlighting shade and
I am wearing that down my nose on my
chin on my cheekbones I have the
correcting shade underneath my eyes to
cancel out any sort of blue tones I have
the number 3 contour which is this one
the lighter one I have that right here
on my cheekbones a little bit on my
forehead and then I brought it
underneath my jawline I have the blush
on which I think is absolutely gorgeous
and then I did take the middle shade I
would say the middle shade with a little
bit of shimmer that pearly white shade
is probably my least favorite out of all
of them I think they kind of just threw
that in there thinking oh people will
want to kind of accentuate their Cupid's
bow or the inner corner of their eyes I
do
that down my nose and on my chin by no
means is it like a Becca shimmering skin
perfecter pressed or anything like that
it doesn't have any sort of amazing glow
or shimmer like I don't know champagne
pop or something from Jacqueline yeah
it's nothing like that
but it gives a nice little luminosity to
the skin but overall that is probably my
least favorite shade but the ones on the
outside these you know five shades are
absolutely gorgeous absolutely gorgeous
so the blend ability with these is
really amazing when I was putting on the
contouring shade for the first time a
couple of days ago I put it on and
immediately it got a little blotchy on
my skin and I thought oh man if this
doesn't blend out well I'm gonna be so
disappointed
and I started to blend it out and it
just completely changed they are so
pigmented and so easy to blend they are
extremely creamy I do notice when I put
my brush in I do get a little bit of
kick up which is normal with any kind of
powder product that is really really
super soft and creamy and pigmented the
only thing that I don't like like I said
is that when I pick that up they do
start to kind of you know muddling to
each other which of course I don't like
especially with the shimmery shade I do
not want those going into any of these
matte shades on the you know outer
perimeter of the palette but oh my gosh
they are just so easy to blend they are
so beautiful and I just love that every
single shade I can actually wear in the
palette and that says a lot because even
this deep deep dark chocolaty Brown
shade I can do is a very very like
strict contour if that makes sense I can
use a really really small dense brush
and really really chisel out my
cheekbones and then blend as far as this
shade goes this nice little one here I
really use kind of a fluffy brush today
I feel like it gave a very natural
contouring look like I said I just kind
of hit the outer perimeters of my face
down my jawline my cheekbone up here
near my hairline and I feel like it gave
a very nice natural contour I feel like
a lot of people on a daily basis wear a
natural contour versus a really chiseled
out sort of look so I love that I can
just dip my brush in there and I can use
a fluffy brush and really really blend
that in super super quickly and easily
and I also have the option of going into
this darker shade and really doing ace
like I guess the strict contour you know
something that's really really chiseled
out I have that option as well so really
really happy with that like I said
pigmentation is off the charts
blendability is beautiful and I have to
say you guys they copied to face these
smell like the chocolate bars from Too
Faced the chocolate eye palettes
whatever you want to call them everybody
knows the chocolate bar palettes
these smell like that I'm kind of like I
don't know how I feel about it art
because Too Faced is my favorite
high-end brand and I feel like they own
that like they own the chocolate bar
scent but I mean there is nothing wrong
with putting this on and smelling a
little bit of sweetness so I do like it
I'm not complaining I just feel like
they did kind of copy to face when it
comes to that but overall I'm really
really happy with this I think it's so
easy to blend really creamy again I
think that the packaging is gorgeous
except for the kind of execution of the
product if that makes sense it's I know
that they thought this out very well but
at the same time it's kind of like did
they not think that these would all get
a little muddled in with each other so
what I do recommend is to use a smaller
brush when you are dipping into
everything if you use a huge brush
you're gonna start you know muddling
them together but overall I am really
really happy with this product I think
it's absolutely beautiful and for $45
this is a great great great value and a
great little set to have I love that it
caters to every single skin tone and
yeah so let me show you again a close-up
of these and I'm gonna go ahead and do
so watches for you guys so let's swatch
these babies I'm gonna start with number
one which is that highlight shade and
this is a matte and it's very very
beautiful God these are so creamy you
guys it really feels like just super
super buttery which is something that if
I'm being completely honest I don't
always associate with Tarte palette um
sometimes tart palettes are a hit and
miss with me whether it be their face
palettes or their eye palettes sometimes
the texture is not completely there but
these are so nice and soft and buttery
so that is the first shade it is called
highlight and it is definitely a
beautiful kind of just cream color
that's how I would just
'but i swatched right at the top there
the second shade is that kind of yellow
banana ii sort of color and this is the
correcting shade and i like that this
isn't too yellow it is yellow but it's
not too yellow um and this is basically
to cover up any sort of blue undertones
gray undertones you may have underneath
your eyes it's beautiful it also works
really well to use it the baking method
with this so there's the highlight shade
and then the correcting shade and then
number three is the first contouring
shade which is the one I am wearing
today it's kind of like that milk
chocolate sort of color but it's
definitely got a lot of taupe undertones
so it's not pulling any orange if that
makes sense and that is right there and
then you have that really really deep
chocolatey gorgeous gorgeous contour and
this is dark you guys can you guys see
that whoa really really dark but
beautiful and I love that it will cater
to so many skin tones and that one is
even more I would say even more topi
than this one even though I contoured
with this one some people might bronze
with this one in the contour with this I
think both of them are beautiful for
contouring you can you know do it either
way and then we have the little blush
color here which is beautiful this is
like a Mavi dusty rose sort of color
it's really really gorgeous I absolutely
love it and I love that it's matte it's
really beautiful that's right there and
then I'm going to swatch that little
middle color right here which I feel
like it's kind of pointless and I think
they could have left out with this
palette because it doesn't do that much
of a glow and I don't know I just don't
find it to be particularly special but
it's in there anyway and it does happen
to be kind of the most chalky and no
it's not super pigmented like the other
ones but it's right there hopefully you
guys can see it so those are the
swatches of this palette again I'm
absolutely in love I think it is
gorgeous and I do want to mention really
quickly it
come with this little card again I feel
like that's like a two-faced sort of
thing having the little instructional
card in here but these are really nice
you know it's nice to have these kind of
things so it just shows you you know
what to do with certain products they
have the number one highlight it says
illuminate the center of the face and
diffuse the appearance of lines using
the matte highlighter shade apply in the
center of the forehead down the bridge
of the nose and on the chin or the lip
correct add dimension and neutralize
redness or discoloration with the yellow
correcting powder you can apply it in
the triangle triangle of light which is
down and up like this or underneath the
eyes extending from the inner and outer
corners to the tops of the cheekbones
from here to here and then they have
number three and for the soft and deep
contour you can choose whatever
contouring shade works best for you
apply to the hollow areas of the face
below the cheekbones buffing up towards
the ears so from here up to here and
then they say you know you can do it
down here nose things like that that is
one thing I have not tried yet I've not
tried it as a nose contour and it says
buff and blend away any harsh lines for
a seamless sculpted look and these are
really really easy to blend like I said
number 5 is accentuate and that is the
blush shade it says merge your highlight
and contour by Fanning over the apples
of cheeks and then number six which is
the glow shade which is my least
favorite and it says finish your look by
brightening and illuminating the angles
of the face applied the shimmer
highlighter down yeah down the nose on
the Cupid's bow and beneath the brow
bone so yeah I do like that they have
that little card in there I think
contouring in general can be kind of
tricky especially if you're new to it
you don't really know where to put
certain shades so that is really lovely
TAV and yeah I don't know what else to
say about this palette I am really
really happy with this I really am
enjoying this a lot I think it really
caters to a lot of different skin tones
I think it's packaged beautifully it is
very compact and sleek and easy like I
said it is about the size of the
rainforest after dark or the coral
crushed palates any kind of circular
palette like this from Tarte and yeah
I'm very impressed very very happy I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I will
link below where you guys can pick this
up from the Tarte comm website and also
Sephora calm
and I will see you guys in my next video
