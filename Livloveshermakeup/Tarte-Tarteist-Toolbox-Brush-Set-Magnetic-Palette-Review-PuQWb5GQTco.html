video is going to be a quick little
review on this new Tarte artist brush
set this is what it looks like this is
for holiday 2016 obviously every single
year tarte comes out with a brush set
for the holidays i did pick up last
year's set and recently i also picked up
the nicole conceal EO brush set so i'm
going to talk a little bit about how
they're different and how they're
similar and just so you guys know when I
do my then and now video comparing this
year's products to last year's I will do
a side-by-side comparison of this year's
brush set to last year's but anyway this
is the tardis tool box brush set it also
comes with a magnetic palette this is
new it is a limited edition and I
personally purchased mine for $44 on the
Sephora comm website this is a 164
dollar value it is a collection of five
full-size Tartus brushes with a poor
portable magnetic palette but
technically you're getting nine brushes
because four of them are dual sided
which is really cool so this collection
of professional quality limited edition
gold brushes are must-have in any beauty
arsenal four brushes feature a double
and did two in one design so that you'll
have everything you need to cover
correct blend shade highlight contour
and glow your skin the artistic
statement brush case includes an empty
magnetic palette so that you can pop in
pans of your favorite removable shadows
blushes contouring and setting powders
and highlighters to create your own
custom on-the-go palette which i think
is awesome and there's also some extra
room to store your favorite artists
essentials so that you can organize and
customize so anyway here is the outer
packaging I will say right off the bat I
really enjoyed this brush set but you
guys I do not like this packaging I feel
like this is such dated packaging this
is what it looks like and I will say the
actual magnetic palette itself also very
very like dated design from last year
set if you guys didn't know last year's
set hated this sort of little design
right here I thought this was better I
didn't exactly love this design either
but I feel like Tarte kind of releases
these odd looking designs for the
holiday season let me know if you agree
down below but I think this is just very
very like 60s or 70s I'm not really
feeling it but to each their own on the
back of the box here you have like a to
and from which would be a perfect
perfect perfect little gift to give for
the holiday season because honestly this
amazing for $44 or basically basically
getting nine tart brushes and these are
very very good qualities I will say
right off the bat I do feel like the
quality of these brushes is very very
similar to the Nicole Concilio brush set
I did review that one I talked about a
few of my favorite brushes that were in
that set I believe I will leave that
link down below he would like to watch
my review but I thought that brush set
was really really good the bristles on
all the brushes are very very soft so if
you happen to get this particular one I
would highly recommend picking up this
one as well because I just feel like
they're really really good I know a few
of you were asking me if I could just
get one set which one should I get I
would say this holiday set since you are
getting nine brushes total technically
since you know for them are dual sided
so out of the two of those I would say
go with this holiday set but the Nicole
concealer conceal one is also really
really good I will say the overall not
just packaging but like the overall feel
of the actual bristles on the brushes
are a lot better than last year's sets
now I'd loved last year's set because it
came with a full-size air buffer
foundation brush this is a beautiful
fantastic brush but I will say I think
that the foundation brush this year is
actually softer like bristle wise than
this one which is crazy because I
thought this one was like putting a baby
but like on your face so really really
good I feel like they have stepped up
like the quality of their bristles and
things like that and one thing that I
love about Tarte like foundation brushes
is the fact that they really really pack
those bristles in there so if you go
onto the face we're really really nicely
so anyway this is the outer packaging
like I said and then here is the actual
little magnetic palette so again don't
really like the design I feel like it's
very like outdated it's just not very
cute you do press this little button
right here which says tart and then it
does open up so here you guys can see
this is the magnetic palette side a very
innovative very very cool you can go
ahead and pop in I don't know some of
your Tarte blushes if you want if you
teapot them you can pop them in there
and then you do have this little area
right here to actually put your brushes
in I claimed to find the other day and
as you guys can see some of the oil from
the cleaner went onto the thing so it's
not like amazing amazing packaging and
one thing I will say is that the only
thing that I don't like about dual sided
brushes is the fact that one of the
brushes is going to get all jammed up in
there so
this is just a little pocket and you
know some of the bristles might get a
little roughed up or for the most part I
think it's really good packaging and I
think it's so cool that they do have
this little area here where you can put
in whatever the hell you want so
technically this is really really great
for travel which is why I do think it's
better than the Nicol can see Leo set
and better than last year's holiday set
because you are basically getting all of
your brushes literally you're getting
dual ended brushes four of them and
basically I don't know what to think
you're just getting nine brushes total
you literally could put together your
whole entire face look and then bring
along any sort of shadows or blushes
that you want you just pop this together
and then you're ready to go on your trip
so although I don't like the design of
the packaging or the actual design on
the front I do like what is in here I
think it's smart I think it's innovative
and I think it's cool so let's go ahead
and I will show you guys what the
brushes look like the first one that you
get here looks like this and this one is
more of like a contour and blush brush
so I personally use this one to
highlight today I really like it it's
very densely packed very very soft
bristles and then this one over here is
a little more on the flimsy side and not
exactly my favorite brush from the
entire kits but it's still nice if you
do want to dust
on maybe a little bit of contour and
kind of buff it in or if you do want to
go lightly with your highlight so this
is the first brush again really really
nice that it's dual sided and both sides
are extremely extremely silky the next
one we have here could be really
anything that you watch this could be a
blush brush a bronzer brush anything to
buff into the skin you could use the
buffing technique with this with a loose
powder very very beautiful it's not as
densely packed as like say the
foundation brush in here I know a few
people thought that these were
foundation brushes or this particular
one was this is not technically a
foundation brush of course you can use
it for whatever you want but it's not as
densely packed so I would probably use
this more for contour or putting bronzer
on one thing I do want to touch on is
that these do shed a little bit it's
very very minimal but they do shed a
little bit you can probably see that
little guy right there they do shed
minimally I think it's okay it's not
something super crazy it's not like
every time I deep clean them or I spot
clean them they start to shed it's just
once in a while you will get like a
loose little hair I personally haven't
had any issues with little hair sticking
to my face they seem like they are still
packed into there but I did want to go
ahead and point
at the next brush that you get is
probably my favorite so this is the
foundation side which is very very silky
you guys can see it's kind of tapered
and then you have this nice little
pointed foundation brush so you can use
this to peck on your color correctors to
pack in your actual under I like
concealer and then this side is nice
because it takes up a lot of surface
area like I said one of my favorite
things about Tarte foundation brushes is
the fact that they are very densely
packed with bristles so they put on your
foundation seamlessly and very quickly
no streaking whatsoever so this one's
very very very beautiful in my opinion
and then like I said I liked this
yesterday I packed on my color corrector
the Urban Decay color corrector in the
shade peach and I just tap this in very
soft very silky really nice for getting
in the under eye area and it is a little
more slender than regular pointed
foundation brushes so I enjoy that a lot
and then here we have this little brush
so this little guy right here on this
side I would usually use to kind of spot
conceal any area that I need to but you
can also use it to put shadow or pack it
on to your outer V which is really cool
and then on the other side you have this
nice little kind of pencil or liner
brush it's very very sleek and slender I
like to kind of spray it down with a
little bit of setting spray and then go
in and maybe foil it underneath my lower
lash line really really beautiful very
very handy again I feel like this entire
set gives you what you would need every
single brush for an entire face look so
these were are really the only brushes
that you would need to bring with you
and then the final one that we have here
is basically this little guy right here
which is kind of like a flat shader
brush you really could pack into your
crease you could pack onto your lid you
could do whatever you want with it
compared to last year's um I guess you
could say like this is not a crease
brush lid brush last year's was a lot
more slender and a little more flat but
I actually preferred this year's because
it's a little more stumpy really easy to
pack on to the lid and then you do have
a blending brush on the other side this
is not the best blending brush but I
will say it can buff out any sort of you
know color that you put into your crease
so it's definitely something to look
into and I really do like this so
overall I would say definitely pick up
this kid I think it's very good quality
for $44 he honestly just can't beat it
and the fact that you are getting that
portable pallet in there so that you can
put any sort of shadows or blushes in
there all you really need to do is like
toss in a foundation and you already
have your brushes you have your brushes
you have your own highlighters you have
everything that you need I think it's
really awesome so anyway I highly highly
recommend this to you guys definitely
something that I think you should pick
up for this holiday season
and it's also a really nice little item
to go ahead and give to someone so I
hope you enjoyed this review thank you
so much for joining me and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
