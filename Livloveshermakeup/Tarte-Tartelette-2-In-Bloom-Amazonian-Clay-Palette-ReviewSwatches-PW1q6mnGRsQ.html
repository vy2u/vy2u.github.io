thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day as
always today I am reviewing for you and
also doing swatches on the new tartlet
in bloom Amazonian clay eyeshadow
palette from Tarte this recently
launched on the ulta.com website that is
where I purchased mine it is $45 it is
an Ulta exclusive you will not be able
to find this at Sephora and it actually
is not a limited edition product so you
don't need to get it right away it is
going to be part of their like complete
collection it will be around for ever I
guess until they just continue it but
this is what the outer packaging looks
like and I do want to let you guys know
right now you can only order this online
like I said you can get it on the Ulta
calm website or on the tarte dot-com
website but you will be able to get this
in store at Ulta on let's see here
November 29th I believe so definitely
look out for it if you guys are
interested in this but this is what the
outer packaging looks like it's really
beautiful it kind of has this like
watercolor sort of thing going on on the
front with a bunch of petals and then
it's got this gorgeous metallic gold
thing going on in the back and the
actual palette looks exactly the same
way it is absolutely gorgeous it's got
really nice like hard casing and you can
see it's the metallic gold on the back
it opens up you get a gorgeous big sized
mirror and then you get 12
gorgeous gorgeous eyeshadow shades so
you get 9 Maps in here and three luster
shades that is what they describe it as
luster shades they're really kind of
like a metallic satiny sort of finish
and they are really really gorgeous so I
like that this palette you know
incorporates a lot of warm tones because
the first partlet palette actually had a
lot of cool tones in it now I do not
have the first her lip palette to
actually do a comparison for you guys
because I never purchased it let me tell
you guys why I tend to have a hit and
miss relationship when it comes to Tarte
palettes I was just talking about this
with my friend Leora last night we were
talking on the phone and we were talking
about how the tarte holiday eyeshadow
palettes really tend to be a mess they
are just not super pigmented they don't
have amazing like they don't have an
amazing texture to them they're not very
blendable and
always shocked by how disappointed I am
basically in their holiday you know I
shadow palettes or kits I do have one
here to show you and I do like this I'm
not going to get rid of this palette I
do like it it's like this little
magnetic palette that's supposed to
click together this was part of I
believe last year's sweet indulgences
collection and in here you get beautiful
beautiful eyeshadow shades as you guys
can probably tell on each side this one
you get a little more like pinky tones
and then this side you get a little more
neutral kind of dusty I don't know
taupey colors they're beautiful but let
me just show you guys like I'm really
rubbing my finger in here like I'm
really trying to pick up swatches and it
barely they're kind of barely their
pigment so what Leah and I were talking
about with like you know for me
personally I never picked up the first
tartlet palette because I was like I
don't know is it gonna be good is it
gonna be bad just from looking at
pictures of it online I thought ooh that
looks very similar to what Tarte comes
out with all the time they go for very
very neutral colors typical Tarte and I
just thought you know what what if
they're barely their pigmentation or
they're not super creamy and soft I
don't know if I'm interested in that so
that's kind of where I stalled and I
kind of thought you know what I really
don't want to get the first tartlet
palette however I must say the palettes
that tart releases that come in this
cute little circular packaging these are
amazing these have wonderful
pigmentation they're really really
creamy they're very very pigmented and I
like these a lot you get a blush in here
a bronzer a highlight and then six
eyeshadow shades and I find the
eyeshadows in here to be comparable to
what they are in this little tartlet in
bloom palette so I am actually really
really happy with this palette I am
happy to say that the formulation is not
what you would expect
I guess start to really be like if you
have tried their holiday kits and you do
not like their eyeshadows you think
they're a little dusty they're not very
pigmented they look so beautiful because
Tarte really puts together a neutral
palette gorgeously I mean the colors
that they choose and things like that
are beautiful they look absolutely
gorgeous when you look at them but then
when you swatch them out and you try and
use them they just they just don't come
out the same way but I am happy
say that these shadows are comparable to
what you are going to find in a palette
like this whether it be the rain forest
after dark palette or this one which is
the coral crush Amazonian clay eye and
cheek palette I am happy to say that
this tartlet palette is very very
comparable to that and I am really
really happy with the pigmentation and
the quality of these shadows like I said
my friend Leora she actually loves the
first tartlet palette so it has actually
inspired me to go ahead and pick that
one up as well because I really really
do love this one and she said that um
you know the pigmentation and the
quality of the shadows are the same in
the first one so anyway like I said the
first one has a lot more cooler tones in
it this one definitely has a little more
warm colors in it and I find that the
luster shades are probably the softest
and the palette they feel very
comparable to those like they feel like
the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
pressed like they feel like they have a
little bit of texture but they are very
very smooth at the same time kind of
similar to the makeup geek foiled
eyeshadows but not as soft they feel
similar to that and like I said there
are three of those in here and then the
rest are all matte and the mattes don't
feel nearly as creamy but the
pigmentation blows me away so I'm
wearing these today I have been wearing
these for the past couple days I
absolutely love this palette I am
wearing this shade charmer which is a
beautiful like white matte color really
really nice and brightening I'm rained
that all over my eye I have firecracker
which is one of my favorite colors
actually the colors I'm wearing today on
my eyes are my favorite colors in the
palette firecracker in my crease and my
lower lash line I have funny girl all
over my lid and then I have leader which
is a beautiful deep kind of plum e ready
matte shade I have that on my outer V so
really really happy with how the eye
look came out today I feel like this is
such a neutral and easy palette to reach
for really really comparable to anything
that you might see on the market I know
a lot of people love the naked palettes
things like that I didn't like the Naked
palette so it's nice to have a really
really nice neutral palette like this
that I can just reach for and know that
it will be appropriate for work it will
be appropriate for so many different
things in life basically so anyway like
said pigmentation wise absolutely
beautiful the maths
tend to pick up a lot more pigmentation
than the three lustre shades in my
opinion but the Leicester shades still
give off a lot of you know they still
give off a lot of color the Leicester
shades have a lot of kick up a lot of
fall out so you definitely want to make
sure that if you are someone who puts
your foundation and your whole face on
before your eye makeup like I do that
you definitely swipe like a fluffy brush
underneath to pick up any fallout
because you will get some but overall
the matte shades don't have that much
fallout and the majority of the colors
in here are matte so anyway I really
really love them I think they are super
easy to blend out I don't have I don't
feel like I'm sitting there for hours
and hours like with my blending brush
you know going back and forth I feel
like they really do blend out very
easily I noticed that they wear all day
I have tried them without an eye primer
and with an eye primer they do pick up
the most color with an eye primer today
I'm wearing the Too Faced shadow
insurance glitter glue these lustre
shades really really this funny girl
shade really really I felt like I could
pack that on there and that glitter glue
it like really made it stick if that
makes sense but I feel like these wear
all day I have no issues with that and I
am just really really happy and
impressed this has completely changed my
mind
about a lot of Tarte pallets I feel like
now I should really just give them a try
before I judge them I think the ones
that are the weakest are honestly their
holiday kits which is weird because you
would think that they would put a lot of
time and effort into their holiday kits
and their holiday eyeshadow palettes but
it seems like those ones are honestly
the ones that are lacking and slacking
so anyway really really happy with this
palette I'm gonna go ahead and do
swatches for you guys I'm going to like
work my way down like this and I will
start with this shade up here which is
called charmer and like I said this is
the one I'm wearing all over my eye
today basically all over my lid all the
way up to my brow bone it's beautiful it
is matte it is gorgeous it's really
really brightening you could even take
this underneath your eye if you wanted
to but there it is swatched
on my hand and I love that the matte
shades in here are not too like dusty
and chalky Oh
like that the next shade is called
flower child this is beautiful you can
also use this depending on your skin
tone all over your lid you know just to
kind of even out you know color and make
sure that you know no veins are sticking
out things like that so there is flower
child the next one going down this way
is funny girl this is the one of the
luster shades that I am wearing on my
lid today it is a beautiful kind of
Prosecco champagne e color really really
pretty okay and the next row is kind of
one of my favorite rows honestly it has
basically if you're looking at it
vertically it has three of the most
perfect transition colors ever
the colors are jet setter smarty pants
and sweetheart they're all matte and you
guys these are perfect for using like as
a transition color they are gorgeous and
perfect for that so the first one is jet
setter this one definitely has more of
like a brown sort of topi undertone the
second one is smarty pants this one has
a little more of a beige undertone and
then the third one is sweetheart which
has definitely a pinky undertone go
ahead and swatch those for you guys I
just love how blendable these are so
there they are swatched out you can see
the difference in tone and really really
they work beautifully on as transition
shades I love that row the next row has
two more Luster's you have rocker
firecracker and then a matte rebel so
rocker is kind of like a you know what
does it remind me of satin taupe from
Mac I think it's called or nutty from
wet and wild it's a beautiful kind of
silvery I don't know silvery taupey
color basically the second one is
firecracker that's the one I have in my
crease and on my lower lashline today
that is a beautiful beautiful true kind
of bronze color and then you have rebel
which is basically like a muddy red
color and it is matte and it's beautiful
and super creamy and gorgeous so there
they are let me swatch them
so those are those three absolutely
gorgeous really like those darker lustre
shades I feel like they really really
pick up beautifully on the eye and then
the last three if we're looking at it
vertically this way are kind of the
darker shades and I was worried that a
lot of these were going to look just
similar on the eye but I am really happy
to say I've been using these kind of is
like definer shades you know right on
the outside of my eye and they really do
pick up and look different they don't
just look dark on the eye they look
different so you have smoke show which
is kind of like a purple Brown I would
say purple Brown then you have activist
which is more of a true cool toned Brown
really really dark chocolatey Brown and
then you have leader which again is one
of my favorites and that is that really
dark kind of Merlot shade it's kind of
got a lot of deep wine color in it so
this is smoke show you have activist you
guys can see super pigmented and leader
so there they are and let me swatch them
for you guys and again I'm just so
impressed I'm so happy you know I really
kind of thought I was going to be
disappointed because honestly I've just
been disappointed by a lot of tart
eyeshadow palettes but I am so happy
that I love this palette so those are
those three colors they are all matte
and they are beautiful they make a
really really gorgeous like defining
shades and they're really gorgeous
on the lower lash line as well so anyway
those are the swatches of the palette
like I said I'm really really loving it
I don't have a lot of complaints the
only thing I would really say is that
those lustre shades or metallic kind of
satin finishes they definitely have a
lot of Fallout and you definitely want
to make sure that you wipe underneath or
even do your eyes first and then your
face makeup but other than that I think
the mattes really are these standout
shadows in here and I think the
packaging is beautiful I love there's a
big mirror
I love how neutral it is and I think you
just get a gorgeous like a variety in
here that can be used for every you know
everyday use basically and I think a lot
of people could use this oh sorry I keep
tipping it that way I think a lot of
people could use this and
yeah I just think it's absolutely
gorgeous so hopefully you guys can see
everything and I am super happy with
this palette so I will link below where
you guys can pick it up from me
sephora.com website and also from the
Tarte comm website um I am just I'm
really really kind of blown away with it
to be completely honest because I have
had a lot of eyeshadow fails from tarps
so I highly recommend I will link
everything below and thank you so much
for joining me
