video is going to be a review and
swatches for you on the new little tarts
young wild and free palette so this is
an eyeshadow palette it is limited
edition you are getting eight limited
edition shades in the palette and I did
purchase it on the Turkana website I
will of course link below in the
description bar where you can pick it up
as of right now which is let's see one
of my filming this June 11th 2016 I have
absolutely no idea if this is going to
be available at Ulta or Sephora so if
you do know after you are watching this
video if you happen to know where it's
going to be available please let us know
down in the comment section so that
everybody can you know go and see if
they can pick it up at Ulta or Sephora
and of course I will update this video
in the description bar if they do end up
being available at Ulta or Sephora but
there has been no talks as of right now
on where they will be available I'm
guessing because it is the double duty
Beauty I'm thinking it's gonna be at
Alta but as of right now I just don't
know so anyway like I said I did
purchase this for $28 and I was very
surprised when I got this palette I
thought it was going to be big like the
size of my tartlet in blue palette this
thing is tiny but it's adorable so here
are the two palettes side by side you
can see the tartlet in bloom is skinnier
however it is much taller and just kind
of you know it's just it's bigger so
anyway this toilet actually fits in the
palm of my hand
I think it's adorable I'm actually
really really happy with the packaging
and this is what the outer packaging
looks like if you guys are curious and
on the frontier just say throw kindness
around like confetti which is adorable
and it does say this is the double duty
Beauty Amazonian clay palette I'm very
very happy this is the Amazonian clay
formula I am NOT a fan of the products
that Tarte makes in China
I'm just not they honestly go and they
make these palettes and they're really
really cruddy they don't have a good
formulation to them I am happy to let
you guys know that this particular
palette is made here in the USA and it
does have the same sort of formulation
as the tartlet in blue or just the orig
original I'm partly palette so anyway
this is formulated without parabens
mineral oil fatal aids triskele and
sodium lauryl sulfate gluten and it is
dermatologist tested and here we have a
little snap closure as you guys can see
you open up the palette you have a huge
which is lovely and here are your eight
shades so we have this shade right here
which is a beautiful kind of dark liner
shade called wow we have party which is
a kind of satiny champagne shade we have
Dream Team which is more of a copper
shade the middle shade right here is
called lucky charm which is kind of like
a taupe or pewter color we have weekend
which is a matte and it's kind of like a
cool toned Brown we have simple life
which is a beautiful matte cream we have
happy place which is the only shadow in
the palette that is kind of a
disappointment it has a lot of glitter
to it and then we have virtue which is
like a dark cool toned again kind of
like a dark cool tone taupe color but it
definitely has a little bit of a green
undertone so I am overall really really
happy with the formulation of this
palette like I said there is one shade
in here happy place that has a little
more grit than the others and it's
definitely noticeable when you swatch it
whether it be swatch with a brush or
swatch with your fingers but overall I
think the palette is really really good
very very comparable to the tartlet in
bloom formulation it does smell like
cocoa which I know they did that with
this particular palette as well and they
have been doing with some of their
Amazonian clay formulations yeah this
one else is smells like cocoa so anyway
let me show the two of these held up
next to each other so you guys can kind
of see the color similarities so
although this is a limited edition
palette and have eight limited edition
shades I do feel like ternt always
releases very neutral palettes which is
probably why they call them like the
neutral the power neutrals or whatever
so anyway I do feel like the shades are
sort of similar but I feel like if you
didn't get your hands on the little tart
the tartlet teas palette which I
personally didn't get and I'm kind of
upset that I didn't because I don't like
to carry this around on my purse it's
too big but this is perfect for my purse
so I feel like if you did not get that
little tartlet teeth palette and you're
upset that you didn't get it this is
like the next best thing that you
honestly can get and like I said it is
limited edition so it won't be around
forever so definitely scoop it up if you
are interested but here you do get some
luster shades you get some bats and then
you do get that kind of glittery chunky
shade the water shade that I thought was
gonna be the worst was this color right
here called Wow and I was so surprised
at how smooth and buttery and creamy it
was I was really really surprised
although
I'm not in love with that charcoal sort
of dark black color I feel like if
you're gonna have a black just make it
black and if you want a really really
deep dark brown like put a little bit of
red undertones in there that's just me I
don't like this sort of like ashy black
color but I think it's really wonderful
to actual formulation even though it
does have tiny little bits of salford
glitter in there you cannot feel it it
feels like frickin butter so overall
really happy with the pigmentation happy
with the wearability of these I am
pairing them today with my benefit Air
Patrol BB eyelid primer and I do have
them layered on top of the lorac pro 3
eyeshadow palette I'm really happy with
the way that they layer it I don't think
anything looks chunky or crazy I do get
a little bit of fallout with these and
throughout the day if I do have some
color on my lower lash line which by the
way today I have virtue on my lower lash
line
I have Dream Team in my crease I have
lucky charm on my lid and I do have the
simple life on my brow bone I do feel
like especially if I have like that
chunky shade right there happy place on
my lower lash line the glitter will
start to fall out on my cheeks
throughout the day but right now things
look pretty good and I have been wearing
these for a few hours so I think the
wear time is strong on these especially
if you're wearing an ice-hockey primer
like the lorac primer
even this NYC city proof eyeliner
eyeliner eye primer is really really
good it's not as tacky but I do feel
like these shadows adhere to anything
really so yeah a really really good
formulation like I said if you missed
out on that tartlet tease palette like I
did I never picked it up and I'm just
like you know hitting my thumb in the
head for not doing so I think this is
probably the next best thing that you
can get and it's so compact and adorable
and I wanted to show you guys really
really quickly inside it's my purse I do
carry this little bin right here which
is actually from Tarte as well this was
their holiday brush set it came in this
little bin
I carry like travel makeup in here and I
recently before all the drama happens I
think I told you guys that I was going
to carry my little becca eyeshadow
palette from jacqueline hailed the
champagne collection eyeshadow palette i
was going to carry that in my purse and
i have been but now that I have this
little palette I actually like this a
lot more I am going to be returning my
Jaclyn
I shadow pilot the only reason I kept
that if you watched my review which I'll
link below the only reason I really kept
that was because I just love the
packaging and I thought it was so sleek
but this particular little eyeshadow
palette fits perfectly in here as well I
just have some lip balms in here I have
a Smashbox umm blush palette and some
things like that so yeah definitely very
very travel friendly awesome I think you
have every shade that you could need in
here I love that they give you a matte
transition I love that they give you a
matte brow bone shade I think this is
just absolutely a perfect little travel
palette so I'm very very happy with this
now let's go ahead and swatch it shall
we so I'm gonna start right here on this
little row here I'm gonna start with
simple life which is a matte it is a
cream shade and oh guys I forgot a few
of you have been asking me if I would
start doing the swatches with a brush as
well I'm sorry I did not pull a brush
from my collection but next video I
definitely will so I will do finger
swatches and a brush swatch next to them
so that you guys can see because I do
think that's important it definitely
looks a lot more strong and pigmented
when you do swatch with your fingers so
yes I will do that next time sorry about
that guys um so anyway we're gonna
swatch simple life and weekend so that
is the matte brow bone and then the map
transition shade so here is simple life
and then there is weekend so simple life
and weekend both really beautiful and
they are just completely matte I really
really like the shades here and I feel
like the matte formulation is really
nice it's not chalky it's not crazy like
I don't know sometimes I get either
really really chalky mattes and a
palette or I'll get them that are so
like chunky like I don't know you know
like they just start to follow up on
each other I don't have that problem at
all with this particular palette alright
next we're gonna go down to these two
shades right here and we have let's see
here happy place and lucky charm happy
places again that kind of chunkier shade
and then this is a luster or satin
finish so happy place is the one I don't
really like it has a lot of grit to it
and it definitely pulls up a lot of
product it's a little chunky as you guys
can see so here is happy place it's just
it skips a little bit it's just the
weaker of the bunch and you may be
looking at it and thinking it looks
pretty damn good to me but you just wait
till I swatch lucky charm which is that
beautiful sort of lid shade
because this is like absolutely stunning
this reminds me of like a foiled
eyeshadow almost so there you can see
the difference so here we have the cold
happy place not really my happy place
but happy place and then we have lucky
charm yeah this is a lucky charm look at
that shadow isn't that beautiful so I
really really like the kind of luster
shades in here I just wish they wouldn't
throw in so many shades that have like
grit to them I just never think that
that's necessary with any eyeshadow
palette I feel like Urban Decay does
that a lot too and I'm just like why why
I feel like the glitter doesn't even
really show up on your eyes it just ends
up following them following all over
your face all right the next two shades
we're gonna swatch our cue and dream
team and these are both Luster's or
satin finishes really really beautiful
you can see Dream Team has that gorgeous
copper sheen to it and then first you
have a little bit of like a hunter green
color to it it's actually beautiful I
love those kind of dirty green colors so
here we have virtue yes over to you and
then here is the other one which is
Doreen team so virtue and dream team
again these just go on so nicely like a
foiled eyeshadow very reminiscent of the
luster shades like firecracker and
what's the other shade in here
firecracker and funny girl in the in
blue palette which by the way I feel
like firecracker is very similar to
dream team but again these are limited
edition shades so they're slightly
different but I feel like if you have
the in bloom and you're just going to
get this particular palette just to have
around and you're not gonna use it for
travel you probably don't need both but
if you really want like a little tiny
version and you didn't get the tartlet
tees palette then this is a really nice
one alright and then the last two shades
we have party and wow which again I
thought these were going to be really
really chalky and gross just by looking
at them but they're actually beautiful
Wow is very Wow and then we have party
which is a gorgeous sort of champagne
shade so here we have Wow and then we
have party so there are they are so
overall I think this palette is very
very consistent which I'm happy to
say again I'm not a fan of the holiday
palettes that Tarte releases and I am
enjoying more and more that they are
releasing more of the Amazonian clay
formula because I think the Amazonian
clay formula is amazing
I think the Amazonian clay blushes are
amazing their face palette that artists
line all that kind of stuff which is
made with the Amazonian clay formula I
think it's really really consistent and
beautiful buttery creamy smells good
and most of all they're not chalky and
they're made here in the USA so they
have good quality ingredients so anyway
I think this is a lovely little palette
especially if you do love your turn lit
in bloom or just your regular tartlet
palette very very similar shades I feel
like you know I feel like Tarte always
does the high-performance Naturals or
neutrals or whatever they always have
very similar shades but if you love your
tartlet palette or your tartlet in bloom
and you want something that you can
carry around in your purse and you
didn't pick up the Tarte lip teeth
palette I think this will be a great
option for you guys so I hope you
enjoyed this little review and swatches
I'll make sure next time to do some
brush swatches for you guys as well
thank you for joining me and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
