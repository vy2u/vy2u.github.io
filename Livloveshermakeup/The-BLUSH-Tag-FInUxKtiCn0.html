channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day if you see me playing with my shirt
it's because it's driving me crazy today
I don't know what it is I just keep it
keeps falling off my shoulders um but
anyway I am here to do the long awaited
blush tag it's not really long-awaited
but a lot of you have been requesting
that I go ahead and do the blush tag
after I did my perfect pallet one and
perfect palette 2 video tag video how
many times did I just say video and tag
anyway I did those videos about two or
three weeks ago and a lot of you were
requesting in the comment section that I
keyed the blush tag I'm super excited I
totally cheated like 20 times over I'm
really apologized there are definitely a
lot of blushes that I like straight up
just I did like two or three blushes per
question but please forgive me I think
it's really difficult like when you're
just thinking one product I feel like a
palette is different because you get
like a whole selection of you know
colors but it's hard to give like a
definitive answer with blushes because
you're literally just picking one color
anyway my friend magnetized me to do
this video she also typed Amy and Vika
and we all have a few people that we
would also like to tag so I have a few
people here I have it on my phone I
would of course love to see any of you
do this tag if you want to do it please
do it let me know that you do it so I
can watch your video but anyway the
people I would personally like to tag
are Katya I would like to tag brie I'd
like to tag Haley Tiffani Rochelle Kayla
Kristin and Jessica I'm going to leave
all of their channel links down below so
you guys can check them out and yeah
let's just get right into this blush tag
like I said I cheated quite a bit but I
hope you guys don't mind all right the
first question is best packaging and I
have a huge amount of answers the first
one being the Too Faced 16-hour
long-lasting blushes these are gorgeous
they come in a little acrylic
heart-shaped container you open it up
and there are two bunnies embossed in
the front looking at each other or
kissing each other I mean that it
doesn't get cuter than that my second
answer would be the Too Faced
sweethearts blushes I love these as well
I think the packaging is so cute it's in
the shape of our hearts you get like
three different strips of color and then
the outer packaging is super cute - it's
like this little cardboard box just
really really enjoy those
and then my third answer my xxx answer
would be the Milani powder blushes I'm
actually wearing this shade today on my
cheeks this is 0ht rose this just comes
in acrylic packaging but it's a gorgeous
rose like embossed on the front
I think that's stunning and then my
fourth and final answer is the Clinique
cheek pops I know a lot of people are
picking this as their answer this is one
of my answers and I really really like
this because we've got a little like
Daisy embossed on the front and even
when you like dig in there it doesn't go
away so really really enjoy those I
think those definitely have the cutest
packaging or best packaging all right
number two is prettiest color this was
another one that was really really
difficult because I feel like I have a
lot of blushes that I think are
absolutely stunning but I narrowed it
down to two the first one being the
Milani baked blush in the shade alumino
so this is just a gorgeous kind of
apricot a peachy gorgeous color it's got
tons of luminous Sheen to it I think
it's beautiful on like every single skin
tone there it is kind of blend it on the
back of my hand
okay but hopefully you guys can see that
I think it's beautiful it really is
flattering on every single skin tone and
skin type I love it and then the second
one is the so Susan universal blush I
think I got this in a glossy box it
looks so plain Jane and boring when you
just look at it but the second you put
it on your cheeks it's so gorgeous it's
like this beautiful rose gold color but
it has a luminous kind of silver sheen
to it instead of a gold chain I think
it's absolutely stunning and I think
that is beautiful I was also going to
pick my L'Oreal cream blush in the shade
rose gold which has more of like a gold
Sheen to it but I narrowed it down to
okay let's just keep going before I
changed my mind
alright the third one is most pigmented
and that has to go to my laura geller
baked gelato vivid swirl blush and
machine to plumbery watch this one swipe
of the finger you see that like whoa
baby
very very pigmented gorgeous deep kind
of berry color really really enjoy this
and I love I love the packaging on this
as well I choose that invest packaging
as well alright moving on the fourth
question is everyday blush and I picked
two the first one is these shades
spellbound from makeup geek I think this
is beautiful it looks a little lighter
in the panic
a little darker on the cheeks it reminds
me a lot of the tarte expose blush but
it has a little more pinky in it then
like nude colors I find out a little
more flattering on my skin tone and I
feel like I can pair this shade with any
sort of like smokey eye or anything like
that I feel like this goes well with
everything so that is my first answer is
the makeup geek spellbound blush and
then my second answer is iam asketh
candy powder blusher I love this color
this is a beautiful comes kind of weird
sorry but I really love that it is a
beautiful cool toned pink color with a
white base like it's very creamy and
almost like camouflages like problems on
your skin it's absolutely stunning I can
give you a fair skin you should
definitely check this out it looks a
little strange on deeper skin tones in
my opinion just because it does have
that white base in there it can look
very like stark white on the cheeks but
if you have a fair-skinned or pale skin
like me you would absolutely love it
it's beautiful and it goes with
everything alright number five is party
blush that would also have to go to an
ela masca blush this is in the shade
thrust and this is like a vivid orchid
color I mean this just says party all
over it so that is my party blush um as
far as regret purchasing that would
definitely have to go to two blushes
here so the first one in this little
palette right here this is the Urban
Decay Naked flush palette it comes with
a blush a highlighter and a bronzer and
the only reason I regret purchasing this
is because I already have the Urban
Decay Naked on-the-run palette and this
has the same exact trio in it so I just
don't really need it and I'm kind of
like why did I get that but I know why I
got it the reason I got it was because
it was on sale for $15 and I couldn't
help myself which now I just feel like a
stupid and I'm like why did it leave
that but anyway that will probably be in
my declutter series when I do that again
in the fall and then the second to
regret is definitely the Kat Von D shade
+ light blush two-tone blush and Sid and
Nancy my friend Mellie is probably
watching this and wants to strangle me
right now because she really likes this
and she really likes the Kat Von D like
brand in general I personally do as well
but these were just absolute crap you
guys can see I got like immediate
hardpan on these which is so gross
you've been asking me to do in hardpan
video like how to get rid of it I would
definitely do that but this is just
gross and then the reason I haven't
gotten rid of the hard fan on this yet
is because I it's just so firmly pressed
like I don't even think you get that
much color I don't think it's that
exciting I'm not really into this blush
at all and I feel like I can't return it
because they actually pulled these from
the sephora.com website so we can't even
get them on there anymore so that's kind
of crazy alright the next question is
least used at least used would have to
go to my color pop blushes I have the
shade clutch and also homie these are
just like a hybrid between you don't
like a cream and powder blush if you
aren't familiar oh my god close this so
tightly I can't open it because they
always say close the lid tightly and
then I do it too tightly but anyway um
clutch is like a hot coral color right
there beautiful color but there this mix
of like a powder and cream and I don't
know what it is I'm not a huge fan of
cream blushes and I'm like why did I buy
those these will probably be my
declutter series as well and then the
other sheet is homie which is like a
beautiful kind of purply color orchid it
kinda reminds me of the Illamasqua
thrust blush alright so the next one is
most-used slash would never let go of
that would have to be might artiste not
artiste I'm sorry this is just the 2014
blush palette from Tarte really really
enjoy this I mean literally every time I
travel I take this with me I love the
color selection in here this is the
blush Becca nuts yeah this is the best
blush palette that they ever released in
my opinion you get a beautiful nude
color a beautiful light pink cool toned
color you get a berry color a coral
color a medium tone color you get
everything in here and I just think it
is honestly the best blush palette and I
would never let go of this ever alright
the next question is a favorite blush
brand so it changes all the time but my
favorite blush brands currently is
definitely the bomb I also have two of
their insane blushes and I believe the
shades are guile and I can't remember
the other one it's like a hot coral but
anyway um here I have to show you guys
hot mama which is kind of like a dupe
for narcissus orgasm I've heard I don't
have Narcisa
it's like a peachy color with gold
shimmer
down boy is a beautiful like cool toned
pink color I feel like these blushes
laughs forever on the cheeks they're
just really beautiful
finally melds easy to work with and then
the last color I have is frat boy which
is kind of like a coral peachy color
really enjoy that
so that was my current favorite brand
and then the next question is greatest
blush discovery of the year that would
definitely have to go to my new Becca
luminous of blushes these are amazing
like it's the best color selection ever
that I've ever seen from a brand this is
the luminous blush in the shade
Snapdragon which is a hot coral and
these are just stunning you guys they
have like the most beautiful beautiful
color and sheen to them and then the
other shade is called Tiger Lily and
this is like a hot Orange it reminds me
a lot of NYX is cinnamon blush but this
has more of a sheen to it really really
adore these like a lot they are
absolutely stunning I have a piece of
fuzz on my nail what are you doing there
like boy alright let me go ahead and
swatch these so we have Tiger Lily
beautiful and then we have Snapdragon
I'm just obsessed I think they're so
beautiful I'm so happy that I found
those and I did a review on them as well
they're just they're amazing I plan on
picking up all of the other colors
alright and then the next question is
most practical most practical but
actually have to go to my new tortoise
or tortoise blush palette I really like
these because I really like this palette
because it is smaller than their holiday
palettes you do get the same formulation
you get a nice arrangement of colors you
have like a big mirror in here and then
the actual blushes are just kind of like
squished together so it's not as hard to
like travel with I like to put this in
my purse and I really love the shades in
here as well and then least practical I
would have to probably say this Stila
aqua color watercolor blush aqua glow
watercolor blush in the shade water lily
you just need a specific sort of brush
for this it's a little messy I'm it does
stain your fingers and it's like a
liquidy sort of blush so this is what it
looks like it's a beautiful color like
don't get me wrong this is a beautiful
blush but it's just kind of messy and I
think it is probably the least practical
out of all the blushes that I currently
Oh
the next one is most expensive that
would have to go to either my Lancome
blush subtil palette or my NARS dual
intensity blush I have this one in
adoration this is the NARS dual
intensity you get like a hot pink and
then like a light pink really really
beautiful I like to pair these together
on the cheeks I believe that is $45 for
the two of those and then my Lancome
blush subdial palettes are I believe 45
or 46 as well this particular one is an
Rose flush you get a contouring shade a
highlight shade and then I gorgeous
gorgeous color in there for a blush that
would probably have to go back to you
best a prettiest color as well as
probably these as well and then this one
is in nectar lace again gorgeous
gorgeous kind of peachy rose gold sort
of color in there alright and then that
last question is blessed yes the last
question is least expensive blush and
that would either have to be my Palladio
blushes or my wedding while it flushes I
believe the Palladio ones are about
$2.99 or 399 on the all talk on website
and I believe the wet and wild color
icons are about the same price so those
would have to be my least expensive
alright guys I hope you enjoyed there's
a blush tag video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow for my vib sale haul from
