my channel today we're going to be
talking all about beginner-friendly
goof-proof eyes shadow palettes this is
your a requested video and even if
you're not a beginner in eyeshadow I
still think that you might want to go
ahead and pick up some of these palettes
because they are really good quality so
the first one I want to talk about is
from Sonia Kashuk if this is the ion and
neutral eyeshadow palette and one of the
reasons why I feel like this is such a
good palette is because the color
selection is very very forgiving if you
were to cover these bottom three shades
right here as you guys can see all of
these are very forgiving colors I feel
like they would work for a lot of
different skin and tones and these are
just really really great so they are all
massive they're very creamy they're very
buildable they're very very pigmented
which is awesome you can use these as
brown shades ease this transition
increase and then liners really really
enjoy this palette would highly
recommend alright next up we have at the
wedding wild eight pan palette in
comfort zone this is an amazing palette
as well now this does not have any sort
of matte shades in here and if you are a
beginner this shade right here at this
shade and this shade might be a little
on the deep side but you do get a pop of
greeny here which is gorgeous and these
are super super pigmented very very
soild they look great on the eyes and I
just would highly recommend checking out
any sort of a shadow College from wet
and wild as far as their shimmers are
concerned they're very buttery really
smooth and they're super well priced
alright next we have a high-end palette
this is the lorac pro 3 the reason why i
feel like this is so great for beginners
is because the shade selection is
excellent so over here you have some
deeper tones but then over here you up
some light cones so if you want to start
with some of the lighter tones and move
to the deeper tones once you feel ready
this is an excellent palette you do have
maps on the top and then you have
shimmers on the bottom you also do get a
pop of color right here so I would
highly recommend this one this is
actually my least favorite out of all of
the pro palettes but like I said I do
think it would be great color selection
wise if you are a beginner alright
moving on we have a little palette here
from Catrice cosmetics this is called
the absolute rose eyeshadow palette I
have really been enjoying this lately I
think it gives very very unison sort of
looks on your eyes so the only shade
that's really really different from one
another is this one right here it's a
little on the chalky side but the actual
pigmentation in here is room
nice because it's not overdone so you
have to light cheese here for brow bone
working into some transitions and also
really nice lip shades and I think that
if you are a beginner you would really
get a kick out of using this because you
really can't make mistakes with this
particular palette so I would highly
recommend that next we have the
chocolate bar palette this is my
favorite one this is the semi-sweet
version the reason why I like this one
so much is because you have a mixture of
cool tones as well as warm tones you
also do get a pop of color in there
which is really fun as well now if you
want a warm tone palette and you want to
try out this formula go for the first
edition if you only want cool tones go
for the bonbons but these are excellent
and probably some of the best eyeshadows
that you will ever find from Too Faced
so I would highly highly recommend this
formula alright moving on we have
another palette here this one is from
Tarte cosmetics this is my all-time
favorite Tarte cosmetics palette besides
their rainforest so to speak collection
those eyeshadows are a little more
difficult to work with so if you are a
beginner I would highly recommend
checking this one out this is the
tartlet in blue matte palette so the
three shades over here can be a little
on the crispy side a little more firmly
pressed it can be a little difficult to
work into the crease and on the outer V
gorgeous all over the lid if you are a
beginner so much have you recommend
using these on your lower lash line if
your going to use them but the rest of
the shades over here are blendable
they're beautiful they're very very
natural-looking and they're very very
beginner friendly so I would highly
recommend checking out this particular
palette my favorite shade is this one
right here which is called firecracker
it is absolutely stunning I love this
you guys see that it's a beautiful kind
of spoiled color with a little bit of
micro glitter in it but the micro
glitter doesn't get all over your face
and there is no fallout with this
palette which is awesome alright the
next one we have here is from Coastal
Scents this is the reveals palette now
this is the first edition I actually
kept this one instead of my naked
palettes because I prefer this one so on
top you get warm tone shades a variety
of finishes and on the bottom you have
more cool tone shades with again a
variety of finishes I think you have to
glitter in few shades in here a lot of
shimmers and quite a few masks so this
is a great beginner friendly College
they have a Volume one they have a
volume two and they also have a volume
three so if you're looking into you know
dupes for like the naked palettes you
want something that is very very
blendable very easy to work with and you
also can get a few pops of color I would
highly recommend this
like there are some swatches for you
guys they can be a little bit on the
powdery side but I feel like it still
works quite well because you kind of
build them up on the eye so I really
really do enjoyed that palette I need to
use this a little more often let me know
if you guys would like me to do a get
ready with me featuring a be revealed
palette and finally the last one I want
to share here is also a little more on
the expensive side it gets dirty so
easily but this is the it cosmetics
naturally pretty eyeshadow palette now
the reason why I feel like this is great
if you are a beginner or if you just
like talipes a blend super easily is
because it blends super easily it's got
a great formula to it you have some nice
warm tone shapes and really really
neutrals over here and then you have
some cool town shades and then something
that's really cool is that because these
are all kind of maps or satins you can
actually take this transforming pearl
shade right here and top it on top of
any of these shape and it will turn more
into a shimmer so it's a great option if
you want something that looks really
really everyday friendly but then you do
want to go ahead and add a little
shimmer on top if you're feeling up to
it and they blend really beautifully
again great color selection and yeah
it's just an awesome palette so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video like I said
let me know if you would like me to do
it get ready with me or full swatch
video on all of these and I guess that
is pretty much it I will see you guys
tomorrow for the limited edition my ass
