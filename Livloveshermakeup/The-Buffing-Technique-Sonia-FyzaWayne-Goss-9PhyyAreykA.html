in this video I'm going to be showing
you guys the Sonia and FISA or also I
guess you could call it the way gas
puffing technique it's not actually
Wayne's a technique he went to show me
on FISA
which is a young makeup artist um I
don't know if she has a YouTube channel
but she does have an Instagram she's
amazing she does amazing makeup and when
we went to one of her little um you know
one of her classes basically her makeup
classes which i think is great i think
it's so sweet he always says you know we
always have something you know more to
learn and I totally agree especially
when it comes to makeup
it's such a fine art and you know you
can really do whatever you want with it
it's a lot of fun you know so new
techniques are discovered basically
every single day like I said he did not
discover this technique she did some
advise I did however he is like
basically distributing it onto the
internet and things like that and has
become very very popular in the past I
would say a couple of weeks to months
maybe like I think he posted this video
about two months ago I will post the
video below so you guys can see the
whole video and I will post a Sonya
advises Instagram below she does not
have a YouTube page I don't believe but
she does have an Instagram and she does
amazing makeup and she's very young I
think she's like around my age like 21
or 22 years old so really really
impressive but basically the technique
is that after you are done applying
everything on your face which I have
done I have applied foundation I have
applied powder I have applied um you
know I'm not using contouring or
anything like that today but you could
use contouring I've applied blush
highlight after you've applied
everything onto your face the thought is
that you go in with a buffing brush so
I'm using my it cosmetics um this is the
little mini Buki buffing brush it's
really really nice and soft and have a
black talk so she and he both recommend
using a buffing brush and you go into
any powder um it could be the powder
that you use to set your makeup it could
be a loose translucent powder it can be
you know so it can be pressed or it can
be um you know a setting powder but
basically what you do is you go into
their tape pick up a lot of crowd
and you start buffing it into your skin
on top of everything you've just done it
sounds like it's going to be very very
cakey on the skin and it's not going to
look good however it looks really really
good it makes the skin appear completely
completely airbrushed it's beautiful so
anyway I'm going to show you guys how
it's done just so you guys know I am
wearing a full heavy duty coverage
foundation today I'm wearing the Estee
Lauder Double Wear it is actually my
first time wearing it today I picked it
up yesterday I'll be showing that in the
hall today um but basically I am wearing
that today I am wearing under eye
concealer I have on this hello flawless
from benefit powder in I love me ivory
and that has some coverage in it as well
I have everything on my face and now I'm
going to go back in and do the buffing
technique so I just want you guys to see
that it's not going to move my makeup
you know that was the first saw and he
you know explained that on the video he
said when he was in the class watching
Sonia advice' doing or Sonia I guess her
name is watching her do the actual
technique when she went back in for the
powder to do the buffing at the end he
thought well that's going to be way too
much product it's going to move around
on her face but it didn't so and I
promise you it really doesn't which is
amazing and I wear quite a bit of face
makeup so take it from me it does not
move the product around don't be worried
so anyway I used my hello
flawless from benefit today to set my
makeup so that's actually what I'm going
to use for this buckle tea technique as
well this does have a little bit of
coverage in it it doesn't matter if it's
a pressed powder if it has coverage no
coverage if it's translucent I've tried
it with a lot of different powders now I
like it with a lot of different things
so um you know I like it with pressed I
like it with the elf HD powder it looks
really beautiful as long as you have the
right kind to brush the right kind of
buffing brush you know like a flat top
really really thick kind of brush that
you know really kind of can buff it into
the skin but still has a little bit of
like um you know can still kind of move
a little bit you see it's not completely
done then you should be able to do this
technique so it really doesn't matter
what power you use anyway so I'm going
to go back into this benefit powder and
I'm just going to swirl that around
completely cover the brush and I'm going
to start really buffing it into my skin
so
you can see I'm doing small little like
circular movements across the skin I am
one of those people that when I apply
powder I press it on so this kind of
technique was like I'm so scared is
going to be moving and you know my
foundation around it's going to be
taking away coverage it doesn't at all
so anyway so I'm just blending that in
I'm gonna keep going back into the
powder and just doing the same movement
across the whole face you guys can kind
of already see this part is so blended
in the blush looks really really natural
whereas over here it still looks a
little like stripy or like a line across
my cheeks and that's how I would
normally wear it but this side looks so
blended and beautiful and just like a
flesh you know like the highlight is
just kind of glowing out of the skin
everything looks beautiful
you're basically putting a power filter
on top of everything so it's you know
you can definitely see the difference I
think and so I'm going to continue on
this side and I'm applying probably a
medium amount of pressure I'm not really
really like full you know to a point
where the brush is like completely
bending but I'm also not doing it
lightly like this you really do want to
blend it in so you know use about medium
pressure okay so here we go on the
forehead
and you guys can see like it looks so
smooth and airbrushed my skin just looks
so like so much better than it did
before and especially like if you
compare it to my chest it just looks so
so so nice and smooth so I'm going to
continue doing that I know very oh it's
kind of like taking when you take like a
powder puff and you tap it in you know
to certain areas like where pores are
and it just disappears this does the
same exact thing so you want to make
sure that you have enough powder on the
actual brush and you just want to keep
blending it in you just blend everything
in so seamlessly do you see that like it
looks like my skin is like not skin it
looks like a deer brushed and that's
what he was saying in real lights the
model that she did this on at the actual
event or the class looked like she was
airbrushed in real life so it's like
putting a filter basically on your face
in real life see if I can already see
like you can't it just looks like it's
so smooth you know so I'm going to go in
one more time to the powder and just
keep blending and buffing that in and
I've just been really really liking this
technique lately I think it just gives
such a flawless look especially on
camera too you know when you're like HD
things like that in this incredible
florescent lighting you know it still
looks really really good so anyway I've
done the whole face now and you guys can
see the blush just looks very very
natural like it's just kind of coming
through the skin you can compare it to
the skin on my neck and my chest which
looks a lot more blotchy this just looks
very very airbrushed and again I am
wearing a heavy duty foundation today
but I don't have any concealer on
except for you know near my eyes in a
little triangle shape but this really
just blends everything together
seamlessly
it makes the blush look really natural
not like you have like a stripe on the
cheek and you know it just it gives like
a layer like a veil on top of the makeup
you just did so anyway that is what
everything looks like after you have
blended it in like that as you can see
nothing has moved on my skin you can
still see the blush you can still see
the highlight everything looks the same
except it just looks a little more like
filtered you know like there's like a
like a veil on top of my skin so anyway
um that is the buffing technique I will
link the videos below where Wayne talks
about it where he demos it but I really
see a difference when I do it especially
on camera too and in photos I really see
a difference in the way it looks before
and after like if I do half of my face
and then not the other half I can really
see and I think it just makes the blush
really blended nicely and looks so so
natural so anyway that is the buffing
technique I hope you guys enjoyed this
if you did give it a thumbs up and see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
