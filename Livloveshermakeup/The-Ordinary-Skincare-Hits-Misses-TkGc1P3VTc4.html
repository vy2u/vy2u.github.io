channel today's video is going to be a
hits and misses on the ordinary skincare
brand so not the whole entire brands I
did pick up five products to try out
first I'm interested in trying out their
foundations let me know there are other
skincare products you would like me to
try out from the brand as well but out
of the five that I did pick up I love
three of them and the other two I'm not
so crazy about so I thought I would do
hits and misses this is a really cool
brand basically they have very very
basic packaging and the reason for that
is because they don't put any money
practically into their packaging so they
are able to give you quality ingredients
for a fraction of the price and let me
tell you some of the stuff really does
work so anyway like I said I purchase
all this on beauty Lycia calm the first
item I got was the lactic acid 5%
treatment for six dollars and fifty
cents I also got the rose hip seed oil
which does retail for nine dollars and
80 cents next I got the bo face serum
but this comes in at a whopping fourteen
dollars and eighty cents which is
expensive for the ordinary line in my
opinion next we do have the hyaluronic
acid + b5 serum right here this retails
for $6.95 basically just a chemical sort
of exfoliant it's a really really
wonderful product I do find this to be
very comparable to the Sunday Riley good
jeans some people say it's very
comparable some people say it's not this
one is even stronger in my opinion I
know they also do have a 10% version but
what I do is I take a full dropper full
of this and I will use this twice a week
I like to apply to my decollete on my
neck of my chest in upward stroking
motions and then also apply it on my
face avoiding my lips and my eye area
you have to be careful with um you know
exfoliating or skin thinners like this
so I take a little bit of that apply it
all over and I really enjoy it I feel
like it does a very very good job of
exfoliating the skin it's kind of like
like colic acid where it goes in and it
tones up and helps with any texture that
you may have and I don't really notice
the difference in fine lines or wrinkles
because mostly I'm not using it in that
area but overall it's very good for
helping to control oil as well as
breakout so if you do have combination
skin oily skin even dry skin I would
highly recommend this if you do have
sensitive skin you have to be careful
with this because
lactic acid it can be quite strong on
the actual face now like I said I only
use it twice a week and I always always
always follow up with a moisturizer or a
nice cold pressed oil because you know
you want to make sure that you have a
little bit of a moisture barrier there
when you're literally going in and
exfoliating your skin that deep but this
is an awesome awesome product you guys
and I really do think it is comparable
to be good jeans so I have been loving
that now we do have the second favorite
product like I said this is the 100%
organic cold-pressed rosehip seed oil
it's amazing that they can sell this for
nine dollars and 80 cents they also do
have a virgin Barilla oil which I'm very
very interested in as you guys can see I
have used probably about half of this
I've been following up with practically
every single serum or treatment that I
purchased I've been following up with
this because I just feel like when you
are using a treatment like that whether
it be an acne treatment cells that like
acid benzoyl peroxide glycolic acid or
something that's more exfoliating you
have to really really be careful you
want to make sure there is a moisture
barrier there so that you can protect
your skin so I've been going in with a
full dropper full of this again I take
it on at my decollete of my neck upward
stroke emotions all around my face on my
lips I take it around my eye area it's a
beautiful very moisturizing and very
very calming I love products that have
rose in it very calming very beautiful
and it's just something I've really been
enjoying so that is great and like I
said I always pair together the two of
these so I don't like to go in with any
sort of like toner with this or any sort
of treatment or like my Peter Thomas
Roth unwrinkled peel pads never ever
ever this I used by itself because it's
so strong and then I follow up with the
rose hip seed oil all right and then the
last product that I've really been
enjoying is the buffet serum now the
buffet serum is a multi technology
peptide serum with a ceramides built in
this is beautiful and you can wear this
in the morning as well as nighttime if
you want to wear any of these during the
daytime you need to follow up with
sunscreen I really wouldn't recommend it
this guy right here like the hyaluronic
acid the oil you obviously can wear
during the day but the more treatments I
would highly recommend using at
nighttime this I will use probably about
three times a week and when I first use
this I got some chemical burns I got a
little bit of an allergic reaction and
I'm not pretty sure what it wasn't here
that was bothering me this is something
that a lot of people recommend because
it's actually very nice and moisturizing
on the skin
for some reason I woke up with dried
shacked areas it really made my skin
peel and no it was not the lactic acid
because I used this for one week and
then I went with this so that I could
really see how the products were working
by themselves and unfortunately I was
just a little sensitive to this at first
so now I only use her three times a week
I know people use this every single day
there are a lot of people with normal
skin compo skin oily skin dry skin that
can for me you just have to go with what
your skin tells you if you wake up and
you've got chemical burns on your face
honey you need to slow down with that
skin care you know don't hurt your skin
if something's not working for you other
people say oh use it five times a week
you just have to do what's right for
your skin so if you wake up with a
little bit of irritation slow down
dilute the product or go in with some
sort of an oil or something so that you
can really repair your skin but anyway
the buffet is really beautiful I do like
what it does for my skin because after a
few days of using it I noticed that my
skin is glowing absolutely glowing it's
like nice fresh skin and after the
peeling process is done which this one
does give me a little bit of peeling but
not so much like red peeling burn
sometimes this can give me a little bit
of more irritation this one just makes
me get a little flaky on the skin this
one full-on like gives me a new face
like my face flakes off like a damn
snake okay but it's good it really does
work so I'm not having that problem
every time I use it now it was just
initially when I started it but this is
a beautiful product and I would highly
recommend again when I use this I always
always go in and follow up with a
moisturizer on oil I love this oil
because it's so calming and it's so
beautiful on the skin and again I use
one a full pump of this or one dropper
full and I apply that upward stroke
emotions on my neck my decollete my
chest and my face I will also take this
around my eye area I avoid my lip area
just because I do find a little bit of
tingling sensations but yeah it's a good
one it really does work even though it
gave me a little bit of a reaction at
first it is something that is working
alright now for the products that I
really don't notice that big of a
difference with the first one is the
ordinary hyaluronic acid 2% plus B of 5
so this is nice okay it's nice you guys
can see I've used quite a bit of this I
use this in the morning I'll use it at
night I'm on the days where I'm noticing
my skin is kind of peeling a little bit
and I don't want to be using the lactic
acid treatment at nighttime or I don't
want to be using the buffet serum home
with a little bit of this and then I'll
go on with the oil so basically
hyaluronic acid binds in the
moisture that you already have in your
skin so it's nice it's just not a true a
moisturizer and I knew that because I
have tried at the Polish choice
hyaluronic acid I have tried the skin
diva hyaluronic acid it's got a very
very sticky thick buoyant texture to it
and it's beautiful on the skin but for
some reason this one was too sticky I
don't know if it's because it has the b5
actually infused in there but I have
tried different formulations that I
prefer like the skin debo one which like
that was a brand that's like an
Instagram brand they sent me their
products Mel's like there's no way that
these are going to be good like these
will probably begin product fails videos
because they just seem like such a weird
like a promotion kind of but you know
like morphe sort of like Instagram brand
I wasn't into it but their products were
actually really good so I love their
hyaluronic acid I'm gonna repurchase
that with my own money this one was just
a little too thick and sticky and tacky
I did not like that I put it on in the
morning and then I had to wait a good 15
to 20 minutes for this to sink in before
I could go in with my moisturizer so for
me it's just one of those things
especially because I was using it mostly
in the morning I didn't like it you can
go ahead and use like the lactic acid
treatment use this as a serum and then
go in with like the rose hip seed oil if
you want to but again this takes forever
to sink in so it's just not something I
like and I would not repurchase alright
and then the other product that did not
work for me is this guy so this is the
ordinary stable emulsion retinol 1% I
don't like this because it's filled with
Tibet ago and it's got silicon in it and
I don't like silicon because I can't
layer products on top of silicon because
when you have that slippery barrier it's
very hard for an oil or any other serum
to actually penetrate the skin so you
can go in with an oil and then put this
on but that's not really going to work
because you know when you use oils you
want to put the oil on last because it's
very hard for serums to actually
penetrate oils so that's why oils are
usually put on last in your skincare
routine well the thing about this is
that the silicone just creates this
barrier where I can't put anything on
top of it so although it does have
retinol 1% which can be quite strong and
can be quite irritating I can't put any
kind of moisture barrier on top of that
because it won't do anything I've tried
I went in with like a moisturizer I
tried going in with this oil it just
felt like this thick layer of silicon
and disgustingness on my face it was not
something I was a fan of I did get a
little irritated with this retinol 1%
because 1% is actually a decent amount
of retinol I do have a
prescription for retinol as well and
I've tried different ones from Peter
Thomas Roth all sorts of different
brands I've tried the Luna oil retinol
all that kind of stuff but this is a
pretty large amount and yet irritated my
skin but there was nothing I could do
about it
because I didn't feel like the
moisturizer that I was putting on top
was sinking in after it so I just don't
I I think that this is good retinol I
think it will do a good job but I just
don't like the format that they put it
in I don't like that slippery silicone
like sort of texture so that is why I
don't like it I would much rather use my
luna oil I would much rather use
something that's built into like a
moisturizing sort of formula so yeah
didn't really like that but anyway if
you guys are wondering about pairings
like I said the lactic acid I always
paired together with some sort of an oil
and you always want to wait for this to
completely sink in so you don't want to
feel the sticky tacky formula you wanted
to kind of sink and completely then
follow up with a moisturizer or an oil I
would not recommend layering this with
anything else
no glycolic acid no benzoyl peroxide
don't even wash your face with like a
salicylic acid treatment this is very
very strong so Watchers wash your skin
with something very very basic put this
on and then follow up with an oil and
then as far as the buffet serum is
concerned I can layer that together with
say the hyaluronic acid b5 serum I can
layer it together with the oil I don't
have too much issues with that but I
would not recommend doing the buffet and
the lactic acid at the same time I just
don't feel like that works out well for
me so mostly what I've been doing is
just taking the serums on separate days
and using what I feel I need my skin
needs so I don't say Oh Monday Wednesday
Thursday I'm going to use this no I just
look at my skin and I say hey what does
it need does it need a little bit of
exfoliation if it does I'll go in with
the lactic acid if it needs a little
more of retexturizing and helps with
breakouts all that kind of stuff I will
go in with a buffet serum and I think it
needs a really big whopping dose of
moisture all going with these guys so
anyway that is it guys I think these are
pretty impressive products overall very
impressed with that lactic acid
treatment it is badass in my opinion
will not be repurchasing at the Sunday
Riley good jeans because I think this is
just as good and yeah really really good
prices so let me know what you have
tried from the ordinary down below let
me know if you would like me to try
other products and that is pretty much
it
thank you for joining me bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
