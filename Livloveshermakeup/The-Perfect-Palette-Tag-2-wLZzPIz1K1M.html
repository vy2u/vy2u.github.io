this video I am doing the perfect
palette tag number two in my perfect
palette original tag video I mean no
sense in the perfect palette item number
one I asked you guys if you would like
to see number two and a lot of you said
yes so there are eight different
questions and let's just get right into
it the first one is eyeliner brush or
nothing in your palette so I definitely
don't like having nothing I don't really
like having brushes either because I
feel like they're either a hit or a Miss
so I would definitely say eyeliner
because I feel like the eyeliners that
come with like the urban decay pilots
are really good the steal of palettes
those are really good the waterproof
eyeliners so yeah I would definitely
have to say eyeliner okay question
number two a makeup palette that you
have hit pan on or a pellet you have hit
pan on so I did show this in the perfect
palette tag number one video this is the
Too Faced and natural eye and I have hit
pan on several shades in here these
three right here I completely use this
shade up I hit pan here here and then
the middle row I am about to hit pan if
you guys can see when I turn it it's
like there's Big Dance so yeah that is
the B palette that I have hit pan on
question and number three favorite Naked
palette I hated the Naked palette so
instead I'm going to show you guys my
favorite alternative to the naked
palettes but yes I did pick up all three
of them I didn't pick up the smokey
because I was just like you know what
I've tried it three times now I hate
these salads so anyway yes I did have a
naked one two and three I did give them
away to a friend but instead of the
Naked palette
I love these revealed palettes from
Coastal Scents so this is just the
regular revealed palette this is what it
looks like I highly highly recommend and
then the revealed palette number two has
more of like the pinky tones like the
what was it Naked palette 2 was a to
note 3 Naked palette 3 like those rosy
tones so I highly recommend checking
these out but yeah I would not pick any
of the naked palettes alright question
number 4 favorite holiday or limited
edition palettes that we definitely have
to go to my Urban Decay vice of for
palette this was beautiful
I really really love this one this week
I've been playing around with the Urban
Decay reloaded palette but I prefer this
one you just have some gorgeous gorgeous
jewel tones
I mean look at this color right here
these two are my favorite flame and
fastball like gorgeous gorgeous colors
and I feel like the pigmentation is
there just some really really beautiful
colors so this is definitely my favorite
limited edition holiday palette is the
exact shade it are the next shade the
Mexico uestion is let's see here a
palette you would repurchase or wish you
had a backup of so that would have to go
to my Fiat a London Olivia Palermo
collaboration palette this is the
smoldering eye palette I really want to
get oh and as I said if it is no longer
available say or not I think this is
still available but yeah I really want
to back up up this it's so tiny and
sleek and purse friendly it's got
beautiful packaging and then the colors
in there are just so like everyday we're
like friendly like they're so creamy and
pigmented beautiful colors I really
really think they're gorgeous any eye
color if you wear these I feel like
they're easy to blend they're easy to
work with on aging skin dry skin all
kinds of eyelids I just love that
palette and I would definitely
repurchase another one of those because
I think it's so travel friendly and
gorgeous alright the next question is a
shady wish was sold individually and
that would go to the bareMinerals ready
eyeshadow 8.0 palettes in bipasha
neutrals there is a shade in here called
I have to look on the back hold on is it
right there
I think this is called sizzle it's this
one right here can you guys see not that
one and this one right here it is
absolutely absolutely stunning I love
all the colors in here don't get me
wrong but this is like a topi dirty like
gold color and it almost has like a
greenish taupe undertone I just think
it's absolutely stunning I wish this was
sold individually it actually may be
sold individually I don't know I have
not checked it out but I do like these
little bare minerals um i shadow
palettes I have a two of these and this
one is in the posh neutrals really
really cute adorable packaging but that
color is amazing alright the next
question is wild card pick a question
from the original perfect palette tag to
answer again so I'm going to answer
again best packaging and this time
I actually was a completely different
one this is the two-faced pretty rebel
pilot I love this palette I love the way
it looks it's like gold and then has all
these little strappy things going on
it's like textured it's just so
beautiful I mean the shades in here are
gorgeous as well this is what it looks
like on the inside but I just love the
packaging of this I just think this is
so cute and very like rebel ish all
right and then the last question is the
palette you would recommend to a friend
and that would have to be this Laura
Mercier artist palette for eyes and
cheeks this is beautiful very very sleek
it's got a little magnetic closure you
open it up and the reason I would
recommend this is because it has a tie
shadows in here and a gorgeous gorgeous
blush they're very very neutral colors
they're very buttery and easy to blend
they're beautiful you get like taupe
sand navy blues and then the blush in
there is absolutely stunning as well so
yes this is the palette that I would
definitely recommend to a friend because
it's so travel friendly and I feel like
anybody could get use out of it because
the color selection is so neutral and
gorgeous alright guys that was the
perfect palette to tag like I said I
take all of you anybody who wants to do
this and I hope you enjoyed it see you
guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
