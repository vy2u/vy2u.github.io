so excited for this video I am finally
doing the perfect palate tag so the
person who created this tag was Melissa
uh I love faces 1 0 4 Q she created this
tag two years ago with her daughter Kate
and I will link her video down below I
have actually been watching her for
years like over three years now and I
remember when she created this tag video
and she has since created a perfect
palette to tag so if you guys would like
me to use that tag video let me know
down below in the comments as well but
I've personally tagged by Meg Bernardo
here on YouTube I'm gonna go ahead and
leave her video and her channel down
below
I do have oh my god I literally just
pulled like a chunk of my hair out do
you have a few people that I want to tag
myself and I would love for any of you
guys to do this or let me know what your
answers are below in the comment section
but the people I would personally like
to tag are Amy
amy has not been tagged two times by Meg
and by me so she better do this tag the
second person I want to tag is Tiffany
the third is Katya the fourth is Vika
the fifth is Kayla the sixth is Rachelle
and then I also want to tag Janna so if
you guys are watching I would love for
you to do this tag video and yeah let's
just get right into it
so the first question is best packaging
alright so this was really hard for me
at first I thought it was going to be
the Too Faced sugar pop palette because
they have like little macaroons on it
it's just adorable and then I changed my
mind and I was like you know what no
it's the Smashbox on the rocks palette
because this was beautiful too like
super gorgeous and then I was like you
know what no it's definitely the vice 4
palette and then I was like no Olivia
you have to pick one and if I were had
to pick one out of all of them it would
be the tartlet in bloom so this is my
answer
it is definitely the tartlet in bloom I
think this is a gorgeous and gorgeous
palette you get this gorgeous like gold
thing going on in the back and then this
looks like flower petals to me I don't
know everybody sees it differently but I
personally think it looks like flower
petals I think it's not amazing
packaging too because you get a huge
mirror and then of course you get all of
these gorgeous shades so yes best
packaging as far as I'm concerned even
though it took me
- like narrow it down I would say is the
tartlet in bloom palette alright the
second question is best color payoff so
that would definitely have to go to my
lorac Pro palette I just think the lorac
Pro formula is amazing these are so
pigmented like literally I don't like I
don't even know what to say these are so
pigmented and beautiful I just think
they have the best pigmentation out of
any palette that I own I would say my
lorac palette sorry my nose is still a
little sniffling I would say that my
lorac palettes have to be the most
pigmented all right the third question
is the most versatile and that would
also have to go to a lorac palette this
is the lorac mega pro 2 palette I feel
like this is the most versatile because
you get two rows of mattes you get two
rows of shimmers and on top of that you
get these like colors in here that you
normally don't see in palettes like a
forest green color and that beautiful
view
and you just get neutral color so you
get warm tones you get cool tones I feel
like you get everything in this palette
and that is why I personally think it is
the most versatile and I have to say
LeBrock it's amazing with their
packaging because like this is so travel
friendly as well alright the next
question is best for traveling and I
would pick the lorac Pro palette but I
have to admit there is one palette that
I like a little more for traveling and
that is my Urban Decay Naked on the run
palette the reason I love this so much
is because first of all it's got a huge
ass mirror and then you also get a
deluxe size mascara in here this is I
don't know if I can show you guys this
without tipping it over but you get a
deluxe size of the perversion mascara
you get a deluxe size at the Urban Decay
24/7 glide on pencil in the shade stag
and then you get a full-size lipgloss
you get five eyeshadows a bronzer a
blush and a highlight like this pretty
much has everything in it hopefully you
guys can see that and I just feel like
it's so perfect for travel because you
literally have your mascara your
eyeshadow your blush your highlight
everything in here so yes my Urban Decay
Naked on the run is definitely my
favorite for traveling alright the next
one is biggest regret biggest regret
would definitely have to go to my visor
or visi art school mats palette this is
in 0-7 cool maps and I've talked about
this a lot and I've gone back and forth
with um decide
whether or not I want to keep it or
return it but I'm going to keep it and
see if I can kind of get a little more
use out of it but yes this is definitely
my biggest regret I just don't like the
way a hold on a sec my alarm is going on
but I just don't like the way that these
go on to the eyes they just take a lot
of effort to blend and I'm just I'm not
into it alright moving on let's see here
biggest regret best color names would
definitely have to go to my Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette these
are the cutest color names ever you have
spread the love you have bananas extra
creamy jelly nuts about you jammin
peanut brittle peanut butter and peanut
butter cups like come on that's way too
cute so yes best names we definitely
have to go to the little um two-faced
peanut butter nine pan palette alright
the next one is least you it's at least
used would definitely have to go to this
laura geller palette this is the
wearables color story baked eyeshadow
palette it's a beautiful beautiful
palette but I've never reached for it
and I'm like why don't you reach for
this look how gorgeous it is these
colors are absolutely stunning like
these two blue shades here oh my god
like look at that beautiful colors I
don't know why I don't reach for this
more often so yeah this is definitely
the palette that I reach for the least
and I wish I would reach for it a little
more often than I do alright the next
one is most used or I mean wait I did
Lisa used most use yes most use would
definitely be my Too Faced natural eye
palette this is what it looks like I
have hit pan on quite a few shades in
here as you guys can probably tell I
paint pan right here right here I've
used this one up completely and then I'm
almost about to hit pan on these three
shades right here so yeah this is
definitely my most used I feel like it's
so versatile and neutral everyday
friendly sort of palette I love these
and love the Too Faced 9 can palettes
I'm obsessed alright the next one is
most loved and that would definitely
have to go to my Too Faced return of
sexy palette are you guys seeing a trend
here I'm obsessed with Too Faced anyway
I love the Too Faced return a sexy
palette this is my all-time favorite
palette a lot of people don't like this
palette I personally do the mirror
always falls out but this is what it
looks like you get like these little
quiz here so
you have like a warm tone one you have
like a kind of cool smoky one over here
and then a cool tone purple one here
these are so pigmented and easy to blend
they're so easy to use so beautiful on
the eyes I just love this eye shadow
palette so yeah that'd be my most loved
and the final question is a desert
island what palette would you bring on a
desert island and it would definitely be
my Too Faced 9 pan palette this is the
natural matte I love this I've used this
a lot I love the colors in here you can
create every sort of I look with this
palette so yeah that would be my desert
island palette I hope you guys enjoyed
this little tag video on the perfect
palette tag I love this tag if you guys
would like me to do the perfect palette
