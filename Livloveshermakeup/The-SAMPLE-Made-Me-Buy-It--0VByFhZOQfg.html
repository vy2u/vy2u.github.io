my channel today I wanted to walk you
guys through some products that I
literally purchase the full sides of
because I tried out to the little mini
sample either impacted form or deluxe
size form and I loved it so much that I
purchased the full size so let's go
ahead and jump right into it I'm gonna
start with the product that I don't feel
like I talked about on my channel all
that often or maybe ever but this is the
it cosmetics the Genesee qua lip
treatment now this is amazing I think I
got this about two years ago yeah two
years ago that I long for a lip product
but I believe I got this around two
years ago and now that you are having
some sort of a deal on the Alta con
website or maybe it was in store at Ulta
it was like when it cosmetics first
launched at Ulta and I remember them
having these tiny little deluxe sized
samples of vision s and qualit balm and
this is totally one of those weird of
products you guys can see it kind of
looks see-through in the actual tube and
actual product is kind of like this
white color when you actually put it on
to your skin I don't even know if it's
gonna show up on my hand but it kind of
interacts with the warmth of your body
and it turns into this really really
beautiful muted pink color on the lips
it's kind of like your lips but better
product it is very very nice it's very
smooth on the lips very very hydrating
and immediately when I tried out the
little deluxe eye sample I knew I wanted
a full size so that is definitely the
first product and if you guys really
want to try this out but you don't want
to spend the money I highly would
recommend checking out the elf lip glow
this one is honestly way better in my
opinion you can see it has the same sort
of thing going on here a little bit of
like a light pink color you put it onto
the lips it definitely has a little more
of a waxy consistency a little more
slip-and-slide and then there's Genesee
co-op but it's absolutely beautiful on
the lips I love the color I love the
feeling these are just some really
really cool lip products and they are
definitely a product that I purchased
after trying at the sample alright up
next we have some more lip products here
so they turned lip surgence a little
sticks I actually have a lot of these in
my collection now when I do my big lip
declutter and just might do cutters in
general which I plan on starting very
soon for you guys I definitely need to
declutter some of the little minis here
so these little minis I got in a holiday
set probably about two years ago again
kind of a long time for lip products
these probably need to go but they don't
smell weird they don't have a different
texture or anything like that I'm very
very careful when my makeup does go bad
I always make sure I toss it out but I
have these little minis here this one
right here is called jazzy this one is
under this one is a little more of a
different finish this one has the glossy
finish this one right here I'm a little
more of a matte finish they also have
the deluxe ice samples this one right
here which is called tarts flush is
beautiful and then you have the full
sizes and after trying these little
minis I went ahead and purchased quite a
few of the full sizes I really don't
reach for these as often as I would like
to you in my collection but I still
think they're really really awesome and
I definitely purchased the full size
because of the level of deluxe size and
minis alright guys I'm moving on let's
talk about the Beca first like priming a
filter now I don't actually have my hair
to show you guys because I literally
just put it on my face before filming
this video it is sitting upstairs but if
you watch my video so far you know that
I do have a full size of this now I do
have a full size of the back light
priming filter I'm really not a big fan
of this I feel like it leaves a very
artificial look to the skin and I just
don't like that but the first light
priming filter after trying this little
deluxe sides right here from Ulta I for
sure purchased it I don't regret it one
bit I don't know if I would repurchase
it again just because I'm definitely a
little more normal dry skin down here
and this is really a good primer if you
are a little more combo oily at least a
little bit of a sticky or tacky finish
to the skin which is great too because
it will make sure and then your a
foundation adheres to your face all day
long so this is definitely something
that I purchase they both sides after
trying the samples they do a lot of
these little samples at Ulta as well as
the luxe eyes sample so I highly highly
recommend checking it out this one's
great if you have more and normal to dry
skin I still don't like it cuz like I
said it leaves a little bit of a
plastered look on the skin which I'm not
a huge fan of but I would recommend the
first light if you have more combo to
oily alright up next guys we have a
blush here ignores cosmetics so I did a
try this out when I did my full face of
samples challenge so I did my whole
entire face using only skincare and
makeup samples and I loved the NARS
orgasm blush so I purchased a full size
not the biggest fan of this anymore
there's a lot of NARS products in my
collection that I hadn't really
decluttered unfortunately if you guys
hadn't heard the news that NARS
cosmetics is no longer cruelty free they
decided to go ahead and sell their soul
and start selling in China so
unfortunately a lot of the products that
I have from them although some of them I
really love like the NARS Velvet lip
lines and also their skin tint and
things like that there's a few of them
in my collection where I'm like I think
I might declutter this so I think this
will go to my friend Brittany I think
she would really get a kick out of
getting this
it's a beautiful color nice kind of
peachy gold color it appears a little
more rosy on this game to be completely
honest if you're a little more fair
complected it's a beautiful color but I
feel like it is do pible and again it
like I said I'm just not super
comfortable with having a ton of NARS in
my collection as of right now are we
moving on we have some products here
from Urban Decay I did try out two these
sample there was this little sheet of
five different Urban Decay color
correcting fluids before I purchase
before I purchased before I purchased a
full sizes so I do have yellow I have
green I have lavender I do have the
peach color as well as pink and these
are absolutely beautiful you guys these
are the best color correctors you will
ever get your hands on they will work
for all sorts of different skin types as
well as skin tones it really really is a
good color correcting up formula so I
tried out the little sheep a hat all
five of them and they were very creepy I
felt like urban decay house is really
really nice um samples which I know
might sound kind of weird but I did a
video all about samples that are nothing
like the full size and there are
definitely some brands out there that
kind of false advertising make their
samples a little different a little
differently than their full sizes and
that could be just because they are in
different packaging but I definitely
notice some discrepancies but I will say
the Urban Decay color correcting fluid
in the little paper form are very
similar to the full sizes absolutely
love those also this guy right here
which is the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion in the anti-aging version
you guys may have gotten that little
bubble sheet where you get to try out
all six of the Urban Decay eye primers
and this one definitely caught my
attention have a little more of a smooth
effect to it and I really like the way
it goes over my eyelid so I would
recommend this does have a little bit of
retinol so make sure you are wearing
sunscreen and then also I feel like I
try out a lot of deluxe sized mascaras
and I do end up purchasing the full
sizes now I will say the Urban Decay
perversion
definitely caught my attention the
second that I tried out the deluxe size
sample it's a really really wet formula
so if you're not into that if you're not
really into those clumpy lashes you may
not like this but this is a great
mascara if you do like more waterproof
formula and you don't like mascara that
does too much throughout the day again
this is not for you but it's a great
formula for me personally I love the
clumping
and the definition that it gives to my
lashes and I'm very happy that I
purchased a full-size and finally guys
look ahead and end with a blush here
from the balm cosmetics so recently the
balm cosmetics did send over a really
really generous PR package to me I will
be doing a best and worst of the balm
cosmetics for you guys hopefully next
week but this guy right here I've
actually had in my collection for three
or four years again no nothing's going
wrong with it I mean the smell is the
same the texture is still the same I
don't have any issues here but this is
the beautiful long-lasting blush and I
originally tried this out and this tiny
little like it was like this like the
packaging but like a little box now this
was the strangest saying but I used to
live in a Manhattan if you guys didn't
know I went to school in Manhattan so I
lived there for five years and they have
a drugstore they're called Duane Reade
inside of Duane Reade they sold the balm
cosmetics or I guess I think in like a
few different wineries they sold the
balm cosmetics and they have these
little tiny deluxe sizes so you could
try out the hot mama
you know bronzer you can try this guy
out you could also try out some of the
different these products that they have
from the balm cosmetics I tried this out
and I instantly fell in love it's
gorgeous if you are a little more fair
complected this cool toned pink color is
really really beautiful so yeah that's
pretty much it alright guys so those
aren't products that I definitely
purchase any full-size because I tried
the sample and I fell in love with them
let me know if you have any products
like this in your collection and I guess
I will see you guys tomorrow I plan on
doing a little bit of an alternative
video or a dupe video for the Lila
palette the Natasha de Nona I think I
found two unaltered to here and that is
only around eighteen or twenty dollars
from j-cap beauty so I just wanted to
give you guys a heads up but I'm pretty
sure that will be tomorrow's video thank
you so much for joining me guys
and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
