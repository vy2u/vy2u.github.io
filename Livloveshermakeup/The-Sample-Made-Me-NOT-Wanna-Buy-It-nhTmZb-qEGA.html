today's video is going to be all about
samples that made me not want to
purchase the full size product now I
have done a lot of sample videos before
like my full face of only samples video
which I'll throw up in the cards as well
as a video all about samples that are
nothing like the full size which I think
I filmed about six months ago I need to
do part two on that particular video but
I'll also throw that up in the cards but
yeah I thought today maybe it would be
fun to talk about deluxe sized samples
that I've tried out that initially I
thought oh my god they get so much hype
I'm probably really gonna like this and
purchase it into full size but I ended
up not liking it and I definitely will
not purchase it at full size so let's go
ahead and start with these two little
deluxe sized samples right here these
are both primers one is high-end one is
drugstore if this is the wet and wild
photo focused face primer and this is
the bare minerals primetime original
foundation primer this is about as basic
as it gets I could not believe the price
tag on this it reminds me of like the
baby skin primer or any sort of silicone
based primer the only silicon based
primer that I feel like really really
has something extra to it or like a
little extra moisture or something
special going on there it's definitely
the Smashbox photo-finish face primer I
just really really personally liked that
one for my dry skin but this is
incredibly basic I mean it's like it's
basic as it gets when it comes to a
primer and I heard so many different
booty oil it's talking about this insane
that they loved it I personally will
just not purchase this in a full size
because I don't think it's worth the
money and then when it comes to the
photo focus face primer this little guy
right here really made my skin look very
very aged has like a little bit of slip
to it but it wasn't hydrating in any way
shape or form and it definitely did not
make my makeup last longer throughout
the day so definitely not going to
purchase a full sizes of these guys
right here
up next we have some loose powders this
one is the bare minerals mineral veil
and this one right here is the tarte
smooth operator Amazonian clay at
finishing at powder both of these were
deluxe sized samples and I do not like
either of them there's something about
the bare minerals mineral veil that I
know a lot of people are drawn to and a
lot of people do enjoy but I feel like
it does nothing for my skin it is
nice if you are doing the whole regimen
where you're just doing the powder
foundation the powder blush and then
you're using this it kind of is like a
finishing veil but I feel like it
doesn't react well with cream products
and I'm more of a cream kind of girl
when it comes to foundation and based
products for sure so I am NOT a fan of
the bare minerals mineral veil never
happened it probably never will be and
then the smooth operator Amazonian clay
finishing powder from Tarte cosmetics is
about as basic as it gets I have been
saying it over and over and over again
but the elf HD setting powder is just as
good as this don't get a ton of product
and on top of that it's quite expensive
I believe this is in the $30 range so
will not be purchasing either of those
in a full-size right next up we have a
serum here from 100% pure this is the
brightening serum and I found this
incredibly harsh on the skin now it's
kind of funny because 100% pure it's
literally a hundred percent pure they
are vegan they are cruelty free this
little guy was said to me as a PR sample
but I would never purchase this with my
own money it was just way too stripping
on the skin and I am somebody who can
handle a lot of acids this is all fruit
acid but I feel like when you're leaving
something like this on the skin for a
longer period of time it is going to
irritate your skin overall so this is
definitely not something I would
recommend to any of you was sensitive
skin I don't even really have that
sensitive skin but this was way too much
for me so not a fan of that will not
purchase in a full-size and then here we
have the lorac behind the scenes eye
primer has anybody else ever thought
this is just the weirdest eye primer on
earth it is super super like elastic and
sticky but at the same time it's like
slippery there's something about the
consistency on this that I just can't
get behind I find that my eyeshadows
crease absolutely throughout the day
when I use this it's kind of a shame
because I have like five or six of these
minis sitting around but I've never been
a fan of this there are quite a few
primers out there that I feel like do
the job and do what I want them to do
but there are a lot of primers that
don't as far as eye primers are
concerned so let me know if you want a
whole entire video on eye primers that
really don't do not a fan of that
will not purchase in a full size and
finally we have a product here from
bareMinerals which is a long wearing a
liquid lipstick as well as the Lancome
base mascara or mascara base now the
only mascara base that I have ever found
that works really really well is
subversion from Urban Decay I
this is not cruelty-free but I just want
to let you guys know even if you're not
cruelty free save your money I
find that when I go in with my mascara
on top of this you can still see the
white which is really really annoying
and then on top of that it really just
doesn't do much it doesn't thicken up my
lashes it doesn't make my mascara
perform better or stay on longer so that
is a really really useless mascara base
and then finally the liquid lipstick
from bareMinerals these are the
generation new to liquid lipsticks this
one right here is in the shade infamous
and it's gorgeous it's a beautiful
beautiful color
I mean hence the the name yeah I mean
it's supposed to be generation new
they're all supposed to be pretty much
like that your lips of better sort of
shades they smell really good like a
vanilla they're super super pigmented as
you can see but they dry it down like
crazy on my lips and I am NOT into that
I'm not into that powdery feeling where
you put it on you let it sit for a
little bit and then it feels super super
powdery and it starts to kind of flake
and it starts to just disintegrate off
your lips throughout the day and not so
much in a very beautiful manner so
definitely not into those generation
nude liquid lipsticks I know a lot of
you love them but I do not so anyway
guys let me know down below if you have
any samples that you have recently
tested out are you going to purchase
them in a full-sized or definitely not
I love getting samples because it's a
nice way to test out obviously the
product before you get it I know not
everybody is into like the 500-point
perks or the 100-point perfrom is
Sephora but I personally really get a
kick out of those kind of stuff because
then I'm able to see if I do want to get
a product in it be full size so anyway
that's it for today's video thanks for
joining me and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
