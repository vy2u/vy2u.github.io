welcome to a new series on my channel
for the holiday season this is called
then and now where I compare last year's
palettes to this year for the holiday
season so anyway
I'm obviously not on camera for this
video I thought it might be a little
easier to see everything if I just had
the products out in front of me in
natural lighting please let me know in
the comments section if you would like
me to be on camera
the lighting is a little different in
the beauty room I do have a ring light
and then I use natural lights but I
thought this would be the best
representation of what these colors look
like and also it's kind of hard for me
to hold up two pallets at once when I am
on camera so I thought this would be a
nice way to kind of show you guys the
two different palettes from last year
and this year side-by-side so anyway
let's go ahead and get started and this
is last year's hourglass holiday palette
this was the 2014 palette I'm sorry the
2015 palette it was very very pretty as
you guys can see I do prefer the
packaging on this year's that this one
was like a kind of dirty gold color it
says hourglass on it it's mirrored and
then as you guys can see you have a
sticker here with all of the names of
the colors that you get in here so you
are getting three ambient lighting
powders in dim light iridescent light
which is actually a strobing powder and
then diffuse light which is just a
regular ambient lighting powder you are
getting mood exposure which is a blush
also luminous flesh which is a blush and
luminous bronze light which is a bronzer
you open it up and you do have a nice
sized mirror as you guys can see and
then here are these six shades that we
had in last year's palette I really
really like this one and I will say if
you have last year's I don't think it's
absolutely necessary for you to get this
year's palette so here is the mood
exposure that we have the strobing
powder than we have dim light to the two
blushes and the bronzer I really liked
this palette because I feel like it was
very diverse it would have worked for a
lot of different skin tones and I really
liked what they did so I prefer the
packaging this year if this palette had
been in this packaging I think it would
have been perfect but it's really
interesting to kind of put it
side-by-side and see exactly what they
did this year because they changed some
stuff up so I am going to list the exact
amount of product that you get in each
pan from last year and this year down
below in the description bar if you
would like to check but here we have six
different shades and then here is this
year so this year is
in a beautiful like marbled sort of
plastic container as you guys can see it
catches the light and it's very very
pretty
from far away it really looks like it
could be marbled and obviously close-up
it's plastic but okay you flip it over
and you actually have a little sticker
chart here seeing one two three four
five and it shows you all of the
products which is nice that is
definitely a step up from last year's in
my opinion you have the same size mirror
here and then you open it and I have to
say when I first opened this I was like
oh my god it's amazing and then I
realized the more and more I would wear
it I was like what is going on here like
why doesn't this look as good on the
skin as last year's palette and I think
it's because this one's a little more
warm toned there are some cool tone
shades in here like that bronzer right
there but for the most part I do feel
like last year's palette was just a
little more versatile a little more
diverse and I do prefer this one it's a
little more cool tone so I feel like the
pigmentation was pretty much exactly the
same some of the colors in here are a
little lighter like I said so I do think
pigmentation wise last year's was better
as well so overall I would just say if
you go out last year's you definitely
don't need this year's but if you're a
sucker for beautiful beautiful packaging
and you do like the hourglass
formulation of powders and highlights
you could definitely pick up this year's
palette so here is something that we
have in this year's palette that last
year's palette did not have and that is
some sort of a surreal lighting powder
that's basically what they're calling it
and it's kind of a mixture between their
strobing powders and their ambient
lighting powders I don't notice like
much glitter or chunks of shimmer or
anything like that
in last year's palettes they had the
strobing powder which was a limited
edition to this palette and now they
actually have all of those in full size
so I have no idea if they will bring
this particular shade what is this one
called I think it's called surreal light
yeah surreal light I have no idea if
they will bring that and put that into a
full-sized I think it is a nice powder
but if you have a strong cool undertone
it may look a little strange on you I
know it looks like it's a little more
pink toned but it has a little bit of a
gray undertone and I can't see this
working for every single skin tone in my
opinion now I feel like the pan sizes
look a little bigger here but I believe
they are the same size again I will link
in the description bar where you guys
can look at the sizing and everything
like that but I think it was very very
well put together just not as well put
together as last year's like I said
package
definitely on fleek I prefer this year's
packaging but I don't know I just feel
like the more that I look at them
side-by-side the less and less I become
very like impressed with this that made
no sense the less and less the less and
less okay
I'm less impressed with this the more I
compare it to this one I do think this
one is absolutely fantastic if you
didn't get your hands on this I believe
they do have most of these in full-size
but this year's is just it's a little
more interesting so I think if you do
have a warm undertone in your skin and
you do have fair to light maybe medium
skin tone this one would be great for
you and I definitely don't think that
well obviously I don't think you can
pick this one up any more but I just
wanted to go ahead and do like a side by
side for you guys so you could see I
will say I don't feel like this is gonna
work on super dark complexions and I did
have a few people write in the comment
section on my review for this one and
then it did not show up on them so
that's another bummer this year although
the packaging is beautiful I feel like
you know the tones could have been a
little deeper they could have been maybe
a little lighter because some of the
actual high lady highlighting shades in
here as well
like those two shades right there are
darker than my skin tone I'm usually
about an NC 10 to NC 15 when I'm not
self-tanning so I would say definitely
last year I think they did the best job
I think they did the best job when I
look at this alone I'm very very
impressed with it I think it's beautiful
but when I compare it to last year's I
will say I do prefer last year's if you
have last year's you do not need this
year's and yeah let me show you guys
some swatches so here is the last year's
palette so watch out the first one we
have there is the ambient lighting
powder then we have the strobing powder
then we have the bronzer we also have
the blush and then also another blush so
those are the swatches from last year's
and then here we have this year's so you
guys can see they are just a little bit
lighter in tone a little more warm toned
and right here at the top we have the
surreal light I guess they call it like
a priming sort of powder or whatever and
then they we have this cool toned blush
right here which is beautiful I do like
that one then we have more of a warm
toned blush and then we have these two
kind of warm toned bronzer and also a
strobing powder here I wish the strobing
powder was a little lighter this year
but when I like go like this
can you guys kind of see the difference
in pigmentation at first I didn't think
there was that big of a difference but
now I'm kind of noticing that there is
so I don't know I need to go through and
kind of look at the ingredients
see if they changed up the formulation
but overall when I put this next to this
one I'm not as impressed but when this
one is alone I'm still impressed so I
hope you guys enjoyed this then and now
what do you think of this do you think
hourglass stepped up their game or do
you think that they got worse or do you
think they just stayed the same let me
know down below and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
