today's video is going to be another
installment in my holiday 2016 then and
now series and this video is going to
focus on the 2015 and B 2016 holiday
blush pellets from Tarte cosmetics I'm
going to show you guys what they did
differently this year with the palette
I'll let you know which palette
I prefer out of the two and I'm also
going to give you my opinion on if the
2016 palette is worth picking up even if
you already own they 2015 palette like I
do so I would say the packaging you know
has I feel like it's completely
completely changed the biggest
difference visually is the fact that
this was rectangular obviously this is
more circular and oval or not oval shape
is circular
I feel like Tarte has been doing this
sort of design lately with a lot of
their products so it just makes sense
for them to continue down that road the
2014 and 2015 palettes both had that
rectangular design and I honestly do
prefer the 2016 version a lot more I
feel like it's a lot more compact and
they really utilize the entire palette
which you guys will see in a second so
packaging wise I would say the 2016 wins
for me it's not prone to getting like I
don't know I feel like this particular
palette just got really really kind of
grimy and yucky looking real quickly
this one's a nice smooth texture or
finish whereas just had like glitter on
it it just got it got really gunked up
pretty quickly so I do definitely prefer
this particular packaging and I just
feel like it's a lot more secure and I
do like the overall design now I would
like to have just like a black cover
with the little heart logo in gold here
I don't really like what Tarte has been
doing with their holiday packaging like
it looks kind of retro to me and I'm not
really into that but to each their own
so now let's go ahead and compare the
Interior before we get into the actual
shades so the 2015 palette as you guys
can see has a mirror which I really do
appreciate now this one right here the
2016 does not and there is a reason for
that I open this carefully so I don't
but write anything but there is a reason
why obviously doesn't have a mirror
because they really really stuffed and
fit as much as they could into this
year's palette seriously there is no
room for a mirror and since this since
this year's palette is double-sided as
you guys can see they obviously had to
put this little protective sheet here
and someone was saying you know it would
have been cool if there was a mirror
here on each side and yeah that would
have been so
awesome but that probably would have
cost them quite a bit of money I don't
really know but I thought that that
probably would this is probably the
cheapest way to go but I feel like this
is not too flimsy and actually is
keeping them from you know going into
each other so I'm okay with that
this year's palette has the round
blushes as you guys can see with warm
tones and also cool tone shades it also
has two highlighters which last year's
palette did not have any sort of
highlighters in it I do have to say I
definitely preferred this year's because
of the larger color selection and the
fact that it is much more diverse and it
would work for all sorts of different
skin tones including super fair and
super dark the 2015 palette in my
opinion was way way way too light and
not friendly for those with like medium
to dark skin I think this one really
only works for fair to light skin tones
and a lot of the shades look very
similar when applied to the actual cheek
so because of that I'm actually gonna go
ahead and declutter this to a my friend
I just don't enjoy it as much as I used
to I really enjoyed it when I first got
it I personally feel that this year's
palette along with like the Tartus
palette that I got during the springtime
can definitely do about some of the
shades so there's no point for me to you
know hold on to that one honestly if
you've got last year's palette and you
enjoyed it you are going to be over the
freaking moon about this year's the
blush quality is really nice I think the
shade selection is the best the best
that Tarte has ever released if you did
not enjoy last year's sell it I would
still check out this year's because I
feel like they really stepped up their
game with this guy I'm super super picky
about a lot of the Tarte holiday
collections but this palette is good
quality and a really good value they
made a lot of changes with formulation
packaging and also shade selection this
year and I hope that they keep you know
doing that I feel like the quality is
really really good this year so
hopefully they will continue to do that
so let me show you guys some swatches
here so we are going to go ahead and I'm
going to share with you the swatches
that are right here you guys know
embedded with swatching so I apologize
if this is super awkward but this is the
2015 palette as you guys can see there
are five different shades here and this
is the 2016 these are all one finger
swatch it's like one swipe of the
product and I just put it straight on I
really do feel like this year's is a lot
a lot more pigmented and it's not just
like those deep berry colors that are
more pigmented I'm talking like even the
peachy shades are more pigmented and
this
right here in the 2015 pallet which I
believe was doll-faced or smashing is a
beautiful color and I feel like it
definitely could have been in this
year's palette but for the most part I
would say I'm just way more impressed
with this year's palette so if you are
looking for a nice blush palette and you
didn't get this one definitely give this
one now the highlighters in here I don't
think they're anything too special
honestly I would have I really wish they
would have just thrown and do more
blushes but I do think that they are
still really really good quality so
anyway that is it for this video I hope
this answered any questions you may have
about this year and last year's palettes
I will go ahead and leave the sizing of
each palette down below in the
description bar so that you can compare
the two if you would like to you I will
also include the prices and I'm pretty
darn sure they were the same price but
I'm not quite sure about that so I will
list everything in the description bar
and yeah that's it thanks so much for
joining you guys and I'll see you
tomorrow
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
