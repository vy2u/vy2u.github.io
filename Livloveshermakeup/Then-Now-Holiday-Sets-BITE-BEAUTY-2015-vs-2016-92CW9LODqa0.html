welcome back to another then and now
where I give you guys a quick comparison
of last year's holiday pallets and kits
versus this year's wait this year's
versus last year's you guys know what
I'm trying to say today we were talking
about bite beauty so this year's kids
came with four little mini Deluxe eyes
and Musa Bush lipsticks and last year's
kit came with four different like
retractable with retractable retractable
matte lip crayon so every single year
they come in the same packaging they
have a little slip this is obviously
this year's and the UH most boosh
formulation is the newest one to bite
beauty so I thought it was kind of cool
that they did give you a little mini
lipsticks this year you can tell us the
amuse-bouche formulation when they have
these little dents here and then last
year's camp obviously was just this nice
little slender like black kind of mac
thing going on and I feel like the
packaging is similar in that sort of
sense they do like the nurse kind of
packaging where it is like that rubber
but for the most part I was a last year
of packaging was much much better in my
opinion because these little guys are so
tiny and delicate but every single year
you do get this nice little case here it
does have a large mirror on the inside
and I like these they're very very cute
and it's easy to store all of your
little bite Beauty sets like that so
anyway let's go ahead and talk about
last year set last year set came with
four retractable matte lip crayons I
love these I definitely prefer this set
over I preferred this one over this
year's if that makes sense um just by a
little just because I really like the
formulation on these I think they do
tend to be a little more pigmented than
the embassy Boosh formulation now the
amuse-bouche formulation is really
really kind of supposed to be
moisturizing and very very long wearing
things like that and I definitely
definitely think it is but i will say i
do think these weren't just a little bit
longer mostly because they didn't have
as much moisture in them but they were
still incredibly comfortable on the lips
the first shade that i have here is
called cafe and i do have its watched
right here and you guys are like oh my
God look at those swatches I know girl i
know a few of you were asking me in my
last video if i would make the swatches
bigger so here they are so this is a
beautiful beautiful shade i really think
it's gorgeous it's kind of similar to
this year's honeycomb but definitely
honeycomb has a little more warm tones
to it so for overall packaging i would
say last year definitely one in my
opinion last year's was definitely a
little more pigmented but this year
these are very very
comfortable to wear on the lips so and
that was the first one the second one
that we got in last year set was this
beautiful kind of just in neutral your
lips with better shade this one is
called tort and it is very very pretty
and I just love how easily these like go
back down do you see that like sometimes
things are like oh yeah its retractable
and it ends up not being anyway here is
the shade tort as you guys can see
really really beautiful completely
completely pigmented I obviously have
like hair on my arm and I still feel
like this like Matt formulation was
gliding over my arm really really
seamlessly and beautifully I do want to
show you guys really really quickly this
year's and Musa Bush line you guys can
see there's like a little bit of
patchiness now I did it flattened out my
hand when I did the swatches so that my
veins and my bones weren't like jumping
through but for the most part i would
say last year's was definitely more
pigmented so that is that shade and then
we had a beautiful beautiful nice red
color and I really wish that this year's
Kate would have had a nice red I love a
good red lip and this particular shade
right here which is called hue is
absolutely beautiful also the 2014 set
they had a shade called pomegranate
which was like the most perfect cool
toned red I really enjoyed that as well
but yeah this is a beautiful shade and I
have that swatched right there and I
just love how vibrant that is I think
it's really really gorgeous and I feel
like this year set really is kind of
missing that gorgeous red color and then
the last shade yeah the last shade I
can't speak they came in last year set
was this nice deep kind of purply color
I feel like my beauty always does
usually a red a nude a pink and then
they do like a purpley color so this one
was called aubergine and there is
operation just your perfect perfect kind
of like purpley color and I'm sorry if
you can see those boxes on my floor I
have so much stuff that literally this
beauty room looks like a tornado
touchdown I need to clean it so bad but
yeah there is the shade aubergine so I
would say like formulation wise I feel
like last year set was definitely a lot
more pigmented it didn't have any sort
of skipping or any sort of Sheerness to
it this year set is probably a little
more comfortable on the lips but overall
I do prefer last year set so let's go
ahead and talk about this year set the
first shade that we have here in the
elusive boost in line a moosh moosh I
cannot say it a moose bouche a line is
called pepper and I kind of wish they
wouldn't have done pepper because they
have already done pepper pepper has been
used in there do
ended lipstick forum I do prefer this
particular you know formulation over the
dual ended lipstick form but still I
just I feel like they should have come
out with all like you know limited
edition shades that would have been cool
so pepper is a beautiful beautiful color
I think it's just a your lips but better
again I feel like bite Beauty every
single year does something like that so
there is the shade pepper as you guys
can see it's definitely a little more
glossy than last year's which were
completely matte but you can see there
also is a little bit of patchiness but
these are so incredibly comfortable on
the lips if you are someone who likes
and like a really really comfortable lip
products like I do then you need to get
this set honestly you need to get like I
hope you got last year set and I hope
you get this year set because every
single year I really feel like bite
beauty you know blows it out of the
water so the second one we have here is
called honeycomb this is my favorite in
the set this is like the perfect perfect
perfect nude color if you have really
really fair skin you would absolutely
adore this here it is swatch and it does
lean a little more on the warm tone side
but for some reason it just looks really
really good on my cool toned fair skin
so I really do love this shade
definitely my favorite out of the bunch
and then we had a nice kind of like deep
rusty almost like purpley color and this
one right here is called nori and noise
nice i like it i don't feel like
everybody would wear this kind of vampy
color here last year's aubergine I feel
like was a little more wearable as you
guys can see it had a little more purple
tones to it this one definitely has more
brown tones but I still think it's
pretty and I definitely would wear a
shade like this and then the last year
that we have here is called fig and fig
is something that you can get in the
dual ended lipstick form like formula as
well so this was nothing new to me but
here is fig swatch it's definitely kind
of like a cool toned pinky color and
it's very very pretty so there are last
year's and then here I'm sorry this
year's and then here are last year so
definitely some similar kind of colors
going on like I said that better
pigmentation for sure with last year set
but this year set is a lot more
comfortable I highly recommend you know
even if you picked up last year set and
yes the colors are kind of similar I do
have like some squatches here of all of
them they all kind of fall within the
same sort of color family what I want to
say is that this is just such a good
value and you know it
nice to try out their different sort of
um lipstick formulas and just their lip
products in general so i would highly
recommend checking out this your asset
for $25 like my can't beat that so
anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this
little video like i said i do prefer
last year said but this year set is
still awesome really really cool and i
highly recommend checking out so that is
it for this video and i will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
