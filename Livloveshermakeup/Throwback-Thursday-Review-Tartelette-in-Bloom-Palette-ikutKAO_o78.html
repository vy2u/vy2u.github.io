welcome back to my channel today we are
starting a new series on my channel this
is going to be something I do twice a
month so every other week on Thursdays
for you guys where I go ahead and I go
back in time and I rear view or talk
about how I feel about a product that I
reviewed six months ago a year ago two
years ago today we are actually talking
about the tartlet in bloom palette which
i reviewed on my channel two years ago I
thought it would be fun to do this I
know I recently just talked about like
yesterday how I'm not going to be doing
more series on my channel but here I am
Here I am
I just love series because they're
something you can look forward to and
there's something they give you like a
clear definitive answer to certain
questions and I've been getting a lot of
questions recently about how I feel
about old school palettes and I thought
this would be a really fun thing to do
so anyway here is the Tarte latina bloom
palette I've had this for over almost
two years now it is an absolutely
beautiful palette and I'm happy to tell
you guys that my thoughts on this have
not changed whatsoever in fact I think I
like this even more and then I did it
back in the day when I reviewed it so
here's what the actual packaging looks
like as you guys can see it's a really
really gorgeous kind of puddle look on
the front you do have a nice mirrored
finish on the back this is some of the
most gorgeous packaging from Tarte in my
opinion a beautiful full-size mirror and
then you do have 12 different eyeshadows
here now in my opinion there are three
Luster's in here and the rest of them
are matte I know some people say oh no
the shade charmer and a little bit of
flower child have some shimmer in my
opinion there really are only three
lustre shades and that is how they
describe them back in the day as being
Luster's now I want to say really
quickly the price on this has not
changed whatsoever but when I first
purchased it this was supposed to be an
Ulta exclusive I believe you can now get
this at Sephora but I remember back in
the day it was funny because Tarte even
said you will only be able to get this
at Ulta or ever like that is it you'll
only be able to get it at Ulta and now
you can get it at Sephora go figure
you know how brands are sneaky with
their limited edition stuff and their
exclusive stuff but yeah so in here you
just have a really really nice selection
of neutral shades this is one of my
go-to a beautiful beautiful palettes as
far as transition shades are concerned I
love to pull this in with another
palette and then also these lustre
shades a rocker firecracker and funny
girl are beautiful beautiful lid colors
this is something that I would say
reminds me of old-school Tarte it
reminds me
old-school two-faced beautiful beautiful
pigmentation really really soft and
blendable it does the smell very lightly
of vanilla and this was the first time
that they had ever infused that vanilla
scent into their palates now this did
release around the same time as the
tortoise contour palette and you guys
will see this on Monday this is
something that I have not touched in
over a year and shot my stash on Monday
is going to be dedicated to products I
have not touched in over a year I found
this under my Alex series night drawer
the other day and I'm like what the hell
I've not touched that forever but I
remember loving this and I really
remember loving the tartlet in bloom and
I'm just so happy to update you guys and
let you know that I still really like
this I think it's really unfortunate the
chart nowadays has been releasing new
formulas all over the place when in fact
they have a really good formula right
here and this was released years ago and
it's just kind of disappointing it that
they unfortunately do not release more
palettes like this I love the layout I
love the packaging I think the price is
beautiful I think the amount of products
you get in here is great and I love the
color selection so I would love to see
more products like this from Tarte let's
go ahead and swatch some of my favorite
shades the first one I want to talk
about is this one right here it's called
rocker this reminds me a lot of a maxim
satin taupe I used to have a single of
the max satin taupe eyeshadow this
reminds me a lot of it it's a really
really nice cool tone shade kind of like
a pewter but it almost has a neutral
undertone I shouldn't say that it's too
cool it looks very very cool toned to
indie pan but when you actually swatch
it out it's really really gorgeous on
the eyes and then I love the shade right
here which is called firecracker super
super buttery and creamy it goes on like
a foiled absolutely a foiled eyeshadow
as you guys can see not this one
does have a little bit of glitter
infused into it but for whatever reason
it's not like those kind of shadows with
Too Faced were like a glitter bomb all
over your eyes it really goes on nicely
and beautifully so that is the shade
firecracker and then I also really do it
like funny girl funny girl has a little
more grit to it definitely a little more
texture going on there but if you do
foil it across your lid or on your lower
lash line it looks impeccable so really
really love those shades the only two
shades in here that I think in my
opinion are misses are activist and
leader they are these two matte shades
right here I feel like sometimes with
Tarte palettes they do those very very
purpley deep colors and these just feel
very very crispy to the touch I really
don't get a lot of use out of these they
feel very very Scratchy
although they are very pigmented
you have to be very careful when you are
working these into the crease or into
the outer V they do take a lot more
blending so let me go ahead and swatch
them for you guys like I said they are
very very pigmented don't get me wrong
about that but they just are a little
harder to work with my favorite deep
shade in here is definitely this one
right here which is called smoke show
this one it blends beautifully into the
crease into the outer V it's a really
really nice shade and I like this one
because it does have a cooler undertone
so those are those three swatch as you
guys can see and then the rest of them I
just think are great Sharma is really
really beautiful all over the lid
especially if you do have a fair
complexion I love jetsetter and
especially smarty pants as they
transition that is a perfect transition
if you have a very very light skin tone
and I feel like this is a palette that
will work for the majority of skin tones
out there if you do have a very very
very deep complexion you may have some
difficulty with some of these I think
some of the lighter shades may look a
little ashy on you but overall you guys
this is such a good palette from Tarte
and although I know I have been a little
hard on Tarte lately this is something
that I would recommend you guys pick up
I think it's absolutely beautiful now I
have heard some people say the first
edition is not as good as the Tarte
letting bloom I have no idea if that's
true because I actually never picked up
the original Tarte leg so if there's
anything I would recommend to you guys
it's this one if you do perform more
cool tones maybe go in store and swatch
out the toilet the tartlets the original
one but overall I would say this is
something that I have just been loving
for years now and my thoughts have not
changed whatsoever so I hope you guys
enjoyed this row back Thursday review
