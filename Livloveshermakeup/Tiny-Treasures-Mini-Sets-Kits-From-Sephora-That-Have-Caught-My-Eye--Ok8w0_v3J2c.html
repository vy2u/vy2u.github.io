to my channel today I am sharing a mini
wishlist with you guys I have some cute
little products that I found on the
Sephora calm website that I would really
like to go ahead and pick it up this is
this season tis the season right for
shopping and I feel like they have so
many different sets and kits right now
for under 25 under 15 under 10 on their
website as well as a whole section
dedicated to mini products so if you
don't want to purchase a full-sized item
you can go and see if they have a little
mini listed but yeah anyway without
further ado let's go ahead and jump
right into it if you didn't know arusian
members are getting a two different sale
or coupon codes this year for 20% off so
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna go ahead and
order some of these with that code so
the first little mini I have here is the
all-day all-night travel duo from Urban
Decay this retails for $19 it is a $30
value limited edition online only you
get a little deluxe size of the all
nighter makeup setting spray which is
quite nice and then you also get the
quick fix pre makeup spray and now I
remember trying out their vitamin b-12
spray or something a while back and it
was just too moisturizing for me but now
that I'm just super super dry I'm
thinking that I want to try that one out
or the quick fix and this seems like it
has like hyaluronic acid in the
ingredients list and it's something you
just mist onto your face before I guess
going in with primer I can use all the
extra moisture that I can get so I am
definitely very interested in that
little set alright up next I have the
tartlet flirt eyes shadow palette I know
I have the full-size toasted palette why
do I need the little mini version for
$23 well when I got to the Tartus Pro to
go palette which you guys recommended I
did a video all about testing out my
subscribers favorite makeup products
I'll go ahead and throw that up in the
cards if you guys would like to check it
out but I tried that out and I'm just so
impressed with the quality and the size
of the palette and because I already
know I love the formula with the tartlet
toasted and this is supposed to be the
same exact thing and I know it yes if
some of the shades are very similar or
overlaps I just really like the thought
of having the tiny tiny a little like a
pocket sized palette to bring with me
for travel so I definitely have my eye
on this
I feel like for $23 it really is a steal
and I just really really enjoyed the
tiny little packaging that Tarte does I
never knew what they were so a small you
guys they're literally the size size of
like a credit card and I didn't know
that until I got they tart does approach
to go palette but if very impressed with
that one and I love my toasted palette
so and I really want the Maine
alright up next I have a product here
from nude sticks I've never tried
anything from them but I've heard they
are cruelty free maybe possibly vegan
and apparently a lot of people like them
so it's called this little set is called
the what's your matte nudes + Reds and
it's basically just like you get a
little sharpener and then you get three
of their lip products I believe you can
like interchange these into like blush
or something like that or is that I
don't know what I'm talking about
I feel like nude Stix has some sort of a
product that's like entertain
interchangeable between cheeks and lips
but for me I don't like cream you know
blush even with my dry skin right now I
just I still don't like it but yeah
these look very interesting to me I
really like lip cramps because I feel
like they're a little more precise I'm
really bad at like lining my lip line
and doing anything cute with my lip so I
feel like this might be a nice to check
out I really really endure that kind of
rusty pair know like rusty orange shade
the nude in the middle is quite pretty
and then I love the red so that's $24 it
is a limited edition and exclusive to
Sephora let me know if you've ever tried
anything out from nude sticks alright up
the next guys we have another lipstick
set I have been really into lip products
even though I know my lips look like
 all the time I've been really into
lip products lately this is the little
vices lipstick sect from Urban Decay
now I have been salty with urban decay
ever since that they discontinued the
revolution at lipsticks those were just
so beautiful and hydrating and gorgeous
I haven't really tried out the advice
but have the lipstick palettes from the
Vice line but I have not tried the
actual bullet form so I want to see if
they're just as good as the revolution
lipsticks
little set does have let's see here one
two three four five at different shades
you have like a bright purple a plum a
red a pink as well as like a burnt
orange color so I probably wouldn't get
the nude sticks one and this I would
choose one of them but this one does
retail for twenty five dollars it's
limited edition and exclusive to Sephora
as well all right up next we have a
product here from Ola Henrickson this is
the three glowing scrubs you get the
pore balancing a facial sauna scrub
which my boyfriend really likes the
transforming a walnut scrub which I am
totally obsessed with I want a full-size
of and then also the transforming almond
facial polish which I haven't tried but
because I really loved the walnut scrub
I would like to try out to the almond a
facial scrub and this is the only set
that they have that doesn't include it
like in full-size this is only twenty
five dollars I've been pretty impressed
with all of it the olla Henriksen
products that i have tried out the
majority of them do work for me the
Green Line is a little to it drying for
me personally right now but my boyfriend
does like it like I said so yeah $25
Limited Edition again exclusive to
Sephora and finally guys we have a
little set here from Smashbox I feel
like Smashbox if there's one thing that
they're good at its primer I love their
photo finish primer water this has a
deluxe I said that in there it has the
photo finish primer which is great for
my dry skin currently it used to feel a
little greasy on like my combo oily skin
but now I really really love it you get
the under eye hydrating primer which I
have tried before and not so excited
that that's in there because I didn't
really feel like it did anything it's
kind of like a gel moisturizer and then
finally you get to the 24-hour photo
finish shadow primer which I haven't
never tried so excuse me if like I have
like a lump in my throat anyway I have
never tried at least Matchbox 24-hour
eyeshadow primer I've heard really
really good things about that and I feel
like Smashbox is the king or the queen
of primer so I feel like this is gonna
be a good set I definitely want it it's
$29 it is a fifty-three dollar value I
already know I love a few products in
there so yeah that's pretty much it
anyway those are my tiny treasures on my
wish list let me know down below if you
are looking at any little minis for the
holiday season thank you so much for
joining me guys and I will see him
