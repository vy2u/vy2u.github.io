you so much for joining me sorry I
thought I'd dropped something this video
is going to be a little different
um it is going to be little tips tricks
tacks on blending eyeshadows I think
that blending eyeshadows is the most
important step of an eyeshadow look
absolutely the most important thing I am
NOT a makeup artist I can't do a lot of
these really really fancy you know I
looks or anything like that I can't even
do wing liner on the top I just do it my
left handedness I just can't I blame it
on that but anyway I have found things
that have worked for me and not
necessarily have I had to like change my
products like a lot of the brushes are
the same I just use them in a different
way and I think that companies market
brushes in a certain way and they say
this one's just for blending and this
one's just for your crease and this
one's just for you know your brow bone
or whatever and I think that you should
go and use whatever brush you want if it
is a foundation brush and you like to
blend your eyeshadow out like that you
should go ahead and do that because
honestly you know a lot of these brushes
that are made for everyone's I actually
don't work and don't you know fit the
contours of their eye and you just have
to use what works for you but I wanted
to give you guys some of my personal
tips what I have found works for me
personally and yeah so let's just get
started so I'm about 90% done with
blending at my eye look out today I am
wearing the makeup
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows in
grandstand and flamethrower
this is grandstand I have that on my lid
and flamethrower in my crease so I'm
just gonna walk you guys through how I
do things that I'm gonna explain it
along the way I go in usually with this
or any sort of matte color that is
similar to my skin tone that is the
first thing I do after I've like prime
my eyes even if I put concealer on top
before I start doing any sort of eye
shadow thing I go in with this I go all
over my lid I even take it underneath
the eye it is going to cover any sort of
a
blue marks whatever it's wonderful this
one is from wet-and-wild it's a creme
brulee or is it brulee now that's from
Mac creme brulee um get one that matches
your skin tone you will be amazed at
like the difference it just really makes
for like a smooth soft canvas and
putting down that powder will allow the
other powders to kind of like adhere to
it and blend out better so that is the
first thing I do and then I will go in
and I will take a transition color I
used to not understand what a transition
color was and it basically is usually a
matte color that is slightly deeper than
your skin tone it could be anything from
this to this so these are both from
makeup geek this is unexpected which is
a plummy color and this is beaches and
cream beaches and cream is wonderful if
you are going and working with really
really dark colors like corrupt or you
know anything that's super super dark
like Houdini uh you know these it is
really great because it has this kind of
peachy and yellowy undertone and it
allows whatever eyeshadow your going to
put on top of that it is going to blend
it in easier because you are mixing
colors basically so you know if you were
going to do you know what is this
mesmerised in your crease you could use
this as your transition color this is
unexpected like I said it's matte it's
very very pretty it is close to skin
tone range and I just have noticed such
a difference since I started doing this
you guys it just allows anything that
you put into your crease after to blend
out like way way way better so I highly
recommend doing that try and get
something matte and definitely try and
get something that is you know I've say
1 to 4 shades deeper than your skin tone
alright the next thing I do is I go in
and I go into whatever color I want to
put in my crease and I dip my brush in
and the brush that I use now is the elf
professional blending eye brush
I use anything like this I have a lot of
brushes and I use things that are like
this small this actually fit into my
crease what I used to do is go in and
use my where is it that's Sigma tapered
up where is it oh it's over there hold
on one second let me grab it it is the
Sigma tapered blending brush this is the
brush that you see every single person
talked about rave about and you see them
literally go in with their crease color
with this and this thing is massive okay
um I don't know about you I just I have
trouble sometimes finding my crease in
the morning if I am bloated if I ate a
lot of junk food like literally I can't
even like if I'm looking straight
forward I'm like where is my crease so
what I personally like to do is take a
mirror um any kind of mirror you can do
it you know with a pallet whatever and I
like to point it downwards and instantly
I can see that area that is chiseled out
and I know oh that's where my crease is
what I used to do is take the Sigma
tapered blending v40 go into my crease
color and start going back and forth
windshield wiper motions and then
circular motions because that is what
everybody does that is what they tell
you to do I don't know you know that is
what is the most popular thing to do
every single look I got was money there
was no difference between what was on my
lid what was on the outer V and what was
in the crease I normally like to put
something lighter on the lid something a
little darker in the crease and then
when I go in for the inner outer V I
like something even darker I like there
to be a variety of things going on I
want people to be able to see that I
have done different things I put in
effort you know and um with this brush
it just I would put the color in and I'd
start blending and instantly it was like
half of it would go down onto the lid
and the other half would just travel way
up and by the time I was done blending I
would have stuff up here by my brow bone
so what I like to do now is go in with a
smaller brush a little denser something
that fits right into
my priests I literally kind of just go
back and forth kind of in like a stiff
motion not like super like all flappy
you know just kind of stiff I place the
color in there and it looks like someone
just colored on your eye like literally
when I do makeup tutorials which I will
film once I have my Beauty room set up
um you guys are gonna be like whoa what
is she doing this is what works for me I
do that and then I go in and I take a
blending brush that is kind of like the
e-40 except it's stiffer the crease is
an area that it literally kind of caves
in on your body something that you
swatch on your arm is never going to
look the same as a dozens in the crease
because it's it's hollow you know it's
already darker in there and um I find
when I take something fluffy it just
gets all over the place I get stuff you
know over here I get stuff over here I
get tons of fallout and I still want to
blend don't get me wrong this little
blending brush or whatever this claims
to be a blending brush I could never use
this to really really blend I only use
this to deposit my crease color into my
crease so this morphe and five eleven
brush is great it is very similar to the
Sigma tapered wait yeah tapered blending
a forty except it is denser and it is a
lot more tapered so you're getting kind
of a fine point and it just doesn't move
the same way the other one does this one
literally like you know it can go all
the way down this one it just doesn't
really let you do that it just doesn't
really give so it's awesome because you
go right in there and I like to go back
and forth back and forth back and forth
windshield wiper motions I do not do any
kind of circular movement my issue with
you know trading off between the
windshield wiper motion and circular
little motions in your crease is that it
literally starts to just go everywhere
and I feel like it's very popular right
now to have that kind of diffused look
and what I mean by that is you have your
crease and then above it you have that
little area that's not really like your
brow bone it's kind of like your eye
socket area
and you see these girls who do makeup
and they have this like blended thing
going on and it is like a diffuse it's
like it's like ombre effect that is what
makes eyes shadow look really really
beautiful and you have to understand if
you are taking a really really fluffy
brush like this into your crease and
going in circular motions which by the
way when you do circular motions this
instantly is lifting it up when you're
doing that and you're trading off with
windshield wiper motions especially was
something that's so easy to bend and you
know I don't know you know you sit there
and you know you really have to blend it
takes a while and after a while you
realize you're really pressing down and
this brush isn't even shaped like what
it should be and your eye shadow is
everywhere it doesn't make sense because
by the time you want to blend out this
area and get that diffused look it's too
late because that brush has already
brought color up here and then you have
to blend that area and then go over and
put more you know brow bone color on
whatever so that was the issue that I
was having so I just used the morphe and
5:11 or anything similar I have a lot of
dupes and you know brushes that are very
similar to this something that's a
little more stiff because the crease is
a tough area and I highly recommend
looking down when you're doing it cuz
it's like you really want to get in
there if you're looking straight you
might not get in there all the way you
can lift your eyebrows like this but you
know I don't know I don't do I try and
not do that because I'm like no I don't
want to premature wrinkle but I mean I
find if I look down into a mirror I can
see exactly where things are I can see
if color has deposited more in one spot
over the other which it tends to happen
with the crease that's the trickiest
part in my opinion because it's like
caved in you know so anyway that is what
I like to do I do not do any kind of
circular movement with this just back
and forth kind of in a stiff way once
that is completely blended I kind of
have like a blunt line here so I have
blended my crease but I have not blended
above like this little area here that is
when like I said I like to go into my
Sigma tapered blending I keep forgetting
with
the e-40 and i just take it and i do the
small circular motions and I do it right
above I don't go into the crease I don't
go near the lid I go right above and I
just do small circular motions very very
light and fluffy and I go like that and
I make sure that I get over here because
if you are someone who doesn't tape over
here you know people like to put tape
here so they get a very precise line you
will notice um if you don't move your
head while you're doing these circular
motions you will forget this area so you
want to always blend this area but do
you see how light I'm pressing I'm not
going like this because the second you
do that the brush is huge that thing's
gonna go up to your brow bone really
really lightly and this is beautiful it
is great for doing this and diffusing
that eyeshadow that you basically like
to left over from the crease basically
so that is how I like to do my crease as
far as outer V I'm not wearing an outer
V sort of color today but I really like
the morphe m50 3 or anything similar the
reason I like this is because it is flat
and it is um it's kind of tapered it's
kind of like skinny chubby so what I
like to do is take whatever color I want
as my outer V I take it I put it on the
flat part I stamp it onto the outer part
of my eye because if you're going in
with something super fluffy you're like
okay I'm gonna do the ironing out boom
do you see how much room that takes up
you are going like halfway into your
crease the point of an outer V color is
just to define the definer you know it's
just to define that area so that you
kind of have like a smoked out
appearance it is not to bring that dark
color anywhere in to the eye you don't
want it down by the lid you don't want
it really really far in you know near
the crease and that was my issue was
that I would go in with a definer and
then suddenly my whole eye look was just
definer so I really like this brush
because it just you can pack it on and
then you tilt it and you can see that it
goes right into your crease and then you
blend that area and I do not go any
further so I will Pat it like this flip
it and that is the only place that I
will blend it in and then I like to go
in and I
take again my morphe I'm five-eleven or
anything similar something that's clean
and then I will do the little circular
motion and the reason I do that with the
stiffer brush is because the outer V is
a little tricky when you pack on that
color you're going to have a you're
going to see that you have literally
packed color on in just one area so you
really really want to make sure you
blend and I find that circular motions
is good for that so I do do that with a
stiffer brush just because I don't do it
for my crease doesn't mean I don't do it
for the definer shade but um so yeah
that is what I do and then yes lid work
okay I never ever ever put my lid color
on first ever because by the time I'm
done blending my crease there is no lip
color left and you have to go back in
and put more on so I put my lid color on
last and I today like I said I'm wearing
grandstand I like to go in with my ring
finger this is my favorite little tool
and I like to just pack any eyeshadow on
it doesn't matter if it's this one if
it's to face palette whatever I feel
comfortable and I feel like my ring
finger the size of it fits into my eye
area very very nicely and I can pack it
on the way I want to I find that a lot
of these like flat eyeshadow brushes are
too wide they're too fat and I just I
can't pick up enough color I just have
issues and I have a lot of them don't
get me wrong I try and use them but I
prefer to use them for different things
you know you can use them to blend you
can use them to put eyeliner on whatever
I just like to pack my lid color on with
my fingers I think it really gets it on
there and after you have put your define
you know you're defining color on and
you already have color that is kind of
seeped down from the crease when you
pack the lid color back on it is making
an easy transition to look at between
the definer shade and the crease shade
because you are putting it on top and
normally um I mean it doesn't have to be
but a lot of people try and go for
something lighter on the lid like you
know today I'm wearing that on my lid
and then I went a little deeper in the
crease and if I was
going to do outer-v I would maybe go
into Houdini even darker but for the lid
you know just patting that on that
lighter color is going to make
everything kind of transition really
really beautifully and that's just the
way I like to do it I have a lot of flat
eyeshadow brushes I just don't really
use them for that purpose like packing
it on it just they don't work very well
for me and I feel like my finger is so
much better it's like made to go right
on my lid anyway so yeah now I'm going
to talk about bringing shadow underneath
which I did do today my favorite way to
do this is not with like an eyeliner
brush it's not with like I don't know my
favorite way is to do with like a pencil
brush basically and I like it to be
dense do you see that like it's dense
it's not just like you know it's not
giving way right away it is the Urban
Decay 24/7 blending brush it doesn't
matter you can get any sort of pencil
brush just make sure it's a little stiff
can you guys see that mark that it made
on my hand do you see how that like
instantly kind of smoked out I put
flamethrower on my lower lash line today
and you just want to do it underneath
your you know water line you don't want
to ever fill in your waterline with
powder but I just go like this and I
kind of just go back and forth back and
forth and the nice part about using a
brush like this that is dense is that it
automatically blends it for you so that
you don't have to go back in
god forbid with one of these big brushes
and start wiping underneath your eye if
you do want to do that you can go in
with the morphe &amp;amp; 503 this one is okay
for underneath the eye you really can
kind of blend it out but honestly I
didn't take like eyeliner or anything
underneath my lash line today all I did
was this and I just went back and forth
back and forth and I feel like it gave a
very diffused beautiful beautiful kind
of smoky effect to the lower lash line
and it's so easy that was just one
application and it's not hard to smoke
out your lower lashline seriously if you
get a pencil brush I'm sorry the
lighting just changed the Sun just came
out if you get like a pencil brush that
is kind of stiff and not too tapered and
wimpy
and you don't want to use like an
eyeliner brush I'm sorry but those
eyeliner brushes like it just makes such
a thin little line and it's too exact
you want something that's gonna smudge
it out a little bit if that's the look
you're going for of course so those are
kind of my thoughts and my tips and my
tricks on things I still do what most
people do I just have found ways to use
my brushes that work for me basically
and by no means like like I said I'm not
a makeup artist I don't put together
amazing amazing looks but it's
definitely a step up from what I used to
do and um yeah I just find it really
easy once you kind of find the shape
that you want from a brush you can get
many different brands you know but once
you kind of find the shape that you like
for a certain area on your eye it's just
so much easier because you know exactly
what brushes you want to use and I think
that that's a huge thing also I primer
is very important today I am wearing the
elf eyelid primer in shear this is like
1 or 3 dollars it works very well Milani
also makes an excellent one you do not
need to get a high end one you really
don't
but eyeshadow primer definitely helps
you know the shadows you know to stick
to your eye basically um it does require
a little more blending when you are
actually like you know blending the eye
look together because sometimes the
bases can be a little sticky but
honestly the colors are just not as
pigmented without a primer in my opinion
and that just goes for like all of my
eyeshadow palettes so anyway I hope this
was somewhat helpful um you do not need
to have the Sigma brush or the morphe
ones anything that's shaped similar and
when I showed you guys these these are
not the ones I've used every single day
I dig through my drawer and I find
something that's similar now I just look
for shape I know I like that to blend in
the crease above the crease and then
something like this for my lower lash
line and then something to deposit color
into my crease I like something like
this so I just look for shape and it
seems to work well for me and I haven't
had an issue yeah so I hope that this
was somewhat helpful like I said I will
be posting tutorials mince my beauty
room is completely
together it's like 65 55% there I still
have a lot of work to do but um yeah so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
talking about blending and things like
that I think that blending is the
hardest thing to do and it's also the
most important thing to do and that's
why it's so hard it's like because if
you don't actually put the time in to do
it you're not going to get the beautiful
diffused smoky eye that you want or
whatever you're going for um you guys
know I don't edit my videos but I find
it difficult when I'm watching people
and they put together these excellent
gorgeous looks it just absolutely
gorgeous and then they fast-forward
through the blending process you guys it
probably takes me five to 10 minutes on
each eye to completely blend okay that
is normally I feel like five minutes on
each eye is normally what it takes
people to blend and to fast-forward
through that part it drives me crazy
because I want to know what they're
doing they just say oh yeah I just do
the circular motions and back and forth
well that didn't really work for me but
you know I want to see them actually
doing it I want to know that it doesn't
just take me ten minutes to blend my
eyeshadows out because I know it doesn't
you know it takes everybody a good
amount of time and I think that it is
the most important step if you watch
those kind of videos you can see like
the girls right after they've come back
from you know skipping through the
blending process suddenly the eye look
is starting to come together blending is
so important so um yeah uh yeah I don't
really have anything else to say I think
I hit up all the points that I wanted to
my lips feel so dry and cracked today oh
but anyway um trying to think if there
was something else so I think that's
everything I just kind of wanted to talk
about it share little hacks and tips
that work for me you don't necessarily
have to get rid of your brushes maybe
you can use it for a different thing
like I do with the Sigma ones and just
because a brush says this is what it's
for it's only for blending or it's only
for your crease now just use whatever
brushes you want and whatever works for
you and your eye
sheep and your eye type I don't know
whatever works for you in that area you
used it it doesn't matter what it is it
doesn't matter if it's one dollar or
twenty six dollars so anyway I hope this
was helpful please leave me any kind of
questions you might have below or give
me some tips and tricks on what are your
like favorite blending things to do so I
will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
