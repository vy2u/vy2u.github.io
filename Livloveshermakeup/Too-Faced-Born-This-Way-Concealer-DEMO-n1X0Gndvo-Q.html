this video I have a demo for you guys on
the new Too Faced Born This Way
concealer the shade that I will be
demoing for you guys is the shade very
fair which is the lightest out of all of
them and if you would like to see a
review on this product I will go ahead
and link it down below in the
description bar it will be the first
thing you see and there you can just
learn the basic information on it if I
like it all that kind of stuff so we're
just gonna go ahead and get started
I have already primed my face I used the
Garnier 5 second blur skin renew instant
smoother it's like a did mythic own
primer I use that for my face and then I
went in with my ELF $1 eyelid primer in
the shade sheer alright I also went in
with my foundation I've used these
smashbox camera-ready BB water drops
with broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen my
shade is fair and I used one dropper
full of that I applied it with a flat
top kabuki brush from Sigma and now we
are going to go ahead and demo the
actual products so I am going to use one
side with this tapered pointed
foundation brush from morphe it came in
a kit so it doesn't actually have a
number on it but I'm sure that you guys
have something like this in your
collection and on the other side I will
be applying this product with a damp or
Real Techniques sponge so let's go ahead
and get started I am going to take the
concealer and I'm going to apply this
underneath my eyes down to the tip of my
nose kind of in like a little triangle
underneath my eyes on each side and also
on my eyelid and I am going back in for
product when I need to put it on my
eyelid so doing that on the other side
as well
sorry if you hear my boyfriend laughing
in the background he's skyping with his
friend and then I'm going to go back in
put a little bit on my chin and I will
blend this part out with my sponge
because that is my preferred method of
application with this product is
definitely with my Real Techniques
sponge I just think it really really
goes on nicely and it's my favorite way
so we will start with the sponge on the
left side I am going to go ahead and
just Pat that in and as you guys can see
this is concealing really really nicely
and this actual color matches my skin
tone very well I think that this
definitely has more of like a satiny
finish to it that's what it reminds me
up it blends really really quickly and
effortlessly and again if you would like
a full review I will have that linked
below but I would say that this
particular shade match which is a fair
shade with pink undertones is very nice
on my skin so you guys can see how
quickly that blended that is one layer
and if you guys are curious the Smashbox
camera-ready BB water drops the
foundation says it's very lightweight
foundation so I hope you guys can see
how much that is concealing all right so
next we are gonna go in with the morphe
brush on this side and I am just going
to use patting motions to blend this in
this is definitely not my favorite way
to apply this I find that it goes a
little streaky on the skin and it does
take away some of the coverage and I
find that it does that with any sort of
brush no matter if I'm using stippling
motions or if I'm blending with like a
little buffing brush I find that it just
kind of takes away the coverage a little
bit and it doesn't look as good i feel
like this side looks a lot better than
this side in my opinion so now i'm gonna
go again one more time i'm ready to go
in one more time and I'm going to go
underneath the eyes again and then we
are just going to blend in with the Real
Techniques sponge so that you guys can
really see how this looks on the skin
when it is built up because I think that
it layers very very nicely and I don't
feel like I feel like that brush just
took away the coverage I don't know if
you guys saw that on camera I've no idea
if it will pick up with these bright
lights but for me personally I think
that the best way for application is
definitely with a damp sponge it's just
very very effortless and it just blends
so nicely and it really really looks
like skin like seriously that took like
three seconds so this is the way it
looks after two
players as you guys can probably see it
is not cakey underneath my eyes
whatsoever it actually looks really
beautiful and kind of satiny a little
bit glowy it kind of reminds me of the
foundation but not so oily and greasy on
the skin they born this way foundation I
was not a huge fan of I do have combo
oily skin and I just felt like that
really really made me I li like
immediately after I applied it I feel
like this would be nice for anyone who
does have I don't know combo skin oily
skin and dry skin I feel like you really
could use this as long as you set it in
now because I do have a combo to oily
skin I am going to go ahead and set my
whole face in with powder I will be
using my essence all about Matt 16
compact powder which looks like this and
I will be applying that a little photo I
figure I will be applying that with the
tarte air buffer foundation brush and
i'm going to set in my eye area first
and I am stippling this on and I love
the way that this sets you can set it
with any sort of powder again if you
have dry skin you can just set it oh my
gosh getting all over my black shirts
but if you have dry skin you can just
set in the areas that you want to set in
it definitely helps with the stain power
but if you do have oily combo skin like
me you probably want to set in your
whole face I just think this is a
gorgeous concealer can you guys see my
under-eye I feel like if there's not a
lot of blue tones I feel like it really
cancels out and kind of color corrects
that it doesn't settle into any sort of
fine lines or wrinkles which is
absolutely lovely alright and after we
have done that it's a brush off our
shirt because we decided to wear black
today look at that gross
anyway that's with my little demo on the
new Too Faced Born This Way concealer I
hope you guys enjoyed it like I said I
will have the review link down below so
you guys can check that out and I will
see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
