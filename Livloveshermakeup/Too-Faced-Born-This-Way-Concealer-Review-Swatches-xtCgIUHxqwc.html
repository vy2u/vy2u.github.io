this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new Too Faced Born
This Way concealer I purchased this for
$28 on the Too Faced calm website and I
of course will link below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
one up as well if you are interested
this is not a limited edition item this
will be permanent to the Too Faced Calm
website and if you guys are looking for
a demo on this particular product I will
link below my video so anyway the shape
that I picked up out of all 10 shades
that do have 10 shades is the shade very
fair and very fair is supposed to be for
fair skin tones with a cool undertone or
a pink undertone this matches my skin
perfectly it's absolutely beautiful and
I will say although I did not like the
Born This Way Foundation that they
released about a year ago I was gonna
say a week ago a year ago although I
didn't like that I really really do like
this particular product I personally do
have combo to oily skin that gets very
oily during the summer time and this
still leaves a beautiful sheen on my
skin without looking too oily so this is
oil free and is supposed to just give
you a naturally radiant look to the face
it says that a hundred percent of people
said it showed improvement in skin
moisture levels after one hour and I
know that sounds like a really hefty
claim but honestly I find that after I
apply this concealer it looks better and
better throughout the day I don't know
how but honestly I am wearing it
underneath my eyes today two layers of
it and I don't feel like it looks cakey
or Creasy whatsoever it just looks
better and better the more that you wear
it so there definitely are some
moisturizing complex or you know I don't
really know they have some sort of
moisturizing ingredients in here 97% of
people said it left a natural
undetectable finish I definitely have to
agree with that as well and 97% of
people also said it gave a flawless no
makeup look and it was smooth creaseless
and just gorgeous on the skin basically
is what they're saying now normally I
don't really think that you know when
products release wood products when
companies release a product I don't
really fall into their claims because
they always make such big claims but
honestly this particular concealer is
absolutely absolutely stunning so here
is the outer packaging I am going to go
ahead and link below as well as you guys
can see there is a little bit of an
ingredients list here I will have that
link below in the description bar but
this is just typical cute to face
packaging like pink and black and then
the actual packaging looks like this
it's just an acrylic little container
and then it does say Born This Way in
gold do you have the little two-faced
emblem right there and then you have the
little cap that is black it does have a
little lock closure which is nice it
snaps closed you guys probably can't
hear it but I like that because then I
know my concealer is not pouring into my
purse you do get 0.23 fluid ounces of
product in here or 7.0 ml which is about
the standard amount for a concealer now
$28 for a concealer some people may
think that that is a lot I normally
personally approaches drugstore
concealers and I feel like this is a
little high in price range but honestly
it's so beautiful on the skin that I
don't mind paying for it so let me show
you guys what the actual applicator
looks like because I think it's really
really interesting I do wish that it
picked up a little more product because
I find when I go underneath my eyes if
I'm going in like a v-shape I have to
dip back in each time that I go and then
again for my eyelids for my chin down
the bridge of my nose my forehead but
this is what the actual doe foot
applicator looks like and look how
flexible this is how cool is that it is
so flexible this is probably the most
flexible wand I have ever seen in my
life and when I first got it I was like
it's my broken like why is it moving
that much like literally it will just go
like me yeah it's kind of awesome it
really really goes into those tiny
corners you can flip it you know twist
it and all this kind of stuff and I
really really like it and at first I
really thought that there was something
wrong with mine but no and this is what
the actual wand is like and I absolutely
adore this wand I hate when you have a
really stiff wand that's kind of pointed
this way and you just can't really get
into the small areas I feel like with
this you can get into all the little
tiny crevices so as far as concealing is
concerned I think this is absolutely
beautiful underneath the eyes if you
have dry skin if you have aging skin if
this is going
to be like your ride or die now if you
do have oily or combo skin I would
highly recommend setting this in with a
powder today I do have it set in with
the essence all about Matt fixing
compact powder like I said I am wearing
two layers that this underneath my eyes
today on my eyelids and I just feel like
it looks beautiful there's no creasing
it doesn't feel like it's moving around
on my skin now when you do set it in
with a powder it does obviously change
the finish a little bit one of the most
gorgeous things about this particular
product is the finish it's a very very
gorgeous satiny look on the skin when
you just blend it in my favorite way to
apply this is definitely with a real
techniques sponge that is damp I just
love the way it goes on it's so quick to
blend like literally I one of those
people I do not like to spend a lot of
time on my makeup and this just makes
the whole process so so so fast and easy
and I think a lot of that has to do with
the fact that I found a really really
nice color match for my skin but
honestly I think the formulation is just
really really blendable and very very
beautiful so overall I think this is a
really nice product like I said if you
do have aging skin or dry skin I think
you can get away with using this
underneath your eyes or anywhere that
you want without having to set it in
with powder I think it's going to look
beautiful on the skin very useful it's
not going to start creasing and it's not
going to fall into your fine lines I do
have fine lines around the outer parts
of my mouth on the you know underneath
my eyes here and then a little bit on my
forehead I do not feel like this
emphasizes that at all so that is why I
feel like I can say even people who do
have aging skin I feel like this will be
really really beautiful I think there is
a little bit of DeMatha cone in here so
it does sit on top of the skin nicely
it's not going to sink in and over
emphasize any pores or anything like
that
we have all been there and done that
with the concealer underneath the eyes
that makes you look like you're like you
know a hundred and eight years old we've
all been there but this is not the kind
of concealer it's just absolutely
beautiful
one complaint that I do have is I can't
seem to find a brush that I like to use
when applying this product the only way
that I like to apply it like I said is
with a damp sponge it seems to get a
little streaky when I apply it with any
sort of brush whether I'm stippling or
blending buffing it in
I just don't like the way it looks it
kind of takes away from the coverage so
overall I think if you are going to use
anything use the sponge you can use any
sort a little Sponge Bob that you have
and make sure that it is damp
so we're time on this is actually very
very strong like I said if you do have
copper or oily skin you need to set this
baby in because it is a little glowy it
does have a little bit of a satiny
texture to it and there is a little bit
of I don't know how else to describe it
a little bit of moisture in there so you
are going to need to go ahead and set it
in but honestly I just think it's
beautiful throughout the day and as long
as you do set it in with a nice you know
matte powder you're not gonna have any
issues and I do feel like after I said
like when I first set it in it just
looks so completely matte but it still
looks pretty but then throughout the day
those moisture levels start to kind of
break through and it just looks glowy
and pretty without being oily on the
skin so here is the swatch on the back
of my hand as you guys can see it has a
very beautiful luminous quality to it
when you first apply it and then when
you do blend it in it does stay nice and
satiny which by the way can we talk
about this shade match yes I don't think
I've ever found a concealer that matches
me so perfectly but when you blend it in
a little more it definitely starts to
feel a little more tacky but then it
just smooths down and you can feel that
sort of DeMatha con feel and then you
have this beautiful luminous effect
without being like wham bam in your face
oily greasy glowy and it's just gorgeous
it just sits on top of the skin and I
don't mean that in a bad way like oh you
can tell that you're wearing makeup
because you can't with this it really
blends into your skin but it sits on top
of your skin it's not going to sink into
your pores or your fine lines or
anything like that so overall I could
not say like better things about this
particular concealer this is definitely
going to be a new favorite for me I
highly recommend just going on to the
website and checking out the shades I
really do think that you'll be able to
find one for your skin tone and I feel
like this is a concealer that will work
for people of all ages so yeah overall
really really good product and very
happy that I picked this up but like I
said I did do a demo on this product as
well so I will have that link below if
you want to see it applied to my face
and yeah thank you so much for joining
me guys I will see you in my next video
