swatches time this time it will be on
the Too Too Faced candy bar palettes
that I picked up um these were on the
two-faced website and if you watched my
hall from a couple of days ago you'll
know I had picked these up I've been
playing with them all week I think
they're wonderful they have amazing
pigmentation and there in this small
little compact um phone case I kept the
phone case on them you can actually use
the phone case I have the new iphone so
it's not going to work but I just
thought that packaging was adorable even
with the phone case on they're not bulky
at all and they fit into your bag
perfectly so the first one we have here
is the lighter as I would consider
lighter palette so you get a nice light
blush a bronzer to highlight shades but
I would use these more as I shadows
two-faced always does that where they
have bigger when it comes to like
lighter I shadows they have bigger pot
so I'm not quite sure why but I use
those as I shadows and then you get nine
I shadows here too so that's the first
one these are the swatches they're
amazingly pigmented creamy exactly what
you would expect from any to face
palette or any of the to face products
love them absolutely love this gold
shade right here if you have blue eyes
you're going to love this color and the
other one is a little more dark I would
say it is maybe a little more you could
get smokey looks out of this you get
this nice darker blush here now to
bubblegum pink it's more like a dark
peach color you get a darker bronzer
that's cool cool tones not so warm toned
and then you get two of these you know
highlight shades or what I've been using
them as which is just like a base for
our you know like a brow bone color
things like that and then this is
actually nice in the crease thats dark
enough that you can actually work it
into the crease I like that then again
you get nine eyeshadows and these ones
are a little more smokey toned a little
darker and this is how they swatch so
really really pigmented you only need a
little bit um I think both are
absolutely gorgeous i'm happy i picked
both up but they were like I think under
twenty dollars each so it's definitely
worth it
and I just love how travel friendly they
are you know they're so easy to just
pick up and toss in your purse you can
either do like I consider this one a
night Khalid and then this is kind of
like a date palette and they're just so
easy to just toss in your purse and I
find them so portable and fun so I
highly recommend I think they're great
the pigmentation is awesome the only
thing i would change i guess is if those
colors right there are actually
highlighters for the face a little more
pigmentation but I kind of think that
they are meant to be shadows that's just
kind of how to face has always done it
they do a bigger pot when it comes to
like the lighter shades in their palates
and things like that so anyway I highly
recommend these two I absolutely love
them here are the swatches again later
palette darker palin and i think you
just get a lot of bang for your buck so
highly recommend and i'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
