thank you so much for joining me I hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
today I am reviewing and doing swatches
for you guys on the new Too Faced
chocolate bon bons palette the outer
packaging looks like this this is what
the box looks like I purchased mine on
the Sephora calm website for $49 which
is the same price that the other
chocolate bar palette have been in the
past the first one and they semi-sweet
and this is exclusive to VIP and VIP
Rouge only on the Sephora comm website
right now it will be released for
everyone in the future it is not a
limited edition product so don't worry
about getting your hands on it right
away but I do want to say if you go on
to the Too Faced calm web say anybody
can order it so you don't need to wait
for it on the Sephora calm website if
you don't want to but anyway this is
what the outer packaging looks like and
you can see on the back they show the 16
shades and two of the shades in here are
actually um not like exclusive to the
palette they are basically called
favorites one of them is called totally
fetch and you can see that it is in this
pretty rebel Palace that I have here
from Too Faced it's that color right
there and then the other one I'm not
even sure which one it is that is like a
cult favorite I almost want to say it's
I don't know I think it might be I don't
know guys maybe malted I really I really
don't know I have a lot of Too Faced
palettes and I have looked through them
and tried to find similar shades and
there is one other in here that is
supposed to be um like one of their cult
favorites but I have no idea which one
it is
but anyway I do know that total effect
is one of their called favorite shades
is a beautiful beautiful like I showed
you guys bright pink color so anyway
this is what the actual packaging of the
palette looks like typical Too Faced
chocolate bar packaging it's got the
kind of tin and it opens up it's got a
little bit of like a magnetic sort of
closure you don't get like a full-on
mirror here I almost I always didn't
like that they did that I felt like you
know if they do this with every palette
they put like the chocolate whatever it
is but I felt like they could have made
this whole thing a mirror that would
have been great but this is what these
shades look like all 16 shades
absolutely gorgeous and you can see the
difference
in this particular packaging is that
instead of having them like little
pieces of chocolate like little bars
this is in the shape of hearts which is
adorable
two-face has been on this kind of heart
kick lately they've been coming out with
like their love flush blushes which are
in the shapes of hearts and just a lot
of their products they're kind of on
this little hearts beam kick heart
themed kick which i think is adorable I
really love packaging like that however
I could see if you were more of a like
mature woman or I don't even know some
people younger people might not even
like this um you may think oh that's
that doesn't look very um no it doesn't
look very grown-up it just looks a
little childish some people may think
that I personally love it
compare it to the other two chocolate
bar palette it is quite girly and young
if that makes sense um but I really like
it I enjoy it so like I said it is $49
and the textures in here and the formula
of these shadows is very very similar to
the ones that you get in the original
chocolate bar and the semi-sweet let me
show you guys those really quickly so
this is the original chocolate bar
palette same sort of packaging except of
course it looks like little chocolate
pieces you can see there are warmer
tones in this one and then you get the
semi-sweet which is still to this day of
my favorite chocolate bar palette even
with the little hearts one that came out
or the bonbon palette the one I'm
showing you guys today this is still my
all-time favorite I just love the shades
in here I love that you get a few pops
of color I feel like toothpaste does
that with their chocolate bar palettes
you always get you know sixteen shades
but you get some that are very neutral
and then you get a few pops of color
this time I sweet is just my go-to it's
my ultimate favorite one however I will
say the bonbon palette is really really
wonderful it's a very very cute and I
really do like the shades in here and I
find that the blend ability the textures
everything about them is the same as the
original one and the semi-sweet so I
already have very very strong opinions
on the first and second I personally
absolutely adore them and I think a lot
of people do you get this nice mixture
of kind of satin colors you get a few
that have a little bit of glitter in
them and you get some that are matte
however they all feel the same they have
the same kind of creamy blendable
texture and they're highly highly
pigmented so I don't have much to
complain with what
comes to the formula I think the formula
is really fantastic and I think the
shades in here are actually really
beautiful this one reminds me a little
more of like a cool-toned sort of
palette I'm seeing a lot more cooler
tones in here and I also have seen a lot
of wonderful transition colors that are
matte like cashew - pecan praline this
one right here called mocha and then
divinity is this beautiful beautiful
kind of like highlight color but it has
a tiny tiny little bit of sparkle in it
and it's really really just absolutely
stunning so anyway um I think that these
were beautifully especially if you are
wearing a primer with them they really
do wear all day I don't like I said I
don't have a lot to complain about the
formula I just kind of knew that the
formula was going to be the same as the
original chocolate bar and the
semi-sweet so if you have both of those
the formula is basically the same exact
except of course you are getting
different colors in here I will say if
you have never picked up one of these
chocolate bar palettes before and you
are looking at all three of them now and
say which one should I get
I would still recommend the semi-sweet
it is just my favorite I just love the
colors in there and I think it's just
absolutely beautiful
most people would actually recommend the
first one though it's the most neutral
it's the most basic and I think anybody
can use it but anyway let's go on and
just starts watching this baby shall we
so I'm gonna start and just kind of go
down this way
I don't know well maybe I'll go across
yeah I'll go across so I'm gonna start
with this shade right here it's called
almond truffle it is a beautiful
beautiful kind of medium toned greyish
pinkish color it's very hard to explain
but that's what it looks like and then
go ahead and swatch that for you guys
and like I said I just love that the
matte colors in here are just as creamy
and pigmented as the other colors like
these shimmery colors or the ones that
have a little bit of glitter and the
ones that have a little bit of glitter
are not gritty I hate that I hate when
they're gritty so that is the first
shade that one is called almond truffle
the second shade alone the maghreb
white the second shade if we are going
across is called satin sheets this is a
beautiful beautiful kind of shimmery
color it's got like a pinky I don't even
know it's like a pinky color but it has
tons and tons of gold shimmer in it it's
absolutely stunning do you guys see that
whoa baby whoa baby it's just so
different I love this color would be
absolutely
gorgeous all over the lid that is satin
sheets as you can see it's kind of like
iridescent and it has a little bit of
like a dual chrome thing going on sorry
my nose is ready yes so you get a little
bit of pink and you get a little bit of
gold absolutely stunning
the next one in here is called sprinkles
this is a beautiful just kind of similar
to satin sheets it's basically a pink
color but it has a little less gold
shimmer in it but it is very very pretty
as well but still has that kind of
iridescent in it absolutely stunning
there is sprinkles alright the next one
in here is called a malted chip and this
is a beautiful kind of Goldy how did I
describe that Goldy brownish color
kind of coppery almost like a penny
penny kind of color right there oh it's
just so gorgeous look how pigmented that
is well baby look at that isn't that
gorgeous love that color and then the
next one is Malta is the one that I
think please tell me if you know if this
is their other one that they are talking
about that is like a cult favorite
because I have a lot of toothpaste
palettes and I can't seem to find the
other cult favorite besides they totally
said shade but Moulton is beautiful it
is a deep deep deep deep deep chocolate
brown color almost like bordering on a
grayish undertone and it does have tiny
tiny little flecks of pink gold shimmer
in it really really beautiful though I
love this color I think it's really
really beautiful as a liner shade just
because a lot of the shimmers in there
don't really pick up like it's not super
super noticeable so a really really
beautiful basic deep chocolatey color
perfect for a chocolate bar palette the
next one I'm going to talk about is this
one right here it's called cashew -
beautiful transition color it's a little
more pink toned and it's got like a
little more of a pink undertone
basically and it's absolutely stunning
it's right there it's one of those
shades that like unless you were using
it as a transition color you wouldn't
really think - now I'm not gonna say you
wouldn't think to use it but it's just
one of those colors where it's like it
really only works as a trans
like you may not even be able to really
fully see it wipes other stuff off you
see that it does have a little bit of an
iridescence to it but it's not super
super crazy the next shade is called
cotton candy is a beautiful beautiful
light pink shade and it has a bunch of
like a ton a ton of silver iridescent to
it I love pink shades with silver
iridescent I don't know about you guys
but I think they are so so pretty it's
such a girly sort of combination you
know pink with silver I don't know why I
don't know why I don't know why that
like it's the first thing that reminds
me of what it is the next one is called
cafe au lait and this is a beautiful
taupey color it has a lot a lot of
silver shimmer in it and this is again
kind of like a satiny texture really
really beautiful highly highly pigmented
the satiny shades in here really have a
lot of pigment to them can you see that
beautiful if you like really really kind
of topi shades alright so the next one
in here is called Bordeaux this is a
gorgeous gorgeous a deep brown under
like deep brown matte color with a
beautiful beautiful kind of reddish
undertone we guys can see me in the
camera with a beautiful kind of reddish
undertone and it is like I said
completely matte and it's just so soft I
love it
there it is it's just so easy to blend
to it's just beautiful so there is
Bordeaux the next one is called mocha
this is again another math one except it
has more of a cool undertone to it
instead of a ready undertone it's got
more of a cool undertone to it again
beautiful beautiful texture to it it
feels the exact same as the Bordeaux
shade and again just so easy to blend
there's mocha and then the next one is
their really really funny wanna it has a
ton a ton of shimmer in it but again it
feels easy to blend it feels not gritty
if that makes sense I feel like a lot of
Urban Decay palettes you know when you
get those glittery shades you know
they're gonna be a little gritty with
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette
those ones never feel that way they
never feel super like gritty but it's
called blackcurrant it is a gorgeous
gorgeous deep purple color with tons and
a silver shimmer in it there is a little
bit of fallout with these kind of
glittery shades but it doesn't feel
glittery like they just feel so smooth
and blendable and pigmented look at that
color
ah super super gorgeous all right the
next color is called dark truffle and
this is like a it's like the equivalent
to Bordeaux except it has shimmer in it
so it's got that really really deep kind
of dark brown color with a little bit of
like a red tinge to it but it also has
tons and tons of a tiny little gold
shimmers in it just that that is the
color right there again really really
easy to blend beautiful beautiful color
the next one is called pecan praline
this is the one that I really like as a
transition it's basically just a light
matte gray shade and I don't know like I
just love the transition shades in here
I feel like they did a really really
good job with that so that is pecan
praline right there go ahead and swatch
a few guys basically just like a light
matte gray it's similar to almond
truffle but almond truffle has a lot
more pink in it it is right there I
don't know if you guys can tell sorry
that's one it stained my hand that uh
blackcurrant black currant shade really
really gorgeous I don't know why it
stains pink even though it's a purple
shade but the next one is a pink shade
it's called totally fetch this is one of
the cult favorites that they talked
about in the palette it's just a
beautiful beautiful totally fetch kind
of shade guys it looks like that oh so
gorgeous totally reminds me of Mean
Girls very very pretty and then the next
one is called Earl Grey I love the names
I just love that name I think that's
wonderful of God these really do stain
those kind of deep deep purple and pink
shades really stain for Earl great is a
beautiful purpley blue color and it has
a ton of silver shimmer in it really
gorgeous that is what it looks like
does remind me of Earl Grey tea it's
just beautiful it's got a lot of shimmer
in there too really really pretty wasn't
a very good swatch you blend it out a
little more there you go
very very pretty and then the last shade
it's kind of that hi ladies sort of
shade but it does have a little bit of
glitter in it but again it doesn't feel
like there's litter in it and when you
put it like underneath your brow bone or
things like that you don't notice that
there's litter it kind of just doesn't
really translate on to the eye but it's
called divinity and it's that beautiful
it is that beautiful kind of creamy
white shade right there God it feels so
smooth and creamy you guys I can't even
tell you Mike oh all right i swatched it
all right there hopefully you can tell
so those are all 16 shades I really
really am enjoying this palette I feel
like that one has a little bit of
Fallout I feel like if you have the
other chocolate bar palette this is
definitely a necessity for you to have
as well just because you know the
formula you know the formula and the
pigmentation everything's just like a
hundred percent and there do you know
what I mean I feel like these chocolate
bar palettes are so consistent with
pigmentation blend ability and also like
the wear time on the eyes is just such a
consistent thing and this one does not
fail when it comes to that as well so
really really cute I'm very happy that I
picked it up would I say that the shades
are anything spectacular no but I do
think there are a lot of really really
nice transition shades in here I like
the satin sheets shade a lot I love
black currant and of course totally
fetch is one that again everybody loves
it's a cult favorite but um overall
really really good palette I still would
recommend the semi-sweet the most it's
my favorites and if you want a really
really neutral one the original one is
probably gonna be your favorite at this
new bon bons one is a little more cool
tone but again I think it's wonderful
and it's great to have this little
collection they are so cute look at
those little chocolate bars so anyway I
hope you guys did enjoy this review I
want to point out one more thing when
you get the little box it's very true to
Too Faced they do send you that little
pamphlet thing that you get inside that
shows you how to put together certain
eye looks just to get you started
Too Faced always does
with their little palates and I love it
I follow a lot of these quite often just
because it really gives you some nice
ideas on how to put together a cool look
whether it's like neutral or nighttime
or just kind of like out they're just
really really pretty so I do hold on to
these and I highly recommend that you
guys hold onto them as well so I hope
you might have enjoyed this review thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
