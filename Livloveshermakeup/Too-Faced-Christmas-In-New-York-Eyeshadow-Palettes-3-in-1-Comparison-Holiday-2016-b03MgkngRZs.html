today's video is going to be a
three-in-one comparison on the new
two-faced Christmas in New York sets or
kits so the first one we're gonna be
talking about is the Grand Hotel Cafe
which you give three different pallets
here
we're also going to be talking about the
macaroons palette and then also the
chocolate shop palette before we get
into that I just want to give you guys
some basic information on each one I
wrote a few things down so we're gonna
start with the Mary macaroons this is
what the palette looks like this is $39
on the Alta com website it is a limited
edition and it does include a deluxe
size better than sex mascara and 12
vanilla scented eyeshadows this is a 153
dollar value and it also does include a
signature step-by-step guide from Too
Faced each shadow in here contains 0.47
ounces of product as far as the Grand
Hotel Cafe is concerned this little set
here you are getting three different
palettes as you guys can probably see it
and you can get this only to face calm
website for $49 you are getting three
Christmas coffee scented pallets in
peppermint mocha Gingerbread coffee and
also eggnog latte in total you are
getting 18 back in shimmer eyeshadows in
here two blushes one bronzer and a
deluxe eyes better than sex mascara and
then for this baby this is the chocolate
shop in here you are getting about 21
eyes shadows you are getting a deluxe
eyes better than sex mascara you're also
getting a deluxe eyes what was it
Too Faced shadow insurance eye primer
and then you were also getting a plush a
blush a bronzer and also a highlight in
here as well as why can't I remember
what it's called the liquid lipstick
thing in the shade chocolate something
I'll leave it down below but I did do a
full review and swatches on this
particular kit I will leave that video
down below if you would like to check it
out but we are actually going to go
ahead and walk through these and I'm
going to start with my favorite and then
talk about my least favorite so out of
all three kids that they released this
year I will say that the Grand Hotel
cafe was the one that caught me off
guard and it is definitely the best in
my opinion
you are getting three different little
palettes here and they're really sturdy
and compact and travel size and one
thing I want to say about packaging wise
for every single kit in here this year
from Too Faced is that the packaging is
amazing I do have
than behind me and as you guys can tell
from the thumbnail you have these nice
like hard cardboard boxes that store all
of the products that you get in them so
I really love the packaging I have to
give that to to face this year I think
the packaging is absolutely adorable I
will be using mine for background
decoration really really cute but anyway
these little pallets are adorable you do
have a to and from on the back of every
single one and they're really nice and
actually sturdy I thought these were
gonna be really cheap and flimsy but
they do have a magnetic closure they
obviously saved a few bucks and did not
put a mirror in there but as you can see
for the layout of these you are getting
six eyeshadows and then either a blush
or a bronzer and this is the one that I
would say is the mist out of all three
but it's still worth it in the long run
so this is the peppermint mocha and in
here you are getting like we said six
eyeshadows in one blush this blush down
here is absolutely beautiful I will say
the formulations on the blushes and
bronzers in the Grand Hotel cafe set is
like amazing like impeccable absolutely
beautiful so very very impressed with
the face products in the Grand Hotel
cafe but I will say these shadows here
are a little more firmly press they
remind me a lot of peach chocolate shop
which was the first palette that I
picked up and I was seeing in the review
you can make them work but compared to
the other two palettes in the Grand
Hotel cafe these just don't really stand
a chance now I am going to go ahead and
still keep this one because it's still
workable but you do get some tour just
kind of berry tones in here and some
nice brown shades now I don't have time
to swatch every single color in this
particular video so what I'm going to do
is leave a link down below for the
chocolate shop review so you guys can
see live swatches on every single
product in there and then I will link
down below to post to my Instagram where
you guys can see swatches on all of
these and then also the macaroons
palette so anyway this is the one out of
all three of the coffee scented palettes
that I will say is a little on the
weaker side it still is workable I would
finally recommend going ahead and
foiling some of the shades like this
shape right here which is called
Christmas blend if you want to put that
on the lid go ahead and foil at first
but overall still good quality that
blush in there is absolutely beautiful
and if you are curious about the scent
I wouldn't say any of these palettes
like smell too strongly this one just
kind of smells like sweetness and I
would say all of them too but this one
right here is the gingerbread cookie
this is probably my all-time favorite
wine it is absolutely adorable on the
back you have the to-and-from I actually
I feel like I can't choose between the
two of these so you just have gorgeous
colors so same thing you have the
magnetic closure no mirror and this time
you have a bronzer this is one of the
best bronzers I have ever experienced
from Too Faced which is absolutely crazy
so really really nice it does have a
little bit of a sheen in it it is called
Gingerbread and this one I guess smells
a little more spicy but it's not like
they're super overwhelming um so you do
have a few matte shades in here and then
you have this gorgeous shape right here
which is called gingersnap and I do want
to go ahead and swatch that for you guys
because it's stunning it is absolutely
stunning and one of the reasons why I'm
so into these palettes from the Grand
Hotel cafe set is because I do feel like
a lot of the shades in here are very
very comparable to the chocolate bar
palette and I didn't feel like that with
the chocolate shop palette or with the
macaroons palette but I will say there
are a few shades in the Grand Hotel cafe
that are very comparable to the
chocolate bar palettes which i think is
awesome so that gingersnap shade is
really beautiful this one right here
also very beautiful you are getting two
kind of liner shades down here this
one's a little more firmly pressed and
hard to work with but overall the
majority of the shades in here are
beautiful and like I said that bronzer
and there is probably the best bronzer I
have ever gotten from Too Faced and then
finally we have the eggnog latte really
cute packaging here as well same exact
thing six eyeshadows one blush love the
color selection in here you're getting
this gorgeous like hunter green color
down here and it is a little more firmly
pressed but it still goes on absolutely
beautiful almost foiled like let me show
you guys what it looks like
isn't that gorgeous it's just got a
really nice like turquoise sheen to it a
little bit of gold and they're really
really nice color and I really like the
way that they put the colors together in
this particular palette again cold brew
and eggnog latte me want to go ahead and
foil those if you do put them on the lid
but this peachy blush down here is life
it is called peach cobbler it is so
finely milled and absolutely stunning I
cannot even I cannot even with this it's
absolutely beautiful I love that it goes
on without tons and tons of fall out
really good quality very very happy so I
would say out of all three holiday sets
from Too Faced that this one definitely
definitely mm-hmm excuse me guys I'm
sorry I'm a little sick today but this
one definitely definitely is the one
that caught me off guard is definitely
the best quality and if I could
recommend any to you I would say go for
this wanna really like the color
selection in there really
product alright let's move on to the
macaroon set so here is the macaroon set
like I said you are getting a 2 faced
better than sex mascara deluxe eyes with
every single one of these but this is
what this little guy looks like and it's
very very sleek and adorable love the
little lavender thing going on you open
it up again they save some money instead
of putting a mirror in but at least they
did a cute design right so Christmas in
New York here are the eyeshadows really
really like this palette as well this is
one that I am also going to go ahead and
keep and I like I like these I feel like
they're not chocolate bars like standard
or quality but they are still really
good and they are better than the
chocolate shop shadows in my opinion
they're not super crazy firmly pressed
they still have a little bit of nice
like you know glide to them they really
kind of go on buttery but there are a
few shades in here like this one a
violet cassis that is a little more
firmly pressed and cookies and cream
also a little more firmly pressed but
what I like about these is that they are
very very pigmented and I do you feel
like they blend out nicely on the eye so
here are a few swatches for you guys as
you could see I just had to blow off
some excess fallout or kick up I don't
feel like I really have that much of a
problem with the holiday um what is it
called the Grand Hotel cafe scent but I
do feel like with the macaroons there is
a little bit I'll fall out and then with
the chocolate shop and that's the most
fall out so this is a really nice little
set if you do like those really really
neutral basic colors you would really
enjoy this I feel like all of the colors
in here are quite similar no matter what
throughout all three palettes so I just
want to put that out there really
quickly if you do have all three sets
you probably don't need all three sets
I'm going to be returning the chocolate
shot but overall I would say this one is
really nice quality if you would like a
very very sleek slender little palette
that you can toss into your purse that
you can travel with I think that this is
a great one I don't have too much to say
because there's not a whole lot going on
here if that makes sense these shadows
don't get me super super excited not
only because of the color selection but
also just because I feel like the Grand
Hotel Cafe is a lot easier to work with
but I still think that these are good
quality perfect to have in your purse
and really really pretty overall they do
have quite a few transition shades in
here which i think is awesome you do
have this coconut shade which is a matte
that's super super creamy and I will say
the maps in here are very very buttery
and very
very smooth they may look like they are
slightly patchy but once you blend them
out they are very very nice on the eye
so overall I would say that is my second
favorite again going to keep it although
I don't have too much to say it's mostly
just because of the color selection the
color selection isn't super exciting but
on a day to day basis these are the kind
of colors that I would wear to work and
things like that alright and finally we
have at the chocolate shop so the
chocolate shop looks like this like I
said I will link my review for this down
below I have decided to go ahead and not
return this but declutter it I do want
the outer packaging for it which I know
like what the hell Olivia but I love the
outer packaging I think this is probably
the hardest palette to work with out of
all three that you can choose from there
just firmly press that there's obviously
a nice color selection in here but I
feel like you can get these kind of
colors in the other palettes the only
thing that you're not getting in the
other palettes are obviously the lippy
the what would what was I gonna say the
eyeshadow primer and then also the
bronzer and the blush and also the
highlights these are different but I do
think that the bronzer and the blush is
in the Grand Hotel cafe set are much
better than these so overall this is
like a decent palette this was the first
one I picked up I really thought I was
gonna hold on to it until I tried the
others I for sure thought that they were
gonna put the most time and energy and
effort into this palette because it was
the biggest one and the biggest value
set in my opinion I do think that you
get the most product in here although
you are getting quite a bit of product
and the other ones I do think that
overall this is a really good one so I
do like this I think this is around in
the 50 $60 range but because the shadows
are so similar in tone and color to the
others and the others have a better
quality formulation in my opinion I will
be going ahead and decluttering this my
friend jess is amazing at makeup and one
of the things I said in my review on
this was that you have to spend that
little extra time with it so if you are
not interested in foiling those
eyeshadows like these two lids shades
here indulge and sugared raisin if
you're not interested in foiling those
forget it they're not gonna go on your
lid you know if you don't want to spend
that extra time blending these aren't
gonna work for you but if you are
someone who doesn't mind doing that and
you do like the larger color selection
in here then yeah I would say go ahead
and pick this up it's not that it's a
bad palette it's just not as good as the
others that have come out from the Too
Faced collection so anyway
I hope this was a helpful little
comparison video for you guys like I
said I will have those swatches linked
down below in my description bar for my
Instagram and yeah thank you so much for
joining me guys and I'll see you
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
