this video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new to face the
chocolate shop kit or pellet or set
whatever you want to call it this is new
it is the limited edition
I personally purchase mine on the
Sephora calm website I will link down
below in the description bar where you
guys can pick it up as well this is a
three hundred yes three hundred and
twelve dollar value inside of this kit
you are getting 21 in different
eyeshadows they range from kind of
glitter finishes to matte finishes and a
few satiny shades you're also getting a
highlight a bronzer and a blush and all
of the powder products are infused with
that cocoa powder formulation so they do
smell like chocolate then you are
getting three deluxe sized items the
first is the Too Faced better than sex
mascara a Too Faced shadow insurance and
also the melted chocolate liquefied
long-wear lipstick in the shade it in
milkshake not all of these products were
made here in the USA a few were made in
the Dominican Republic one was made here
in the USA and the other was made in
Italy and this is what the outer
packaging looks like as you guys can see
it's a beautiful light pink box and it
just show you all of the ingredients for
the products listed on the back as well
as where they were made and then the
actual packaging looks like this it's so
beautiful it's a really really sturdy
nice cardboard box I feel like there
should be behind me in my videos or
something it's so cute very very
decorative I really really enjoy it and
if you guys didn't know I went to
pre-college in ah so College in
Manhattan New York so I spent five years
of my life there really love New York
it's very magical during the Christmas
like time or during that time of year so
that's kind of why I wanted to get those
because Christmas in New York adorable I
was there for five years and I feel like
I spent a lot of Christmas there but
really really nice and I just thought
that was cute and kind of I know it was
special to me so I really wanted to get
this kit um anyway what happens here is
you just pulled this up as you guys can
see right here on the lid you do have a
little bow with little bells super super
cute and this is one of those typical
kind of two-faced over-the-top pop-out
things I really like this I think it's
absolutely adorable you can see a girl
with her dog and possibly her boyfriend
walking down a Fifth Avenue super super
cute and then down here you do get the
palette I'm trying to include this in
the actual frame but hopefully you guys
can see everything so I guess we'll just
go ahead and start with the three deluxe
size items that you do get and I will
give you guys my thoughts on those and
I'm gonna try not get too nitpicky when
we get to the actual palate I do think
it is a good kind of solid I shouldn't
even say solid it's a pretty good palate
I don't think I'm going to be returning
this we will see though I'm going to be
using this particular kit and shop my
stash or at least the palette and shop
my stash this coming week so that I can
play with it a little more it's been a
little hard for me to get on camera and
actually review this like thoroughly for
you guys because I feel like there are a
lot of hits and misses with the actual
eyeshadow and blush bronzer part but
anyway let's talk about the deluxe size
items first the first item is the Too
Faced better than sex mascara this is in
the black shade this is not the
waterproof formulation it's just the
original and this is what the actual
wand looks like and if you guys have
been watching my channel for a while you
know that I love this mascara it's got a
really nice natural bristle wand I feel
like it gives a lot of volume and also a
lot of length
not too much definition but one thing I
do want to say this mascara is notorious
for slipping and sliding all over your
eyes so if you do have very oily eyelids
make sure you go ahead and set you with
powder so that you are not getting any
underneath your eyes or up here near
your brow bone so overall really happy
that was in there we love that mascara
the next item is the Too Faced melted
chocolate liquefied long wear lipstick
if you watched my inside my collection
video you know that I'm actually
decluttering all of my melted liquefied
long wear lipstick it's not because
they're not good quality they're
actually very comfortable and they are
good quality but they are slightly
drying on my lips I am a flutist if you
guys didn't know and I have just gotten
into only wearing pretty much products
that I think are very very comfortable
so the actual shade is nice it does
smell like chocolate and I do think that
this is probably one of the more
comfortable liquefied lipsticks on the
market so here is the particular shade
it is a little more on the warm stone
side so if you don't have like a warm
undertone in your skin this can look a
little funky on you honestly I feel like
it makes my teeth look really yellow and
on top of that I have a strong cool
undertone so I feel like this wasn't a
perfect good color for me but it doesn't
really matter because I will be
decluttering this either way and then
they last item that we have here is the
Too Faced shadow insurance 24-hour
anti-crease eyeshadow primer this is a
very nice primer I like the way it goes
on it's not too sticky it's not too
silicone based it's really nice I feel
like it does adhere at the shadows very
nice
some of the glitter shades in this
palette I feel like you can go in with
the two-faced glitter glue or you can
just foil them I don't think that this
particular primer holds them or Bond's
them together that well but it is good
for all of the other shadows in here
alright so now let's go ahead and get
into the actual palettes like I said I'm
gonna try and not be too nit picky here
because I feel like I mean you guys know
me I feel like I could go on and on for
hours and hours about holiday palettes
are just in reviews in general so anyway
here is what the outer packaging looks
like or the actual packaging not the
outer packaging the actual packaging
very very sleek reminds me of a lorac
mega Pro palette I like it it's magnetic
it's very very nice you are getting a
whole lot of stuff in here like I said
21 different eyeshadows highlighter a
blush and a bronzer really cool that
it's so compact my only thing I don't
like is you guys know I love having me a
mirror this is very very cute it's the
same thing that we saw with the pop-out
box but I would say they probably went
ahead and saved a few bucks by not
putting it a mirror here so here is what
the actual palette looks like as you
guys can see we have some warm tones on
the top and some cool tones on the
bottom and then we do have our three
products over here not over here over
here this is the highlights of the
bronzer and the blush we're gonna go
ahead and start with those because I
feel like um they're pretty darn good
like those are probably some items in
here that I'm really impressed with as
far as the palette is concerned so the
first thing we're gonna talk about is
the highlight the highlight is gorgeous
it's a lot better than the two face and
nikkietutorials palette highlight you
guys know I was not a fan of that I
thought that that was absolute crap
actually it was a really bad highlight I
feel like this particular highlight is
beautiful it's got a little bit of a
champagne rose gold undertone so there
it is it is called inner light and I
will go ahead and swatch that right now
the one thing I will say about the face
products in this palette is that they
are pressed a little more firmly it's
nice because they don't kick up any sort
of product but at the same time you do
have to kind of build up the color so
there they are they're not extremely
extremely insanely pigmented but they
are still good next we have chocolate
Soleil which is the infamous bronzer
from Too Faced I do have a full-size of
this and I will say the formulation is a
little different but the color is
exactly the same again it's pressed a
little more firmly but it still goes on
and you can feel
on the skin I do feel like this will
show up on anybody who has fair to light
and medium skin tones probably not if
you do have a very deep dark complexion
and then the last thing we have here is
the blush and I am obsessed with the
color of this blush I think it's
absolutely stunning
it's kind of like a mafia and rose like
a mauve rose color there it is right
there and it has a little bit of a sheen
it's absolutely stunning on the cheeks
and it is called chocolate-covered
strawberry I wish they would have a
full-size of this because I would buy it
in two seconds this is what it looks
like and I do feel like that one has a
lot more pigment than the highlighter
and the bronzer so as far as those three
face products are concerned nothing too
bad to say I think they are good quality
are they as good as full-sized like
bronzers from Too Faced no but they're
still pretty good now let's go ahead and
talk about these big hi these big not
highlights but these big like eyeshadows
that we have here you guys can see
they're kind of like double the size
those three shades are absolutely
stunning and they remind me a lot of
beach chocolate bar formulation those
are probably my top three picks in this
particular palette and then also some of
my favorites are actually the glitter
shades in here which is very strange I'm
not normally someone to go and foil
something and put it on my eyelid or to
go and grab my glitter glue and foil it
or put it on whatever I'm just not
someone who puts that extra work into
working with glitter shades but I will
say these two shades right here this one
which is called indulge and also sugared
raisin are probably the two best glitter
shades I have ever found in a two-faced
palette they go on beautifully when
foiled and if you guys were wondering
what I was wearing yesterday on my
eyelid and the day before it was these
two colors so yesterday I had indulge on
my lid and then the day before I had
sugared raisin they're absolutely
stunning and as long as they are
completely foiled they look very very
beautiful they don't swatch super well
when your hand is completely dry but I
just rub down with a cloth and I did not
dry it so that's why they look really
really nice in the squash so I really
actually like the glitter shades in here
and I really like those bigger kind of
matte or brow bone shades which are
desserts on me glaze and also banana
dates so I like those and I like the
glitter shades one thing I will say that
I was very surprised about was the fact
the fact that the mattes in here we're
not very good quality at all
normally with like a two-faced palette I
feel like their mats are very creamy
very buttery very pigmented I feel
they are firmly pressed in here they're
hard to blend and on top of that they're
just I don't know they're just very
firmly present not what I would think
you know to face would release so
there's a whole lot of those in here but
what I like is that they're nice
transition colors so you guys may be
able to see guilt-free chocoholic cookie
dough to see very very pretty colors you
can use these on your outer V you can
use them as liners shades as your
transitions but it makes it kind of
difficult when you want to go in with a
transition color and it's hard to blend
because the transition is there to help
blend out the other eyeshadows so if you
can't blend your transition you may have
a little bit of issues but overall I
would say at my favourites formulations
in here because they are very very
different are definitely those glitter
shades and then those three bigger pans
but there are a few shades in here that
are sort of like a foiled finish or more
of like a shimmery finish they do have a
little bit of glitter packed in there
they're a little rough to the touch and
I will say in general most of the stuff
in this particular palette is rough to
the touch if you are someone who really
doesn't like something a slightly
scratchy you're gonna hate digging your
finger in here I don't likes watching
these because they think they actually
go onto the eyes a lot better than they
swatch and that's really important to
remember I know I talk about all the
time oh god it feels like a baby's butt
like I love that but you have to be
honest with yourself - it's not really
about how it swatches it's about how it
applies to your eyes and I actually
think the eye looks that I get with this
are really really stunning so I will say
you know I'm kind of on the fence about
this but at the same time I'm not I'm
pretty darn sure I will be keeping this
we will see I'm gonna play with it again
it this week like I said push off and
swatch of my stash and then I'll let you
guys know at the end of the week I will
do look at the week and we'll kind of
play around and do some eye looks but
for the most part I would say that 60%
of this particular palette right here is
good I like the 3 deluxe size items that
you get with it as long as you're okay
with that lippy shada then I would say
this is something that possibly you want
to think about picking up I do think
it's a good value and I do think this is
quite compact and travel friendly
obviously the pop-up box is not but you
would just take this sleek little
palette maybe a mirror and then those
three little to luck size items with you
so yeah I think the wear time on these
is pretty darn strong again because they
are so firmly pressed they tend to stay
on the eyes a little longer this is one
of those palettes that I would say is
kind of similar
like my Urban Decay vice 4 palette I
love the way this looks on my eyes I do
need extra time when I work with this
I've been wearing this palette all week
by the way and I need extra time when I
work with these because a lot of these
are bonded together with glitter they're
a little chunky they're not super super
easy to blend I feel the same way about
this particular palette so this is
definitely something that I would like
to have on days where I have more time
to get ready or if I really want to be
glammed up this is the kind of palette I
would reach for on a day to day basis
even though the shades do look like
they're very chocolate bar esque and
they're very everyday friendly you're
gonna spend a lot of time blending these
out so in my opinion they're not
everyday friendly but for a night out on
the town or if you're going on date
night or whatever I think that these are
cool and they're nice to have so anyway
let's go ahead and starts watching these
eyeshadows we're gonna go ahead and do
this row here first so the first one we
have here is desert on me which again I
feel like that is the same sort of
chocolate bar formulation actually let's
go ahead and swatch those three big ones
first so we have deserts on me this one
right here is called glaze and then we
have banana date and those are just
beautiful very very pigmented very very
creamy I really like the formulation on
these so on the top we have banana date
then we have desserts on me and then we
have glaze very very creamy and buttery
formulation thank God the three
eyeshadows in the palette that we're
like jumbo sized are really good for you
next we're gonna move on to raspberry
rose sugared raisin cake batter
butterscotch sugar bells and also mint
chip which are those smaller shadows
that you can see here so the first one
we have is raspberry rose this is one of
the masks that still feels very creamy
and buttery then we have sugared raisin
which I told you guys is that really
glittery shade that I actually do like
we have cake batter which is a nice
transition but it is a little more
firmly pressed and then we have
butterscotch which is a beautiful kind
of crease color it's got a little bit of
like a burnt coppery thing going on so
we're gonna do that's light pink color
and then the glitter then we will do
this guy and then this guy so here we
have raspberry rose then we have sugared
raisin then we have cake batter and
butterscotch there they are and those
are one swipe swatches and again this is
on a dry hand now but they when they are
foiled they look absolutely stunning and
I have to
say that color sugar Drazen like that
lavender at your add essence right there
oh girl I'm in love with that that color
is beautiful alright moving on we are
gonna go on to sugar bells and also mint
chip sugar bells is definitely a little
more firmly pressed but it does come off
as a foiled eyeshadow sort of thing so
it's a beautiful silvery color and then
mint chip kinda reminds me of that one
shade in the nikkietutorials palette I
can't remember what it is but it does go
on quite nice and it's just like a dark
kind of bluish color so there they are
here is silver bells or sugar bells
sugar bells oh he's nice a sugar balls
now girl sugar bells and then here is
mint chip so those go on nicely those
are the ones I was telling you guys
they're a little more firmly pressed but
they do you kind of go on like a foiled
eyeshadow which is strange because
normally when you have a foiled shadow
they're super super creamy so whatever
next we are going on to this row right
here this row go ahead I cannot see with
the viewfinder at that row right there
so the first shade we have is indulge
which is that other glittery shade it's
got a little bit of a silver iridescent
to it then we have guilt free which is a
transition and it's more of a cool tone
transition and ginger doodle I'll go
ahead and swatch those first so there's
the glitter here is that transition and
then there is that butterscotch shade so
as you can see the glitter has started
to kind of fall apart on a dry hand but
that's indulge than we have guilt free
and then we have what's it called Oh
ginger doodle
so ginger doodle is more of like that
satiny quality foiled thing matte shade
very firmly pressed and then there we
have the glitter alright moving on we
are going to go ahead and starts
watching on the other side because my
fingers are starting to get stained that
is one thing I will say with the more
firmly pressed oil shadows is that they
do stain your fingers alright moving on
the next one we have is toffee crunch
honey dip and jingle bell so toffee
crunch is a really firmly pressed matte
shade and it swatches like chef like let
me show you guys do you see that yay
good job ginger doodle no not at all or
toffee crunch then no and then we have
honey dip
I like the sheet it is nice it kind of
goes on foiled and then we have
jingleberry which is also more of a foil
to shade so there you can kind of see
the difference between what's going on
here at the top one is toffee crunch
in the middle we have honey dip and then
we have jingleberry so you know like I
said it's like you started squashing
this pallet and you're like oh my god
these are great and then you're like
well that sucks and then it's like oh
it's great and then you're like whoa
what is that alright now you're moving
on to the last row so we are going to so
watch these babies here this is more of
a warm toned row we have cookie dough
which definitely has a little more of
like a glitter finish to it but it's
kind of like a firmly pressed matte
shade as hard to explain then we have
Tootsie which I swear I've already
started to get hard pan on because it's
so firmly pressed and we have chocoholic
so cookie dough Tootsie and chocoholic
cookie dough twits ii and chocoholic all
mats yeah you can see that right let me
try and build up that middle one not
that great not that great not very
pigmented and they go on quite patchy
and those are only the kind of shades
that you would want to use as a
transition which is supposed to help you
to blend out your eyeshadows so that's
kind of depressing then we have a lava
cake we also have pound cake which I
love this shade and then we have
huckleberry so love a cake pound cake
and huckleberry lava cake has a little
more glitter in it in it but it goes on
like a foil shadow pound cake is
gorgeous it reminds me of narcissus
orgasm and then huckleberry has a little
more of a foil finish as well but it
does have loose glitter in it so there
we have the shade let's see here lava
cake pound cake and then huckleberry
very pretty love that shade right there
on the lid pancake so anyway guys those
are all of the swatches like I said I'm
trying not to be too nit picky because I
feel like there could be a lot that I
need to say about this particular
palette but overall I would say wait a
little bit let me try and pick up some
more holiday palettes before you go when
you're like oh I have to get this one I
don't think this particular one is gonna
sell out right away
I am still waiting on my hotel cafe
palette from Too Faced I will do a
comparison hopefully the shadows are a
little more high quality than this one
we shall see but I feel like there's
just a lot of hits there's a lot of
misses but I would say about 60% of this
is good if you do spend a lot of time
blending out your eyeshadows and you're
okay with that then I think that you can
get some really beautiful looks with
this but if you are like me and on a
day-to-day basis you want something
quick easy and natural I would say pass
on this particular one so I hope this
was helpful thanks so much for joining
me guys and I was
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
