Valentine's Day I wanted to get a video
up realised and yeah which is not so
hard for me because I don't actually
know how to edit my videos and I don't
really want to even learn it just seems
so time-consuming I'd rather just film
the video I like and just post it okay
ah
today's video is going to be a review on
the new two-faced cocoa contour chiseled
to perfection face contouring and
highlighting kit it looks like this and
it comes in this little box that looks
exactly like it and inside they have
this adorable little like usual with the
Too Faced they always show you certain
ways to get a certain look which is nice
into your beginner which I am when it
comes to contouring I I'm wearing this
today and I like I don't really like it
I've been wearing at the past couple
days I think it's good this is what the
actual palette looks like you get this
nice I would say taupey color which is
honestly the darkest one for me in the
palette that I can go I can't actually
wear the shades too dark so this medium
cocoa shade is really beautiful it gives
just the appearance of like a shadow
it's not orange it's not you know it's
perfect then you get like cocoa which is
a matte and it's basically a highlighter
um kind of blend with my skin tone so
it's not exactly a highlighter for me it
just kind of evens out underneath the
eye but I do use pop of light which has
shimmer in it I use that to highlight so
um yeah and like I said this dark cocoa
color here it's absolutely beautiful and
so pigmented but you guys like I'm just
too painful just I'm too pill that's not
gonna work it's just too much see that
that would never look like a natural
contour on my face but anyway the reason
I picked up this kit was because all the
other ones that I've been
like on the Sephora website and things
like that just all of them look too dark
like there's not one shade in there that
looks like it could possibly somehow fit
my skintone and the thing with me is
that I'm new to contouring so I need to
find something that's not gonna make me
look ridiculous and this medium Coco
shade really does it well so um you also
get this little contour
boopie brush which is i don't like this
i think this is one of their teddy bear
brushes it's very soft it's beautiful
but it's like thin and they expect you
to what carve out your cheeks with this
it's just like watch when you go like
that it just bends in you need something
stiff for when you're trying to you know
contour especially in the cheek area in
your you know chisel that face out you
can't have something that's sinking in
because then you're gonna splatter it
everywhere and it's not look even worse
so um overall I think this was a good
deal this was $40 on the Sephora website
now that's basically under $10 for each
thing that you get in here um some of
the other contour pals that I've been
seeing you know they have like a larger
range of I guess you know shades to play
with but you know some of those would
just never work personally on my on my
skin tone you know so no but um you know
like that yellow powder I know a lot of
people set under the eye with yellow bar
I've tried the Ben Nye banana powder and
it was like yellow like you could
actually see it and like I said with
like some of these shades like you know
beautiful but I mean I think they could
have been a little more high lady you
know especially for someone who's a
little more fair and I think it's great
that they did add in this nice dark
color that could be someone's contour
somebody has dug enough skin out there
that could really use that gorgeous
gorgeous warm color to contour your face
now I know you're not supposed to like
use it to contour useless to use that
shade particularly as a all-over bronzer
but if I did that it would just look
ridiculous
on top of the medium cocoa that I
already have like if I can't turn place
it if you guys can see like here's my
neck I'm already looking a little dark
in the face today and that's just from
using the medium cocoa and I use both
highlighters so um I really like this I
do not regret it I'm not gonna return it
I'm really happy this is my first powder
little contour box and I think it was a
great price and the shades are doable
especially you know if you have a
lighter complexion if you're deeper I
don't know if this is really gonna be up
your alley um I don't think this medium
cocoa is actually dark enough to contour
out you know somebody who has like a
really nice like like a honey complexion
or you know just like a golden
complexion I don't even think that
that's gonna be dark enough now when
you're looking for something to actually
contour with you do want something
that's a little more like taupe in color
I also like this NYX one this has been
NYX blush in taupe but when it comes to
warming up the face with the bronzer
after that's just a step that I usually
end up skipping because it just looks
like too much and especially if the
bronzer is advant
thats all my sister warned my face off
with like that's gonna look like someone
just squirted like self-tanner on my
face like that's not gonna look good so
um overall I'm really happy with it I
think it's great I'm just I'm new to the
game when it comes to the contouring
thing I know a lot of people love the
Anastacio and you know what there's
wonderful contour pallets out there um
I've never really got into it until now
and I'm just learning I actually think
it's easier with creams something that I
like to do is take what is it the
L'Oreal yet the infallible that new
foundation I take the lightest shade
which is my actual shade and then I take
two shades darker which is in shell I
believe and I use that to contour with
and it's so so natural I think the
problem with powder is that it can look
a bit unnatural and especially did your
heavy-handed like I am like you know I
probably should have brought it down
but I wanted you guys to see just like
how sometimes really really good
pigmentation is great but sometimes if
like oh you know just be careful with
that so um yeah I don't know what else
to say um you know $40 I mean it's
basically less than $10 a piece with the
brush and you know I mean yes I said
that the brush is not good for
contouring you can use it for other
things it's cute and it's very very soft
I'm happy I'm happy with this purchase
well I buy other contour palette I'm
sure I will um I can't compare it to
anything because the only other thing
that I do with contouring is the darker
foundation with the lighter foundation I
find that the just working with like a
liquidy product is much easier but I
really wanted to try a powder one and
I'm happy I picked this out so I hope
this was helpful and I hope you guys um
if you're interested go and pick this up
I'll leave the link below obviously I'm
not you know affiliated with like
Sephora or anything I'm just linking you
to the product so that you know it
doesn't take you guys like forever to
get there or something so I'll link
directly to where I got it and yeah oh
ooh now I'm starting to think that maybe
this is only for VIP Rouge at the moment
so if you are a vib Rouge status you can
get this which I am but I don't know
when it comes out to just the like a vib
and the beauty insider I'm not sure but
if you go onto the Sephora website I'm
sure if you like click on this it'll
show you when you can get it so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this happy
Valentine's Day I'll see you guys later
