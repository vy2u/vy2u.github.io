video is going to be a review on a
holiday set or little kit that has come
out from Too Faced it is called the
Liberty fly socket and this is basically
part of their holiday French theme that
they're going with this year I think
it's really really cute they came out
with the look on Pele which is the big
palette that they came out with they
have look on chateaux they just have
like tons and tons of really cute French
themed you know gift sets and that's
part of their holiday collection this
year so I absolutely love this this is
what the packaging looks like and inside
here you get three full sizes of the la
creme lipsticks I have never tried the
la creme lipsticks so this was a great
way for me to go ahead and try the
products out you get two very neutral
colors and then you get a color that has
a little more pigment to it and it comes
in a really cute little glitter bag I'm
going to unbox everything so you guys
can see it I put everything back in just
so I could undo it so you guys could see
because honestly the packaging this is
one of the cutest packaging out there
for this like holiday season I'm gonna
say it right away it's my favorite so
far
packaging lines but anyway this is a
great little kit this is probably over
like an $80 value and you can get this
for $29 I purchase mine on the Too Faced
Calm website you can also get it on
Sephora calm and Ulta calm but basically
what you're getting for $29 is three
full sizes of the la creme lipsticks
which originally go for $22 apiece so
you are basically purchasing like one of
the lipsticks and getting two free plus
the cute little glitter bags so let me
show you guys what it looks like this is
what the little glitter bag looks like
it's adorable if it's in the palm of my
hand it's super tiny and cute you have
the little what is this totally fell
right here yes
isn't that cute you guys I love that and
it's a little zipper undo it and then
you find this cute little wrapping paper
in here this bright pink wrapping paper
I'm just loving this packaging you undo
it and here you have your three
full-sized la creme lipsticks they are
gorgeous packaging they are gold and
then they have the little two-faced logo
on there as you guys can see these are
the same kind of weighted material as
the Too Faced better than sex mascara if
you have that one they feel the same
they feel really good in your hand
they're just like really kind of heavy
and weighted I don't know how to explain
it but they just feel really really
great the only difference is of course
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
comes in the light pink one these come
in gold and I think it's a very holiday
holiday ask I guess you could say so let
me said for $29 you are getting three
full sizes of those and two of them are
their two best selling shades which are
tapi and nude beach hi I'm wearing taffy
on my lips today it is a more pinky
nudie sort of color this is what taffy
looks like that is what I have on my
lips today I'm gonna go ahead and swatch
that for you guys right now that is
taffy so really really beautiful you
guys can see that these have tons and
tons of shine the shine kind of stays on
the lips I've been wearing taffy on my
lips for probably an hour and a half now
I noticed that the color doesn't stay on
as long as say like a liquid lipstick
like these steel ones that I reviewed
yesterday I reviewed the Stila eternal
love liquid lipstick set those stay on
forever these do not you have to reapply
them but overall they're really really
shiny and they have just this lovely
lovely formula that are so comfortable
to wear on the lips so I really really
love it you do have to reapply like I
said but I don't mind because it's so
luxurious and it's one of those colors
too that's not crazy crazy colorful so
you can just kind of apply it without
looking in a mirror so I really love
that so that shade right there is taffy
that is one of their best selling shades
their other best selling shade is called
nude beach and this is more of their
like nudie really really instead a pinky
nudie this is
more of a like Mafi kind of undertone
you know more more of a nude base more
instead of like a pinky undertone you
got more of a nude kind of thing going
on there so there's taffy and there is
nude beach and you can see there's super
super shiny and glossy and I really
really like that I just think that they
look really really pretty on the lips
even when I pair mine with my tooth to
face what is that the lip insurance it
still stays relatively glossy on the
lips for about an hour and I really
really like that so those are the first
two colors and then the last color you
get in here I believe is new like two
for this kit it's like a limited edition
shade this is Wham and it is this
gorgeous gorgeous kind of wine color but
it has tons of gold pink purple every
single color Sparkle you could think of
is in here and I really really love this
one this was the one that I was like oh
I feel like I'm gonna be the most
attracted to that one because it's got
lots of shimmer and the other two do not
have shimmer
however they have that really glossy
texture texture but anyway I really
really thought I was just gonna be that
was gonna be my favorite but honestly
I'm really liking the nude ones too I'm
one of those girls that really tends to
reach towards more mathy and raspberry
and like read sort of tones from my lips
because I always felt like nude kind of
washed me out but I'm really I'm loving
all three colors in here so up here you
have taffy you have nude beach and then
you have Wham
so when is the one that has all that
shimmer and sparkle in it it's just a
beautiful kind of holiday color and like
I said I do believe that this is new um
especially forth like this get this
little levity plays are I don't know if
this is in their actual la créme
regular collection that these two are so
anyway those are the three colors that
you get in this gorgeous little set I
think it is so worth it I just love this
little bag you guys I can't wait to like
toss this in my purse put something in
there it is just so cute I I literally
love the bag they should sell these on
the two-face website for like I don't
know $10 fees or something because they
are so cute and I just think the
packaging is adorable and for $29 the
cuz these lipsticks are so luxurious and
because they normally are $22 apiece for
$29 to get three full-size it's just out
of this world like that is a great great
value and they are really really nice
and I think that a lot of people can go
for this kit because you really only get
that one like in-your-face sort of color
and the other two are very neutral so if
you like a neutral lip and you don't
want something that's too much like of a
pop of color because this one can be
built up you know that's a built up
swatch if you just apply it lightly it
looks just like a pretty raspberry wash
of color over your lips so if you like
more neutral lips you're definitely
going to love this kit um and yeah I
just think it's a great value $29 you
cannot get any better than that I will
link below all three websites where you
guys can pick this up and yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this review thank you
so much for watching I'll see you in my
next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
