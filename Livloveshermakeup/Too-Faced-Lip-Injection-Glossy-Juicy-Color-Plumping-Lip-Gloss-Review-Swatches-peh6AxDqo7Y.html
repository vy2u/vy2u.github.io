this video I have a quick little review
for you guys on three out of the six new
two-faced lip injections juicy color
plumping lip glosses so these are the
glossy formula from the lip injection
line which has been around for a while
now I am a fan of the original lip
injection line and when I saw that they
were coming out with colorful shades in
the glossy formula I did want to go
ahead and try them out
these were $22 a piece on the Too Faced
calm website they are not limited
edition so hopefully they will show up
at Ulta and Sephora sometime soon I
don't have any dates for you guys but
hopefully they will and also what else
do they want to say oh yes they have six
different shades ranging from really
kind of nudie pink colors all the way to
a deep purple orchid color like this one
so the shades that I got were like a
boss which is that beautiful sort of
orchid color right there I also got babe
alert which is a beautiful Orange II
peach shade and then the last one I got
is called a milkshake which is a
gorgeous nude color with gold iridescent
running through it so like I said I'm a
fan of the original lip injection
formulation it has sort of like a satiny
matte consistency and I had never tried
the original glossy formulation out but
I really wanted to try these ones
because I thought that they really were
going to give a lot of color to the lips
unfortunately they really don't they
look like they would give a lot of color
because the packaging looks super super
opaque but these really have barely
their sort of color in my opinion so the
actual packaging is nice they come in
these little acrylic pad you know a
little critic up a little acrylic
bagging they come in these little
acrylic tubes and they do have a nice
design on the actual cap here and they
all have the same sort of doe foot
applicator which I do like it is very
flat on each side and then it has a
pointed little tip so that you can get
into the tiny areas on the inner corner
of your lips so that is what the actual
wand looks like and then the actual
packaging like the outer box packaging
is super cute as well you have the color
coordinating shades so here we have a
babe alert which has the peachy box with
the gold iridescent almost
we have milkshake which is the nude box
and then we have like a box which is of
course that beautiful purpley color and
I think like the whole concept and
everything is really really nice and
very very cute unfortunately they just
fall short when it comes to the actual
consistency and also I don't want to say
the formulation but the consistency of
the product and also the actual
pigmentation so I'm gonna go ahead and
starts watching these for you guys so
you can see what I'm talking about
like I like the packaging I think the
doe foot applicator is really nice I do
feel like these do plump up your lips a
little bit it's nothing crazy it's
nothing insane you put them on it
doesn't feel like a bee is stinging your
lips it just feels like you ate some
spicy food and you got some on your lips
like you were eating slimy Hot Cheetos
and you got some other powder on your
lips that's what it feels like now I
will say that the feeling does last for
quite a while probably about fifteen to
thirty minutes so if you have open sores
on your lips or cuts or really dry lips
you may not like this feeling of like
the tingling going on now these are
infused with jojoba oil and also avocado
oils so they are quite moisturizing but
the next thing I want to talk about is
the actual consistency so the
formulation is good I feel like they do
plump up your lips they do what they say
they are going to do however they are so
freakin tacky like they are so sticky
and gloppy and gross and yucky on the
lips in my opinion so here we have the
shade like a boss you guys can see we
have some like high shine color going on
there and it's absolutely beautiful like
it looks so gorgeous
however the consistency you guys the
consistency is just so weird like I
touch this and it's so sticky and tacky
and I am one of those people I just
can't deal with that on my lips I just
don't like that and again it could be
because I am a flutist
I just don't like that really gloppy
thick like lip gloss feeling on my lips
now the original lip injection in my
opinion feels nothing like that so I
guess I was just kind of taken aback by
the actual consistency of these when I
started to put them on so all of them
have that same sort of consistency and
then my other issue is the fact that
they look nothing like they do in the
tube I
thought a little piece of fuzz I really
thought that they were going to be super
super opaque and awesome and I would
have gotten over the consistency if they
were super awesome and opaque but
unfortunately they just gave a really
light amount of color to the lips and I
am wearing this shade today the beep
alert shade on my lips right now I put
it on about 45 minutes ago and it's
still tingling a little bit I do feel
like the glossiness is still there but
it feels hella tacky on my lips and I
really don't like that but here is the
shade babe alert and here it is in the
packaging did you guys see the
difference like I just feel like this
was like false advertising like it would
have been so cool if this was the actual
pigment that you got in there but it's
not it's just not what you get they're
all so similar when you swatch them next
to each other so what I want to say is
that I feel like the whole concept is
good I think the formulation does work
the lip injection like formulation the
actual you know plumping up the lips a
little bit it's nothing crazy it's not
like it's gonna make your lips three
times the size that they normally are
but it is going to plump them up a
little bit and I do feel like that
actually stays for a while so what
happens is you put the color on you can
see the color at first and then that
fades after about thirty minutes and
then after about fifteen to thirty
minutes
the actual tingling sensation fades and
then after 45 minutes the glossiness
fades and then you're left with just a
little bit of like plumped up lips which
I liked like I like that I feel like
after an hour so that's how I like these
products but I just don't like that
residue that it leaves on your lips like
I just feel like if I were to wear my
hair down or something you would do get
stuck across my lips so anyway I guess
that's kind of just what I want to say I
don't really have anything horrible to
say about these but I also don't have
anything really good to say about them I
really think that if you want to get
these I would honestly just get the
original lip injection if you really
want to get something to plump up your
lips but if you want something with a
little bit of gloss and a tiny bit of
color to top off your favorite matte
lipstick or something like that
I think these definitely could do the
job I just don't think they really stand
alone like on their own very well so
there is the shade milkshake so you can
see it's a lot more opaque in the actual
packaging
so yeah not much to say here guys I
think the formulation is good when it
comes to the lip injection part I don't
like the tackiness I don't like the
stickiness although there are some
carrier oils in there that are very
affected and nice and moisturizing for
the lips I feel like it just kind of
contradicts each other because you also
have like cinnamon and cardamom for like
plumping up the lips and then you have
like avocado oil it's like I don't get
the point but I do think that they plump
up the lips of momentarily it's not
something that's gonna last 24 hours but
it definitely will last up to probably
about four hours but the actual
consistency the tackiness even after you
wipe them off with a freaking makeup
remover wipe is just really really
annoying I would never wear my hair down
if I'm wearing one of these and I just
feel like the actual pigmentation is
really really lacking so I feel like
they're not worth the 22 dollars I'm not
going to return them I will use them to
top off use them as like you know a
topper for my favorite lipsticks but
yeah I'm not super super impressed with
these I would recommend just getting the
original lip injection I don't think
they're anything special and I think
that two-face should either reformulate
them and make them a lot more opaque
like the actual like color or the actual
packaging or they should lower the price
to like twelve dollars so anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed this quick little
review thank you for joining me and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
