you for joining me today I am reviewing
a new product so that I'm super excited
about it is the Too Faced love flush
long-lasting 16 hour blush the shade I
got is called love hangover and
basically Too Faced recently launched
these you can get them at Sephora I
believe you can get them at Alta now and
of course they're on the Too Faced
website but they recently launched a few
new products for like their summer you
know collection basically there were you
know rumor is that this was gonna be
part of like the Fall collection people
they had released like a pre pre-release
photo of the blushes and like a little
circle and people thought that they were
probably coming out during the fall but
they did come out earlier so this is
part of like their summer collection
they also came out with like a new eye
palette and a few of those things but
this is all I picked up so anyway I'm
just gonna talk about it and yeah so
basically I purchased mine for $26 on
the Sephora website they have six
different shades so um they have like a
i'll read you on the website i have it
pulled up right back there next to me I
was gonna say next door right next to me
on the left hand side so they have a
deep plum II color called ear your love
is king and it's a plum eros color they
have a color called how deep is your
love and that is a watermelon pink next
they have at the shade I got which is
love hangover which is a perfect warm
pink then they have kind of like an
orange II peachy shade it's called I
will always love you and it is a gilded
peach color it says the next one is
called justifying my love and it is a
bright pink with fine gold sparkle and
the last one is called baby love which
is a soft dusty nude with fine gold
Sparkle so basically they have six
different shades that have you know
basically you know from your nudes to
your darker to your corals bright pinks
medium pinks basically everything like
that so I think they kind of kit up
everything I don't know if they are
going to release more shades I'm not
quite sure I hope they do because I
really really love this product so
anyway I like I said $26 on the support
website I will link below where you guys
can um view you know all the blushes if
you'd like but basically the little box
that it comes in looks like this which i
think is adorable
and it has the name of whichever one you
picked up on the top so like I said I
picked up love hangover and this is the
actual packaging lucky buys isn't that
cute it's really really cute it's
plastic and it's actually very very
sleek like it's very thin and you know
easy to basically carry around like in
your purse or travel with and it opens
up like this and it has kind of one of
those like magnetic closures so it
doesn't feel like you know it's flimsy
and it's gonna open up and break all
over your purse so it does have a little
bit of a magnetic closure and then you
get a nice size little mirror here and
then you get your blush shake so blush
blush shade oh my gosh that's hard to
say say that fine five times best so
this is the color I got like I said it's
called love hangover and I think the
outer packaging looks a little more
peachy and also the color on the sephora
website looked a little more peachy then
it looks in the pan and it looks a
little darker in the pan almost like it
has like mauve undertones however it's
definitely different when you apply it
to your cheeks
so I'm anyway what I really liked about
it was that it is a born pink
however it has small little shimmers in
it that are silver so you're getting
like a warm color with like a you know
cool shimmer which I thought was really
cool so anyway I have it swatched right
here on the back of my hand as you guys
can see it looks a little like more warm
and a little more pinky on the back of
my hand and it does in the actual pan
that's my only complaint when it comes
to packaging is that it doesn't look
exactly like how it looks on the skin
however you know and also how it looks
good packaging hold on a sec somebody's
calling me um but anyway I also think
like the outer packaging looks just a
little lighter but just you know look up
you know photos online and things like
that
instead of guaranteeing you know your
exact color that you want basically
almost Support website because you know
depending on your screen in your
computer whatnot that can change so if
you are worried about that definitely
look up pictures online or I recommend
maybe going in store and swatching
yourself so anyway I really really like
the shade I think it's really really
nice I am wearing it today it has the
smallest amount of shimmer so it gives
just like a nice
appearance to the skin however it's got
that nice like warm neutral medium pink
tone which i think is really really
beautiful a kind of color-coordinated my
outfit today to go along with how cute
packaging buzz and the pink color but um
basically I just think it's really
beautiful I applied mine today with this
BH Cosmetics tapered brush like this I
find that if you are going to apply it
with a really really dense brush you
need to be really really careful because
there is a lot of kick up with this
product it's not that it's dry it's
actually a very very smooth creamy
texture it's just that when you you know
swirl your brush around and it just
picks up a lot of product and you will
have little dust and crumbles everywhere
so you want to make sure that you blow
off the product on here and also tap off
your brush or blow on it before you
apply it to your cheeks or it will be
way way too much color so like I said I
applied it with this brush today and I
actually think this is still too dense
I've applied it with quite a few
different I've applied it with quite a
few different brushes but this one is
still too dense I really think that the
best way to apply these because they are
so pigmented is probably going to be
like a stipple brush else makes a really
great one with a small stipple brush and
you can just you know tap the bristles
in there and then just kind of glide it
on and you know it's really really
plentiful and easy you know to blend out
if you do put too much on like again
today I put too much on I think almost
every single time I've used this I've
put too much on but it's easy to blend
away so it's not gonna leave like a
streak or something you know it's easy
to blend so that's great
so you know yeah I really like that I
think it's one of those products you
just need to be careful with you know if
you're heavy-handed with blush which I
happen to be you just want to be careful
so anyway I recommend a pine with
probably a stipple brush or something
really really light and wispy not
nothing that's too densely packed with
bristles so yeah anyway um the one thing
I want to talk about which is you know
basically the reason they came out with
these it's called the long lasting 16
hour blush so basically it makes sense
that they came out with this during
summertime because during summer we all
are looking for things that are gonna
stay on our face longer and not like
sweat off and get oily and whatnot and
this blush does last 16 hours I have
kept it on I think the long as I kept it
on so far is probably 18 to 20 hours
which is really long however it was
still there
on my cheeks and I noticed that it works
you know with anything you know you
could be wearing no foundation you could
be wearing foundation no primer whatever
it doesn't matter this just adheres to
the skin it's not adhering to the other
makeup on your face it's adhering to
your skin and it just really really
sticks and what I love the most about it
like I said I applied like a little too
much and it's so heavily pigmented
however it's so easy to blend out which
is crazy
you you would think that like a long
lasting product would be you know it
would set quickly and you wouldn't be
able to blend it out kind of like a
Revlon Colorstay foundation however this
is still so easy to blend out and it's
kind of foolproof you know you can use
it with a really light hand or you know
really pack it on for a lot of color and
it lasts how you put it on in the
morning is how it will look at the end
of the day basically so that is so
impressive to me I think that's just
awesome and yeah so anyway I'm really
really loving this I'm gonna brief you
guys a little bit about what it says on
the sephora website so it says the Too
Faced love flush long-lasting 16 hour
blush is $26 it says what it is a long
wear fade and smudge proof formula that
keeps your cheeks perfectly flush for up
to 16 hours and I do want to stay right
away you know how sometimes you're
wearing a blush and if it's like a
darker shade you know it tends to start
to like you know like move like they
will it not separate but like you'll see
that maybe you rubbed off a portion or
things like that I never notice that
with this blush so it is definitely
smudged and fade-proof it says the blush
it says blush all day and night with
this flesh of true love each of the six
pigment rich high-impact shades deliver
a pretty pop of color for any skin tone
with a bold color payoff that's for sure
the long rare formula is enriched with
buttery soft pigments that bond with
skin and take on a weightless suspended
look that lasts for up to 16 hours so
you don't have to worry about
reapplication throughout the day from a
soft dusty nude hue with gold sparkle to
a watermelon pink you can create an
array of looks for daytime and nighttime
wear it is formulated without parabens
sulfates and family total aids I don't
know how to say that uh-huh and it says
what else you need to know at this blush
is cruelty free and formulated without
pollutant so anyway
a really really really great product
like I said I'm really impressed and I
actually did go on I only pick up you
know when I'm trying out a product I
like to just pick out one or two maybe
no more than that just in case it
doesn't work out for me for when I'm
reviewing because I don't personally
like to return makeup products but I
love this so much that I'm definitely
going to purchase more of them and I
actually went online and purchased the
other one that I've really really wanted
that I was having a hard time debating
between this one and the really cool
toned bright pink which is called
justify my love and I actually ended up
picking that one up and I'm going to
give it away in my 2,000 subscriber
giveaway so whenever I hit 2,000 you
guys will be getting one of these I
thought that that bright pink color
would match everybody's skin tone really
well and yeah so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this review if you did please
give it a thumbs up give it a thumbs up
for this cute little packaging I just
want to like put it in my hair it's so
cute anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
