you so much for joining me i have a
review for you guys on a really exciting
product or a really exciting little set
or kit that i think you should
definitely pick up it's on the
sephora.com website it is called the two
face melts your heart out set and it
looks like this this is little box that
it comes in and inside you get a full
size of the two face melted liquefied
long wear lipstick in melted peony and
then you get a deluxe size of the melted
metal which is their newer melted
lipstick if they've come out with this
one is more like shiny and it's got a
little more like the litter to it a
little more Sheen and this color is in
dreamhouse so basically for twenty-five
dollars you get a full-size of the
melted pini and then you get the deluxe
size of this I'm going to tell you right
now the deluxe size is half of what the
full sizes so basically for $25 you're
getting this for $21 which is the normal
price but then you're getting the deluxe
for an extra four dollars which is
awesome because it's half the amount of
product that's actually in the full size
so I think that's a great steal like I
think that's just it's great it's a
great deal steal everything it's really
really good so it's a great way to try
out if you haven't tried the two face
melted lipsticks um they are very
popular I do have a few other shades
however when I saw that they came out
with their melted metal ones I wasn't
sure exactly if I wanted to purchase a
full size so when I saw this kit on the
Sephora website I definitely thought I
need to go ahead and get it so I have
them swatched right here this is melted
peony which is kind of like a cult
favorite it's a beautiful nude kind of
just you know pinky almost mom just
perfect perfect nude color and
underneath I have dream house which is
that metallic one as you can see the
metallic one really picks up a lot of
shine it doesn't actually have like
chunks and chunks of glitter in it
however I don't find that it applies as
smoothly as the melted p anyone does i
would say obviously that's because it
does have that texture to it i see i
think excuse me i think in my personal
opinion that i still like the regular
melted melted lipsticks better just
because the texture really glides on
easily and it's really easy to use so
I'm kind of glad that I picked this up
in a deluxe
anyway because I don't know if I would
have actually purchased a full size of
the melted metals so anyway um when you
open it up you just kind of twist off
the cap and inside you get this kind of
little fuzzy tip applicator and
basically it's a lipstick in a tube it's
kind of like putting on a lipless lip
gloss except it is an actual lipstick so
you just squeeze the product out and it
comes out like that and then you just
work it right on to your lips and it
really just it sets pretty quickly and
it just really feels nice on the lips it
doesn't feel drying it doesn't feel like
it's like you know aggravating or
bothering my lips however it doesn't
feel like a lipstick it doesn't feel
heavy it doesn't feel you know sticky
it's really really awesome formula same
thing with the melted metal one you just
squeeze it out get the product there and
then you can just put it on your hand I
find that with the melted metal one
there's a little war um it's a little
more patchy but applying and I think
that's because it does have like those
tiny little shimmers in it that would be
my guess um so you know this one is not
as easy to apply and it does go on a
little more patchy than the original
formula but if you're someone who really
wants like really bright poppy colors
and a little more shimmer then
definitely go for the melted metal ones
anyway I'm going to read you guys a
little bit about what it says only to
face up to faced sorry the Safari web
site so it says the two face melts your
heart out set $25 what it is a coveted
duo of two-faced best-selling a metal
melted liquefied long wear lipstick and
a mech metal net and a melted metal
lipstick to give lips high impact color
this set includes to face best-selling
melted liquefied long wear lipstick and
peony and an exclusive sneak peek of
melted metal in dreamhouse a lip color
that impacts electric illustrious
liquefied metal lip look the melted lip
color provides high impact super rich
saturated pigment in a long wear formula
while a melted metal impacts a vibrant
long metal finish long oh god so many
men in a melted metal lola a vibrant
liquid metal finish that gives your lips
a look of a multi-faceted depth each one

allows for a clean and effortless look
ever look effortless application each
time and comfortably coats lips with lip
color and it says it includes full size
of melted peony and then to Lex size of
the metallic dream house and it is
formulated without parabens sulfates our
families and it says what else you need
to know to face Co fine co founder and
creative Creek creative director of it
what should I say corrective during as I
cannot read today creative director
Jerrod Blandino has never seen lipstick
more beautiful intense rich and glossy
than when it's melted from the cosmetic
labs with this inspiration we created a
lipstick liquefied so it doesn't lose
its pigment or shine while keeping it
comfortable flexible and cushioning bear
this product is cruelty free gluten free
and vegan friendly so sorry really can't
talk today but anyway I just really love
this little set I totally think it's
worth it like I said you're getting a
full size of one of the cult favorites
melted peony and then you're getting for
basically four dollars a deluxe size of
the new melted metal liquefying metallic
lipsticks so anyway I hope you guys
