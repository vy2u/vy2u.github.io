this video I am giving you a review on
the new to face melted back to liquefied
matte and long-wear lipstick in the
shade star I purchased this for $21 on
the sephora.com website I am wearing it
on my lips today I want to let you guys
know I literally just applied this okay
it looks really bad and I literally just
apply it but anyway I did purchased it
for 21 dollars only sephora.com website
they have a really nice shade range and
selection however like half of the
shades are sold out currently because it
is such a new product it is only
available for a VIP and VIP bruges
Members Only right now and it isn't
Sephora exclusive products so you are
not going to be able to get this at Ulta
if you were curious anyway this is
supposed to be a long wear lipstick that
is ultra saturated lightweight it has
avocado oil in it it's free of parabens
and fatal aids and sulfates and all that
kind of stuff and I was really really
excited to try this out because I love
Too Faced so much but I really got it
disappointed in this product and pretty
darn sure I'm going to be returning this
this is what the outside packaging looks
like typical really cute Too Faced
packaging with the matte black and then
it shows the actual color on the front
and then it gives the color name and the
actual packaging is so adorable you do
get 0.23 fluid ounces in here or 7 ml
this is what the actual packaging looks
like really cute it's got the little
gold what is this little gold handle and
then you have a doe foot applicator that
you know it's very very nice it does
kind of shoot out right away like that
and then this is acrylic it's not glass
but it's a very very cute the way it's
packaged I think is just absolutely
adorable I really really adorable
packaging so it's the formulation that
I'm not loving when I first got this and
the warrant I thought it looked really
really good I must have been having a
very good lip day because I probably was
really really moisturizing that day I
have to say if you do not moisturize
your lips before you put these on they
are going to look so bad and the soft
part is that the sad part is is that I
just literally put lip balm on and then
put this product on and I feel like it
is already collecting up in the fine
lines and dry patches on my
which is really annoyed I have tried it
with the the Laura Geller at lip spackle
which is like a lip primer it still
looks that way it's just it's kind of a
hot mess of a formula honestly and I'm
one of those people I take really good
care of my lips I'm a flutist so I
constantly am boy stir anything my lips
I have so many good moisturizing lip
balms I feel like I've tried this
product out quite a few times now and
I'm just not happy with the way it
settles on my lips now I did pick up a
very kind of like nudey pink sort of
shade and I feel like with any long
wearing that liquid lipstick when you
get one of the lighter shades it's gonna
be a lot more noticeable on the lips
because it's just almost like a new
color you know what I mean it's a very
very noticeable and it can kind of make
your lips look dead however I have to
say I have to say I have my Sela stay
all day liquid lipstick right here and I
do have these swatch on my hand this is
the Stila stay all day liquid lipstick
in the shade of bossy and then here is
the child star liquid lipstick from Too
Faced as you can see the Stila one is a
lot more pigmented and it literally
feels a lot less tacky than this Too
Faced one and the toothpaste one just
looks a little blotchy and splattered
and I feel like that's the way it goes
on the lips and then on top of that even
though it might feel a little more
lightweight than the Stila one it still
has like a weird tackiness on it and if
I were to rub my lips together it would
just start crumbling all over so I'm not
super impressed with this formulation I
feel like it goes on a little streaky it
really emphasizes the lines and dry
spots on my lips and when it starts to
wear off throughout the day although it
does have a nice like where time but I
would expect that from any liquid
lipstick but when it starts to wear off
I feel like it is even more noticeable
like it starts to wear off on the inner
part of the lips like any other liquid
lipstick but then it starts to literally
just get so patchy and it looks ugly and
you can't just reapply a liquid lipstick
unless you have amazing amazingly like
moisturizing lips if you already have
really really moisturize lips I guess
you could but I can't get away with that
like if I
put another layer of this on my lips
right now it would start to just crumble
up and cake up and look disgusting so it
was kind of sad because when I first
tried that product I actually really
liked it and again I can't even remember
what lip balm I was wearing with that
you know when I applied it that day I
can't remember for some reason but it
looks so nice and for an incredibly long
time and I didn't feel like it was
emphasizing any lines or wrinkles on my
lips but since then every single time I
have applied it I felt like it just
looks like crap
on my lips so I'm pretty darn sure I'm
gonna be returning this yes it is quite
saturated and pigmented not as much as
the seal of one the seal one is a little
more I don't know how to describe it
it's just a little more opaque in color
I feel like the two-faced one is a
little streaky and I feel like it does
wear a long time it is quite ultra
saturated not as saturated as some other
liquid lipsticks like the Ceylon one but
I feel like the claims just kind of fall
short as far as far as like being
moisturizing and having avocado oil in
it and all that kind of stuff because I
feel like if it actually did I wouldn't
be having these sort of issues like I
literally just applied this five minutes
ago and I feel like you can already see
all these little wrinkles on my lips so
I'm just not a huge fan of the
formulation I think it is a good price
you do get a nice amount of product but
if you are looking into a like all day
liquid lipstick I would recommend
checking out the Stila ones not the new
toothpaste ones I don't they use me to
say that has two faces of my favorite
high-end brands but I'm just not
impressed with these liquid lipsticks so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
