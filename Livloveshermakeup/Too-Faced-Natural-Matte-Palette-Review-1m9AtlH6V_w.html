today's review is going to be on the new
Too Faced natural matte matte neutral
eyeshadow palette it looks like this and
this is exclusively sold on the Ulta
website for $36 that is where I
purchased mine this is kind of supposed
to be like the all matte version of this
palette this is the Too Faced natural
eye palette and as you guys can see this
is a very well-loved product from me
I've already hit complete pan on this
color down here and I've hit pan on a
few of the shades in here so I really
like this one so when I saw that they
were coming out with an all matte
version I was like I have to get on that
because I love the shades I think
they're beautiful and these are very
very similar so on the inside you get
nine gorgeous gorgeous shades you get a
cute little mirror up here and by the
way this is tin packaging it's not like
the boxed packaging so I think that's
kind of the new Too Faced thing so you
get this color up here heaven you get
lay steady the color nude then you get
cashmere bunny strapless honey butter
sex press Oh risque and chocolate cookie
so some of the names are different than
the ones in the original natural eye
palette but they're all very very close
in like color range so I'm really really
happy with them I think they're just
beautiful they're super super creamy and
easy to work with Too Faced is known for
having stuff like that though you know
just pigmented gorgeous creamy products
that's basically what you know they're
known to happen this palette is
absolutely no exception let me read for
you guys a few things that it says on
the Ulta website I have it pulled up on
the side here it says an Ulta exclusive
the Too Faced transformed all the shades
you love in the award-winning natural
eyes neutral eyeshadow collection into a
stunning matte palette go from soft and
pretty to slightly sexy with these nine
gorgeous neutral matte shadows that pair
perfectly blend beautifully and are so
versatile you can wear them before
breakfast or after dark and I am wearing
them today by the way on my eyes
two-faced to the nine shades from their
best-selling natural eye palette and
made the matte rich pigments exclusive
to true color if your pigment eye
after rich color payoff there blendable
luxurious silky smooth formula blends
effortlessly for an airbrushed effect
and then it says step-by-step
instructions include toothpaste
signature glamour guide with the three
looks to help you get started and that's
true so the little box that this comes
in is right here and you do get this
little card which is something that Too
Faced does with like all of their
palettes it gives you a little step by
step card to show you how to create
certain looks which i think is so
helpful because some people you know
like people like me to you know that our
beginners and makeup and things like
that and just aren't makeup artists
basically it can learn a lot from stuff
like this so they have like a daytime
look a classic look and a fashion look
and that kind of shows you on the back
what those look like
so it's kind of like daytime smokey and
then really really extravagant and smoky
so really really like that they come
with those cards I actually do keep
these so um anyway but yeah like I said
um these are just gorgeous they're super
super creamy I am wearing the colors
heaven all over my lid today all the way
up to my brow bone then I have what
color nude in a nudie sorry this color
down here I put in two as a transition
color and then I used strapless with the
e25 blending from Sigma and put that
into my crease and then I took lace
Teddy and kind of blended it out at the
top and it's just such a nice pretty
look I feel like Matt's just look so
beautiful when they're just all together
and there's no shimmer on the eye just
cuz a really nice classic look and I
think you get that with this palette so
I absolutely love this I will link
everything below where you guys can pick
this up and yeah I highly recommend it
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
