video is going to be a review of
swatches any quick comparison on the new
Too Faced Park Avenue kisses Christmas
in New York set I purchased this for $29
on the Too Faced calm website I will as
always leave a link down below if you
are interested in picking it up this has
two full-size la creme lipsticks in it
in these shades sugar-daddy and also
pink chocolate as well as one ala matte
lipstick in the shade
art the outer packaging is really really
cute and consistent with the Christmas
in New York theme you do get the
ingredients listed back here and if you
are curious this is made in China so I
really enjoyed last year's set because
you guys the value on this is incredible
it's like one of those really really
good lip sets that you need to pick up I
highly recommend checking out the by
beauty lip set and also this one I did
get last year's and I just absolutely
loved it for $29 you are getting three
full-size look from lipsticks and these
normally retail for $22 apiece so if you
have never tried out the formulation and
you're curious and this is a great way
to go ahead and do that so the packaging
on the la crema lipstick is really nice
it's very weighted very similar to the
Too Faced better than sex mascara and
that is what they look like a very very
nice size right here I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch out the three shades that we
got in last year's in the Petit clays
offset which was adorable I really
really enjoyed last year set it came in
a really nice little turquoise pouch
with tons and tons of glitter and
shimmer on it and this year you get this
little pouch right here which is also
really really cute but I definitely
preferred last year so the first shade
that we had in last year's set was
called a nude beach and this is what it
looks like it was kind of like a nude I
would say a really nice nude cool toned
color so there is nude beach very very
pretty the next of the the next sets
that we got no the next color we got was
called Wham and this was like really
really pretty this is actually glitter
infused but it's still very very nice on
the lips and this was called way I'm
like I said and it's kind of like a
berry color with tons and tons of micro
glitter it's a very very beautiful and I
did feel like this wore extremely well
on my lips even though it was infused
with glitter I still feel like it was
comfortable it was true to the
formulation and I was very very happy
with it and then the last shade that we
got in last year's
what's called taffy and this one was
more of like your peachy nude and it
leans a little more on the warm tone
side so I really liked the color
selection last year because I feel like
they just did a very very good job color
wise they're all very very wearable and
natural and I feel like everybody could
have worn that set so I gave that a
great review last year because I really
did like it and then this year we are
getting the two full-size lip creme
lipsticks in the shade should or daddy
which looks like this
which is a beautiful sort of rosy nude
there is sugar daddy and then we are
also getting the shade pink chocolate
and pink chocolate is like literally my
favorite ever this is a beautiful
beautiful berry color with a little bit
of a brown undertone these are not like
us watching over my bones very well but
there is pink chocolate as you guys can
see and then the last shade that you are
getting is not the original la creme
formulation you are getting a matte
shade so this is called rebel heart
savings our packaging really nice and
weighted except it is black and matte
and I will be going ahead and
decluttering this to my friend Haley who
I know likes this formulation they're
just not comfortable enough for me to
want to wear on my lips I'm very very
picky about my lip product and I do
prefer the more luminous creamy version
in the original one so anyway here are
side-by-side swatches of last year's kit
versus this year's I feel like
everything is pretty much is the same
except these are way more pigmented this
year I noticed that right off the bat
the colors are obviously different but I
feel like the pigmentation is like way
more on fleek so if you were wondering
yes the pigmentation has really really
been stepped up I do still have an issue
with how long these wear on my lips they
really do start to kind of slide off
very very quickly but I'm personally
someone who doesn't right mind
reapplying throughout the day so I
really really adore this set I think
it's absolutely beautiful there are like
one obviously one shade in here this
particular one right here is kind of
similar to the two nudes that you got in
last year's set but if you got last
year's set and you loved it you are
going to love this year's set as well
but if you don't like like a matte
formulation you may not like that guy
but it's still worth it because you're
getting two full-size look creme
lipsticks for $29 so overall I would say
this is a great formulation really great
way to try out but they look creme
formulation from Too Faced and I'm just
very very happy I think that this is
these are very very wearable shades and
everybody could wear them so
way back to my little quick review
swatches in comparison I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
