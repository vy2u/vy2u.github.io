my channel today I have a first
impressions for you guys on the new Too
Faced peanut butter and honey palette I
am so excited I got this two days ago so
I'm not ready to do a review yet but I
thought I could do with first
impressions I will of course do a
follow-up review for you guys as well in
about a week or two but yeah this is
what the outer packaging looks like this
does retail for $36 on the Too Faced
calm website I personally got mine as a
Platinum Member from Ulta we got early
access this will be available online on
the ulta.com website as well as Too
Faced on March 1st and in store on March
19th
now I would recommend ordering from the
Ulta calm website because you do get
like a free gift if you could get a
little deluxe size better than sex
mascara which is a great mascara but
yeah pretty much I'm super super excited
for this if you guys didn't know I'm a
huge fan of the Too Faced 9 pan at
palettes I have a lot of them they are
just absolutely wonderful in my opinion
some of my favorite formulas that they
come out with even though some of the
ingredients are a little different from
one another for the most part I feel
like they're all really good so I did
purchase the Too Faced peanut butter and
jelly palette last year by the way if
you guys are curious this is limited
edition I've seen two people now say
that it's not but it is listed as
limited edition on the Too Faced Ofcom
website so if you do want it in March I
would highly recommend jumping on it but
yeah I picked up the peanut butter and
jelly palette I really do like this I
think it's fantastic so I'm very excited
to see if this one is comparable we're
going to do some swatches and then I'm
gonna go ahead and apply this on the
eyes for you guys and we shall see what
it's like I do have a bunch of cleanup
brushes here and I already have the
majority of my makeup on this brow today
is just like you like it doesn't
want to be doesn't want to be doing
anything but I put all the rest of my
makeup on so if you want to know what I
do have on my cheeks or anything like
that it will be listed in the
description bar so let's go ahead and
open this up here is the outer packaging
super super super cute this little toast
thing I love it I really really love it
alright so on the inside this is what
the actual packaging looks like a nice
little tin packaging as usual for their
9 pan palettes their 9 pound palettes
the layout is usually three bigger kind
of like a brow bone shades and then six
smaller shades and I feel like you're
getting nice amount of product in here
for $36 so here are the actual shades at
gotta say these really do look a lot
better in person than they do online and
I feel like it's just not really showing
up the real color even on camera right
now I'm looking and they just look very
mundane and kind of mixed together or
like very very similar on camera but
when you look at them in person you can
definitely see okay there's that shade
there's this shade so I just wanted to
put that out there I do notice sometimes
with the 9 pan palettes some of the
darker shades start to get a little
muddled together but these look pretty
different so I'm very excited if you
guys are curious I really can't smell
like any peanut butter or any honey with
this now my nose is a little runny today
but it just smells slightly sweet that's
it it does not smell nearly as good as
the peanut butter and jelly palette this
one actually smells truly like peanut
butter this one doesn't really so if you
are curious it does smell a little
sweeter than peanut butter but I can't
really smell that much so anyway by the
way if you guys are curious also keep
saying if you're curious there is
absolutely no peanut butter in here so
if you do have a peanut allergy no
worries so let's go ahead and just
starts watching I'm gonna start with the
shade creamed honey so this one appears
to be a glitter shade it is this one
right here just is one of those nice
like brow bone kind of matte shades it
seems like it's a matte but it has like
glitter in it I don't know okay so there
is the first shade this one is called
creamed honey
alright that goes on pretty darn nice
hopefully you guys can see that I do
feel like that would be nice for my
particular skin tone next we will swatch
a base sweet here is the base sweet and
this is more of like a pinky kind of
color as you guys can see this would be
nice as a transition going on a little
chalky there can you guys see that it's
not going on that grade all right and
then the last one we have here is Queen
Bey I'm sorry Queen B yes Queen B and
this one
why don't keep wanting to say BAE it's B
be sweet and Queen B queen bee is
definitely more of like a topi a topi
color that is these are not watching
well alright so there they are the three
bigger kind of like matte shades if you
guys were curious so at the top cream
honey under
that'd be sweet and then queen bee queen
bee is really really topi can you guys
see that I hope it's showing up on
camera this is like a topi color this is
more pinky and then that one has more of
like a I would say like a nude base but
it does have glitter in it the other two
are matte so not very impressed with
that let's go ahead and compare it to
the three big shades in the peanut
butter and jelly palette the three that
we have from the peanut butter and jelly
are spread the love bananas and extra
creamy and these are really really nice
so let's see here spread the love
bananas and extra creamy so here are the
ones from the new peanut butter and
honey and here are the peanut butter and
jelly all right so I do feel like these
are a lot more pigmented and now the
shades are a little deeper in tone but
just so you guys can get some reference
I'm already getting the feeling that
this palette - the new peanut butter and
honey probably isn't that great if you
do have more of a darker complexion
which totally sucks but um if you can
still get the peanut butter and jelly I
would pick it up I feel like sometimes
it goes in and out of stock of being on
being in stock run on uh what is it also
calm alright let's go ahead and just
watch some more let's jump into the next
row of the peanut butter and honey we
have peanut butter honey brittle and
honey buns gang a little bit of a kick
up here as well it's a little a little
interesting for their 9ko to pay less
they're not usually like that so here we
have this row right here we will start
with this one so that is peanut butter
now we do have the shade peanut butter
in the peanut butter and jelly palette
so let's see here is peanut butter the
next one is called honey brittle which
is really pretty they feel a little a
little more crispy than I'm used to you
guys I'm not gonna lie I feel a little
more crispy than their other nine
pellets or and then here we have honey
buns which I think everybody really is
into that yellowy kind of shade guys
these are not swatching very well do you
see this alright so here is peanut
butter underneath that we up honey
brittle and then honey buns let me see
if I can build those up a little more
that honey brutal man now
 let's try a little more hmm they
look they look a little patchy can you
guys see that now hopefully alright
let's go ahead and swatch the three
shades from the Too Faced peanut butter
and jelly on the other side so we have
peanut butter peanut brittle and jelly
so we already do have one shade that is
the same and that is peanut butter these
are way more pigmented you guys Oh
peanut butter and jelly peanut butter
and honey do you guys see
yikes alright moving on we're going to
do with the final row let's see here
going nuts we have can't even read these
bee's knees and feeling nutty so let's
go ahead and swatch those now we get a
little more micellar water here I'm
worried you cries OH
your face has just been so inconsistent
lately so this is kind of freaking me
out but that's okay
so going nuts is a nice kind of I would
say this one's going to be more of like
a shimmery shade it's like a deep cool
toned almost eggplant color and then we
have bee's knees which again appears to
be that kind of like matte finish with
the glitters like embedded it is but not
like super super crispy hopefully it's
not and then feeling nutty is just a
really really interesting kind of
greenish a brownish color very warm tone
so let's go ahead and swatch those man
these feel rough you guys okay feeling
nutty felt really really good but uh
yeah I don't know all right so let's
swatch these ones you guys I'm going
like back and forth here to see you can
see alright so I feel like that last
shade right there did really really well
so feeling nutty is the one on the
bottom I feel like that's watched
beautifully bee's knees is the one in
the middle and then on top we have going
nuts let me see if I can build those up
a little more because those two top ones
don't look that great
all right there they are a little more
built up so this is probably the best
row like right away I can see that now
let's go ahead and swatch the peanut
butter and jelly on the other side we
have a peanut butter cup but we have
jamming and nuts about you the only
shade in this particular palette that
really wasn't that great was this one
which is nuts about you but let me show
you guys the swatches alright they're so
pigmented over here I'm getting worried
I'm worried I'm worried worried worried
alright alright so peanut butter and
jelly peanut butter and honey just for
reference I don't think I line these up
correctly but just so you guys can see
so definitely colors are very very
similar I'm not going to sit here and be
like they're not because they seem very
similar to me but I need to get them on
the eyes and see what they look like so
first impressions wise swatches I'm a
little worried they don't look that
pigmented but this may be a nice palette
for just like natural makeup looks if
you guys didn't know I'm a natural
makeup look kind of gross so this may be
good for me
alright so let's go ahead and jump right
into putting this on the eyes I'm using
you guys in just a little bit here Anna
we're gonna go ahead and apply this so
first I want to show you what I primer I
have on I do have the benefit Air Patrol
BB eyelid primer on this is a really
nice eye primer and I'm going to put a
little bit of eyeliner on my waterline
quickly just for a little definition
this is the Smashbox Kohl waterproof
liner in the shade Sumatra and I just
like to go ahead and put this on to my
waterline for that extra defined sort of
look so let's jump right in
I am nervous all right let's do the wet
and wild crease brush which looks a
little something like this I'm going to
take the shade you know what why don't
we do cream honey so there is cream
honey very nervous about how these are
going to apply and tap off that excess
and I'm just going to apply that all
over my lid all the way up to my brow
this is definitely one of those shades
and put it underneath my eye as well
this is one of those shades where you
know you can't see the glitter particles
or at least I can't see them so it's
more like a matte shade I would say
alright putting that all over
oh I can taste the honey in my mouth
that's not so weird but you know when
you like inhale a palate even though it
doesn't smell super strong I feel like I
can kind of taste it alright so there we
go on the eyes the first shade let's dip
into be sweet now that is the second
shade right here and I'm just going to
take the same brush and let's work that
into the crease as our transition shall
we see what it does okay it's a nice
transition if you do have fair skin I
think hmmm like that pretty color
alright now let's go into honey brittle
which is the shade right here it's a
little more deep and peachy same brush I
tap off the excess super powdery guys
super buttery alright it's going to work
that into the crease as well in circular
motions where I like that color I like
that that's a very pretty nice pretty
one but yeah I can say right away I
don't feel like this is gonna work for
every single skin tone if you do have a
deeper complexion I would pick up the
peanut butter and jelly if you can still
get it you guys know how I feel about
the limited edition thing let me tell
you Trish in my ass I feel like these
pallets always end up coming back so I
would pick that one up the next time it
comes back alright so there we go let's
go ahead and Marcus we'll just take a
sigma e35 brush and I'm going to dig in
to a deeper color let's take peanut
butter which is this one right here and
I'm going to start working that into my
crease tapping off that excess and we'll
see if we can kind of build up some
color here hmm right these are actually
third they're blending pretty well I'm
not someone who likes to spend a lot of
time finding you guys know that about me
so I really do like the 9 pan palettes
because of that I feel like you don't
have to spend tons and tons and tons of
time but yeah that's looking that's
looking relatively good alright so let's
go into bee's knees shall we actually
you know what will take feeling nutty so
feeling nutty is that matte shade over
here the one that I said is to watch
really nicely it felt really good like
when I touched it it's very very
uh it was very very pigmented and very
very smooth they are we go there's some
color that's nice I like that I like
that so with the same brush just going
in there you guys like I know I may look
like I'm tapping off a lot but these are
very powdery so just nothing to keep in
mind I don't remember my peanut butter
and jelly palette being that powdery so
something to keep in mind alright
circular motions I feel like these are
blending out relatively well I mean it's
not like the best thing ever but looks
relatively good it's not horrible
alright let's do some outer V work shall
we I'm gonna take this little guy right
here this is my luck see 231 small
tapered blending brush I'm going to jump
into going nuts which is that kind of
eggplant cool tone color let's dip in
there and we will start working that on
the outer V into the outer crease see if
we can kind of deepen that up and then
we will blend everything together that's
a pretty color like that it looks a
little more smoky gray on the brush I
know if you guys can see the actual
brush is like a smoky gray color not so
much like that purple eggplant kind of
color not really getting any fallout
which is great so I'm just kind of
concentrating that in the outer V
hmm it's not bad uh looks a little
patchy the state does so let's go ahead
and take that wet'n wild a crease brush
again and I'm just going to blend
everything together
mmm you know it kind of took some of
that warmth away from those other shades
that we had worked into the crease so
this one I feel like even though it is
the one kind of like shimmer shade or
you know I wouldn't call it foiled it's
just you know the one that has a little
bit of Sheen to it it is a little
difficult to blend here having just a
little bit of difficulty it's not
horrible but it's not it's not amazing
either alright so let's go back into
cream honey in that same brush I'm just
going to tap right underneath the brow
to make sure we can keep some lightness
going on there okay okay amazing but
it's okay
I'm going to take this little flat brush
right here I'm gonna spray it down with
something my pixie skin treats and
makeup fixing this give it a good shake
and then I want to take that yellow
shade and I want to put that on the lid
and I am going to foil it because I just
don't feel like the pigmentation is
going to be there if I don't so I am
just going to foil that right on to my
lid looks kind of nice not too bad
it's definitely one of those that brush
looks still messed up definitely is one
of those that you probably want to foil
but that's pretty I like the yellow I
mean the yellow is different it's
different it's not going to be
everyone's favorite it's not a bright
yellow it's not a gold yellow it is
literally a straight-up you know it's
like the color of urine it okay this is
just calling it how I see it it's
definitely a different kind of yellow if
you're hoping that it leans more like
gold toned it's not it's just yellow all
right so let's go ahead and take a
different shade on our lower lash line I
think I have dipped into everything
except for Queen B and E's knees so
let's take bee's knees which is this one
and let's work that on the lower lash
line shall we I am going to foil that as
well because I don't want any fallout
and I take my Urban Decay 24/7 blending
brush go into bee's knees and let's see
here oh it's kind of smoke out the lower
lash line shall we all right already got
it in my eye it does feel like like I
said there's like quite a bit of powder
eNOS it's not horrible what it's also
not amazing just something to be aware
of oh that doesn't look that great this
is more of like a reddish orange color
not great for my skin tone personally
I'm going to take this Sonia Kashuk
number 116 brush and I'm just going to
see if I can kind of blend that a bit
because that went on a little little too
much for me you know what let's also go
ahead and take that yellow shade the
Honeybuns let's take that on the inner
part of the lash line cuz why the hell
not gonna foil again I'm going to take a
clown C 513 brush and we will pick up
some honey combs let's take that right
here you can play with a little more
color
god there's literally powder like flying
up I don't know if you guys can see it
or not all right then you know what
let's go into Queen B so that we have
used every single shade and let's kind
of work that on the inner corner kind of
an interesting inner corner highlight
gray toned but whatever I want to try
and use everything alright guys so that
is literally every single shade in this
palette on my eyes it looks just okay I
am not super impressed I'm gonna go in
with this morphe M 330 brush and just
blend everything now because I feel like
you know it just it looks a little
colorful um now I can see where I put
the different colors which I like but
when the area where I'm seeing that is
like where I have foiled so yes I can
see the honeyBun shade but that is
because I foiled it I can see this like
orange e shade on the bottom boot that's
because I foiled it I don't have a good
feeling about them not being foiled so I
just didn't want to waste my time not
foiling them but you know once I play
with them more I will let you guys know
if they go on to the eyes that nicely
without being foiled but I just get the
feeling that they won't all right so
that is pretty much it I'm going to
leave it kind of like this I'm sure I
could do some more blending but I just
want to leave it like this for now let
me call my eyelashes quickly and then we
will put mascara on because I feel like
an eye look is never really complete
until you have finished everything off
and actually put mascara on so I'm going
to pop on a coat of the they're real
mascara from benefit and then we will
call it a day because so far you guys I
think it's just okay it's not an amazing
amazing palette this shade that really
stands out is that honeyBun shade and it
truly is like a pea color you know it's
not like a a Goldy kind of whatever
color it is truly just straight-up
yellow it's a little bit of like an
orange tone to it so if you were
thinking oh it's going to be more gold
like it's not it's not at all if you
guys would like me to compare that color
to some of the yellow or gold shades in
the new viola Voss ride-or-die palette
definitely let me know down below but
yeah that is pretty much it you guys
here is the eye look that I created with
the new peanut butter and honey palette
I think it's okay it's not amazing but
it's okay
so here's a close-up what do you guys
think do you guys think it looks nice I
think okay I just I don't really have
anything else to say I think it's
watches really poorly but it looks okay
on the eyes I think these are just
shades that you're going to need to foil
if you want that really wham bam in your
face kind of look but yeah
that is pretty much it thank you so much
for joining me for this first
impressions you guys they do hope you
enjoyed it and I will see you tomorrow
