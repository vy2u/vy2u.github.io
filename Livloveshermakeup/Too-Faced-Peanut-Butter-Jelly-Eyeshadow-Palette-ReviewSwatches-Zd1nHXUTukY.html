channel peanut butter peanut butter
today yes it is peanut butter jelly time
and I'm so excited you guys this is the
new two-faced peanut butter and jelly
eyeshadow palettes this is one of their
nine pan palette and I got this on the I
was gonna say two-faced website no I got
this on the altar calm a website a few
days ago I got an email from Ulta and it
said congratulations you are platinum
member would you like to purchase the
peanut butter and jelly palette early
and I was like hell yeah I would so I
ordered it and I'm so excited to review
it for you guys today and give you
swatches and absolutely obsessed with it
I'm just gonna go ahead and put that out
there right away I think it's absolutely
fantastic so fantastic that I went ahead
and purchased another one for the
giveaway that I will be doing since
they've reached 5000 subscribers that
will be up in the next week or two by
the way but anyway so I did purchase
another one I think it's absolutely
fantastic
I'm loving this palette I can't wait to
share with you guys some information
about it how long it wears on the eyes
swatch it for you guys and show you
everything so like I said I purchased
this for $36 on the ultra calm website
it will be available for everybody on
February 28th on the autosum website and
also the Too Faced website so I am gonna
leave the link below and you guys can
come back to the video and click on it
if you want to or you can just go to the
Elgin icon website but I will leave two
links below they are not affiliate or
referral links in any way shape or form
this is what the actual packaging looks
like and I would read for you guys a
little bit about what it says on the
Alta comp website but it's very limited
information it basically just tells you
the shades and then it lets you know
that to the actual
peanut-butter-and-jelly eyes shadow
palette was inspired by the peanut
butter shade in the semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette so let me go ahead and show
you guys what that she looks like it is
right here it is a beautiful kind of
peanut buttery warm shade and that is
basically what inspired them to go ahead
and create this new peanut butter jelly
palette so this is what the actual
palette looks like if you are familiar
with any of the Too Faced nine shadow
pan palettes they all look like this
they're all the same size you get nine
shades in here you get a mixture of
shimmer glitter and matte shades and
they all come like this they're
basically all in this packaging I have
the natural matte one here
and these sugarpop one here all the same
packaging I keep it have one of the old
school ones here this is the natural I
won this came in cardboard packaging
which I think I actually preferred
because honestly there is a little
magnetic closure here but I'm never sure
if it's gonna open up because it opens
very easily so it kind of preferred the
cardboard packaging because you had to
lift it up like this and by the way I
have hit some major pan on this ballot I
love that one but anyway I was just
really really happy to get my hands on
this I knew I was gonna love it right
away honestly you guys like I know
that's cheesy to say but I knew I was
because the formulation of all of these
nine pan pallets from - fees are very
similar they we're incredibly long
they're very vibrant they go on to the
eyes even better than they swatch like
in person if that makes sense and I just
feel like it's the same with this one
there is a little bit of a layer that
you have to work through so this is what
these shades look like there is a little
bit of a layer on all of them especially
the matte shades that you kind of have
to work through it's not like a film
that's on top but it kind of feels like
a film I would recommend using these
with synthetic brushes I personally like
to use these with synthetic brushes all
of these to face nine pan pallets I
don't know what it is they just pick up
a lot of product and they really put
them on the eye nicely I will tell you
guys which shades I'm wearing really
quickly but first I want to show you
guys and the actual little pamphlet that
comes here so it's all like you know
closed up super cute I of course undid
line all ugly but it looks like a little
envelope and it says it's peanut butta
Genet tab you open it up and you can see
you get a range of little looks that you
can create which i think is fantastic to
face kind of came up with this whole
idea of having a little beauty pamphlet
in their palette and it is actually
tucked right into the area where the
mirror is in the palette so you can
carry it with you if you want to so you
do get the little mirror there it says
peanut butter and jelly time and then of
course you get all of your nine shades
so I do like having this I'm not a
makeup artist so I think it is nice to
have that in there these are what the
actual sheets look like let me show you
again I feel like I pulled it away too
quickly but you get some let's see here
they call this soft and sweet daytime
look and then you get the rich and
creamy which is more like a nighttime
and then the PB&amp;amp;J which is kind of like
the dramatic look I really love the
shades in here I think they last a very
nice amount of time on the eyes like
literally all day especially if you're
wearing a primer it doesn't matter what
timer could be a glitter glue primer it
could be the elf one dollar primer I
tried it with like all of them and
they're all just fantastic it just these
are so pigmented and they have such good
quality to them that they just work they
work with everything you literally could
wear them without a primer and they
would still work so let me tell you what
shades I'm wearing today I have these
shade bananas which is that gorgeous
gold shade right there I have that all
over my eyelid I have peanut butter in
my crease peanut brittle and jamming on
my outer-v and then I did you spread the
love to go in as my transition shade and
extra creamy as my brow bone shade so I
really really love the shades in here
you get a really really warm colors in
here so if you are not a fan of warm
tones I normally go for cool tones
because I do have a cool undertone in my
skin but I love the warm tones in here
and I love that little pop of color with
jelly right there I would say the
weakest shadow in here is actually jelly
I feel like it is the least pigmented
out of all of them you really have to
work up the color but I would say my
favorite one in here is peanut brittle
which feels like absolute butter and
it's absolutely gorgeous so I will go
ahead and swatch these for you guys but
overall I think they're absolutely
fantastic I love the wear time I think
they're identical to the formulation of
the Too Faced 9 palette
you know palette 9 palette palette 9 pan
palettes in general I feel like the mats
are the same as the ones in the natural
mats the shimmers are the same as the
one in the sugar pop talent even the
glitter shades have glitter that has
glitter in them are very like a micro
glitter like they're very easy to use
very easy to blend I never have any
issues with these kind of 9 pan palettes
from Too Faced so absolutely loving it
let's just get right into the swatches
shall we before I get into that I need
to talk about the peanut butter scent
there is a peanut butter scent in here I
have looked all over all over the
ingredients list and it claims that
there is no peanut butter powder in here
but I don't believe that because I smell
it and its first it smells like kind of
like milk chocolate and then you smell
that peanut butter like that saltiness
but honestly I just want to touch on
this really quickly I don't know if any
of you have peanut allergies or you have
someone in your household that has
peanut allergies please do a little
further research from what I can tell
it smells like there's peanut in here
now they do claim that there is none so
I don't really know I really don't know
please just do further research on that
topic if you do have somebody in your
household or if you yourself are
allergic to peanuts so anyway long story
short let's get right into the swatches
shall we so I'm gonna start with the top
row so we have spread the love peanut
butter and peanut butter cup spread the
love is a gorgeous kind of peachy shade
with I would say gold glitter in it that
is what it looks like and that is what
it looks like on the hand right there
really really beautiful I think it acts
as a really really gorgeous transition
color even though it does have that
micro glitter in there I still feel like
it works really really well the next one
is peanut butter which is of course the
signature color in here oh my god let
some funny I just blew on it and it like
shot up into my mouth and I taste
peanuts now like literally I taste beat
up like that is out like strong and
potent this stuff is so there is peanut
butter I have that blended out right
there sorry there were a few swatches
that I could not get off down there and
then the next one in the row is called
peanut butter cup this is another
gorgeous gorgeous oh by the way sorry
spread the love is they glitter shade
and then you have peanut butter which is
a matte and peanut butter cup is a
shimmer and really really gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous color it is like a
dark chocolatey brown with golden
sparkle in it it kind of does have a
little bit of glitter in it but it just
it's micro glitter you guys you like you
can barely tell but you'll understand
when I show you the actual swatch it
looks more like a shimmer shade really
really beautiful metallic gorgeousness
love it and then the next row we have
bananas which is the one that I have my
lid today peanut brittle and jamon I
love this little row I think it's
amazing so the first one is bananas
which is a gorgeous kind of gold yellowy
color and this is definitely like a
satiny shimmer shade that is the finish
of it absolutely beautiful you guys mama
gun this reminds me of get lucky from
colour-pop if you know that shade get
lucky this is what it reminds me of
isn't that beautiful it like almost
looks like it's wet on the eye really
really stunning and then the next one is
my favorite which is peanut brittle
which is a gorgeous kind of coppery
orange color right there absolutely
beautiful so pigmented you
like so pigmented definitely my favorite
out of the bunch so easy to blend look
at that yes yeah yeah so so so beautiful
and then the last one in that row is
called jammin and now my hand is think
state so I'm gonna go to the other one
and jammin is a beautiful it's described
as a chocolatey Brown but honestly I
think of it more as a purpley Brown with
a few like chunks of glitter in it
that's not I see it personally so as you
can see there's a little bit of like a
purpley tone in there they describe it
as a chocolatey Brown but I don't really
see that so there is jamming and then
the last row we have extra creamy jelly
and nuts about you so extra creamy is
there we have jelly and then we have
nuts about you extra creamy is a
beautiful kind of satiny finish it's got
this iridescent sort of white quality to
it it's really really beautiful it's not
completely matte I really love the way
it looks underneath the brow I think
it's absolutely stunning I don't know if
it's showing up but it's right beneath
the jamon shade and then we have a jelly
and jelly is the orchid like the
beautiful purple orchid shade and really
having to pick up a lot of product here
because in my opinion I know it probably
doesn't look like it but this is one of
the weaker shades in this palette it
just doesn't honestly swatch out as
pigmented as the other ones but it's
still very beautiful it's a gorgeous
kind of metallic II shimmery shade it is
right there
jelly stunning Aigner
and then the last one we have even
that's about you which is a beautiful
beautiful matte color it is like a ready
kind of orange shade it's just a little
more red than peanut butter and like I
said it is a matte and it's stunning and
we will go ahead and swatch that right
here I'm running out of room so there is
the last one which is called nuts about
you so overall you get such a nice like
arrangement of shimmers and glitters and
matte colors in here I think they're all
amazing they are so pigmented easy to
blend I think they look even better on
the eyes I really really enjoy using
them I think they're wonderful it smells
great it's a great travel palette I just
love these little 9pn palettes from Too
Faced so I'm very very happy
yeah I don't really have anything bad to
say about this particular palette I
think it is definitely worth of money if
you are into these kind of shadows if
you like these shades if you have the
natural matte or the sugar pop or any of
the other palettes that come me in this
little nine pack nine pan format then I
think you would absolutely love the
shades in here and the quality and
formulation of them so thank you so much
for joining me and I will see you guys
in tomorrow's videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
