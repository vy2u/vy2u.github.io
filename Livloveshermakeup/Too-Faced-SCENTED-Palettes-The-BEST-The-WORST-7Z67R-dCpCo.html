my channel happy Thursday today's video
is going to be all about the best and
the worst in the in-between of two-faced
scented pallets I have some base pallets
here to share with you guys I also have
some eye Palace to share with you guys
which I'm very excited about a few of
these I have already completely
decluttered out I did g-cloud her out to
the Too Faced sweet peach eyeshadow
palette because I was not a fan the
chocolate shop palette which was one of
their holiday collections that is gone
and then also the tardis Pro palette
which was a face palette those are
already gone but some of these I have
been holding on to to literally talk
about in this video so I'm very very
excited if you've been watching my
channel for a while you know that I've
been really really upset lately with Too
Faced and Tarte cosmetics I feel like
they have been extremely inconsistent
I'm nervous to purchase from those
brands right now Too Faced actually used
to be one of my favorite brands and they
no longer are they're really really not
they're way down there on my list now
but I do still believe that they have
some really fantastic products within
their collection I just wish they would
work on being a little more consistent
so anyway let's go ahead and start with
like the OG products the products I
would recommend that I think are great
these are obviously all scented and I
know that not everybody is into the
scented thing but I think it's something
very very cute the Too Faced does and
I've seen a lot of different brands kind
of catch on to this and notice that
people actually find it very fun a lot
of people find it gimmicky some people
can't even stand fragrance in their
products but I think it's really cute
and I think this was a fun way to kind
of share with you guys some scented
products that are good and also bad so
the first one I want to talk about that
is absolutely amazing is the Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette this is
what it looks like on the outside if you
guys can see and this is what I have on
my eyes today I'm wearing the shades
peanut brittle which is right there and
this guy right here I'm sorry this guy
right here which is called peanut butter
cup I have peanut brittle in my crease
and peanut butter cup in my outer V and
then I have a few single shadows which
I'll go ahead and list down below
layered on my eyelid and my lower lash
line but this is a really nice warm
toned palette it really does smell good
like peanut butter it smells like peanut
butter but it's not anything super super
overwhelming the longer that you do have
these pallets the more the scent kind of
fades out but I think this is really
good quality most of the 9 pan palettes
from Too Faced are very very good and I
actually do prefer the formula on the
good ones over the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette so that is the first one I
want to talk about the neck
is of course the chocolate bar palette
see chocolate bar pallets are like OG
favorites from Too Faced and everybody
loves these now I do have all three as
you guys can see but this little guy
right here is actually going to my
friend Rochelle this is the original one
I never ever got much used out of this
you guys can even see there are a few
shades in here that I honestly have
never even dipped to that dipped into
this is the old-school one so it doesn't
even have names on it but it still does
smell like chocolate it's a very very
neutral pretty palette and this is
usually everybody's favorite the reason
why I'm decluttering it is just because
honestly I have so many palettes with
those kind of colors now my personal
favorite is the semi-sweet palette I
feel like this one is so underrated the
reason why I like this one so much is
because you are getting a mixture of
warm tones as well as cool tones in here
so this is my all-time favorite one if
there is anything that I would recommend
you pick up from Too Faced it's either
one of the good 9 pan palettes or one of
the chocolate bar palette these are just
such a nice thing to have in your
collection because they will create
everyday friendly neutral eye looks and
I really really love this one and then
my second favorite is the Too Faced
chocolate bonbons palette so this was
kind of their third edition and as you
guys can see this one actually has cool
tones in it and I am someone who does
pull a cool undertone in my complexion
so these are very very flattering on my
eyes and I really really enjoy this one
as well and they all smell like
chocolate really really good the next
one I want to talk about a lot of people
will not agree with me on but it is the
Too Faced white chocolate chip palette
now this is not something that's going
to work for everyone but I adore this
you guys if you are someone who does
have a very very fair complexion like I
do these will work on you now if you
have a medium complexion a very very
deep complexion a lot of these shades
are just going to blend right into your
skintone but I love it it smells really
really good
extra extra sweet and it's super super
beautiful it's not a palette that I
would recommend if you want like a
really really striking dramatic like a
night kind of look even the black shade
right here which is called let's see
here exotica no black sugar even that
one right there doesn't even come off
super super pigmented but if you like
everyday friendly really really natural
eye looks I think you would enjoy this
especially if you do have a fair
complexion and then I do have to face
palettes here that I absolutely adore
the first one is the Too Faced cocoa
contour palette now they do have I think
three different versions of this now so
they have this version which was the
original which I picked up a few years
ago and I think they have a deep version
as well now which is awesome but this is
what it looks like on the inside it does
smell like cocoa as well not as strongly
like I said the longer you have these
the less they start to smell but there
is only one shade in here that I
absolutely detest and that is this one
right here which is called pop of light
I don't know why they thought it would
be good to put a highlighter in here
that is infused with glitter I hate when
two-face does that and they're like
let's just put glitter and everything
I'm like why but everything else is
absolutely beautiful you guys this sheet
right here which is called medium cocoa
makes a great great contouring shade on
fair skin so I really do enjoy this I
think it's a great palette and then
finally the Too Faced the little black
book of bronzers now I know this is no
longer available but I heard they are
coming out with a volume 2 edition when
you open it up this is what it looks
like on the inside and I got a lot of
use out of this but I stopped using it
about a year ago and it's not because I
don't like it I think this is really
good quality and this was a really fun
way to put together all these different
bronzers so you could try out every
single bronzer from Too Faced but in
like a smaller pan I just honestly don't
reach for it anymore I have my more and
more butter bronzers now from Physicians
Formula I got some of the new Becca
sunlit bronzers which I will be doing a
comparison video for you guys next week
I really really like those and I just
don't reach for this anymore so I'm
going to go ahead and declutter this to
my friend Rochelle but honestly it
really was good quality and it does
smell like chocolate or at least these
guys at the top do so anyway those are
the best of Too Faced scented palettes
in my opinion let's go ahead and talk
about some palettes that I think are
just okay that are also scented so the
first one is definitely the Too Faced
sweet peach glow palette so I was pretty
disappointed with the sweet peach line
in general I declared the eye shadow
palette I do like the papadum peach
blush and I did like the lip oils but
this in my opinion was really not that
great I felt like this was the most
hyped up out of all of them this is what
it looks like on the outside and it
really does smell good if you love like
peach rings and like artificial peach
peach fragrance you would probably love
this it smells really really sweet and
in here you did get a highlight you also
got a blush or a blush topper and then a
bronzer the bronzer is super super
orange this is like a true blush top or
even on my skin I really have to build
it
and I just think it's so stupid like if
you're gonna do a highlight of bronzer
make it a blush don't make it a blush
topper you know what I mean
and then the highlight is a pretty I am
liking this more and more but these are
just the products I'm showing you guys
right now are not ones that I can
guarantee are going to make it through
my next declutter do you know what I
mean I just feel like I'm not getting
too much use out of them but I do reach
for them once in a while so that is a
product that I think is just mark and
wouldn't really recommend the other two
are these little guys right here so
these are the two faced eggnog latte and
gingerbread cookie palettes now when I
first got these I actually thought they
were quite good these were from the
Christmas in New York collection which
was their holiday collection this year
now I think two-face has gotten a little
better with their holiday collections
they're not amazing like I said I
already decluttered the chocolate shop
palette but this one was pretty darn
good you also did get the peppermint
mocha palette which is a total fail and
I will show you guys that next and like
my bad pile but these were okay I do
prefer this one more if there's anything
that's going to be decluttered it will
probably be this one there is a lot of
fallout with these but what I really
love are these little um or these big I
should say bronzers and blushes at the
bottom so in each palette you do get six
different eyeshadows and then you get a
blush or a bronzer at the bottom it
really does smell lightly of gingerbread
and this one does smell lightly of like
a chai latte
I like the peppermint one the most
because you can smell it the most but
this is what the eggnog latte palette
looks like very very unique colors like
this shade right here this shade right
here I want to hold on to the palette
for that I might go ahead and just do
pop this blush down here this blush is
amazing okay this peach cobbler blush is
amazing I also love the gingerbread
bronzer but for the most part I don't
think that these are impeccable I don't
think they're the best you know formula
that Too Faced has ever released they
are definitely not 9p on palette formula
and they are definitely not chocolate
bar formula but they're still okay so
that's just kind of the okay pile like I
said can't guarantee if I will hold on
to those or not I do like the shade
selection I feel like to face for once
actually made palettes to have
interesting shades in them but yeah like
I said can't guarantee that I'll hold on
to them and then also I want to talk
about the merry macarons palette so this
was also from the Christmas in New York
collection I like this because it is so
compact and travel friendly and you just
get a bunch of neutrals in here okay
looks like every other Too Faced palette
on earth okay
they pop in like a purple shade down
here or like a green shade and they're
always like that's the pop of color it's
the same thing over and over again the
more I look at this the more I'm like
I'm pretty sure I'll declutter this but
I need to play with it some more I think
it is nice if you want everyday friendly
neutral eye looks I know that these will
be going on sale soon at Sephora someone
said that I don't know that for sure but
you can still get them on Amazon and
stuff but is this better than like a
chocolate bar palette hell no you guys
they're really not that great but again
I feel like the formula on some of the
Too Faced Christmas in New York like the
holiday collections we're better than
they were from previous years alright
and finally let's go ahead and get into
the pile the first one will come as
no surprise it is the peanut butter and
honey palette did not like this you guys
I do not think it's a good formula so
it's very disappointing okay it's so
 disappointing because the 9 pan
palette formula like I said for the most
part has been getting better and better
and then they released this and his
total crap it definitely smells very
lately of honey but I don't smell any
sort of peanut butter whatsoever I felt
like this was one of the most gimmicky
pallas they've ever come out with I
tried to love it if you watch my first
impressions on this I was trying so hard
to love it because it's been so
difficult I've been getting so much hate
lately from people saying you need to
stop being so negative about Too Faced
and I wanted to try and love it but then
I realize you know what I shouldn't try
and be anything okay if I hate it I
 hate it and this was just one of
those palettes that I really didn't get
too much use out of I had to pair it
together with another palette it's a
very supplementary palette in my opinion
the only two shades I was really crazy
about were honey brittle and then this
one right here which was these knees but
a lot of these were scratchy these
particular shades right here don't have
a lot of color distinction between the
three of them and it's just a very
boring palette it's a very very boring
palette so although it's cute and it's
gimmicky it's just it's gimmicky alright
and then the next one I want to talk
about is the Too Faced matte chocolate
chip palette ooh this is going to be
decluttered as well oh by the way the
peanut butter and honey I'm returning
but this one's gonna be decluttered I
have a friend who wants to try this out
he works at Sephora he's very good at
makeup he can make this work
but this is what it looks like on the
inside of her so I was going to give
this to my friend Senora she is a very
deep complexion and these did show up on
her but then she was like you know what
I went to face chocolate bar palette I
don't need that but this is what it
looks like it's basically just the matte
version of the original og Too Faced
chocolate bar but these are very hard to
blend in my opinion the reason why I
liked the white chocolate chip was
because I
felt like the formulas were completely
different now if you're someone who does
have a deeper complexion I think you
would prefer this because these shades
are actually going to show up on you but
like I said a lot of them were Scratchy
difficult to blend I'm not the kind of
girl that wants to blend my eyeshadow
for 25 minutes okay it's just not me so
for me personally this was not good at
all here we have the two-faced
peppermint mocha palette like I said
they released the Grand Hotel cafe set
with all three of those and it's just so
crappy when they give you three palettes
and two of them are good and the other
one sucks it's like how am I supposed to
return this if I want to kind of work
with the other two you can't so you get
stuck in this situation where you're
like me and now you're kind of like the
kind of wish that whatever turned it but
this is what it looks like this was
definitely the prettiest as far as color
selection is concerned in my opinion
Santa Baby is a beautiful blush I should
probably go ahead and deep pot that but
these shades up here we're very very
patchy very very scratchy
some of them were clitter infused even
though they don't even look like it like
this one right here coffee chip you know
I hate when you dig into a Too Faced
eyeshadow palette and you're like oh
it's a nice satiny sheet and then
there's glitter everywhere it is
so obnoxious I hate that I wish they
would stop with those glitter in few
shades because you know what they're not
flattering on the eyes I don't care who
you are they're not flattering so yeah
this was something definitely that I was
not impressed with whatsoever so that's
going to be decluttered and finally we
have the natural love palette I don't
know if you guys knew this this is
scented and it smells great it smells
great it's got beautiful packaging it
smells like flowers smells like lilacs
or something not lilacs water lily
something like that smells like water
lilies on the inside this is what it
looks like and I am completely
completely sure that I got it done okay
I'm completely sure I got it done
because so many people are loving this
and it's in the bad pile just because it
honestly didn't work for me I felt like
there are way too many glitter and few
shades in here out of what there's like
thirty in here I think 11 of them were
glitter infused and again it's just back
to that whole thing why do you do this
litter infused thing nobody is liking
this formula okay I feel like two-face
is pretty darn good with their mats but
their shimmers are always usually nice
and foiled and beautiful so just keep
doing that okay stop with the glitter
and fuse shed but this is what it looks
like I felt like the dark shades over
here we're very patchy very very dry the
middle sheets right here like these
pretty pinky shades were actually very
good kittens bunny nose cutie patootie
honey moon very very beautiful had that
nice
soiled look when you apply them finger
swatch and then also when you blended
them in on the eyes but then these guys
over here which I have a nine pm formula
from the natural map pellet as well as
the natural eye palette these were
patchy they were dry they'd looked gross
on the eyes and yeah I'm pretty darn
sure that I got it done because I've
seen so many reviews of this palette of
people saying it's so good so just be
aware of that when you are shopping for
this guy but yeah it does smell really
 good so anyway that is it guys
those are the best and the worst of Too
Faced scented palettes in my opinion
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
