going to be a review and swatches on the
Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate bar
palette I purchased this when it was
only available for vib Rouge which i
think was around Christmastime and I had
it mailed to my apartment in New York
but it did not get here until definitely
after Christmas and so I was gone if you
guys didn't know I was gone until about
two weeks ago I was gone for way over a
month so I do not actually get my hands
on this until about two weeks ago and I
must say I'm loving it I have been using
it so often I mean this thing is like
already like worn out can you see that I
mean I've been using this to death I
absolutely love it um I love the brand
Too Faced I think they make great
shadows I actually do not own the first
original chocolate bar palette and I
already ordered it because I know I need
it now that I have this I'm like how
come I never bought that what is wrong
with me so anyway um yeah let's just go
ahead and go through the swatches for
you guys and I'll tell you a little more
about the palette so we're gonna start
with this arm and we're gonna start with
that black color right there the first
color is called licorice and it's just
this really nice deep black color the
one next to it I hope it's showing up it
probably is because I'm pretty pale it's
called coconut cream it's a nice
highlight color um kind of like yellow
based really really beautiful the next
one is called nougat which is like a
almost pinky really really nice creamy
matte pinky Mavi like a sh t color it's
really really beautiful the next one is
truffled and after that is hot fudge the
next one is cocoa chili and that is that
one right there the one after that I
hope you guys can see is pink sugar and
the one after that is puddin next we
have this blue one right here which is a
blueberry swirl peanut butter and
frosting
and then we have let's see here rum
raisin mousse caramel bonbon and butter
pecan hopefully you guys can see all of
those that butter pecan one is kind of
light where is it out there but those
are all of the swatches I guess I will
talk about quick leave the shades I
don't like there are two in here
blueberry swirl and pink sugar are
really really lacking in pigmentation so
this one and that one really really
lacking in the pigmentation department
pink sugar feels like nothing on your
finger and it barely picks any color up
and blueberry swirl which I'm sure
everybody thought was really scary is
really not that scary so those are the
two that I'm just like they're not so
great but the thing is about this
palette is that it is so warm and
beautiful you have your choice of maths
shimmers and they all have the same
pigmentation and the same feeling and
texture they're all so so creamy and
easy to use one of my favorite things
about Too Faced palettes is that they
put these two big blocks even in their
little like shadow boxes big blocks of
like highlighting colors that butter
pecan and the coconut cream is just I
mean they're amazing for highlighting
I'm really really just impressed so I
can't really use the butter pecan so
much as a highlight it's a little
yellowy but the coconut cream on that
one is gorgeous and I just palette you
guys it's so good now I can't really
give you a comparison to the other one
that chocolate bar the original because
like I said I don't have it yes I did
order it because I love this one so much
and I'm such a supporter of tea I just
love to face so I can't believe I never
got that one but um I think these are
just gorgeous gorgeous shades these are
actually very very warm they look kind
of cool like you look at them and you're
like hmm that's a cool tones palette no
it's a very warm toned palette and it's
wonderful some of my favorite colors I'm
wearing moves today just in my crease
really really quick I take coconut cream
put it from my lid all the way up to the
brow and then I put loose in my crease
which is a really nice soft matte Brown
and caramel is beautiful caramel and
bonbon almost look similar
let's see caramel and bonbon but caramel
or I'm sorry bonbon has that more pinky
tone whereas caramel is almost like that
true gold orange II shade the color
peanut butter in here this one Oh
gorgeous it's like the perfect
transition color it's awesome yeah I
love every single color in here except
for the pink sugar and blueberry swirl
those are the ones that are kind of
disappointing licorice which is that
matte black it's not so much that it's
disappointing it's just that ever since
I got makeup geek corrupt um it's just
like that one looks like you like
actually compared to it I don't know
makeup geek corrupt is like super black
so maybe it's just me but every other
like color in here is just amazing the
texture everything I highly highly
recommend this one I know a lot of
people were saying it looks like it's
cool tones and I know I already mention
this but it really is warm tones like
you can see those are warm colors not
all of these are cool so um I don't know
I highly recommend this you get 16
gorgeous gorgeous shades and yeah here
they are up close and here are the
swatches again
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I'm really enjoying this palette I'm
grabbing it almost on a daily basis I've
only had this for two weeks and you can
kind of see it's been like it's gonna be
demolished in like a month um so anyway
I highly highly recommend this Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette um it
smells amazing - yes it does smell like
chocolate delicious everything about it
is just like wonderful like this maybe
this is up there or with one of my
favorite palettes which is the Too Faced
return of sexy this is up there with it
I mean I think Too Faced just makes
great palette so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I'll see you in my next
one five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
