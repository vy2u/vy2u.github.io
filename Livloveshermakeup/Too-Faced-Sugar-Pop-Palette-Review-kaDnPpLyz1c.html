review for you guys tonight this time it
is going to be on the new two-faced
sugar pop eyeshadow palette this is the
cutest little box that it comes in
little macaroons on the front it says
this is a sugary sweet eyeshadow
collection three steps three looks three
minutes so let me show you what the
actual palette looks like it's tin just
like there are other little shadow boxes
like that although I guess they're not
shadow box is sending more their shadow
tins so it looks like that and it is a
magnetic closure and you open it up and
this is what it looks like on the inside
and I know it's adorable it's so cute
these are the shades you get as you can
see they all have corresponding sugary
sweet names like rock candy strawberry
ice peach fuzz macaroon malted milk ball
sugar violent blackberry bubblegum and
blue raspberry I am wearing a few these
shadows on my eyes today I am wearing
rock candy all over I love it it's got a
little bit of sparkle to it and it just
kind of lights up the eye area i put a
little underneath my eyes as well but
just like a nice fluffy e-40 brush um
and then I have strawberry ice all the
way on my lid like all over my lid a
little bit of macaroon on that warmness
that you guys can see there I have that
kind of on the outer half of my eye and
then I worked blackberry into my crease
I have a little bit of blackberry in
macaroon underneath on my lower lash
line as well I love this palette you
guys know I love to face I'm extremely
obsessed with their little shadow boxes
or shadow tins that come like this I
have a lot of them and I really really
love them I love the formula that they
use to make these shadow boxes or shadow
tins so basically the thought would this
one is that it's like really nice spring
summary colors but also this little
pamphlet you know toothpaste always does
that I have something that pops out here
and it shows you different looks that
you can create but this one's a little
different because it says that you can
create three looks in three minutes you
also get a mirror there when you do take
the little pamphlet out so basically
this is so cute to see there oh so it's
like a little letter you just untuk it
and it says indulge your sweet tooth XOX
so it shows three different looks on the
back but the thought that you could do
these in the three minutes it's kind of
like I don't know if you could do them
three minute so I kind of disagree with
that but they give you three looks the
first one is sweet and spicy the second
one is sugar plums and the third one is
candy coated and this is what they're
supposed to look like I don't let off
the top one but i love the bottom one
and the middle one especially this on
this is so beautiful so I could
definitely see myself trying to recreate
these looks if it really does take three
minutes that's amazing I don't think so
because it takes a lot of time blending
things out we all know that so um but I
do like having the little pamphlet for
like ideas on Oh what do I want to do
today with this little shadow box so I
do like that to face does that with all
of their palates I will keep that in
there um the mirror like they used to
have bigger mirrors but now that they
slip these little things in right there
um I guess that the mirrors are smaller
but overall it's just a really nice
little compact a compact little pellet
so basically i think the testers are
amazing if you've tried any of the
palettes that look like this from to
face you'll know that they have really
really creamy textures even if they're
like no matter if they're match if
they're shimmery if they have glitter in
them they usually have a really nice
texture the only one I wasn't sure about
it first with this one right up here
which is called malted milk ball at
first it seemed really chunky and
glittery but the more like I worked into
it um you know how sometimes like I
shadows have like a coating on the top
of them and they feel a little rough but
once you get beneath that surface it's
creamier that's basically what happened
with this one this one now is really
creamy that I've worked my way into
there but that is a swatch of that on my
finger and then blackberry is one of my
favorite shades in here I love that
color isn't that beautiful that's what I
have in my crease today blue raspberries
also beautiful is just like the
pigmentation is ridiculous and beautiful
and perfect so um I I'm just really
really impressed um like I said I am
weighing on my eyes today I think
two-faced it's really hard for them to
do wrong when it comes to these little
like boxed shadows that they do so a
and that is a look at the palette I
think it's just beautiful this shade
right here too is one of my favorites
look how beautiful that is like a nice
light like lilac color love it so I
really love everything in here I think
peach fuzz it's going to be great for
like a transition color yeah like just
to start with like to work into your
crease this will be a really nice
transition color I basically played with
all of them except for that one so I'm
really impressed I love it I think it's
totally worth it for thirty-six dollars
this is like almost on the lower end
spectrum of pallets nowadays so it's
really great that two-faced have kept
that price um and yeah so you can't pick
this up with Sephora I'm kind of
surprised I picked mine up on the
toothpaste website for thirty-six
dollars all of the little box ones are
thirty-six dollars I'm pretty sure this
is a limited edition one they kind of
come out with new limited edition ones
for the summertime but you can pick it
up on Alta I don't know if it's going to
be an awful exclusive or if so far is
going to start selling it but I picked
mine up on the toothpaste website i will
link below where you guys can get it but
i want to read a few things for you guys
on the alta website first it says the
sugar pop I collection thirty-six
dollars give I some sugar with
toothpaste colorful palette of nine
deliciously enticing shimmer and glitter
shadows in vanilla chocolate and candy
inspired Hughes that allow limitless
irresistible sweet looks for eyes that
sparkle and pop rich pigments exclusive
true color pure pigment I shadows off a
rich color payoff totally true and it
says blendable luxurious silky smooth
formula blends effortlessly for an
airbrushed look step-by-step
instructions includes to face signature
glamour guide with three looks to get
you started so um it's pretty
self-explanatory this is just kind of
like their summer palette that they came
out with and I think it's beautiful I
love it um I think there's so many
different looks you can create with this
like I said I really like that they have
these like you know really summery
shades like bubblegum blue raspberry
macaroon but then they go and they do
blackberry and strawberry ice which are
almost like muted lilac you know kind of
towns I think that's so beautiful so I'm
really really impressed so happy I got
this and I will link below or you guys
can pick this up for yourselves I'll see
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
