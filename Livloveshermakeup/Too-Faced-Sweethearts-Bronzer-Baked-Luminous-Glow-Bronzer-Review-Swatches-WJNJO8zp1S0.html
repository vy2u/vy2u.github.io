this video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer this is a baked
luminous glow bronzer in the shade sweet
tea and I purchased this on the Too
Faced calm website for $30 it's
beautiful turquoise packaging with like
a little like gold seal here are really
really cute packaging and I will link
below where you guys can pick this
product up as well if you are interested
and yeah the actual packaging looks like
this which is too cute it is in the same
packaging as the Too Faced sweetheart
blushes I have one right here called
there something about berry and I want
to say right away the formulation and
the packaging is the exact same on the
bronzer so they only have one option
right now or one shade for the bronzer
which is called sweet tea I hope they
come out with a darker one honestly
because this is a very very light
luminous bronzer
I personally am loving it on my skintone
I am wearing it today I have it on you
know the outer perimeters of my face not
really too contour because this has like
a glow and shimmer in it and also it's a
little on the warm side but I like to
just like bronze up my face it looks so
nice and I think if you have fair skin
you're gonna love this so this is what
it actually looks like it is a little
dusty and a little powdery because it is
baked but you get one side that's kind
of like a highlight honestly it looks
lighter in the pan than when you swatch
it out it looks a little darker when you
swatch it out it's more of a bronzey
shade than the highlight that a true
highlight and then on the other side you
get a darker shade and so you have the
option of basically going into either
shade or mixing them together I
personally like to mix them together and
then I just apply with like a fluffy
brush like this like the elf kabuki one
or anything that is big and fluffy that
will just dust it all over my face I'm
absolutely loving the formulation on
this it's really buttery and smooth I
actually think the formulation is a tad
better than the Sweethearts baked
blushes in my opinion it just feels a
little creamier a little premiere and a
little smoother than these ones in my
opinion I mean I don't know if I'm just
like completely crazy but yeah when I
put my finger in there I feel like the
bronzer just feels a lot smoother so I
don't really know what that's all about
but they have the same sort of
pigmentation I'm
don't feel like these are super super
heavily pigmented they're not supposed
to be like that honestly they're just
supposed to give a beautiful flush of
color to your skin and kind of make your
skin look radiant and luminous and I
feel like this bronzer definitely does
that so I'm really really happy with it
the wear time is pretty darn good it's
not as good as like the two-phase
16-hour blushes by any means but it is
really really quite good if you wear a
primer and you put a setting spray on I
feel like this can last a good 8 to 12
hours on your face and I just think it's
a beautiful color it does pull a little
more of a warm tone than a dark like
cool tone so that's something to be
aware of and also I feel like if you do
have darker skin like medium to deep tan
dark skin I feel like this is not going
to show up that well on you I am
obviously quite fair and that's why I
really like it because I feel like it
does give a luminous glow to my skin but
for the most part I feel like it's
definitely not a shade that's going to
work for everyone this is what it looks
like when I swatch it out so I can show
you guys and I will go ahead and mix it
on the back of my hand so you can see it
just gives a beautiful flush of like
radiant glow eNOS I just love it I think
it's absolutely beautiful and let me
show you what the two of them look like
if you want to use them separately so
you have the lighter shade here and then
the darker shade here and this is what
they look like so you can use them
separately there is the lighter shade on
the bottom and then the darker shade on
the top but I personally like to blend
them together and I feel like they blend
so easily as you can see I just blended
those together really really quickly and
nicely and I just love that golden sheen
that it leaves on my cheeks that makes
me feel very beachy so I really really
love this little bronzer I think it is
great especially if you are fair
complected like I am and yeah like I
said I'll leave a link below if you
would like to pick it up I really don't
have anything else to say I think the
wear time is strong I think the
pigmentation is okay it's not supposed
to be super super overly pigmented and I
know that because I have you know I have
tried out the blushes before but I feel
like the pigmentation is good it's just
a soft luminous look to the skin and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this little
review and swatches thank you for
joining me and I will see you tomorrow
