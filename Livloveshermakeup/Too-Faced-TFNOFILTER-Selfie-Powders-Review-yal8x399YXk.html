hope you all are doing well I'm going to
do a review for you guys on the news
Too Faced no filter selfie powders they
come in a little box like this super
super cute and the packaging looks like
this so kind of like the box
super super sleek really really easy to
carry super light love it I think that's
a really cute little cover too
anyway the point of these this was weird
I purchased mine for $36 on the Sephora
website by the way I will link
everything below so you guys can find it
when I first saw this on the support
website I was like what is that like
these colors look so weird like can you
actually apply those to your face or
will you actually have a yellow face
purple face like I was just I did not
get it um right away after I read a
review on there people say that they're
nice and sheer and really buttery I was
like okay I'm gonna have to try it so
basically the point of these are that
they are a light filtering photo
enhancing powder so each one it gives
you a different a difference like filter
so as you guys can see it you do get a
little mirror and then there's these
cute little I don't know if you guys can
see a little dog photo so that's the
normal one and then this one is sunrise
which is this color here and it's
supposed to get a brightening diffused
warmth totally toasted which is this one
right here is a bronzed smoothing glow
and then this purple one right here
where you can see that the doggy looks a
little more cool toned is called cool
ethereal light and that's Moon River I
am wearing Boone River all over today
and you guys I love it I love Moon River
um I think all of them are really really
nice totally toasted it tends to look a
little dark on my skin
on my personal skin tone but um Moon
River is awesome these just give oh my
god and by the way they are so buttery
the texture so right there you can see
Moon River totally toasted right there
and then summarize right there sorry if
my hands look really red I just did a
video with swatches so um as you can see
these have like a really really
beautiful balance like light to them
like they just look like they're light
reflecting which is why I think they
look so B
on the skin almost like airbrushed and
I'm just like I think they're so
beautiful as you guys can see like
they're swatching on my hand you can
barely see a few of them but you can
kind of see the sunrise one right there
kind of a little bit of a cool-toned
right there which is Moon River and then
the bronze one so I actually really like
these I think the concept at first was
just weird to me because I was like I
don't understand like what I don't
understand I just don't understand how
you can put those on your skin without
it looking like you actually put that
color on but it really gives like a nice
diffused light it's almost like the
hourglass ambient lighting powders I'm
going to say so anyway um like I said
you get those three colors the texture
is buttery buttery smooth and creamy and
rangs me of like the chocolate bar eye
shadows and let's see can I read a few
things to you guys on the back on the
back of the box again it shows you the
three like filters you can use in the
dog again modeling all three and it says
here I'm Safi powders are your filters
for the real world our collection of
weightless undetectable finishing
powders mimic the effects of your
favorite photo filters by using light
fragmenting technology to instantly
brighten with diffused warmth so right
away something I didn't mention yet is
that these are not like setting powders
you know these are like they say
finishing powders you want to take a
really nice light fluffy brush and run
it over your face after you're done
putting on your foundation after you're
done setting your foundation this is
like the last thing you want to put on
basically so many continue reading um it
says to instantly brighten with diffused
warmth the bronze with a smoothing glow
or add a cool ethereal light to the skin
get closed up perfection and photos and
look filter flawless in real life it
says yeah so basically that's what it
says on the back of the box
I'm gonna read for you guys a little
more on what it says on this before
website I have it pulled up over here
like I said it was $36 and it says a
palette with three lightweight finishing
face powders that mimic the effects of
photo filters by using light fragmenting
technology to brighten bronze and
illuminate the skin go filter flawless
wherever you go with these portable wait
lists finishing powders each one
instantly brightens up your face
sunrise provides a diffused warmth
totally toasted
bronzes with a smoothing glow and Moon
River brings a soft ethereal glow to the
skin formulated with a liquid plush
technology they're a unique powder cream
hybrid powder that are seamlessly that
are seamless to apply and leave the
velvety texture of a cream for a
flawless appearance get photo ready when
you wear this powder alone or blend
together for a customized photo filter
finish and it says it is formulated
without parabens sulfates and yeah so
that's basically all the information it
gets on the website I think it's helpful
to go into your research first so that
you understand these are not like
setting powders they are just enhancing
powders you apply them after you're done
with everything and you get just
beautiful results I just think Moon
River is my favorite I love this it
really gives a beautiful ethereal glow
to the skin so I hope you guys enjoyed
this little review on the new Too Faced
no filter selfie powders I'm really
really happy with them I love them so
far I think it's so cool I love that
hourglass came out with the ambient
lighting powers and now two-face has
kind of gone on that route because they
can be used for multi-dimensional things
you can use them strictly you can use
all three colors like you can use the
bronze one on your cheek you can use the
yellow one underneath your eye for like
just brightening up the darkness and
then you can use the cool ethereal light
the moon river' all over your face you
can really do whatever you want with
them and I think they're beautiful so I
hope you guys enjoyed this I'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
