have another review for you guys today
this one is going to be on the new to
face the little black book of bronzers
this is like it comes in this little box
really really cute and then the actual
packaging looks like this it's like this
really sleek little palette and you open
it up and here you have like this little
like animation of I don't know bronze or
wardrobe thing it's super cute and then
you get all of these browsers right here
it's so amazing so basically two-face
took all of their current bronzers and
put them into this one little palette I
purchased mine on the actual two-face
website from $49 but you can also get it
on the ulta.com website or in-store it's
also $49 there they do not sell this at
Sephora I don't know if they're going to
uh they just currently don't but like I
said it's $49 and you can get it on the
two-face website or the AL TOCOM website
I will link both below so you guys can
pick it up and basically I'm just like I
love this I love the thought of this I
think right now brands are so so
obsessed with contouring and
highlighting that everybody has kind of
forgotten that it's getting warmer
spring is around the corner and that we
all like to have a little bronzer in our
life some warm colors not that like topi
contour you know and I think two-face
really thought of this well when they
thought you know what let's just take
all our bronzers and put it into one
little kit like this into one level you
know palette like set and I think it's
just like an awesome way to do it so
basically in here you get the milk
chocolate Soleil which I am wearing
today to warm up on my cheeks I love it
it's just so nice and light it's
probably the lightest color and here it
is completely matte and yes it smells
like chocolate um I love it I do I just
I'm not like contouring or anything
today I just have it warmed up on my
cheeks I think gives such a nice blow
especially if you are very fair like I
am next to that one you get chocolate
Soleil which is basically the same exact
thing except just a little deeper and
then you get snow bunny which is like a
really really shimmery um like kind of
glow product like I'm sure some people
could probably use this as a
i light it's just really really nice and
golden you basically swirl all the
colors together I'm sorry if these look
a little bit muddy because I did swirl
them around already you know I've been
using them but basically you get like a
little light highlight strip a really
dark strip a pink strip and then kind of
am more like bronzy strip and then when
you mix them together you get that
golden color right there I think it's
really really beautiful I think this is
like highlight territory for a lot of
skin tones maybe not for my skin tone
cuz I am very fair but for a lot of skin
tones that would be beautiful highlight
and then you get to the dark chocolate
Soleil bronzer which I believe is new
this is a really really nice deep one if
you can see up here this is the original
chocolate Soleil this one is almost a
little more like contouring looking to
me because it's got those taupe
undertones whereas the dark chocolate
Soleil is kind of like a really really
chocolatey has some nice warm undertones
and then you get pink leopard and this
one has like some pinks some highlights
some deep colors and you mix them all up
like this it looks so pretty before I
use them I'm sorry guys but basically
that's what it looks like and this is
dark like this is really really dark
especially for someone with my skin tone
so I'll have to use that carefully if I
am going to use it I guess you could
possibly contour with it but it does
have a little shimmer so I would kind of
advise against it but I just love that
Too Faced did this palette because it's
catering to every single skin tone so I
do like that though and then you get
beach bunny and basically that's like a
dark a medium a lighter like four
different strips mixed together and that
one is also shimmery and then you get as
a summer which is matte and that one's
really nice too it kind of reminds me of
the chocolate Soleil then you get some
bunny which is like a dual dual kind of
shimmery bronzer and you get a lighter
shade on one side and a dark brown the
other you could use both separately or
you can mix them together and get a
really nice color like that and then you
get back to the milk chocolate Soleil on
the top so I
really loving this like I said I really
reach for I'm sorry runny nose today I
really reach for milk chocolate Soleil
because it really caters well to my skin
tone personally but I also really love
snow bunny
I do like pink leopard I mean if I'm
really gonna go ahead and like really
want to bronze up my skin I think that
that one looks beautiful and and the
summer is gorgeous I just I love this I
love this you guys know I love the brand
Too Faced in general but I think this is
just an awesome little palette I'm a
little um I'm not really happy that it
doesn't have a mirror I kind of wish
they haven't done this little cartoon
thing here and just put in like a huge
mirror that would be awesome if it was
like the size of this but this is really
cute it just has like little um like
they talked about which days you can you
know where which like on Mondays
chocolate and milk Soleil I'm Tuesday
snow bunny things like that and also I
just want to add they have like little
things underneath these colors that kind
of tell what they are I'll go through
those quickly milk chocolate Soleil is a
light to medium matte chocolate Soleil
is a medium / deep matte snow bunny is a
luminous dark chocolate Soleil is a deep
/ tan matte pink leopard is a blushing
illuminator color then they have beach
bunny which is a custom blended like
molding color so you can kind of pick
what you want which colors you want or
you can mix it together like I did and
this summer is a 16 hour long wear one
and then Sun bunny is a natural so um I
just love I just love that they did this
I think more brands need to come out
with this like I mean I know a lot of
brands are coming out with like the top
products from their line like in a kit
right now but I really think that having
a palette like this that's like all of
our bronzers or all of our blushes in
one palette is so awesome because Too
Faced is really known for those Soleil
bronzers and I mean it's just really
really great and like i said i think
that product i mean companies are really
really hung up right now on contour
products and highlighting but people are
forgetting that you know
the warmer months are coming and it's
nice to have some bronzers in your life
so let me read a little bit what it says
on the auto website for you guys
it says the little black book of
bronzers $49 it says the little black
book of bronzers is a coveted collection
of Too Faced eight unique iconic
bronzers including their new dark
chocolate Soleil they created this
ultimate bronzing wardrobe to give you a
bronzer for every outfit mood and moment
this limited edition collection is a
hand illustrated and features an
exclusive bronzer story for every moment
of the day of the week so I guess that
that's kind of what liked a little comic
thing was on the inner flap so I guess
that's kind of cute um and it says Too
Faced has that the largest and best
bronzing assortment even in the business
they utilize the most advanced
technology to create beautiful natural
looking and good-for-you bronzers and
every finish for every season and any
occasion so I totally agree with that I
think Too Faced is known for their
bronzers if you're gonna purchase a
bronzer go ahead and get one from Too
Faced go ahead and pick up this palette
and get a sample of every single one
that they have so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this review I will of course
link below where you guys can pick this
product up and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
