video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new to face and
nikkietutorials the power of makeup kit
I purchased this for 56 dollars on the
Sephora comm website a few days ago it
released first on Ulta calm and then on
the Too Faced website and also Sephora I
personally purchased mine from Sephora
just because I prefer the point perks
and a Soto shipping is faster for me
since ima the IB Rouge member but this
is a $56 kit it is a two hundred and
nine dollar value so you're getting some
really cool stuff in here it is a
limited edition so if you do want to get
your hands on this after I review it
then I recommend going ahead and doing
it right away
I will link down below in the
description bar where you guys can pick
it up from Ulta or Too Faced it is
currently sold out on the Sephora combo
say right now but let me go ahead and
tell you guys a little bit about what is
in here so this is a limited edition
makeup collection handpicked by
nikkietutorials herself
it says Too Faced teamed up with global
Beauty megastar nikkietutorials to
create this limited-edition collection
that celebrates the transformative power
of makeup and I just wanted to say we
all have seen those power of makeup
videos and nikkietutorials started that
and I just like I got that video is very
like inspirational and has a really nice
good message to it and I just wanted to
say I thought it was really cute that
they kind of put together this kit based
on that her exclusive collection
features everything you need to create
endless looks including 9 all new
eyeshadows a deluxe the better than sex
mascara in an exclusive purple shade and
Nikki's go-to highlighter shade in
champagne truffle for that perfect glow
and now if you guys have any of the
chocolate bar palettes you know that
that truffle shade is actually a eyes
shadow so she uses that in this palette
as an actual highlight I will get into
that in a little bit because I really
just feel like they should have done a
real highlighter because she is like the
queen of glow and I feel like this does
not speak very highly of her like this
particular shadow but anyway I'll get
into that in a second umm but anyway
this set contains nine is zero point
zero four ounces of eyeshadows in the
shades painkiller frosted YUM
sugar-coated wham-bam makeup and chill
Ivy wanted mystic hour and irresistible
you are getting to 0.36 ounces of the
love flush 16 hour blushes and I will
always love you and justify my love and
have been watching me for a while guys
you know that I have a full-size of all
of those love flowers blushes I am
obsessed with those those are my
all-time favorites blush formulations so
I was very excited to get my hands on
this kit because of those as well you're
also getting 0.11 ounces of the
highlighter in champagne truffle which
again is that eyeshadow shade that they
kind of reformulated into a highlighter
you are getting 0.11 ounces of chocolate
soleil bronzer which is a nice bronzer
from Too Faced I do have it in a
full-size and I also have it in the
little black book of bronzers which is
just a little black book of bronzers
from Too Faced is a really nice little
collection there you're also getting
whiskey here 0.035 ounces of glamour
dust or I guess you could call it a
loose pigment in the shades literally
you're also getting 0.17 ounces of the
shadow insurance 24-hour eyeshadow
primer you're getting 0.17 ounces of the
better than sex mascara in a purple
shade which is new and exclusive and you
are also getting a 0.0 15 ounce sketch
marker liquid art eyeliner in a deep
black shade and there's a really cute
quote down here and I can totally see
nikkietutorials saying it she says when
life gives you lemons punch it in the
face and asked for glitter so anyway
super super cute the outer packaging
looks like this it's a beautiful
beautiful box I love this print
I'm all about this print I love anything
leopard print and also just zebra print
so I'm all about this I know a few
people were saying that they didn't
really like this they thought it was
kind of childish I personally thought
the last palette that Too Faced released
with all the stickers and stuff was a
lot more childish than this I actually
think this is really really cute and
totally up nikkietutorials
Ally I really think that this particular
kid does speak to her on a lot of
different levels now I am personally
going to be returning this I'm going to
go a little more into depth about it I
just feel like this wasn't a good fit
for me personally there's some items in
here that I just wouldn't reach for I'm
not that in love with the highlighter I
feel like there's some hits and misses
when it comes to the formulation on the
eyeshadow so I just want to say really
quickly it's not the against
nikkietutorials or Too Faced like I said
two-face is my favorite high-end brand
and nikkietutorials is
amazing amazing makeup artist she's
amazing her artistry skills are off the
 chain okay excuse my language
but you know surely I mean it has
nothing to do with her I just wanted to
give you guys a really nice honest um
review on these because I know a lot of
people were sent to these for PR and I
do think it is hard when you are friends
with someone to give a very very honest
decent review but I also think everybody
is different some people like certain
things some people like other things and
yeah this is just my honest opinion so
love the packaging love the prints
everything leopard print you open it up
and you get this little bag here and it
is like resealable and it is filled with
like the glitter and the mascara the
eyeliner this is what the eyeliner looks
like it says two-faced sketch marker
you're so two-faced and it is in the
liquid black color I believe this is a
full size these Sketch markers are
relatively new to the Too Faced brand
and it has a beautiful very very precise
little point now people watching my
channel for a while you know I am NOT
nikkietutorials um I you know I'm not a
makeup artist or anything like that I'm
a musician that's my job and I just I I
can't do winged eyeliner for I
can't even do really upper eyeliner so
when I saw that this was in the kit and
it was a full size I was like damn it I
was really really hoping that they would
make the mascara full size because that
would be a little more easy for me to
work with but I do think this is very
precise and beautiful it's a very
jet-black inky dark color so if you're
into that I definitely think you would
enjoy this so not too much to say on
that the next item we have here is a
deluxe a sample of the Too Faced better
than sex mascara in the purple shade now
I am wearing this today and it's a lot
more wearable than you would think
I am someone who just wouldn't really
wear purple or blue or colorful mascara
on a day-to-day basis I just love my
black mascara I'm all about that life
like that is my favorite thing however I
will say this is actually extremely
extremely wearable like I said I have a
layer of it on my lashes today and and
although it although I do think that the
formulation is a little different than
the original Too Faced better than sex
mascara which is one of my all-time
favorite mascaras I do still think this
is relatively good with this particular
mascara I noticed that I get a lot more
volume and a lot more length this one I
just feel like doesn't really build on
my lashes as nicely as the original one
or the black formulation now they claim
that this is the exact same formulation
um I just wanted to let you guys know I
kind of feel like it's not and I don't
know if it's because the color is
changed I do notice that I get flaking
with both of these little bits of dried
mascara underneath my eyes and also up
here at near my brow but for the most
part I would say that these are slightly
different I feel like I get a lot more
volume and length with the original
mascara maybe that's just because of the
color but this is still relatively good
and the actual shade really is quite
wearable I'm gonna go ahead and do a
little swatch II here for you guys so
there is the color very much like
nikkietutorials asked she wears a lot of
purple like her signature you know kind
of purple look so I could see why she
wanted to pick that out and I think it's
cool because this is something that you
can only get in this particular kit um
the actual wand is the exact same as the
Too Faced better than sex mascara that
is what it looks like kind of like a
medieval torture device it is not a
rubber bristle wand it is actually just
a natural like fiber so it's a good one
I do think this is a decent mascara but
I still do prefer the original
formulation the next item that you get
in this little bag is the Too Faced
shadow insurance this is a 24-hour
eyeshadow primer this is a really nice
eyes shadow primer this is the same
exact formulation is the full size tube
that I have if you do have very very
oily eyelids I think you would
absolutely love this it's a really
really good one because it comes out in
like this really nice nude consistency
or new color nude consistency nude color
but the consistency is actually like it
dries down pretty fast but it's not
sticky so it's not too sticky it's not
too tacky dries down really really
quickly I do feel like it helps for
these shadows to adhere to your eyes
better I am filming this later in the
day I went to work today and I have all
my makeup on I have not touched up
anything and I feel like my eyeshadows
look relatively good although I'm not in
love with all of the eyeshadows in this
palette I don't feel like they're
creasing or moving around anywhere so I
do think that that eye shadow primer
works and it's always nice when Too
Faced does give you a little sample size
of that and then the little final item
that we have in here is this little
glitter now I haven't really worked too
much with this I did try and foil it on
my eyelid yesterday and then today I
tried to do that again I will say this
is messy it's just one of those things
with loose pigments if you're not really
into them you're not really into them
and I'm just not really into
it is very much a loose pigment it's a
beautiful kind of silvery color Oh God
has to be so hard to show you guys
without tipping it but it's a beautiful
silvery color it's got like rainbow
reflex in it I am definitely gonna go
ahead and swatch it for you guys right
now but it's nice it actually feels
quite like a micro-fine which I really
do enjoy however like once you actually
get it on your lid it just goes
everywhere I'm sorry I keep swearing
guys I apologize but it really does go
everywhere and I just feel like it's all
over the place so um I'm not the hugest
fan of this the hugest fan the biggest
fan of this I just feel like it's very
very messy and like I said today I did
try to foil it and I tried to put it on
with a little bit of glitter glue as
well from Too Faced and I just felt like
this was going everywhere so I'm not a
huge fan of that so just from that like
I could see that half of the kit I
already didn't really enjoy because
again not really going to use the sketch
marker not in love with purple mascara
that's just kind of a preference thing
if you really do like colorful mascara
or not in the neck glitter shade I'm
just kind of like a little I won't
really use that so I think that that
kind of goes to show you guys the first
half of the kids I'm already not that in
love with so that is one of the reasons
why I'll be returning it now let's go
ahead and get into the main feature this
is what the actual palette looks like it
is extremely extremely like efficient
like this is great you are getting a
bronzer in here you're getting a
highlight you're getting eyeshadows and
you're getting blushes this is so well
packed they do have a faint smell of
vanilla or chocolate to them and it's
just absolutely beautiful I love this
one thing I do wish they had was a nice
little mirror here and this is slightly
flimsy I don't know if you guys can see
that it is made out of cardboard this
does Bend back all the way but I don't
know I feel like you could break that
spine pretty easily anyway again I love
the packaging think it's absolutely
adorable and this is just really
efficient and very travel friendly here
are what the eyeshadows look like as you
guys can see there are nine different
shades here you are getting two mattes
in here and then I would say the rest of
them some of them are a little softer
and they have more of like a luster kind
of formulation to them and then the rest
of them are kind of glittery and chunky
now I will say that was something that I
just wasn't really expecting when I was
looking at the actual pictures online I
really was hoping these would be like
foiled and then they would have a few
matte shades the mass shades in here
painkiller and makeup in shale are
absolutely the standout
I do have painkiller in my transition
today I have make up and chill in my
crease and then I put IV all over my lid
I did go in with frosted YUM on the
inner corner and not the inner corner my
lower lashline the first third and then
I took mystic hour which is that
beautiful kind of bluish greenish color
and I put that on the outer part of my
lower lashline I do like the way that it
came out I will say and very impressed
with the fact that these don't have that
much fallout they don't have that much
kick up even though they are kind of
like glittery but they're very very
firmly pressed and I will say I notice
the same thing with the blushes and also
with the highlight and the bronzer
everything is very firmly pressed so you
need to be careful excuse me you need to
be careful when you you go in there to
make sure that you're not getting hard
pan from the oils or like any sort of
wetness on your fingers because then
it's going to seal everything in and
you're not going to be able to work with
it so anyway overall I do like the color
selection I know a few people were
saying they looked at this palette and
they were kind of like that doesn't look
like anything special but I feel like it
does kind of seem like something that
Nikki would work with it's got a great
silver shade that nice gold shade the
purple and the blue are really beautiful
this shade down here I do not like it is
a matte but it is very very kind of
chalky and it's hard to blend that so
that's probably my biggest issue with
these again I'm not making tutorials I'm
not a professional makeup artist I don't
like to spend hours and hours and hours
blending out my eyeshadow and one of the
reasons why I love the Too Faced brand
so much is because for the most part
their eyeshadows are so easy to blend
out their chocolate bar palette easy to
blend like they're 9pn palettes easy to
blend so I was really hoping that the
formulation on these eyeshadows would be
very very similar to what I'm used to
seeing from them unfortunately I really
only liked those two shades right there
which are painkiller and makeup and
chill those are very very easy to blend
and very buttery but the rest of them I
feel like I just have to put that extra
work into so not saying that they're bad
quality I just feel like um a lot of
them are packed very very heavily with
glitter um that wanted sheet is very
very firmly pressed and weird I'm going
to get a little bit of hard pan and I
just wish they were a little smoother
easier to blend in a little but more a
buddy
buttery buttery yeah buttery alright
guys but let's go ahead and swatch those
eyeshadows the
first aid we have here is IV which is a
matte white this is what it looks like
and have a little bit of a cool your
word essence to it it may not look like
it but it does I'm going to swatch it
right here there's still a little bit of
glitter I can't get off from this hand
but there is the shade ivy it's just a
beautiful beautiful matte transition
color I'm not transition color you guys
know what I mean like all over kind of
lid color really really like that one it
is a good one the next one we have here
is called sugar coated sugar coat it
kind of reminds me of that what is that
that one shade in the chocolate bar
palette pink sugar that's literally just
like a glitter really really firmly
packed this is just one of those shades
where no matter how much like how
lightly you dip your finger or how like
much you really really dig in there
you're going to get like chunks and
chunks of product so here it is swatch I
don't feel like this swatches very well
there it is it's still a beautiful
beautiful shade kind of like a cool
iridescent pink but as you guys can see
there is some glitter going on there and
it does blend out relatively nicely but
I do kind of have to really kind of push
at it if that makes sense
the next shade we have is frosted YUM
which is that beautiful kind of silvery
color this one is quite nice it is a
little more firmly packed kind of like
the shade irresistible as well and it's
just got a little bit of glitter it's
not you look at it and you would think
that it's like I don't know to me when I
look at it I think it looks like it's
foiled but it's kind of not it's still
pigmented don't get me wrong I think
that all of these are beautifully
pigmented but just with one swipe here
is what the swatch looks like there
definitely is a little bit of kick up
and as you can see there are definitely
some little particles there that are
slightly chunky now when you actually
blend it out my biggest issue is when
you have a glitter eyeshadow like this
you start to get patchiness so here it
is completely blended out it is very
pretty very very shiny but again just a
little rough to the touch and also in my
opinion just a little a little patchy
which I am not a fan of and then we have
irresistible irresistible is pretty much
at the same exact formulation as frosted
YUM except it is a gold shade so this is
what it looks like I'll go ahead and
swatch that one and I have this on my
lid today and I do think that this one
is very very pretty again when you do
start to blend it out you start to
notice a little more
of the patchiness but if you want to
foil it and put it on your lid I do
think it is quite a pretty color I have
a lot of gold's like that so it's not
something that I like absolutely insane
over or like oh my god I love it so much
but it's still relatively good and then
we have my two favorites which are
painkiller and make up in chill
painkiller is the perfect perfect
transition color like this is so soft
and buttery and creamy and beautiful and
it just swatches so so so nicely there
is painkiller beautiful transition has a
nice neutral undertone it's not too warm
it's not too cool and then we have
makeup and chill which is a beautiful
kind of warm brown which I also really
really really love and again actually
it's kind of more neutral it's not too
cool and it's not too warm but there
they are together really really love
those two shades love the formulation on
those and those are the kind of matte
shades that I think when I think of Too
Faced I automatically just think of
those because they're so creamy and
buttery and that's the kind of
formulation I've used to the next word
we have is mystic our wham-bam and
wanted mystic our is quite nice it's a
little more foiled and I do feel like
this one swatch is really beautifully do
you guys see that that color is amazing
so here is mystic hour right Yes mystic
hour see there we go that's what I
wanted all the other glitter shades to
look like I was hoping they would be
foiled like this so I think that one is
absolutely beautiful then we have wham
bam I wish Rambam was more like mystic
hour but it definitely has a little more
grit to it and it just doesn't go on to
the lid as nicely and it doesn't feel as
soft here it is up close can you guys
see the little it started to ball up
already so there it is I'm not too bad
you know like not too bad when you put
it swatched onto your finger now your
finger does pick up a lot more product
and then a brush would and I notice I
tried to work this into my crease
yesterday it was just it was flying
everywhere I was flying everywhere guy
there was just everywhere and I just
couldn't really deal with it so I didn't
really enjoy that but it does blend out
nicely if you really really kind of try
so there it is blended out and then the
last shade that we have as far as
eyeshadows are concerned is the shade
wanted which I said is kind of like that
matte deep dark almost black color I
would say it's just a hair lighter than
now this one I wish it felt like
painkiller and make up and chill it is
very very pigmented which i think is
great but this one is almost like near
impossible to blend out I have no idea
why but it's just very very hard to
blend so there it is a very very
pigmented looks pretty darn good but
it's just it's a hassle to blend out so
anyway as far as the eye shadows are
concerned I would say my favourites are
definitely makeup and chilled painkiller
IV and maybe mystic hour but those are
really only half of them but I'm really
like getting a kick out of you know what
I mean so the other ones are just kind
of chunky and glittery and not my
favorite to work with so I feel like
when you only like half of something
maybe you want to think about returning
it which is what I'm doing
let's go ahead and get into the blushes
the first thing that i swatched actually
when I got this palette were the two
blushes because I was like are they the
same are they the same as the other ones
and they are the same exact formulation
as these sixteen our blushes which I'm
happy to say because those are my
absolute favorites I will say the shade
right here I will always love you which
is more of like a peachy color this
definitely definitely to me seems a
little darker in the pan than the
original one and I will swatch them
side-by-side for you guys so you can see
what I'm talking about I don't know why
but I just feel like it looks slightly
darker I could be completely wrong and
maybe it's not something that's going to
show up on camera but it just seems like
it has a little more of a peachy color
or tone going on to it so there are the
two of them swatch together so here is
the shade I will always love you from
the palette here is it's in single form
almost more pigmented and just a little
deeper and tone so that's not something
I really mind I think that's awesome and
then we also have I will always love you
which is that beautiful kind of cool
toned pink color and this is what it
looks like and this one is identical to
the full-size absolutely identical it's
got a little bit of a nice length I
would say Silbert iridescent to it so
let me go ahead and swatch the other one
so yeah oh yeah absolutely identical
here is the palette I will always love
you I'm sorry just to find my love and
then here is the full-size justify my
love so they are basically identical
they have the same amount of like where
time as the other blushes they're
they're the exact same formulation which
I want to see more two-faced products
like this I want to see more kits I want
to see them release like more kits with
those
is in them because they're just an
absolutely fantastic formulation oh by
the way as far as the eyeshadows are
concerned the wear time on them is
pretty darn strong with that eyeshadow
primer I just wanted to put that out
there although the actual like
consistencies and textures of them are a
little different on each one I do feel
like they do stay on the eyes relatively
well alright and then the last two items
in this particular palette are the
highlight which is originally like a
eyes shadow color and then we have
chocolate soleil chocolate Soleil is a
little different in this one it feels a
little harder to blend then my full-size
or the one that I have in my bronzer
palette but it still goes on quite
nicely if you do have like I would say
medium fair yeah fair to medium skin
tones I think this would definitely show
up on you if your skin is darker than
that it is going to take probably a
heavier hand and you might want to go
for the dark chocolate Soleil shade
which you know you can get any full-size
but yeah I don't think that this will
show up on you that well but I do feel
like it's pretty darn good it's pretty
darn similar I do find it just takes a
little more effort to blend out than my
full-size so there it is so watched on
my hand and then the last item that we
have here is the highlight and I thought
this was one of the most important
things from the palette because
nikkietutorials
it's the freakin Queen she is the queen
of highlight you guys like she's always
glowing she looks amazing like her
highlight game is so amazing it's just
amazing so I was really really really
disappointed when I got this shade right
here which is called champagne truffle
now it goes on a lot better you're gonna
need a dense ass brush if you want to
put this on your face you need something
really dense like the alpha blending
brush any kind of I don't even know
Sigma tapered highlighter brush is still
too flimsy
even the Luxy tapered highlighter brush
is not enough you're gonna need
something super super dense so what you
want to do is get something like this
which is a very very dense fan brush you
really want to dip in that product like
really really get in there you guys
because the actual pigmentation on this
baby is like practically non-existent
I'm going to go ahead and swatch with my
finger so you guys can see really really
trying to pick that product up there
just want to show you guys so there it
is and let me go ahead and swatch it and
there it is
so
I don't know for me personally it like
just like one little finger swipe like
this you're getting basically nothing if
you really really really work your
finger in there and you try and get it
off as much as you can it definitely
does show up on the skin don't get me
wrong this is a beautiful beautiful
color it's like that gorgeous kind of
cool toned pink with almost like a gold
iridescent running through it but this
 does not show up on my skin it just
does not show up and I do have right now
I think I'm about an NC 20 and Mac
Foundation so I do have a little bit of
a self tan going on right now
I just cannot like I literally am
sitting there building it up forever and
ever even with a really really dense
brush like this I don't know if I just
got a fluke if mine is just not good but
from what I can see and this should have
been something different I do like the
thought I think it's very innovative
that she wanted to use an actual
eyeshadow but this is just no I do not
like this as a highlight I feel like
she's the queen of highlights she should
have had something a little better and I
just I can't get over how weak this
highlight is it's patchy it doesn't look
good on the skin and the second you do
actually get it on the skin and you
start to build it up oh my god if you
have texture on your skin forget it girl
you are just going to have all of your
pores or emphasize your fine lines and
wrinkles like any sort of um you know
you might have as emphasize it's really
just not good so alright guys that is
kind of my little review on this
nikkietutorials collection again nothing
against Nicki nothing against Too Faced
love the brand I will be going ahead and
returning this I just think that there's
not enough in here that I'm interested
in and I when I was looking on the
actual website the first thing that
intrigued me was the actual palette so I
understand that the other like part of
the palette I wasn't really that into
her not the palette this little kit I
wasn't really into because again not
super into purple mascara not really
into liquid eyeliner it was really this
palette that intrigued me but I feel
like there are more misses and kits in
here as far as I am concerned I'm just
someone who doesn't like to put a ton of
time and effort into blending out my
eyeshadows and doing stuff like that
I was hoping these would be similar to
the formulations that I'm used to from
Too Faced but unfortunately there's just
a lot more misses than hits in here for
me so anyway I really hope you enjoyed
this review thank you so much for
joining me let me know down
below if you are going to pick up this
pallet if you did pick it up let me know
if you like yours or not and I will see
you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
