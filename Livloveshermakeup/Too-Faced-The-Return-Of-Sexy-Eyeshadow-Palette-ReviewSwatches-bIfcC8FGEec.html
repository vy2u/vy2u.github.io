turned into a pallets watching fest
today but I am going to do these
swatches and review on the two-faced
return of sexy palette this has been out
for a long time but I recently picked it
up and this is my favorite palette right
now and also I would say the top three
palettes that I own in general this is
what the shades look like and I'm
telling you right now I have never put
my finger in shadows this soft ever not
lorac not you know Urban Decay this this
palette is amazing I mean it is so soft
everything is so soft and as you can see
they're categorized in three sections so
you get warm here then you get kind of
like the pinky purple is there and then
you get the smoky blues over here so um
I did swatch them I have the warm
section here the pinkies here and then
the Blues here and it does come with an
eye liner in here which by the way
really reminds me of the Urban Decay
24/7 glide-on pencils which is awesome
because that is my those yeah those are
my favorite so this one really reminds
me of that it stays in the you know the
waterline all day without smudging and
this is the Squatch yeah super pigmented
amazing and waterproof they do have a
smudger stick on the other end if you do
want to smudge it out but this is the
Too Faced perfect eyes waterproof
eyeliner so highly recommend um I'm
gonna start with the warm ones and do
the pinks then do the blues for
swatching I'm going to look at the back
of the palette and try and figure out
where i swatched and what the names are
so let's start with the warm section the
I'm gonna go this way so this color
right here is called naive this one
right here is called casting couch this
gold color right here is called new in
town then you get this color right here
which is called ingenuine and then this
color right here is called innocent so
that is the warm section beautiful
super
meet I'm telling you I've never felt
shadows so soft um over here we have the
pink section I'm going to start with the
lightest one which I believe is right
here that one is called pink diamond
it's just a matte pink and I'm just so
creamy you guys it's amazing so that
one's called pink diamond this darker
one right here is called prima donna
then you get this purple right here this
is called hopeless romantic this one
here is called divorcee and this one is
called icon so those are the purples and
then here you have the smoky blue
section so the first one here is not
really showing up it's really light but
it is called seven-year itch and then
you get this silver color here this is
called bombshell a deeper silver this
one is called Hollywood this nice light
kind of almost topi like color here is
called maneater and then this one at the
bottom with the glitter in it which I
love is called beauty mark so those are
those swatches and like I said you guys
softest shadows I have ever felt in a
palette okay I mean better than my lorac
pro better than anything anything okay I
mean I'm just amazed and I absolutely
love the colors now I do love Too Faced
as a brand I'm obsessed with them I
think that they have like some of the
best eyeshadows but this is the best
palette they have ever made in my
opinion especially when it comes to
texture so anyway I do want to say a few
things I ended up bringing this on my
Thanksgiving vacation because it got in
them like it came in the mail the day I
was leaving and I was so excited I
wanted to bring it with me this is not
travel friendly as you can see it's very
chunky it kind of has this plastic thing
here and the mirror did fall out while I
was traveling so that was not good but
um you know I don't recommend it for
traveling because it is so chunky um but
it is just perfect in every other way in
my opinion you also have these little
cards here that slide out from behind
the mirror and these are basically just
little lookbook cards so you get the
horn group the purple group and then the
smokey group so they teach you they
basically give you instructions on how
to get a day look and a night look for
each set and I think those are nice to
have and they have the pictures on the
back so very very pretty and I think
that those are nice yeah you know I like
that I like when companies decide to do
that because some people are not as
experienced with eyeshadow on stuff like
that and certainly me sometimes I can't
even come up with like a look just
looking at the palette so I like to go
through those cards anyway here is the
palette again or just perfect
I might even save my favorite palette of
all time honestly I'm not even kidding
right now I know that this is an older
palette but go and check it out you guys
it is the softest easiest to blend
gorgeousness you will ever have I swear
to you anyway that's my review yes a
little over the top but that is how I
truly feel about this so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
