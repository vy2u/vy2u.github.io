this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new to face totally
cute eyes shadow palette I had some
major reservations about this palette
you guys I'll get to that in a minute
but I purchased this for $36 on Me Too
Faced Calm website if this is a limited
edition as of and as of right now you
can only get it on with a two-faced calm
website in here you are getting a 9
brand new shades that are in like
neutrals pops of colors you're getting
metallic finishes you're getting mattes
you're getting glitter shades you're
getting rich high pigment shadows that
have true color payoff you are getting a
glamour guide and you are also getting
yes listen to this ears open totally
cute sticker collections
I'm sorry way to customize your palette
alright guys I have always loved to face
I have always loved their 9/10 palettes
I have a lot of them I love the peanut
butter and jelly palette this was not
too like stupid for me okay I thought
the packaging on this was adorable the
little piece of toast like I love that I
love the natural matte palette
I love these sugar pop palettes I love
these 9 pan palettes okay so when I saw
that they were coming out with a totally
cute one originally I saw the inside of
it first like a sneak peak on trend mood
or something like that and I was like I
need it look at those gorgeous shadows
you're getting some really nice pops of
colors and then some neutrals
I love the formulation on these
particular shadows but what I saw what
the actual palette looks like and what
they wanted you to do with it I was like
that's stupid that's stupid
I'm gonna be 24 years old in August and
although I do like cute things like that
little piece of toast on the peanut
butter and jelly palette you cannot
expect me to want to take stickers and
decorate my makeup palettes with them
that is just too much you guys that is
too much to face so yes let me show you
what actually came up with this palette
and I'm feel very embarrassed right now
alright and this is what Kate with the
balanced so you get a sticker collection
here and you are actually supposed to go
and put these stickers on your eyeshadow
palette listen I will use these stickers
I will use them in like my agenda or
something like
but I just can't put it on makeup it
just feels too childish it's too much it
goes too far I don't know what else to
say but I just was kind of like
embarrassed by the fact that that's what
they wanted me to do and then when I
opened the outer packaging out popped
two more and I was like God do you
really have to make me feel like such a
child so anyway I don't mean to rant but
honestly I thought that was really
stupid the whole packaging thing I
understand that they did collaborate
with like you know artists and like
cartoonists and the whole point was to
have like a totally cute sort of like
kawaii sort of palette but in my opinion
I just thought this was extremely
childish again I thought the peanut
butter and jelly palette this is
adorable in my opinion the little piece
of toast and everything but actually
decorating your own palette with
stickers I just don't understand that
seems like something a young child would
do with a piece of makeup and a lot of
people who buy $36 eyeshadow palettes
are not you know like 12 years old you
know they're usually people that are I
don't know maybe 16 and older so anyway
that was like the one thing that kind of
bothered me about the whole palette
besides that you guys the formulation is
excellent the colors are beautiful the
pigmentation is great and actually some
of these stickers are pretty cute right
here it says Too Faced is my life I'm
like yes yes it is
this one says Too Faced I wake up for
makeup it's super cute and then this one
over here says Too Faced kiss and makeup
this one says it's butter a card
this one says exercise I thought you
said extra fries so some of these are
definitely cute and like I said I'll use
these in like my Lilly Pulitzer agenda
but I just cannot decorate this little
palette here with the stickers I just
can't do it so anyway here is what the
actual palette looks like I'm just gonna
leave my plain it's actually really
beautiful it's just a light pastel e
pink color it says two-faced and it does
have like a little raised emblem here
you open it up it is a magnetic closure
just like some of their other newer like
9 pan palettes you do have a little
mirror here that says two-face totally
cute you get your little glamour guide I
don't know if I showed you guys that yet
and then here are your actual eyeshadows
so the eyeshadows are really really
beautiful in here you guys if you have
any of the other eyeshadow palettes that
come in the 9th and you know version
then it is the same sort of pigmentation
blend ability just it's the same exactly
basically they are very very blendable
shadows they are very soft today are
very creamy they are just absolutely
absolutely beautiful and the shades in
here I really actually like these 3
shades right here which are unicorn
shooting star and double scoop I think
are so beautiful this particular shade
makes for a gorgeous trend not that one
this particular shape makes a gorgeous
like base and transition color and then
I really like this color right here
which is called bunny foo-foo I know the
names but bunny foo-foo is really cute I
do have that on today let me tell you
guys when I'm wearing actually really
quickly so I do have ice cream cutie or
I'm sorry double scoop all over my
eyelid and underneath my eye and then I
went in with a bunny foo-foo I'll just
hold it like this I went in with bunny
foo-foo as my transition I went in with
chocolate donut as my actual crease
shade and then I went in with storm
cloud on my lower lash line clover on my
lid and then I took a bunny foo-foo
again and went on like the upper part of
my crease like above my actual bone here
so I really like the way the look turned
out I think it's beautiful and then I
did take a little bit of this shape
right here called shooting star which is
like a foiled eyeshadow and I put that
on the inner corner of my eye and on the
this part of my lower lashline so
overall I think the actual like
formulation of what is in here is
exactly what you would expect from a 9
pan palette from Too Faced these are
extremely extremely buttery some of the
shades in here are even softer than some
of the shades in the peanut butter and
jelly palette I love this particular
palette I think it's absolutely
beautiful and there's some shades in
here like bananas and this one right
here peanut brittle that are super soft
but honestly some of the shades in here
are even more buttery so I feel like two
faces definitely stepping up their game
as far as like blend ability and
pigmentation and softness is concerned
so overall really really love this I can
use any of the 90 on I
palates with any sort of eye primer I
never have an issue you don't need to
use like a glitter glue or anything like
that and one thing that I noticed with
this particular palette was that I had a
lot less fallout that I do then I do
with some of the other 9 pan palettes so
that was quite exciting I feel like
their formulation is getting better and
better so really really nice I love the
blend ability the colors in here are
really pretty I want to show you guys a
comparison really quickly against these
sugarpop palette if you guys are curious
because you may look at this and think
oh sugar pot palettes because they seem
sort of similar but in reality they're
really not that similar in tone so let
me show you guys there's a few shades
that look maybe slightly similar but
here is let's see here here is the cute
palette and then here is the sugar pot
palette and sorry guys I'm gonna be so
late at night
so anyway there are definitely some
color similarities these ones are more
like pastel and then these ones are more
like I don't know I feel like these are
a little more vibrant and a little
darker in tone the two cute palette is
so I don't really feel like you're
getting any sort of color overlap or
finish overlap you are getting some
shimmer shades and here's some glitters
and some mats and if you have had a Too
Faced 9pn palette before then that's
just kind of the standard so overall
beautiful beautiful formulation I will
link my peanut butter and jelly palette
review down below if you would like to
see me talk a little more in depth about
the actual formulations of the 9 pan
pilots from Too Faced but I know a lot
of my viewers that are probably watching
have some sort of a 9-pound palette from
Too Faced so yes this is the same sort
of formulation it's beautiful very
blendable and I absolutely love it so
let's go ahead and starts watching shall
we I am going to start with these three
shades here that are the bigger sorts of
colors so the first one is called a
double scoop and this is double scoop
it's a beautiful matte cream color and
you know their mats are just getting
better and better so there is double
scoop and again I have that all over my
lid today and underneath
my eye the next shade is a lucky girl
which is a beautiful champagne color and
this just goes on straight up like
foiled like it's beautiful and I was
really really surprised although when
you dip your brush in there you do get
some kick up I wasn't getting any
fallout with these at all like the past
two days so this shade right here is
called shooting star beautiful kind of
champagne color and then the last one in
the row is called unicorn and this one
feels a little harder like it's a little
harder pressed if that makes sense but
it basically is double scoop with a
little more of like a silver iridescent
to it it's still really pretty but it
definitely feels a little more I don't
know it's just a little more firm to the
touch and I feel like a lot of two-faced
9 pan pallets have a shade or two that
you have like a mist as far as the
formulation is concerned but there is
the shade in unicorn so that is the
first row again really really creamy
really beautiful I really love that
shade double scoop and I really love
shooting star I think that's a insane
gorgeous gorgeous champagne color so
let's move on to the second row we're
gonna do a bunny look but you've got in
my mouth
we're gonna do bunny foo-foo we're gonna
do clover and then we are going to do I
heart to face so bunny foo-foo is that
beautiful warm transition color it looks
like a peanut butter from the peanut
butter and jelly palette actually very
very similar so there is peanut butter
it is a matte absolutely stunning
the next sheet is called clover and
clover is basically like a foiled green
it's absolutely stunning so here is
clover that green shade isn't that
pretty I have that on my lid today and
then we have I hurt to face which is a
pink color and there is I hurt to face
this one has a little more chunkiness to
it because it does have glitter in it
but it's still very very pigmented so
there are those three shades right there
exactly what you would expect from a
two-faced 9-pound palette I don't know
what else to say I feel like I reviewed
so many of them on my channel that I'm
just like it's the same formulation but
really it's the same formulation but I
feel like it keeps getting better and
better
alright and then we are going to do this
last row right here and by the way if
you guys are curious they call this one
the
cream cutie ROH this one the lucky girl
row and then this one they totally cute
bro so we're gonna take chocolate
doughnut which is the shade that I have
in at my crease today is just a
beautiful warm toned dark chocolate
brown color and it's absolutely
beautiful I mean it just goes on so
nicely like yes full-on pigment
absolutely stunning very very soft and
buttery then we're gonna take storm
cloud which kind of reminds me of max of
blue brown pigment but it has more like
turquoise colors in it but it's still
really pretty it definitely has that
brown undertone look at that doesn't
that go on foil look at that thing yes
and then the last thing that we have in
the pilot is called mule and this one is
a dark purple color it is a glitter so
it has a little more texture to it and
it also has a brown undertone so yeah
those are all of these shadows in the
palette I know I ranted a little bit at
the beginning about the sticker thing I
just could not believe that they had
done that you guys I think that's just
so stupid but you know that was my
little rant I think that the palette
overall is the same sort of quality and
consistency and you know wearability and
all that kind of stuff as the original
or the other 9 pan palettes
I definitely think if you like the
colors then you should pick it up for
sure they definitely have some nice you
know when I'm holding it next to the
sugar pop palette I'm like you know what
they're really not that similar I feel
like the sugar pop has more sort of
pastel II like summery colors this one
has more like I don't know it just has
more depth to it if you guys can see so
yeah I really think if you like the
colors if you see them on the website if
you see them up close and you like them
I would definitely go ahead and pick it
up it's just another awesome little 9
pan palette that you definitely don't
have to decorate with stickers but it's
awesome and yeah I really really enjoy
it of the colors so I don't know what
else to say I think you guys have seen
enough reviews on 910 palettes for me
but yeah I think it is really really
cute and I would highly recommend you
guys check it out if you do like the
colors thank you for joining me and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
