video is going to be a review of
swatches and of course a comparison on
the new Too Faced chocolate chip palette
so I purchased both of these for $26
apiece I purchased the matte chocolate
chip version on the Too Faced calm
website for $26 this is exclusive to the
Too Faced Calm website and the white
chocolate chip palette which sold out so
freaking quickly I got on these
sephora.com website it is exclusive to
Sephora and it is also $26 so this one
sold out very very quickly this one is
currently also sold out on the two-faced
calm website I don't know if this is for
sure going to only be a two-faced
exclusive it may show up at Ulta there's
been some little ramblings or rumblings
here and there about that happening so
we shall see but I know that the white
chocolate is exclusive to Sephora so yes
currently both of them are sold out I
will go ahead and leave a comment down
below in the comment section and let you
guys know if I found anything out about
when the restock will be happening
because these will both be restocked
very soon for everyone to purchase but
inside of here you are getting 11
shadows in each and you are getting 0.5
grams or 0.02 ounces of product in each
pan so let's go ahead and take a look at
the outer packaging is this is what the
outer packaging looks like on these
little guys so the matte chocolate chip
palette has more of like a matte
packaging as you guys can see it does go
ahead and list the ingredients on the
back and Too Faced is cruelty free it
says on here we transforms 11 of your
favorite shades from the best-selling
chocolate bar eye shadow collection into
modern buttery matte finishes indulge in
cocoa powder infused shades of perfect
brown neutrals and a pop of color with
our signature chocolate scent so yes
they do smell very very heavenly and
very chocolatey I guess you could say
very very strongly of chocolate I will
say I feel like these little pallets
smell a lot more like chocolate than my
big chocolate bar palette but yes this
little matte version is supposed to be
basically the matte version of the
chocolate bar palette in a pocket size
if you guys are curious about the actual
sizing of these palettes the closest
thing that I would say is comparable to
is definitely The Naked basics palette
if this is Naked basics to the regular
basics palette also is the same size
they are about the same exact size each
of them is as The Naked basics so that
is what they look like they're about the
same size in my opinion
I will say that this one's maybe just a
tad thicker but yeah that is about the
size of these little pallets so the
original chocolate bar palette looks a
little something like this I actually
think that this little chocolate chip or
matte chocolate chip version actually
has a better color selection I actually
prefer the colors in here I do not think
that they are absolutely identical I
have swatch them side by side and
although the colors look very similar as
you guys can see they are not absolutely
identical so if you were hoping for
absolutely identical matte shades from
this one it's not exactly the same in my
opinion I think that these the colors in
here definitely have a little more depth
a little more richness to them and I
actually prefer the shades in here over
this one but we will talk about
formulation in a second but yeah those
are the two of them side by side this is
supposed to be the little mini pocket
palette version or matte version of the
original chocolate bar palette so that
is what the outer packaging looks like
like I said a little bit of a matte
finish and then the outer packaging for
the white chocolate chip is a little
more of a glossy box so you can see on
here that it has the ingredients listed
again and it says the white chocolate
chip features 11 cocoa powder infused
buttery shades in pastels creamy news
and a pop of black all with our
signature chocolate scent so this is
what the outer packaging looks like as
you guys can see or the actual packaging
and it does show on the back again how
many ounces of product you're getting in
there it does show on the back the
actual names with a little sticker and
it does that as well on this little guy
so I think the packaging is actually
really cute I definitely preferred the
matte chocolate chip version because I
just like the way that this packaging
feels normally I'm not into that whole
like rubbery matte thing but this is not
like a rubbery it's just nice plastic
it's like a really really durable kind
of plastic it doesn't feel as luxurious
to say like the original chocolate bar
palette or even in the semi-sweet or the
bon bons palette where you have that
nice tin packaging but it still feels
really really good and durable so I
actually preferred this packaging over
the white chocolate version the white
chocolate version although it's super
cute and I think it's very pretty and
colorful like I like the white with the
pink and a little like yellow or bold
thing down here it just looks a little
cheaper because it is a little more
shiny but overall I would say the
packaging size and the fact that these
are like true little pocket palettes is
really cool I think that they came out
with a really nice idea and concept of
doing that and I do think that it
transfers into the actual product so
when you open it up you do have a nice
sized mirror on both of them which I
really do appreciate and this is what
the white chocolate chip looks like on
the inside as you guys can see you are
getting a variety of finishes in here
you are getting some italicized finishes
you are getting some glitter finishes
and some matte finishes and then on the
matte chocolate chip again you open it
up you do have a nice sized mirror as
you guys can see and then all of these
are matte finishes so I guess we will
start with formulation wise we're going
to start with this little guy I feel
like the formulation is not identical to
what the original chocolate bar is or
any of the other chocolate bar palettes
but they matte version in here there are
a few mats that are very satiny and
buttery and creamy like they are in the
original chocolate bar version however I
will say there are a few in here that
just really feel scratchy and are kind
of powdery and chalky
they just don't so watch as beautifully
they don't go onto the eye as
beautifully and I just feel like there
are a few shades in here that just don't
really fit the quality of the overall
palette if that makes sense so I will
say this shade right here at this shade
right here at this shade this shade this
shade probably like the more lighter
tones in here are beautiful very soft
very very buttery it's when you start to
get into these darker tones right here
like this cranberry kind of color or
that reddish kind of color this dark
green down here that dark brown that it
actually starts to get very very
scratchy look the quality is just not
the same now when it comes to the white
chocolate version I will say that the
mattes in here are beautiful I feel like
the glitter finishes in here are
beautiful and the metallic ice finishes
are absolutely beautiful I feel like all
of them in here are very comparable to
the semi-sweet palette to the bon bons
palette and absolutely to the original
chocolate bar palette the massing here
are so silky and beautiful I feel like
even the glitter finishes or the really
metallic ice finishes like this one and
this one right here are really really
gorgeous they go onto the lid really
nicely I have this particular shade
which is like this beautiful I believe
it's called cookie dough or sugared
raisin I'm sorry a sugared raisin this
was also in the chocolate shop palette
that came out too during the holiday
season if you guys were curious that was
my favorite shade in the chocolate shop
palette but sugared raisin is really
really gorgeous I put that on my lid and
I didn't even need to foil it today it
just went on beautifully with like
tapping it on with my finger I don't
feel
there's as much fallout with this
particular palette as there is with this
little guy now a lot of the shades in
here are definitely a little more firmly
pressed like I said there are some
really soft buttery creamy shades in
here but there are also some really
scratchy mattes in here
definitely not comparable to like the
Too Faced natural matte 9 pan palette
and definitely not comparable to the
original chocolate bar palette but I
would say out of the two of them if you
aren't going to pick one up I would
definitely recommend picking up the
white chocolate palette I just feel like
this overall has the better quality to
it and is more comparable to the actual
baby chocolate bar palette so formula
wise if this one's just okay I would say
this one is actually really really good
and for $26 I think it's totally totally
worth it
as far as where time is concerned I feel
like where time is really really good I
have tried these palettes out with three
different eye primers I tried it the
glitter glue from Too Faced
I tried shadow insurance which is just
the original um Too Faced kind of eye
shadow primer and then I did go ahead
and I tried out the balm cosmetics time
bomb today I am actually wearing it with
a face primer because this week when I
did shot my stash I included both of
these in there but I told you guys that
I was going to wear my Maybelline
instant pore eraser and I actually put
that on my eyelids today I feel like it
went on really really nicely I'm not
having a lot of creasing the shades that
I am wearing today if you guys are
curious are this shade right here I have
this in my crease sugared raisin like I
said I have that on my lid and then I
used one or two of the matte shades in
here I believe this kind of like honey
butter shade here and then this one a
few of the shades do overlap from other
palettes that they do have if you are
curious but I think it's nice I think
they're beautiful and if there's one
that I would highly recommend like I
said I would recommend the white
chocolate version I feel like this one
is very very nice but if you really want
a very very good all matte palette from
Too Faced definitely check out the
natural matte palette I feel like the
quality in there is a lot better than
the quality in here and also these
shades are basically just duplicates of
what you are getting from the original
chocolate bar palette now like I said
they're not exactly exactly identical
but they are pretty darn close whereas
the white chocolate version they've
never really released shades like this
this is more of like a Naked 3 kind of
version so you're getting a lot more
pinky tones pastel e tones and sure when
you open up like your chocolate bonbons
palette you can definitely see that
there are some pinky and pastel e shades
in here you have some nice a foiled like
silvery kind of shades
things like that kind of like sugared
raisin that you can pop on your lid but
I would say that this one is definitely
the most unique out of the bunch and the
one that is very comparable to the
original chocolate bar so application
wise I feel like I can use any sort of
brushes with these they go on
beautifully I will say because these are
so soft and buttery in the white
chocolate version they do tend to have
maybe just not so much fallout but they
do tend to have a lot of kick up so when
you're putting your brush in there they
do pick up a lot of product but I think
it's just because they are so soft and
buttery it's kind of like when you're
working with like a lorac Pro shadow you
know you put your brush in there and a
lot comes up because they are so soft
and creamy and buttery I don't have as
much of an issue with this little guy
however I do get a little more fallout
with this I don't really know how that
works these were are just a little more
firmly pressed these just feel a little
more soft and buttery so overall you
guys I think that both of them are good
quality I wouldn't highly highly
recommend this one I don't know if this
is something that I would keep in my
collection I might declutter it to a
friend I just feel like the natural
matte palette from Too Faced is so much
better in quality and also just colors I
prefer the more like reddish kind of
colors again this is beautiful compared
to the original chocolate bar palette
which if you guys are curious I am
decluttering um compared to that one I
actually prefer the tones in here there
are a lot more rich there are a lot more
dark and I feel like um they do have a
really nice amount of pigment to them
but I think that this one is definitely
the most unique because we've never seen
Too Faced do you kind of like this
pastel e
pinky sort of silvery thing sure
sometimes with the chocolate bonbons
palette they done some silvery shades
but for the most part this is kind of
like the Urban Decay Naked 3 kind of
colors so I think it's great if you are
looking for something with the original
chocolate bar formulation and you like
the colors in here then absolutely get
this but just know that you probably
have something in your collection that
has all of the colors from both of these
palettes in it so it's not absolutely
necessary but if you are a die-hard fan
of the chocolate bar formulation that
yes I would check it out also I just
want to touch on pigmentation really
quickly I feel like pigmentation is
great with this palette a little more so
than this palette so although these are
really soft and buttery I feel like I do
have to build this up a little more on
my eyes I don't mind doing that because
I feel like it's a little less mistake
proof because you just keep going in and
building it on your eyes worth with this
one you go in and you start working
something into your crease and it's like
BAM full on pigments so again even
though they do feel a little scratchy or
too
touch maybe you just have to dig into
them more and really just kind of use a
light hand because these are hella
pigmented yeah let's go ahead and just
get into swatches shall we so we're
going to start with the white a
chocolate version so I'm going to start
with this shade down here this one is
called glaze and this is a matte and it
is so soft and buttery and creamy and
beautiful I love this shade I think it's
great especially if you do have a fair
complexion and you just want to go all
over the lid so there is the shade glaze
the next shade that we're going to go
ahead and swatch is this little guy down
here this is a whitish color and this
one is called pearl candy love the names
and this one has a little more of a
pinky base I guess you could say to it
so it's really nice if you do have like
a cool undertone in your complexion
which I do so here is what that looks
like and this is more of like a foil
dorm italicized finish that's how I
would describe it it may have a little
bit of glitter particles in it but it's
something that you really can blend out
nicely so it's not too disruptive on the
actual eyelid all right the next shade
that we are going to go ahead and swatch
is this one which is called cake batter
this one kinda reminds me of honey
butter from that natural matte palette
it's very beautiful it is a matte and
it's very creamy and buttery has a
little more of a cool undertone and then
like that warmish undertone that honey
butter has but it's still beautiful so
there is that cake batter shade and then
next we're going to go into that nice
kind of pearl eyes pinky color I really
like this it kind of reminds me of like
narcissus orgasm because it's got that
beautiful beautiful pink color to it
with like a little bit of like a gold
and that is called raspberry Rose day
and this is just beautiful so that is
what it looks like and like I said it
kind of has that narcissus orgasm gold
thing going on Ruby really cool I like
this a lot it's very very beautiful so
there is raspberry rosy and this would
look gorgeous if you just want to foil
it on to your actual eyelid and then the
shade that we have underneath that one
does have a little bit of glitter in it
this one is called cookie dough but it
really goes on like a matte it feels
very very silky and the actual glitter
particles that are in there are very
finely milled so don't worry too much
about that being too heavily um filled
with glitter so here is that shade right
here very very beautiful and then we're
going to go on to that third
so at the top we have this really nice
kind of nudie transition color I think
it's great if you do have a fair
complexion this particular shade is
called ambrosia so there it is right
there very very very beautiful and I
will say with this white chocolate
palette I feel like this is a little
probably a little better for those of
you who do have like a fair to light
complexion if you're someone who has a
very very dark complexion I'm not quite
sure every single one of these shades
will show up on you but I do think that
the matte version would show up on you
quite nice so there is ambrosia as you
guys can see it actually has like a
little bit of shimmer to it and it
actually has a little bit of a gold
undertone very interesting then we have
those two really really beautiful kind
of glitter pack shades that actually go
on kind of foiled so those are
indulgence and sugared raisins so
indulgence is the silver and again these
go on really nicely especially if you do
foil them and then sugared raisin is
what I have on my lid today and I just
love this shade I loved it in the
chocolate shop palette and I love it now
so there they are
so there's sugared raisin and then there
is indulge very very metallic eyes very
high shine very very pretty on the lower
lash line inner corner of the eye or
even just smacked onto the lid and then
the last three shades we have our let's
see here on exotica guilt free and black
sugar so exotica guilt free is a matte
and then black sugar is a glitter but
again it's a glitter but it has a really
really really nice consistency to it so
this top one right here isn't beautiful
kind of satiny taupe color exotica I
really like this a lot I think it's
beautiful and it goes on very very high
shine and gorgeous gorgeously so there
it is a swatch can you guys see that
it's totally foiled absolutely beautiful
then we have that matte which is the one
that I worked in to my crease today this
is called guilt-free and is that really
pretty shade right there when I picked
it up it did kind of go into the other
shade the mattes like I said are very
very creamy and buttery so make sure not
to dig too hard like I just did but
there is guilt free the two of those
pair together like yes girl and then the
last date we have is that beautiful
beautiful dark black kind of color and
it does have little reflex of I would
say like blue and silver glitter in it
and this is called black sugar I
actually have black sugar in my outer-v
today and this is beautiful this is a
true dark black color very very
pigmented and you can actually see the
little bits of glue
in there so that is the white chocolate
chip pellet like I said it is my
favorite out of the two I just really
like the way it goes onto the eyes and
the way that it translates onto the
actual face all right now let's go ahead
and just watch this little baby so here
is the matte chocolate chip but we are
also going to start with the biggest
shade right there this one is called
white chocolate so let's go ahead and
swatch it I will say this one although
it's very pigmented it feels scratchy
like if I were to compare it to the
bigger shade in here on the glaze shade
there's no comparison this one feels
scratchy and that one doesn't but it
still goes on very pigmented as you guys
can see so there is the shade white
chocolate kind of like right around my
skin tone color with a little bit of a
warmer undertone the next shade we have
is called madame marzipan so here is
matte marzipan perfect transition color
for those of you who do have a fair
complexion like me this one feels very
soft and buttery so again kind of
strange how like we're getting different
kind of finishes here but you will see I
hope that you guys can see with this
matte finish normally I feel like to
face is like amazing with mattes like
their natural matte palette I know I
keep saying it I'm like a broken record
over here but their natural matte
palette is absolutely beautiful but I do
notice these mats kind of emphasize
texture and just like the hairs on my
hand and things like that so I did want
to point that out but as you guys can
see they're still quite pigmented and
then we have this one down here and this
one is called a matte hazelnut so matte
hazelnut is really beautiful if you do
have a darker complexion that would be a
really great transition shade and this
one is very buttery and creamy so it's
really kind of a hit and miss with this
particular palette but there is that
shade so there are the first three
shades in the matte chocolate chip
palette moving on we're going to go on
to the next little row we have a
beautiful beautiful kind of how didn't
even know how to it's like a cool tone
brown shade and then kind of like the
honey butter shades so we have the shade
semi-sweet and then Matt creme brulee so
here is a semi-sweet has a little bit of
like a reddish undertone very soft and
creamy and buttery and then this one on
the bottom is a match creme brulee again
very soft and creamy and buttery so here
they are
so watched super super beautiful I love
that shade it's got a little bit of like
a pinky undertone really really
beautiful and then the next row that we
have here is this dark hunter green
color which is my favorite
color out of the entire palette
unfortunately it does have a little bit
of like a hard pressed thing going on
there so it's not as luxurious and stuff
when you did your finger and they're in
fact kind of feels like sandpaper but it
is so pigmented that color is beautiful
so this one is called Matt guilted
ganache and then we have strawberry
bonbon and Matt cherry cordial so here
is this beautiful dark greenish color I
just love this like the way that this
looks it's like that dirty hunter green
I'm really into those kind of colors I
know some people aren't I will say that
this can look slightly muddy when you
actually put it on to the eyes but it's
still really really beautiful so there
is that color and then we have the
strawberry bonbon which feels like
frickin butter it feels like a little
baby's ass like I'm not even kidding
it's just crazy to see how the texture
you know changes in this particular
palette so there's the strawberry bonbon
I love that shade I love a nice cool
toned pink color so not surprised that I
love that one and then we also have that
really scratchy kind of um what would
you describe this that it's kind of like
a muddy um auburn color I guess you
could say and that one is the cherry
cordial the matte cherry cordial so here
it is so I love that green and I love
this cherry cordials a shade but I will
say they do feel very very Scratchy so
when you get them on the eyes just make
sure that you're doing a lot of blending
because it you have to blend them out
that's that's all I'll say
and then the last three that we have
here at the top we have triple fudge
then we have a matte candied violet and
matte champagne truffles so there they
are so this top one here again feels
very very Scratchy but you can see I
mean very pigmented so it's really hard
to say because when they're very
pigmented and they do go on to the eyes
very pigmented it's like oh that's great
but it is harder to blend out you know
those kind of shades and then here's the
violet shade the violet shade a piece of
fuzz stuck here the violet shade is
actually really really smooth and creamy
and buttery so there is the violet shade
but again very very pigmented especially
these darker colors really really
translate onto the eyes very nicely
which is why I said that this particular
palette would be great if you do have a
darker complexion and then this one down
here is the Mac champagne a truffle
which feels very very buttery so there
are the last three
so watched so anyway
like I said overall thoughts not exactly
comparable to the chocolate bar palette
the original one like color wise when it
comes to this little guy I don't think
these are the best mattes that two-face
has ever released I do think that if
you're going to buy one of these for $26
I mean come on $26 they're perfect
stocking stuffers you do get a nice
amount of product in here I would go
with the white chocolate chip and yeah
that's pretty much all I have to say I'm
sorry this is such a long video I hope
you guys enjoyed it thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
