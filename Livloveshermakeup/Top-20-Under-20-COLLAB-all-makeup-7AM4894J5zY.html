very excited for this video not only
because it's a collaboration but also
because we are talking about products
that are under twenty dollars these are
all makeup related this is the collab
video with my friend Mellie here on
YouTube I'm gonna go ahead and leave her
channel her video and her instagram down
below so that you might the list so that
you guys can go and check her out we
have collab before on makeup products
like top ten under ten from the
drugstore and yeah we are talking about
makeup products or I don't know she may
be including other things other than
makeup products but we're talking about
20 products under twenty dollars but 20
products each that are under twenty
dollars not like 20 items that are all
under twenty dollars does everyone is
under twenty dollars each if that makes
sense i hope that i hope that i'm
specifying correctly anyway i would love
if you guys went over and checked out
Miley's channel tell her I say hello and
yeah let's go ahead and get right into
it shall we all right I want to make
sure I don't miss anything I think I
have everything so let's go ahead and
get started the first items I want to
talk about i'm talking about as one
because they are technically all sort of
the same thing just different shades
these are the wet and wild fergie center
stage collection shimmer palette or
highlighters so the first one i have
here is rose golden goddess and i just
love these I think you can get all three
of these I think there's a fourth one
two you could probably get all four of
them for under twenty dollars at the
drugstore but they're just beautiful
blush toppers or highlighters this one's
definitely a blush copper for me there
is similar to Becca's blushed copper yes
alright the next one is gorgeous this is
be actually very similar to champagne
pop no not champagne Prosecco pop this
is the center stage collection palette
in Hollywood Boulevard or just gold
color love it and then the last one is
in roses champagne glow and if you have
fair skin you probably have this in your
collection but i highly recommend
checking those out i think they are 499
or five dollars so definitely under
twenty dollars each but you could
probably get all three or four of them
for twenty dollars as well so love those
the next items i want to talk about our
in here these are the Revlon just bitten
kissable abstains lip balm stains or
whatever you want to call them they come
in lacquer version match version and
also just the regular version all sorts
of different colors they do have this
look to them that's kind of like the
tarte lipsurgence i would say that these
are like the drugstore alternatives they
smell minty just like the tarte
lipsurgence 'as as well and yeah they
have a bunch of great colors love the
formulation this one is called
unapologetic which is a matte coral we
have this one which is my all-time this
is like my all-time favorite because
it's my first one this one is called
romantic and it's just in the regular
formula beautiful red we have the
lacquer version in the shade Coquette
which is a beautiful light pink shade I
have this matte color here which is
called elusive it's gorgeous I love this
morning your lips but better sort of
shade this one right here is just the
normal formula as well this is called
cherish which is a beautiful lilac pinky
color and then we have this one which is
called sweetheart which is one of the
regular formulas as well this one's
really well used and it smells really
good love that shade and then the last
one is called whimsical love this color
probably one of my all-time favorites
it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful
glossy sort of purply color with tons of
glitter in it but it's actually very
comfortable to wear on the lips so love
those you can probably get two of those
for under twenty dollars at the
drugstore in the next two items I want
to talk about again I'm just showing you
guys options so I'm counting them as one
these are the bhcosmetics wild child and
also wild at heart too baked eyeshadow
palettes I think you can get both of
these for under twenty dollars or just
one of them for under twenty dollars but
this is what they look like these are
actually really nice shadows and if you
do use them wet they actually look very
spoiled and beautiful on the eyes so I
really like both of them the wild at
heart definitely has a little more color
to it so if you prefer that you can pick
this one up but they're both wonderful
quality and I'm kind of going through
these quickly because I don't want the
video to be too long so I won't be doing
this watches but if you guys would like
a separate review on anything that I
show just leave that comment down in the
comment section that made no sense to
leave me a comment down below and I will
make sure that I can put it on my list
alright the next item that I want to
talk about that is under twenty dollars
just right under twenty dollars and
think this is about eighteen dollars at
target this is the Sonia Kashuk I on
neutral eyeshadow palette I love this
thing I've had this since I was in high
school this is an amazing amazing
neutral matte palette if you need a
really really good
on it and you don't want to spend more
than twenty dollars a highly recommend
checking this one out all right let's
talk about a color correcting palette
that is the bomb com one of my favorites
is probably my second favorite color
correcting item besides the Urban Decay
color correcting fluids this is the NYX
color correcting concealer palette love
this as you can see i have almost hit
pan on a few of the shades here we have
a yellow to correct like you know dark
circles underneath your eyes the peach
color you can contour with the shade
green cancels out redness lavender will
brighten and then this one right here is
nice for under the eyes as well
beautiful beautiful formulation they
actually do give a bit of coverage sort
of like the urban decay color correcting
fluids and i love this i believe this is
around $12 at target alright the next
item i want to talk about easy covergirl
true naked roses palette and i think
that you can get this one and the
original one for under twenty dollars at
alta but definitely one of them is just
under twenty dollars beautiful beautiful
palette I bored this a couple of weeks
ago and I just love it you've got some
gorgeous shades in here they're really
really Rosie toned I personally did not
like they make it three ballads as you
guys know and I think this is much
better quality honestly I know people
are going to disagree with me but these
are really buttery they're very soft
they blend with any sort of eyeshadow
primer and I highly highly recommend
checking this formulation out from
covergirl alright moving on let's talk
about these ml oh my god I'm scared
stuff is going to fall off okay the elf
prism eyeshadow palettes I think you can
get all three of these for under twenty
dollars but definitely one of them is
you know I think like five or six
dollars so this one right here is called
sunset these are beautiful beautiful
eyeshadows you guys they go on like
they're foiled and they're just
absolutely stunning this one right here
is called smoke which is obviously a
smokey toned palette really really
beautiful with the two pops of color in
there and then we have the original one
which is called naked and I discovered
these eyeshadow palettes last year I'm
absolutely obsessed these are such good
quality if you want to pick up an
eyeshadow palette from ELF and you don't
know which one to get i would highly
recommend checking out of these prism
formulation alright the next one will
come as no surprise my all-time favorite
base foundation anything of all times
pretty much is the cover girl of the lay
CC cream this is my favorite sort of
color correcting product to put on my
face
I don't even think it's available
anymore someone told me that they are
reformulating it and it's going to be
coming back but it is under twenty
dollars at the drugstore it's beautiful
it is the town rehab foundation the
shade i have is 105 i agree you guys
have probably seen me go through six of
these look at the past two years and on
top of that I do talk about this all the
time i used it in my five minute makeup
challenge so many different videos love
this product if you ever see it pick it
up you will not regret it all right I do
have a primer here that I want to talk
about that is a little more pricey I
think this is around twelve or fifteen
dollars but it's so good this is the
l'oreal magic perfecting bases this is
the one that has that really really
silicone to mexico and feel to it it's
super super thick and this is not a
product that you put all over your face
it's kind of like the benefit
Porefessional you treat certain areas of
your face with this this is even thicker
and honestly even better at concealing
pores in my appeal in my opinion of my
opinion in my opinion then the benefit
Porefessional it is so silicon II you
guys but it really really cancels out
pores and things like that it is
absolutely beautiful a little goes a
very very long way and I just like to
take it put it around my t-zone I know I
don't talk about it very often but
honestly under twenty dollars this is a
great deal highly highly recommend
checking that out alright the next item
I want to talk about is the makeup
revolution ultra blush palette in sugar
and spice they have so many different
blush palettes but this particular one
is absolutely stunning the two
highlights here I have to splurge phase
i have to the two highlights here are
like bam bam in yo face look at that one
do you see that oh my god oh my god
all right so look at those two
highlights first of all this is more of
a blush topper but look at that
highlight so so so amazingly gorgeous
honestly wow I just turned my back did
you hear that crack am I trying to wipe
my fingers and I'm cracking all right
but anyway this is a beautiful beautiful
blush palette this is under ten dollars
at the drugstore I believe or at Ulta or
a target to the self us a target now
only at Alta but you do get some matte
blushes in here some satiny blushes and
then those two highlights highly
recommended this particular shade i
watch emilynoel83 reviewed this palette
and I was
I have to get that shade because I
wanted that high tide oh alright moving
on I have two mascaras I of course have
to mention the first one being the
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama I
don't know if I talked about this in my
top ten under ten but this is an amazing
amazing drugstore mascara that is under
twenty dollars it is a dupe for the
laura mercier extra lash sculpting
mascara which is like a 30-dollar
mascara so i highly recommend checking
this out if you have not already it's
got a wonderful wonderful formulation to
it a lot of people don't like it because
it is very slick and oily and wet maybe
you could pick up the waterproof version
but honestly this gives me like trifecta
lashes like volume length and definition
yes love and then the other mascara of
course I had to talk about is the
Sephora outrageous curl mascara this is
only a $12 Sephora house brand mascara
it's amazing it is my all-time favorite
mascara of all times it's got a great
little tiny wand it gives you so much
curl and definition in length and
thickness every time that I wear this on
my lashes people are like are those fake
eyelashes and I'm like no they're not
alright so moving on the next items I
want to talk about are these right here
these are the Knicks ultimate eye shadow
palettes I reviewed these and i said i'm
just going to return one of these and I
never did I like all of them I'm gonna
keep all of that but anyway we have a
shadow here or we have a pile here
called warm neutrals so we have this
warm one here these are eighteen dollars
a piece at ulta however you can get them
one by one get one fifty percent off
quite often which is what I did you get
some really gorgeous warm tones in here
these are very very buttery and soft and
SAT me very easy to blend and very well
worth it for a pallet in my opinion the
next one is the brains palette I
actually have this on my eyes today I
have this dark purple shade on my lower
lashline mixed together with this light
lilac shade love this honestly if you
were going to get one of these I highly
recommend checking out the brights I
never got the open Decay electric
palette and I don't feel like I need it
because I have that bright palette this
one right here is called cool neutrals I
think this is the one I was going to
return but now I don't want to I just
honestly love these they're so nice very
very compact easy to toss into your
purse and then the last one is called
these sim okies wait no it's not if
called smoky and highlight
okie and highlight palette really
beautiful getting some jewel tones in
here and I feel like the formulation
across the border of all four of them is
really really good really beautiful very
easy to blend they don't feel like oh my
god like oh it feels like butter they do
feel soft quite buttery but not like
pure butter I'm making no sense they
don't feel like a foiled I shadow but
they do have that really soft blendable
sorts of quality tonight alright moving
on let's talk about some more makeup
revolution products I believe these are
five dollars at Ulta you could get quite
a few beats for under twenty dollars
these are the revolution baked vivid
highlighters I have two shades here that
are my favorites I have one called peach
glow which is not my favorite I don't
remember if I decluttered it last year I
will declutter it this year if it's
still in my collection but the one that
I highly recommend for you guys is this
one right here again I think these are
five or six dollars definitely under 20
this one is called golden light and I
just have to swatch this for you
guys because hello highlight highlight
be on fleek for sure for sure with this
particular color it's beautiful it
really really mimics the two-phase
counterflow the original highlights on
the one side has the pink and then on
the other side it has that cream color
with the gorgeous like gold running
through it that is what this looks like
it has no skipping if you put too much
on honestly it can look a little
textured on your skin so be careful
definitely go in with like a fan brush
with this baby but honestly beautiful
amazing quality and then the other one
that I really like is pink lights and I
feel like this one should be called
lilac lights because it's a beautiful
purpley color but again this one has
that gorgeous formulation really really
soft and buttery beautiful if you really
want a lilac highlight you should get
this one there it is so yes love these
like I said you could probably get every
single one of them for under twenty
dollars so i would mention them because
they really are a favorite of mine
alright moving on the next item i want
to talk about is the mixed wicked dreams
palette oh god i love this i feel like i
never talk about this but this is a
gorgeous palette you are getting 24
eyeshadows inherently yes 24 shadows
they have some satiny shades some
glitter shades and some matte shades I
love how they put this together we have
some neutral shades we've got some pops
of color and then we just have some nice
life
insertion colors amazing love love love
you even have like a match brow bone
color over here so I feel like they just
put this together so nicely this goes
for I believe seventeen or eighteen
dollars highly recommend I mean they're
very very good very similar to the
Knicks ultimate Shadow like formulation
they tend to be maybe a little chalky ur
a little harder to work with than the
ultimate shadows but again this is an
older product the new Knicks ultimate
pallets are a newer product so I think
they just keep getting better and better
with formulation but I really love the
color combination in here alright let's
talk about some balls that you can get
for ebony seventeen or eighteen dollars
apiece at Alta and at sephora i love
these they are from benefits i was
thinking of showing you guys my baby
lips but i realized that i showed those
in my top ten under ten if you don't
like the baby lips if you feel like
they're just not moisturizing enough you
have to check out the benefit Venable
lolly bomb and chat of all these are so
good they're just a beautiful tinted
bulb they stay super moist on the lips
this one right here is lovely bomb I
mean super gorgeous mirrored packaging
it is a pinky lilac a shade then we have
cha cha Beom which is a beautiful orange
color like I love when a product is just
straight-up orange and this one pretty
much a straight up orange now these only
tin to your lips they're not going to be
super super opaque and pigmented i'll go
ahead and Squatch this one so you guys
can see so there is with a few passes
you can see it's nothing crazy but they
are so comfortable on the lips and you
guys they smell a rose you know how I
feel about rose scented things okay love
that and then also been upon which was
the first one I got I always opt for a
red lip I don't know it just seems to
bring some life to my complexion and any
time I have the decision to choose
between like a pink lip and a red lip
it's always red so anyway here is a been
a bomb beautiful very very comfortable
on the lips love these highly highly
recommend checking them out again kind
of pricey for tinted lip balm but I
prefer those over these sugar ones
alright moving on let's talk about the
elf blush palette I think you can get
both of these for under twenty dollars
or at least one of them for under twenty
dollars they're like seven or ten
dollars a piece they look like this you
get a huge ass mirror you have a dark
palette and have a light
let I have both cut their amazing so
pigmented you guys so pigmented very
soft very buttery highly recommend I
know a lot of people talk about these
but they are well worth the money great
for travel you can actually pop these
out in the back and you can put together
your own palette that you want
absolutely amazing and then here is the
lite version it has a lot more peachy
and corley undertones to it i think i
actually prefer the dark palette because
i love those Barry tones but both of
them are amazing another one I want to
talk about that I'm kind of categorizing
as separate because it is separate but
it comes in the same sort of format is
the highlighting palette or the
illuminating palettes beautiful very
very comparable to hourglass ambient
lighting powders this one right here is
very very similar to dim light so anyway
gorgeous very very pigmented very
buttery they give a beautiful
luminescent quality to the skin can you
see that swatch their love them
absolutely worth it in my opinion highly
recommend checking out the illuminating
palette as well alright let's talk about
probably my favorite lipstick liquid
lipstick formulation ever those are the
Lime Crime velvet teens these are so
comfortable i love the color selection I
know lime crime and people don't love
lime crime because there was that huge
security breach I said it the other day
I'll say it again to go ahead and you
know you need to make a paypal account
if you are shopping online you need
paypal so I highly recommend just gained
a paypal account and you don't have
anything to worry about but i love the
formulation on the lip fell the teens
they are so soft and airy and light and
i know some people say that they prefer
like the kat von d or the anastacio i've
never tried the audacity of Beverly
Hills ones but I have tried the kat von
d and i do not like them as much i play
flute and very picky i cannot have these
transferring onto my 14 karat gold
mouthpiece ok hello I don't want
getting all over my flutes and on top of
that I just like how light these are on
the lips oh yes they don't even transfer
all my head join to the kat von d ones
do a little bit and so do the steel ones
so these are my favorites very very
light and airy on the lips this shade
right here is called cement it's just a
great gray shade we have salem which is
a dark chocolaty Brown I've been talking
too long guys and then we have the shade
cashmere which is like amazing
it is this beautiful beautiful kind of
grayish pink shade I also have the shade
riot which is a your lips but better
shame alright guys we are on at the last
item hopefully I got through all 20 I'm
going to be so pissed if I stop this
video and then I go and I find something
else so hopefully we got all 20 items
but the last item is also an eyeshadow
palette from alpha I did see this on the
web site the other day I don't know what
the hell this is called it doesn't say
anything on the back the sticker it
doesn't see anything on the front this
is just a beautiful beautiful eyeshadow
palette that has some gorgeous shades
and gorgeous gorgeous formulation even
better than the prism eyeshadows so if
you can find this I'm going to give you
a close up shot so hopefully you can see
what it looks like it's the one that has
that bright green sort of yellow color
in there I swear to you these feel like
soiled I shadows at least the ones that
have the shimmer in here they feel like
all of I shadows they're absolutely
stunning I don't know what the hell does
that is called I will try and link it
below if I can find it but yeah there
are a few swatches right there love that
palette very reminiscent of at least the
kind of shimmery or luster shades in
here are very reminiscent of the makeup
geek off while I shadows or even the
make up for ever artist shadows yes and
then the matteson here are super buttery
and soft as well so I don't know I don't
know where the hell this palette came
from it's amazing highly recommend on
your twenty dollars yeah we did it guys
ok I hope you enjoyed this video let me
know if you like these kind of videos I
know you guys definitely like to be top
ten under ten and if you want to see I
don't know top 30 under 30 or something
like that I'm sure milli and I can
figure something out and we can film a
video together again so anyway go ahead
