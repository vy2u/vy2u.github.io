makeup list because I'm going to be
doing a skincare chat or a five rules
you should live by skincare kind of
thing so I think that when it comes to
skin care a lot of it is like preventive
and we can actually help ourselves and
the earlier you start the better so
these are five rules you should live by
and they're easy to incorporate into
your daily life and just do it because
you'll be happy you know when you're in
your forties and you look like you know
you're in your thirties so anyway number
one is drink more water and I don't just
mean water I mean just adding more
fluids into your diet a lot of times we
eat a lot of foods and a lot of them are
processed or box things like that which
is okay I eat a lot of processed foods
but what I notice is that there's so
much sodium in those and that I just am
NOT balancing it out with enough fluids
and I started drinking three liters of
water a day probably about two months
ago and I've noticed such a difference
in number one the foods that I'm eating
or drinking I really don't crave tons of
sugary drinks anymore or sodas because I
am constantly hydrated and second of all
my skin my hair everything like that has
been so much better and it has that
extra layer of moisture so you know it's
really really important you don't have
to be drinking water you could just add
extra fluids in each day you know T
things like that it's going to help so
try and just get as much fluid in your
body as possible a lot of the time we
don't realize that we're dehydrated and
we are so very important number to
moisturize and by that I mean it does
not have to be an anti-aging moisturizer
it does not have to be anything fancy
with retinol in it just getting a nice
good heavy duty moisturizer that you can
put on your face at night is huge it is
absolutely necessary one of the reasons
we get wrinkles is obviously from
repetition of moving you know your
forehead or your eyes things like that
but another reason is dehydration
wrinkle
are just areas that are very very very
dehydrated and it's important to try and
plump those back up so that's what I
meant with drinking more water just
extra fluids is that you're going to be
pumping from within but a good
moisturizer is really what's going to
help you and you want to take that down
your neck your decollete then you want
to use a body moisturizer to it is
always our face our neck and our
decollete that look the most aged once
we get up there in the years but
definitely keep your body moisturized as
well it's really really important and
yeah number three bringing products down
your neck so what I mean by that is that
like I was just talking about with the
moisturizer you must bring that product
down your neck and around your day peel
it a this area the face the neck and the
decollete are the most exposed to uva
UVB the sun in general every single day
they are the most exposed we usually
don't have these areas covered every
single day and so it's very very very
important that you bring the products
that you use on your face down your neck
and down to your chest very very
important I think one of the dead
giveaways of someone you know being up
there in age is usually when they have
kind of a crappy neck that's kind of how
you can tell I've seen tons of women
that have gorgeous skin on their face
but you know the dead giveaway of their
age is definitely their neck and radical
at eight so bring all the products that
you use on your face down your neck
every morning every night the next thing
I want to talk about is sunscreen
sunscreen is so important you guys I
know it's very very cool to be tan and
some people like me just can't really
tan I used to self tan and then I
realized it's really just a preference
whether you like pale skin or tan skin I
think tan skin is really really
beautiful I just don't have naturally
tan skin and I burn easily so it's
important to wear an SPF every single
day now you can get some really nice
ones the one i like to use personally
all over my body every day that feels
like a lotion is the Hawaiian Tropic it
smells delicious it doesn't feel like it
has SPF 50 in it it's the sheer touch
mula also the hydration like interlock
one is really really nice they sinking
quickly they smell good they don't smell
like sunscreen they're not Gracie you're
going to forget every morning when you
put them on you think you're putting a
body lotion on you're going to forget
that you have that SPF 30 or 50 in there
which is so important I just can't even
you know stress enough about that now I
also recommend having a separate
sunscreen for your body than for your
face get something a little more
sensitive for your face Neutrogena makes
a nice one the clear skin line is good
anything the shiseido one it's really
really good it's not greasy at all
anything that is going to just give you
that layer of protection from the Sun
really really good and especially if you
can get like a foundation or other
products that have built in SPF even
better so that's number four and number
five you guys the biggest biggest thing
I would say when it comes to anti-aging
things is sleep a lot of us do not sleep
enough and we're exhausted and we're
tired and have you ever noticed that
when you wake up and you haven't gotten
a lot of sleep you literally look like
you have aged like 5-10 yrs that's
because that's kind of what your body is
thinking it's working in overtime and
it's trying to produce you know the sea
boom in your skin and it's trying to
produce the oils and all the good stuff
but it's just exhausted and your glands
are shot and you just you know that's
the way it is so I really really
recommend I'm in college I know how hard
it is to sometimes find time to sleep
and rest but I think it's one of the
most important things when I sleep in on
the weekends and I wake up that's when I
look the best I'm serious I have no
redness in my eyes my skin looks better
everything just you know seems better
and it's true it will help you mentally
and it will help you physically and it
definitely helps with beauty benefits so
those are my top five skincare rules to
live by I hope you guys enjoyed this
definitely try and add these into your
routine you will definitely be
appreciative in the future when you know
you're not aging as much so hope you
guys enjoyed this site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
