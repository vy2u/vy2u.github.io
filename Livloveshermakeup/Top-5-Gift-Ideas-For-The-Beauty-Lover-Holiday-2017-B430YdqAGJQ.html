channel today I wanted to walk you guys
through my holiday 2017 gift guide for
the beauty lover now normally I go a
little ham with this series they usually
make it into three different parts like
last year I did stocking stuffers and
tiny treasures the second set was all
about sets gifts and all that kind of
stuff that you can pick up during the
holiday season and then the third little
series was actually extravagant luxuries
but today I'm gonna make it a little
more simplistic for me as well as you
I'm actually gotten really sick of
watching these videos the past couple of
days because I personally feel like
there's just so much information these
videos are tremendously long which mine
wear last year as well
and I just feel like you know we don't
really know what your friends and family
are going to want for the holiday season
and whether it be for Hanukkah or
Christmas or whatever so I thought this
year I would give you five simplistic
ideas and then you can work off of them
let me know if you like this kind of
format or if you prefer a last year's
format and I can go ahead and I can do
that for next year but anyway let's go
ahead and jump right into it guys so for
the beauty lover the first
recommendation I want to give is a
subscription box you literally can get a
year-long subscription box from Ipsy or
boxycharm or glossy box you might have
to wait on the wait list a little bit
but any sort of subscription box whether
it be cruelty free or just a regular
subscription box is great for the beauty
lover that is the gift that literally
keeps on giving because this person is
going to get a new box every single
month they're gonna feel like it's a
Christmas every month you know
it's just a really really nice idea I
actually give to two of my co-workers a
subscription to Ipsy last year for the
holiday season and they still get their
bags and they still text me and say
thank you so much so and that's the
first of our commendation I want to give
up next I want to talk about luxury
skincare sets now I know not everybody
is this into skincare as I am but
everybody should be taking care of their
skin it doesn't matter what age group
you are in you should be taking care of
your skin so whether you want to give
this to your mom or even your younger
sister maybe is 18 to 20 years old
giving in to really really good skincare
at a younger age is fantastic so they
first said that I would highly recommend
is they come see about me from drunk
elephant it retails for $90 we get these
see from a day serum in there you get
the Umbra sheer physical daily sunblock
you're also getting a little sample size
the bestie jelly cleanser and finally
you are also getting the beat intensive
hydration gel which is a really nice
product as well I don't personally love
it as much just because it's not
hydrating enough for me but most people
I would say with combo oily and normal
skin will enjoy that
another little odd duo that I would
recommend looking into is the power
couple duo that is from Sunday Riley I
purchased that last year this is just a
really really great way to get people
into skin care and the bottles are
beautiful the sets are really nicely put
together and these usually cost around
the 80 to 90 dollar mark so it is going
to be a very luxurious gift but they
will probably know that immediately so
that is the second recommendation up
next I want to recommend a Beauty admin
calendar I don't really care if you're
religious or if you celebrate Christmas
or whatever you celebrate and these are
a lot of fun I'm not a religious person
I love beauty a bitch calendars I like
poke in the hole taking out the little
product and seeing exactly what I get if
you don't want to sneak peek it to
anybody you won't tell them obviously
that you're purchasing it but maybe
we'll be able to crack open each little
slot and you can do like a 12 day or a
24 day whatever you want to do and they
get a new product every single day
during the month of December I mean it's
adorable it's super cute right now there
are a ton out there see Ozzy London has
a nail polish one so if you have a nail
polish lover in your life I mean that
would be a great gift idea
all the Henriksen currently has their
skincare set that is a holiday advent
calendar I actually purchased that one
and I open them all up I love it
and then Nick's actually recently
released a lippy one that I just
purchased for Black Friday last night so
that was definitely something I would
recommend looking into a beauty app and
calendars are just so fun again they're
kind of like a gift that keeps on giving
every single day you get something new
so that is a lot of fun all right guys
the fourth idea I want to share with you
guys is holiday 2017 at beauty products
that are already on sale a lot of people
like to just a gift gift gift during the
holiday season but if you are on a
little bit of a tight budget maybe you
can only purchase one thing but if you
come over and look on Sephora as well as
Ulta right now there are so many holiday
2017 products on sale why are they on
sale because the holiday season starts
early for makeup literally at the end of
August beginning of September they're
already pushing out the holiday sets in
case
so I would say about 45% of these
products will go on sale before
Christmas and honestly it's just
something I would recommend looking into
if you want to get two or three things
for the price of one definitely go check
out the weekly Wow's and these sales
suction at both Sephora and Ulta as well
as different websites that is just what
I would recommend because I think it's
fun to give a lot of gifts during the
holiday season instead of one in
particular but if you want to give one
in particular that's always a great
sentiment like I said a luxury skincare
set like the come see about me is
perfectly packaged it's beautiful you
don't even have to wrap it but a lot of
people do want to do stocking stuffers
and things like that you can get little
sets and kits for ten and fifteen
dollars on these sephora.com website we
highly recommend you guys check out the
sales sections okay and then finally I
want to recommend a luxury hair tool or
a skin care cleansing device now again
you may be thinking that sounds really
boring but actually these are very very
practical whoever you give this to will
most likely use this on a daily basis so
if you have a friend who is constantly
blowing out their hair or curling their
hair or flat ironing their hair maybe
you want to pick them up a luxury hair
tool I recently saw that Dyson just
released like a really really expensive
below dryer for the hair but I've heard
it's fantastic so maybe you want to give
something like that or like a skincare
device cleansing tool all the luna foreo
minis are actually on sale right now
only sephora.com website
I think the minis are on sale the
full-size is on sale as well as the
men's one which is actually comes in
black packaging so that's definitely
something I would recommend it is so
nice to have a cleansing device in your
home I feel like I've used a cleansing
device every single morning whether it
is my little one that I picked up from
Ulta which was only twenty dollars it's
kind of like a dupe for the frail or my
frail or sometimes they still do use my
Clarisonic so that is definitely
something hard to recommend to you guys
and I think would be a lot of fun so
anyway that's it for this video very
short and simplistic but I wanted to
give you guys some ideas so number one
would be a monthly subscription box
number two a luxury skincare set number
three a beauty admin calendar number
four just check out the holiday sales
especially today which is Black Friday
and then finally skincare cleansing
device or an expensive
luxury hair tool so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
