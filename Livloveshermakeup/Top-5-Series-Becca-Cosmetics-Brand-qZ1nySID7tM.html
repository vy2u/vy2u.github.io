thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a wonderful Tuesday
and a good week so far
today's video is going to be a top 5
series video on the Becca cosmetics
brand so I'm gonna be sharing with you
guys my top 5 picks from the Becca
cosmetics brand this was really
difficult
recently Becca has come up with a lot of
new products they have some nice like
lip glosses I love their new Becca
flip pans I like a lot of the products
that they come out with but I had to
narrow it down to five products and I'm
gonna share with you guys which ones
they are so my first pick from the Becca
cosmetics brand would definitely be the
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in the
shade moonstone now most people like the
shade opal or the shade pearl don't get
me wrong I don't have any full size of
opal but I do have a full size of pearl
that one is absolutely beautiful it's
just a cool iridescent white and it's
really really gorgeous on fair skin
tones however moonstone is like a soft
gold or a soft yellow I guess you could
call it and I absolutely adore this one
this is basically my all-time favorite
shimmering skin Perfector press that
they have and their shimmering skin
Perfector press are basically just their
powder highlighters they're beautiful
they're very very creamy and very very
pigmented this is what moonstone looks
like on my finger as you guys can see
and then I'll go ahead and swatch it for
you guys as well but I feel like
moonstone is the one that doesn't get
talked about as much people either
really really rave about what is that
opal or they rave about pearl but this
is definitely my favorite one out of all
of them even though I do have a cool
undertone in my skin I really think this
is absolutely beautiful so there it is
that is my first pick from the Becca
cosmetics brand my second pick from the
Becca cosmetics brand is a primer and
when I first got this I don't remember
being totally totally in love with it
I thought it was relatively good but now
I am trying to use it up before
September first in a project plan video
and I'm actually really really sad to
see this go so anyway I am about right
here as you guys can see about halfway
through the primer this is the Becca
backlight priming filter this is
absolutely beautiful it gives a gorgeous
gorgeous Sheen to the skin and what I
really noticed is with Becca products
they just know how to make your skin
glow you know like they're simmering
skin perfector press there liquid
shimmering skin perfectors those are
very nice also but even their primer had
they gorgeous gorgeous glow to it and I
just feel like anytime I think of the
Becca brand
I think of glowing like glowy skin so
anyway this is what it looks like on the
back of my hand it's a beautiful
beautiful primer it smells it smells so
good it smells like the tropics or like
I reminds me of Hawaii for whatever
reason it just smells so so so good and
it's very very beautiful on the skin I
do think it prolongs aware of my makeup
quite nicely it's not as good as say
like a primer that's a little more tacky
like the vitamin enriched face base from
Bobbi Brown or even the coverall primer
from wet and wild but I do think it is
quite good still and it really really
gives a gorgeous glow to the skin so
this is definitely my second tape from
the Becca cosmetics brand my third pick
is something that you guys may not
really know that is one of my top 5
picks from the Becca brands but this is
their Becca
um beach tint shimmer souffle this is a
cheek product in the shade that I have
is watermelon and moonstone now I have I
think two or three of these this one is
the one that I picked because I
absolutely love this color
it smells like watermelon and I feel
like I do talk about this sometimes I
will use it as a lip product or as a
cheap product like a blush but this is
probably one of my all-time favorite
cream blush formulas ever it's beautiful
as you guys can see it's got a lot of
glow to it you are getting moonstone
mixed in with this beautiful beautiful
kind of watermelon sort of color it
blends out so beautifully on the skin
and I remember when these first released
that's when I got this one this was my
first one smells so good um I remember
when I first got this these were all the
brave everybody was talking about these
they were like oh these are so awesome
they're beautiful on the skin you can
blend them in with your fingers with a
small stipple brush from ELF they just
go on so so so nicely and they don't
disturb your foundation so if you are
someone like me who does wear a lot of
foundation you powder your face quite
heavily and you want to wear a cream
blush but you don't want it to break up
the makeup that you already have on I
think this is absolutely beautiful and
just so so so stunning so this is my
favorite one again probably because it
does have moonstone in it and like I
said moonstone is my favorite highlights
from them
I think this is an absolutely beautiful
cream blush if you can get your hands on
one of these I highly would recommend to
go ahead and do so all right and then
the fourth product that is definitely a
favorite of mine from Becca cosmetics is
their Becca luminous blush in the shade
Tiger Lily
I currently have two of these blushes I
plan on getting the whole entire
collection I sort of have an obsession
with certain blushes where I'm like I
have to get the whole collection kind of
like with the Too Faced the little heart
blushes the love flush 16-hour blushes I
got all of those I'm going to need to
get all of these they're absolutely
beautiful they are a really really
gorgeous they're supposed to be like a
sheer blush but honestly they're super
super pigmented the shade that I'm
sharing with you guys today is called
Tiger Lily this is my favorite one out
of the two that I have I have the other
one which is called Snapdragon which is
a hot coral but as you can see Tiger
Lily is a beautiful kind of orangie
color it blends out really nice on the
skin and even though it is supposed to
be a luminous or like sheer tone blush
it still goes on very very full of
pigment and you have like a little bit
of a sheen and glow in there again becca
is just amazing with their glowy
products so I absolutely absolutely
adore that luminous blush and although I
do like Snapdragon I just preferred this
color on my skintone and the final
products that I want to talk about
probably will come as no surprise it is
a palette from a collaboration that they
did with Jaclyn hill this is the
champagne collection face palette so
this is amazing I love this I've been
using this all week I've shot my stash
and I chose this out it's beautiful
you're getting three blushes and your
two are like mineral matte blushes and
you have amaretto and Pomplamoose and
then you are getting two shimmering skin
perfectors in Champagne pop and Prosecco
pop and then you're getting a luminous
blush in the shade rosy spritz
they are all really really good quality
and really really beautiful I love the
way that they put this palette together
everything is gorgeous I think the color
selection is amazing I like the blushes
that they chose I like the shimmering
skin perfectors that they chose
everything about this palette I just
really really adore and the packaging is
so amazing it's like so so so amazing so
I really really do enjoy this particular
palette and let me go ahead and swatch
for you guys I'm sure you've seen
champagne pop and Prosecco topic there
is a champagne pop there's Prosecco pop
I think these are just beautiful and let
me go
head and swatch of my favorite
shimmering skin perfecter next to those
because I really do still prefer
moonstone but here are the three of them
swatch so here we have champagne pot
Prosecco pop and then there's moonstone
I feel like these two are a little
darker on my skin so I need to use a
little more of a light hands but as you
can see moonstone is really nice and a
true highlight on my skin tone anyway
you guys those are my top 5 picks from
the becca cosmetics brands i would love
to know down below which are your top 5
picks but like I said this was really
really difficult because I do like some
of their lip glosses their new split
pans are amazing they have a lot of
really good quality face products and
overall I would just have to say that
these are like my top 5 ride or dies but
like I said I would love to know down
below which ones are yours
so anyway that is it for today's video
thank you so much for joining me guys
and I'll see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
