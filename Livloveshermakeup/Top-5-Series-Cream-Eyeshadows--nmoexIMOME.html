thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having an absolutely
fantastic day this video is going to be
a continuation on a met top 5 series and
I'm going to share my top 5 cream
eyeshadows with you guys today this was
a viewer requested video so yeah let's
just get right into it the first one I
want to talk about is from Stila this is
the stainless much grant it is a
waterproof eye primer a shadow and a
mine are all built into one this is what
the outer packaging looks like and I
really love the kitten shade oh by the
way this is the shade kitten I really
love the kitten shade from Stila it is
like their best-selling shade I have it
in I shadow single form I have it in
this form and I also have it in like a
liquid illuminator form they all look a
little different but for the most part
it's a beautiful champagne II kind of
gold color and it looks absolutely
gorgeous on all different kind of skin
tones so what I like about this
particular cream eye shadow is the fact
that it's just one of those little twist
up pens I think it's really easy to use
I love putting it on the inner corner of
my eyes underneath my brow bone or even
just right onto my lid I really enjoy
that it does increase and also it's like
movable it doesn't set right away so you
can blend it out if you want to I'll
show you guys that right now it doesn't
set too quickly I really do like those
color tattoos from Maybelline but
honestly they set so quickly that
sometimes you just can't blend them out
this one does set rather quickly but for
the most part you still can blend it out
within the first minute or two and I
just really really enjoys that about
that product so that is my first
favorite cream eyeshadow the second one
I want to talk about is actually from
forever 21 this is the cream eyeshadow
in the shade 4:01 shitake and this is
what the outer packaging looks like and
it's basically like one of those little
pots which is very very normal for cream
eyeshadows I feel like they're either in
stick form or a little pot form and this
is a beautiful kind of pewter topi pinky
purple shade it's absolutely stunning I
love wearing this all over my lid kind
of as a base if I'm going to be putting
a taupe color all over my lid or even a
dark color it's got the best consistency
ever it's so smooth and creamy I've had
this for over a year now and the
consistency has stayed really really
nice and smooth and creamy and it's just
hit beautiful
you guys so there is the color swatch
tout on my hand it's very beautiful very
iridescent I love it I just think it's
absolutely stunning and I love that the
formulation has stayed the same again I
feel like those color tattoos set really
quickly this one does not it stays
rather creamy it sometimes does crease
when I put it on my lid but I like
taking underneath my lower lash line I
think it's beautiful and you kind of set
it with a powder so I like to use that
one more as a base but I think it's
really really wonderful like good job
forever 21 alright moving on the next
one I want to talk about is from
colour-pop of course had to include one
of these in here because they make some
fabulous fabulous cream eyeshadows this
is the want super shock pressed pigment
in the shade too shy which is a
beautiful like mermaid blue kind of
color it's got like an iridescent purple
undertone it's just got tons and tons of
color in here it's beautiful it is one
of their pressed pigments so it doesn't
feel as soft as some of their other
super shock shadows but look at that
color like perfect mermaid blue color
this is gorgeous
all over the lid underneath the lower
lash line it blends like a dream and it
really does set you don't even have to
set this with a powder I just think it's
absolutely beautiful look at that color
how gorgeous is that for the spring and
summertime like and don't even know like
I can't even go there don't even pretend
like that's not amazing it is absolutely
stunning so I absolutely absolutely love
that one and then the next one I want to
talk about is actually from elf
cosmetics
and I love these super lustrous what are
they called no long lasting Super
Lustrous eyeshadows from ELF I could not
pick one out but I finally decided on
the darkest color it doesn't have a name
on it but I know for a fact that this is
the darkest color that they have in
their line but it's this gorgeous it's
similar to like the color pop
consistency it's kind of pillowy and
soft but as you guys can see it's a
beautiful dark kind of brownish color
with like a plum undertone I think it's
absolutely gorgeous and I love the
pigmentation these do not crease zombie
what I like to do with this particular
shade and you can see that it has a
bunch of little silver shimmers in it as
well but what I like to do with this
particular cream eyeshadow is go in and
dab into it with like a brush and go
ahead and put it on the outer V of my
eye I feel like it sticks really really
nice
it looks beautiful and it's like that
perfect like outer-v sort of color it's
like a nice cool / warm brown it's just
perfect for the outer V so that is one
of my favorites for sure and then the
last favor I want to talk about is from
Bobby Brown and I'm sorry but she makes
some of the best long-wear cream
eyeshadow sticks
ever they are so silky they have like
the best consistency and this particular
shade in um what is this one long genu
is that what it's called is that the
shade yeah long chin you this is the
ombre creme stick it's amazing that this
is what they look like so again they're
kind of like that twist up sort of cream
eyeshadow in the shade you guys oh my
god and it goes on like butter like
that's just one little swipe oh my god
it's beautiful because it's completely
matte and I'm obsessed with this color
it's just the perfect slate gray color
can you guys see that beautiful it's got
this kind of matte satin me consistency
to it you can blend it out very very
easily this is probably the easiest one
to blend out if you want to I wear this
on my lower lash line I can get away
with writing this on my waterline I do
have to touch it up throughout the day
because it is so creamy um but that
color and just like the consistency it's
amazing so anyway those are my top of
five cream eyeshadows I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I will have the
second part of my dupes yeah dupe video
second parts coming up after this so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching me and I'll see
you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
