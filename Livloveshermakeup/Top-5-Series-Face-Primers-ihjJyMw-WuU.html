back to my channel I still have a few
that I wanted to do and also I am going
to start doing top 5 series like brands
so basically I talk about my top 5 picks
from Too Faced or top 5 picks from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works things like that so expect
to see some of those videos coming up in
February but today I am just doing you
know a normal top 5 series where I talk
about different brands but one topic so
the topic today is face primers and I've
also P if I wanted to do I don't see a
lot of people do top 5 series on primers
just because I feel like I don't know
sometimes you find a primer and that's
the only one that you want to use
however I have combination skin and I
really like silicone primers that I also
really like hydrating primers so I
thought I would share my favorite ones
with you guys and yeah let's get right
into it the first one I want to talk
about is from Too Faced this is B
hangover RX replenishing face primer it
has electrolytes coconut water and
probiotics it is silicone free you guys
can see I really have used a lot of this
I love it because it is a pump which is
really cool it's definitely like a
liquidy texture like it would run down
your hand like I said it is silicone
free so you're not going to get any sort
of pore filling benefits from this one
when you rub it in it just kind of feels
like a very lightweight gel moisturizer
like that's the best way I can describe
it it smells amazing like coconut and it
really does prolong the wear of my
makeup anytime my skin is just kind of
irritated or I don't know I was drinking
too much and I actually am hungover or
if I don't know you know I just my skin
is looking like lackluster just a little
little dull and whatnot I always use
this primer and I always reach for it I
really do feel like it is replenishing
and it puts the moisture back into my
skin without being too greasy so you
guys can see now that is completely sunk
in it doesn't really leave like a tacky
texture there is a little bit of like
grip there but obviously that's because
it's a face primary it's going to extend
the wear by gripping onto the foundation
but it's not too much it really just
feels hydrating so I absolutely
absolutely love this one the second one
I want to talk about is from you stink
mahant or elias al if you love really
really really really like silicone e
prime
you're gonna love this one it smells
amazing beautiful packaging glass like
jar bottle it's one fluid ounce so
there's actually a lot of primer in here
like I said it smells really good there
are tiny little gold like flakes in here
you can't see them on the skin they're
supposed to like brighten your skin but
overall I think this is just a really
really nice blurring primer to fill in
your pores you can bring it under your
eyes I've used it as an eye primer as
well it just makes everything that you
put on top of your skin or on top of the
primer glide on like butter and it's
just really really beautiful my one
complaint is that the pump kind of broke
on me like it just spits out like the
smallest amount of product but as you
guys can see it is much different much
different it is a lot more different
than the two-faced one because it is so
thick and silicone like I guess I would
describe this as being similar to let me
think of a drugstore wine you know what
this is very similar to the Maybelline
with sour baby skin yeah maybelline baby
skin this is very very similar however
what I do notice is that the baby skin
sometimes it will leave me a little oily
like it's so thick and silicone like
that it leaves me a little oily whereas
this one you guys can see it has
completely sunken on my skin it still
feels silky however kind of have like a
Demi matte finish so it's really really
nice if you have oily skin or
combination skin so that is a second
favorite the third one I want to talk
about is actually a primer built in the
- a like serum it's like a serum primer
this is from NYX this is the honey do me
up it has honey in it it's got gold
flakes and collagen it looks actually
kind of similar to the YSL one this is
what it looks like I've used this a lot
I really like to grab this when I'm just
having skin troubles and I really need
that extra like hydration from the serum
because this really is truly half serum
half primer it's definitely a little
sticky because there is honey in there
but I think that's what makes it a
primer everything else about it just
reminds me of a skincare item but it
does get tacky and you can see like
product that I don't even know if you
can see that but it like to lift stop
because there is honey in here the gold
flakes again are not noticeable on the
skin it has a very natural scent to it
it just kind of smells like an herb
definitely not as good as
to face or the YSL one but I like it
because I feel like it is doing
something for my skin it's giving you
know like beneficial ingredients to my
skin because that's what I do
give ingredients to my skin you guys
know what I mean I feel like it gives
something to my skin and when my skin is
just acting up and I feel like I need
extra hydration or I just need to kind
of call my skin down I always reach for
something like this I feel like silicone
primers are not good when like I'm gonna
flare up or if I'm really breaking out
heavily they just kind of are so thick
that it clogs my pores even more but on
a regular basis I love them don't get me
wrong I think they're fantastic but
sometimes it's nice to reach for things
like the NYX honeydew the app or the
toothpaste one all right the next one I
want to talk about is from Garnier this
is actually a skin care item but it
basically is basically basically you can
say it Olivia basically it's just a
silicone like the sort of primer this
would be great for those of you who have
really oily skin because it leaves a
completely matte finish it's not too
thick let me get some out of here
because I'm almost out alright so that
is what it looks like it is a light pink
color as you can see it's not moving at
all because there is a lot of silicone
in here but this has a lot of pore
filling and benefits to it if you have
dry skin and this is going to patch up
on those areas it is not going to be a
good one for you definitely try the meat
lean baby skin if you have dry skin and
you want to try a like silicone like
primer that would be a better fit for
you this is going to dry completely not
it's going to cover any pores texture on
your skin is fantastic but if you
overuse it it will start to break up in
certain areas so I like to make sure for
my combination skin that I really really
moisturize ahead of time very very well
or else it will break up on my cheeks
but this is a fantastic one I definitely
will be repurchasing when I am out and
yeah really really good from Garnier and
the last one I want to talk about is
from its cosmetics this is kind of a
recent purchase but I am in love this is
the if cosmetics feel the moment
anti-aging ultra hydrating low sensory
awakening primer serum I can never say
that in one breath it's too long of a
name but this has caviar extract
hydrolyzed collagen peptide
ironic acid by the hyaluronic acid
vitamins A C and E argan oil jojoba oil
avocado oil and deep ocean water that
sounds so nice like I love that yeah it
has balancing treatment essential oil
and basically it smells really really
good I think that's what the sensory
awakening thing is because it smells a
very like spa like this is a very very
thick texture if you have aging skin if
you have dry skin you're gonna love this
I cannot use like a whole dropper fault
but it does come with like a dropper or
a palm keeping choose whichever one you
want I like the little dropper
personally I either will put like one
drop or run my hands down the outside of
the little dropper because a whole
dropper full oh it's too much for me it
I will just look like a hot oily mess so
if you are going to use this if you want
to try it and you have oily skin or
combination skin I would say the best
way to try it out is if you're in a
hurry in the morning and you don't want
to throw a moisturizer on it this is
going to moisturize your skin so it's
nice because it's kind of like one of
those on-the-go products where it's like
I don't have time to do my skincare
routine but I know this will hydrate my
skin so what I like about it cosmetics
is that every single one of her products
actually has anti-aging properties in it
it's going to be good for your skin it's
not just like a makeup item if that
makes sense it's kind of like the next
like it's got the serum built into the
primer it's the same sort of thought
with it cosmetics and it says apply over
a moisturizer or on to clean skin so
like I said if you have oily skin
combination skin maybe you want to try
it first just putting it onto clean skin
not doing the moisturizer and then
putting it on because I did that the
first time and I used a whole drawerful
and I was like what what is this this is
this the piece of but when you use
it the right way and absolutely amazing
it's very very thick and I feel silicone
like I don't know if there is actually
silicone in there but what I know is
that there is like just some really
really fantastic like peptides and
anti-aging ingredients in there
and I enjoy it a lot and let me tell you
this little thing is expensive it's a
little plastic bottle I my first
impressions on it we're not that good
however I have used basically like none
of it it lasts forever because you only
need the tiniest amount so anyway those
are my top 5 favorite face primers let
me know what yours are in the comments
below and I will see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
