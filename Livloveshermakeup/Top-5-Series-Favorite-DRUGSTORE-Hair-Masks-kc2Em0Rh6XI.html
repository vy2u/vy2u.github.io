thank you so much for joining me as
always I hope you guys are having a
fantastic day I'm continuing my top 5
series today and I'm actually going to
be talking about my favorite drugstore
hair masks I am a big believer that you
do not need to spend 20 or 30 dollars on
a hair mask um I will say I do like a
few hair masks that are a little more
pricey everyday like the it's a 10
miracle hair mask and also the macadamia
natural oil one those tend to be
depending on the size you get around 30
to 40 dollars and I'm not saying those
aren't good I'm just saying there are
cheaper alternatives and I wanted to
show you guys my favorite ones from the
drugstore today so let's just get
started the first one I want to talk
about
it's from Grenier 50s this is the damage
eraser strength reconstructing butter
this is for distressed and damaged hair
it helps reconstruct and preserve
strength for strong rejuvenated hair it
looks like this you guys can see it's in
this beautiful little orange tub and it
smells amazing it is empty right now I
have already used this one out but I
probably used I would say about maybe 12
of these I've gone through at least 12
of these in the past like two years I
know that's crazy but it smells amazing
typical Garnier fruity sort of scent
just really really um maybe not typical
garden 840 service enjoy feel like they
tend to do very like fruity scents this
one's a little more deep and kind of
like buttery if that makes sense but
this is a very very thick textured
butter and I think it's beautiful no
matter what kind of hair type you have
I do have fine pretty knots in here I
have fine hair but I have a lot of it
but I have hair that just gets way down
really easily and this used to not work
for me actually when before I started
dyeing my hair blonde I actually did not
like the way this worked for my hair it
really kind of weighted down but now
that I have kind of colored my hair and
I have a little more texture in it I
think it's fantastic and I think people
with coarse curly dry hair anybody would
really really like this so this is the
first one that I recommend and you can
get this for under $10 the second one I
want to talk about is from Aussie this
is the 3 minute miracle moist this is
the original one they now have
one for like shine and strength and
whatnot I do not like those nearly as
much as I like the original formula I
just feel like this one is the best
it just has um I don't know it has the
best scent it smells like coconuts but
it also just has like the best I don't
know I really feel like it makes my hair
very very silky and soft I guess if you
want to go with the shine one that one
would obviously make your hair shinier
and the strength one is nice too but
this one has that original kind of
coconutty smell to it and I feel like I
have talked to so many different people
that use this and love this no matter
what texture your hair is no matter what
color it is everybody seems to really
really like this product and I do like
that it's a little squeeze bottle you
literally just squeeze it and dispense
it and this is under $5 at the drugstore
so I highly recommend this one I know
that they do have like I said tons of
different formulas now like branched out
from the Aussie 3 minute miracle
line however I think that the moist one
is the best
I just noticed my hair is extremely
silky and soft when I use that one I
want to tell you guys what the Garnier
Fructis one I noticed that my hair feels
much more strengthened so I feel like
they do different kind of things if
you're looking for softness go for the
Aussie 3 minute miracle moist and if you
want your hair to be a little more
resilient and kind of strengthened
definitely go for the Garnier Fructis
one the next one I want to talk about I
love also this is from Pantene this is
just the original hair masque um it
doesn't have any sort of doesn't really
tell you what it's going to do there are
a lot of Pantene hair mask but this is
the one that I'm talking about it just
says Pantene mask and it says it is for
deep moisturization for powerful repair
of the hair Pantene has two different
kind of sense again I've used this one
up already I'm so sorry I can't show you
guys the formula but it is very thick
and kind of um not really butter like
but it's um I don't know I guess it's a
little more liquidy than say the Garnier
Fructis butter or the 3 minute miracle
but it just kind of it will fall through
your fingers in the shower if that makes
sense but it still is really really nice
I know a lot of people to have coarse
hair love this I love
I have fine here it works it doesn't
strip your hair and none of these
actually strip my hair color so you just
so you guys know because I do full
highlights and I do put bleach in my
hair and none of these actually strip my
color which is great but this one um
Pantene has two different kind of sense
that they do they have that really
really fresh smelling kind of scent that
they do with their products and then
they have a sweet-smelling one this is
the sweet-smelling one I prefer the more
fresh scent however I think this is a
fantastic mask this one is also around
$4 at the drugstore or at Target and I
think it's absolutely fantastic I think
this would work for all hair types as
well alright so the fourth one I want to
talk about I love and I have been using
since I think middle school or high
school this is the Neutrogena
triple moisture deep recovery hair mask
it is a concentrated weekly treatment
for soft lustrous hair this one smells
amazing this one I have not dug into yet
as you guys can see but it is a very
very thick kind of butter like
consistency and it just really spreads
nicely throughout the hair I don't see
it I don't seem like it doesn't feel
like there's a whole lot to do once you
put this in your hair it really just
kind of works its own magic it really
really helps to detangle the hair I am
somebody that the minute my hair hits
the water it tangles like crazy so if
you are looking for detangling purposes
or you want something that really helps
with detangling I highly recommend this
Neutrogena triple moisture that's
probably my favorite thing about it is
the fact that it helps detangle my hair
because I can't tell you guys how
tangled and hot mess like my hair gets
like it's really really bad so
definitely for detangling purposes I
recommend the triple moisture one as far
as just all over kind of strengthening
softening making your hair look shiny
and also detangling purposes the last
one I want to talk about is the L'Oreal
total repair 5 damage erasing balm I had
a hard time deciding whether to show
this one or its sister product which is
like the UM I think it's called the
power Moisture it's more of like a gel
consistency it's beautiful it really
helps to detangle the hair but this
particular one I feel like is a little
better it is a very very thick butter I
did use this last night
and it smells amazing but it is a very
very thick butter and I just feel like
this helps detangle it adds shine it
does basically everything for your hair
so if there was one mask here that I
really really recommend that can give
you everything that you need for your
hair really like strengthen it detangle
helpless shine make it soft I would
recommend the L'Oreal total repair 5
because I feel like this one is just one
of those products that does everything
kind of like the macadamia deep repair
oil or whatever one you know the one
that I was talking about this a little
more pricey that one does everything for
my hair also but this is kind of like
the cheaper alternative so I highly
recommend checking that one out if you
just want um a product that's going to
do it all basically for your hair so
just as an overview the hace 3 minute
miracle moist this is the one that I
would recommend if you want to soften
your hair as far as strengthening your
hair I would recommend the Garnier
Fructis reconstructing butter damaged
eraser as far as just putting like a lot
of shine into your hair and making it
very light resilient I would recommend
the Pantene masque and for detangling
definitely the Neutrogena triple
moisture this is amazing amazing at
detangling that's probably my biggest
issue that I have is tangles and then as
far as basically everything combined
into one I would recommend the L'Oreal
total repair 5 damage erasing balms so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I just thought it would be fun to
come on here and give you guys basically
my top 5 drugstore picks for a hair
masque and yeah if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
