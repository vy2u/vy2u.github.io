blinking or whatever or just like
sitting there so hopefully it's working
this time anyway I am continuing my top
5 series today and it's actually another
collaboration with my friend Kristen or
mama loves mascara here on YouTube I am
so excited to be clapping with her you

inspired me to start my youtube channel

year and a half to two years and she is
the one who literally inspired me to
open up like to the whole world and put
myself out there and put up makeup
videos so she has been a huge part of my
life like she has done big things for me
and it's weird because you know we've
never met each other anything and I feel
like I'm having a fangirl moment but
literally she's just one of those people
we all have that certain youtuber that
we literally like the minute they post a
video we stop what we're doing and we
watched their video she is that youtuber
for me she's a mom um she you know I
don't know I mean she's like a wife she
has a full-time job she's just one of
those really inspirational people and
she means a lot to me and it's like I
feel like she's done so much for me even
though we've never met her anything she
just inspired me to be able to come on
here and do YouTube videos and I
absolutely love her so I am so honored
that she is collabing with me i'm going
to link all of her information below her
Instagram her YouTube channel I highly
highly recommend going over and checking
her out we sweet film very like similar
videos I would say and that's probably
because again she's so like
inspirational to me and I don't know I
just feel like I want to do the kind of
stuff that she does on her channel and
so she does a lot of halls she does
really great reviews she reviews like
new products that come out and she does
demos with them as well so she's just
really really awesome I think if you
guys like my channel you're really
really going to like her channel so i
hope you guys go over and subscribe to
her channel like i said i will link
everything below in the downbar it will
be the first thing you see and yeah I
hope that you guys definitely go out and
check her out and yeah let's just get
started so we are doing top 5 series top
5
mascaras for drug store and high ends
because of course she's mama loves
mascara she could not pick just five you
know and neither can I to be completely
honest so anyway I'm going to start with
my drugstore pics so the first one I
love is the cover girl the super sizer
mascara it looks like this this is the
normal formula and it has a wonderful
wonderful wond that really really builds
up length of volume and definition it's
got kind of slightly smaller bristles at
the bottom and then it kind of stands
out at the top and you get longer
bristles it is a rubber bristle brush
and I love those kind of brushes those
are usually my favorites um but I like
this too because it kind of twirls and
they recommend when you're putting it on
to twirl the brush I just put it on
normally and I notice that I get amazing
volume definition and length and that's
like the trifecta of you know mascara so
I absolutely love that one when I want
more natural lashes I go for my wet and
wild max volume plus mascara this is my
favorite like natural lash sort of
mascara it's really really cheap and
cheerful at the drugstore and it kind of
has the exact opposite of what the super
sizer has like wand wise it basically at
the top it's kind of like hourglass
shaped and at the top of their shorter
bristles and then at the bottom there
longer again it does have a natural or
not a natural a rubber bristle brush but
I really really loved the way this fans
out my lashes it doesn't make them
crunchy or clumpy in any way it's really
really natural looking and beautiful so
I love that another really nice natural
looking one that I also love is from
covergirl the clump crusher by lash
blast this is amazing lash blast is like
that original the original one is like
that orange packaging has that really
big fat like rubber bristle brush that I
feel like everybody uses and everybody
loves but this clump crusher like sister
product to that one is amazing it has
kind of like a spoon-shaped um like
rubber bristle brush and I can't even
open it I don't know what happened but
this won't open so I can't show you guys
but um it has kind of like a spoon shape
brush and it just really really makes
sure that you have absolutely no clumps
like it fans out every single lash
without clumping so I have this in the
waterproof formula I have it
in the regular formula in black and
brown and I absolutely love it so highly
recommend checking that one out another
one from the drugstore that I really
like that is relatively new it's from
Maybelline this is called the falsies
push-up drama I like the regular the
falsies mascara I also like the falsies
was it the flare door the cat i won or
something like that but this one is
really really great a lot of people say
that this transfers on them I've
actually heard really bad reviews about
this on mascara but I personally like it
or really bad reviews on youtube on this
mascara is what i meant to say but i
really like it have a rubber bristle
brush and you guys can see it has tons
and tons of little spikes and i feel
like it really really defines the lashes
and by defining i mean you know it can
look slightly clumpy but it really
really defines them i wouldn't say it's
amazing at lengthening or thickening it
just really really defines them so you
can use two coats of this and it looks
like you're wearing like false lashes so
really really love that one and then the
last one i have is from l'oreal this is
the telescopic telescopic shocking
extensions mascara this is the
waterproof formula i absolutely adore
this one i have been wearing it this
week it is a little difficult to remove
but anything from the shocking
extensions like formulation or anything
from like that it's like brand i guess
you could say i don't know I it's not
like it's not like a separate brand from
l'oreal but like that little like I
don't know that little like grouping
that they did of all the different
telescopic formulas are awesome so the
breasts the brush is awesome because it
really really kind of linked into your
lashes you really really picks them up
like way high like really really goes up
and I love it for lengthening it's just
amazing the original formula is great
too and so is just the telescopic
formula this is like a separate thing
this one is like the shocking extensions
one but the regular formula is also
really good Wow having a hard time
explaining that one for you guys but
yeah I love this for lengthening it
doesn't necessarily thicken or define
the lashes amazingly well but it's
amazing at lengthening all right let's
move on to high-end so my first favorite
high-end
is sorry I'm trying to get these already
over here the my first favor high end is
from Lancome it is the Hypnose drama
mascara and this is in the shade
excessive black I actually have this one
it's like the smaller size I don't even
have a full size of this yet I will
purchase it and get a full size um after
i'm done with this one it smells so good
I don't know how a mascara can smell so
good but it smells amazing but it has a
natural bristle brush which is
interesting because I normally like the
ones that have rubber bristles but it's
nice it's got this tiny little curve to
it like really really slight curve to it
and I feel like it really really um
volumizes and lengthens my lashes really
really well and I don't find that I have
any issues with like smudging or
anything like that so I really really
enjoy the Lancome Hypnose drama this is
like the trifecta of lashes like the
trifecta of mascaras if you want your
lashes to look absolutely perfect the
Too Faced better than sex is my absolute
favorite favorite favorite it's amazing
it lengthens it defines and it volumizes
your lashes it is a natural bristle
brush but it's really really big and
kind of like fluffy and kind of flared
out and I just find like two coats of
this literally it looks like I'm wearing
you know false lashes so this is
probably out of all of these my top top
top favorite mascara all right another
one that is fantastic is from Sephora
this is actually they're like an in-home
brand in-house brand or whatever in home
brand I think the in-house brand this is
the Sephora outrageous curl dramatic
volume in curb mascara first of all look
at that packaging how cute is that
packaging it's like my favorite ever but
it has this really really tiny tiny
short little wand and it is one of those
like rubber bristle brushes and it kind
of turns like you guys can see it kind
of has a little bit of a curve to it or
like a twist this is amazing it really
can get under there like on those lower
lashline and like up here it's just
amazing to get into all the tiny little
corners that some of the other mascaras
they have bigger wands can't and it just
makes your lashes look so long and so
thick I absolutely love it i highly
recommend
checking this out I don't hear a lot of
people talk about this mascara but it
really is amazing and it really does
hold a curl if you're someone who has a
hard time with um you know your lashes
kind of like falling down after even
after you've curled them and you put on
mascara that one really really keeps
them like up alright my third favorite
is from Laura Mercier this is the extra
lash sculpting mascara in black onyx and
you guys this is amazing at sculpting
and by sculpting I mean like defining
like it really really can make your
lashes look quite clumpy if you're not
into that you probably won't like this
one I am into that so I do like it you
guys can see it has shorter bristles at
the like bottom or the base of the brush
and then it turns into longer bristles
at the top and they kind of flare out
it's amazing the formula is so dark and
black like pitch black just awesome
awesome awesome I don't have any
transfer when i use it i absolutely love
it it really really defines them and it
does make them look a little clumpy but
defining is sort of like that you know
it can clump a few lashes together but
it's like you don't look at the person
wearing this and say oh it looks like
they have really liked nice fanned out
lashes it's like they look very dramatic
so that is why I love this one from
Laura Mercier and then my last one is
the they're real mascara from benefits
love this this is kind of what got me
into the whole like rubber bristle brush
like trend it's amazing it just has like
this tiny little like ball at the top
almost that kind of sticks out like
spikes and then it just has a typical
kind of I don't know like mascara one
towards the end there's nothing
particularly amazing and special about
the wand because I feel like everybody
does this now where they have the little
ball thing at the top but they were like
the first ones to do this and honestly
this is almost as good as the Too Faced
better than sex it really really does
almost do the whole trifecta thing where
it volumizes lengthens and defines all
in one so really really awesome product
I believe you can get it in a waterproof
formula as well and then I have one
extra thing that I want to mention and
it is a lash primer so technically is
not a mascara but this is the Urban
Decay subversion thicker longer stronger
lash
this lash primer makes any of the
mascaras I just showed you 10 times
better i'm not even kidding it really
really works well if you guys watched my
declutter video that i did that had
eyeliners and mascaras in it you would
have seen that i actually went ahead and
donated like three or four different
lash primers because this is the best
one I have ever find found it has this
like wonderful little brush it's a very
very fluffy and nice and it's got tons
and tons of little fibers on it the
fibers don't get in my eyes they don't
bother me i have heard that contact lens
wearers contact lens wearers where's
hahaha people wear contacts have no
issues with this whatsoever which is
awesome because then it doesn't irritate
your eyes I don't personally wear
contacts um but you know I've heard that
being an issue before like when you put
fibers on it like can get inside your
eye on your contact or something that's
really scary but it does hurt like you
know what I mean it hurts when you have
fibers in your eye obviously but anyway
this is amazing it really makes any
mascara and any of the ones that I just
showed you work ten times better so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I so encourage you to go over and
check out Kristin's channel like I said
she's been such an inspirational person
