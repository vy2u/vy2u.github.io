especially the ones that make youtube

different during the winter time but
hers are her fall and winter top five
lipsticks um but I will link her video
of her top five in the downbar as well
so you will see her Channel and then her
video and hailey is just one of those
people that you would describe as sweet
as pie literally she is sweet as a piece
of pie okay like she is just the
sweetest person I have never met someone
as nice as her to be completely honest
she's one of the nice people ever and
she's just so generous and sweet and she
just gives you the best comments and
like she just is such a nice good person
if that makes sense like she just really
really genuinely is a good person and I
really really appreciate that I try to
be a good person and I can see that she
genuinely is like a good good sweet
sweet person and I really really love
that so um if you guys are interested in
checking out her channel I highly
recommend you go over and leave a
comment tell her I say hello and
definitely subscribe if you are
interested in the content that she puts
out I think she's just sweet as pie and
just such a good person I just I don't
know I know I keep repeating myself but
she really is just one of those people
that it's like she is a genuinely good
person and I really enjoyed that about
her so um
anyway without further ado let's just
get into my top five lipstick picks for
the fall so the first one that I have
swatched right here is and the one
little I'm wearing on my lips is from
Maybelline and it is the Maybelline
matte lipstick in touch of spice 660
touch of spice this is a gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous lipstick it looks like
this it's kind of got this beautiful
ready mauve sort of color to it it has a
beautiful finish to it I feel like I'm
wearing nothing on my lips right now
that is how wonderful it feels on the
lips it definitely dries matte but it's
gorgeous it just feels so so light on
the lips and you guys can see three of
the colors like going down that way this
way kind of looks similar but this one
definitely has more of a mob undertone
and I think it is so Universal and
gorgeous on everybody skin tone if you
have very very fair skin like I do it
definitely picks up that mob undertone a
little more if you are tan you get a
little more of a um like ready nude kind
of color on your lips it just looks
gorgeous on everybody and you can get it
at the drugstore three of my pics are
from the drugstore so you know really
really easy and accessible but overall I
think this is gorgeous and it is so
Universal and flattering on every single
person so that is my first favorite my
second favorite is that really deep
vampy color right there and that is from
urban decay it is the revolution a
lipstick in the shade shame and it comes
in gorgeous gorgeous packaging like this
kind of like a mirrored kind of thing
going on and this is what it looks like
in the packaging and it's super scary it
is like very very intimidating very very
dark but when you put it on you really
can wear this super sheer you can put it
on with a lip brush and just kind of
build it up so that it's just like a
touch of berry on your lips or you can
really really put it on and wear it deep
and vampy but the reason I like this is
because it is like very very dark and I
do like to go very very dark and vampy
but I find that if it doesn't have a
berry undertone with my skin tone it
just looks too dark too scary and um you
know usually lipsticks that are really
really deep like this tend to have
a chocolaty undertone and sometimes that
just looks like too much on my skin tone
so this is definitely a favorite of mine
if I am going vampy I love this color
you can see it is not a matte finish it
definitely has a lot of shine to it and
it really does stay kind of moisturizing
on the lips which I feel like you can't
say about a lot of deep deep deep dark
colors so I absolutely love that my
third favorite is from Revlon this is
the super lustrous lipstick in 006
really red and this is a matte and this
is a beautiful perfect red shade that
has an orange undertone and I think it
looks absolutely stunning on so many
different skin types our skin tones
sorry it looks beautiful on those that
have like an olive undertone a fair skin
you know it looks gorgeous on basically
everybody I feel like it's a very very
Universal flattering shade and normally
I tend to grab four Reds that have like
a blue undertone this one definitely has
that kind of warm or orangie undertone
but it is absolutely stunning it is a
matte but it's not as comfortable as the
Maybelline touch of spice formula I feel
like that one just really feels like
nothing on the lips whereas this one you
could definitely feel on the lips but it
definitely doesn't feel heavy if that
makes sense so really really nice
formula gorgeous color I feel like you
can wear this all the way through any
season really you could wear this in the
follow you could wear it in the winter
spring summer like you know there's a
time to wear this color and it's all the
time so that is my third favorite my
fourth favorite is from bite Beauty this
is the butter cream lipstick in Heather
and that is the one that you are seeing
right there this is like one of those
colors oops I got it on my finger it
definitely has a peachy like apricot
sort of undertone to it but it still has
that really really gorgeous like neutral
color thing going on like the undertones
definitely pulled that peachy color but
it still can go really any sort of like
it you can wear it really any time of
year but I feel like for the fall
especially it's such a neutral beautiful
color that you can wear and I really
like that it kind of pulls those peachy
apricot e undertones because it makes it
just so so wearable so that is right
there this is definitely the most
comfortable
of all of them to where even my lean
touch of spice even more comfortable
than that this buttercream formula from
bite beauty is ridiculous it literally
feels like you're wearing a Revlon lip
butter on your lips so definitely the
most comfortable to wear you can see
it's very very like I feel like it's
very flattering anything was peachy and
kind of apricot e undertones I feel like
is extremely flattering especially if
you have fair skin so that is my fourth
favorite and then the last one we have
down here is also from Revlon also from
the super lustrous lipstick formula and
this is a creme it is in 5-10 very rich
and this one definitely has the berry
undertone out of the three that you see
from here so that is very rich it's
definitely got that beautiful kind of
Sheen to it very very comfortable to
wear on the lips not as comfortable as
they bite Beauty one but a gorgeous
gorgeous color and I feel like these
three shades right here at the
Maybelline touch of spice the bite
Beauty a buttercream and this one are
definitely the most wearable and easy to
you know it's like it's like you're
putting a color on your lips but it's
not like over like compensating like
you're not putting a read on you're not
putting on Urban Decay shame but these
three are the most neutral wearable
shades for fall and I absolutely love
them so there is a close up of all the
colors i absolutely love these lipsticks
all of them are comfortable and easy to
wear and i really love the finishes of
all of them but overall I would say the
two most comfortable are the bite Beauty
buttercream and the touch of spice from
Maybelline this is an amazing lipstick
and that is the one I'm wearing today
and I've been wearing it for about three
hours and it still is like put you know
it's like stays put I would say you
definitely need a lip liner with Urban
Decay shame really read probably lip
liner at the other three probably can
get away with not wearing one but over
all those are my top favorite to fall
lipsticks I hope you guys enjoyed this
