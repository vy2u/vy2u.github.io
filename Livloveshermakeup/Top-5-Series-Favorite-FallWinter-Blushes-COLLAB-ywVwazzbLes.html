blushes so it's kind of like a top five
series a lot of you been asking me

series on foundations or eye palettes or
blushes things like that so this one is
going to be blushes and I'm super super
excited if you do not know who Laura or

pronounces her name I want to say it's
Laura but it might be like Ora uh-huh

right down in the description bar and

supporter of my channel in general and I
really want to get back and be a

these big beautiful eyes she's gorgeous
and she refused everything this girl's
like on top of her game okay like if you
guys think I'm good at reviewing new
products you have to check out her
channel because I think her past like 15
to 20 videos have literally been reviews
and swatches or lip swatches on new
products that have like recently
released within the last month which is
amazing sorry if I'm looking down all
these blushes are following out of my
lap but um yeah so she's amazing I
really really love her she's a huge
supporter of my channel and I am support
of her channel and I hope that you guys
will mosey on over to her channel and
check her out she's really wonderful
very sweet and I'm so excited to be
doing this video with her so this is
going to be our top 5 favorite fall /
winter blushes so I am going to swatch
them all for you and show you guys um
during the fall and winter seasons I
tend to go a little darker on my cheeks
I really really like a very fair skin so
I really like the look of like peachy
colors and pink colors on my cheeks but
during the fall and winter seasons I
tend to go a little deeper a little
and I love the way it looks so the first
one I want to talk about is from Milani
by the way four out of five of mine I
realized are actually drugstore which is
awesome so the first one is from Milani
this is the baked blush in red vino 0-9
I could not get that little tag off it
drives me insane
I need like Google or something but this
is what it looks like and it is a
beautiful beautiful burgundy shade and
it's got tons and tons of gold shimmer
in it and it is baked so it doesn't have
like the smoothest softest texture but
man oh man is this baby pigmented can
you guys see that and I think this is
just such a gorgeous color for fall I
really love all the Milani blushes have
like a little bit of Sheen to them so it
kind of like picks up some iridescent on
your cheeks and I think it's so gorgeous
and this color just screams fall to me
can you guys see that it is so beautiful
let me blend it out a little more it is
so beautiful and of course you can blend
it out so that it looks like almost like
a light pink color on your cheeks or it
can be that kind of dark kind of ready
maroon sort of Berkeley shade and I
think it's beautiful for fall so that is
my first favorite love that love those
Milani face blushes if you guys have
never tried those out you really should
because they are awesome
alright the second one is from L'Oreal
and this is actually a cream blush or
like a mousse boba I think yeah mousse
blush what I would call it it's kind of
like one of those it kinda reminds me of
like The Dream bouncy blushes from
Maybelline except better
I hope so this is from L'Oreal it is the
visible lift color lift blush in rose
gold and you guys the formulation of
these is amazing but look at that color
this is about as pinky as I kind of like
to go when it comes to fall and when it
comes to like going into winter
especially this is probably as pinky as
I like to go but look at that iridescent
that gold in there it is amazing and
it's not chunks of glitter it is
literally like so finely milled in there
it is stunning so let me show you guys
that is what it looks like oh yes yes
yes yes let me go ahead and swatch it
for you and this is like so true to the
name rose gold like this is rose gold
isn't that beautiful oh I love that
and I think it's so beautiful on the
cheeks it can go with anything you know
if you go with oh and to reach over for
this if you go with anything you can go
with um you know like a smokey eye it
can go with neutral colors that you like
to wear during the fall and winter
season it really goes with everything
and I think it's absolutely stunning and
I just love the color and the texture is
so like you can see it kind of picks up
like a mousse but it blends so easily
you can blend this with your fingers you
can blend this with like a stippling
brush that's usually how I do it with
mice FL small stippling brush but it's
gorgeous amazing formula really
beautiful rose gold I know a lot of
people associate that with like spring
and summer but I'm telling you rose gold
is beautiful during the fall as well so
love love love that one the third one I
want to talk about is from Amy K and
this is the one that is I don't believe
this is high-end I'm not quite sure what
this is I don't know if it's drugstore
price but I got this in a glossy box and
it is the a meet a makeup and it is the
artist color powder blush in 1:08 and it
is like this gorgeous dusty rose
terracotta shade it almost looks like a
bronzer but it really can't be used as a
bronzer because it has too much
terracotta and kind of rosy tones in it
but you guys this is how love pigmented
I feel like I'm doing a lot of swearing
in this video sorry but that is what it
looks like it is so pigmented I don't
know what it is but this looks so
beautiful on the cheeks for fall I feel
like it goes with anything um I like to
especially pair this with like my
chocolate bar palette from Too Faced
because every single like shade in there
goes beautifully with this any kind of
neutral eye that you have will go with
this blush isn't that gorgeous it's just
like this dark terracotta sort of dusty
rose I don't know it's got some sort of
pink undertone in there that just really
really stands out but it is absolutely
stunning and I really feel like that
would show up on everybody skin tone no
matter if you're really fair or if you
have deeper skin alright the next one I
want to talk about is from ELF and it is
the pressed mineral blush and if you've
never tried any of these press mineral
blushes from Alfea
our super pigmented very very creamy
they feel like a high-end blush but this
shade is in six three to four wanderlust
and it looks a little similar to red
vino when it's washed out you can see
this one has a little more of a pinky
mob undertone but next to red vino they
look sort of similar but this one has
really really finely milled silver
shimmers on it so it is different than
red vino which has a ton of those like
gold shimmers in it but it is beautiful
it just has this beautiful kind of
purply mob undertone and it is just
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous on the skin
and I was having a hard time deciding
between this one and the other one from
elf which is their three dollar studio
blush in I believe it's called blushing
Rose is that what it's called it's a
beautiful deep kind of very very
mob-like deep with like gold shimmer
it's really beautiful too but I ended up
picking this one because it has this
finely milled um silver undertone in it
and it just like when you turn like your
cheeks it just picks up like this
shimmer and glow and iridescent it's
gorgeous so I love love love this blush
for fall it does pick up and kick up a
little bit of powder but overall
gorgeous and you can't go wrong it like
three dollars alright and then if the
last one I want to talk about is from
covergirl this is like old school
covergirl they still sell these this is
one of my favorite like blush
formulations from the drugstore this is
the covergirl classic color blush in 590
soft mink they have a lot of different
colors I know Emily Noelle eighty-three
talks about this color a lot it is
beautiful I really want to get a
close-up so you guys can kind of see it
looks kind of unusual and different and
kind of basic in the pan but I'm telling
you guys this picks up the most
beautiful silver undertone on the cheeks
and I know that sounds like gue silver
undertone that sound very attractive
okay
but it is gorgeous and these are not the
most like I don't know they're not very
like cushiony or sock when you rub your
finger on it it smells like your grandma
like it is old school old school I
actually kind of really like this end
but you just like old school old school
and it doesn't have like any phenomenal
texture to it or anything like that it
kind of picks up a lot of product at
once but can you guys see that shade do
you see when I turn it you can see those
beautiful like silvery undertones
it is special this is a special blush
and I have to say the formulation of
these classic color blushes from
covergirl they have I think only three
or four shades and I have all of them my
other favorite is rose silk it's
beautiful but they all have the same
kind of silver iridescent to them every
single shade it's just a different like
the basic shade is different but the
undertone is always like that beautiful
silvery kind of shade so that is it on
my hand can you guys see that like there
is no need for highlight when you are
wearing this blush it is just absolutely
stunning so those are my top 5 fall /
winter or fall going into winter blushes
I absolutely love these I would say
definitely for fall this covergirl one
and probably the L'Oreal visible lifts
are like go twos and then once I get
into winter definitely I start popping
out those darker darker colors like the
red me know and the Wanderlust from out
so I love these I think they're
beautiful I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm happy that four out of five of
mine I was literally I have so many
blushes you guys and I was going through
and I was like wow four out of five of
my favorite like fall winter seasonal
blushes are drugstore that is awesome so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I really really encourage you to
go and check out Leora or Laura's
channel I like I said it will be linked
right below in the description bar it
will be the first thing you see you
really should click on her link um but I
encourage you to definitely go over and
check her out she's just so sweet and
she's got she's very like organizational
and together she's got all her stuff
planned out

like beautifully beautifully edits her
videos she edits her she beautifully
edits she edits her videos very
beautifully there you go if I edited my
videos I could have edited that little
weird segment of awkwardness out but I
don't but she edits really really
beautifully and she recently did a bite
Beauty like lip swatches video and it
was like so precise and to the point and
she got through like all of them in like
under five minutes and I'm like that is
the kind of stuff I want to be watching
I don't like watching these videos to
have these long-ass interactions they go
on for like 25 minutes and then you
don't even like get into what you want
to talk about of course it's different
when you're doing collab video because
you got to you know give a shout-out to
the person before you start the video
but she's just like so precise and to
the point and I find her abuse very very
like informational and great so I highly
recommend you boys you go you guys go
check her out

a wave for me and a hug and I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
