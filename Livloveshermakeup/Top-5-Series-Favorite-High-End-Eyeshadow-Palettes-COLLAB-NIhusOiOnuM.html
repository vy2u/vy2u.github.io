let me move my camera little um welcome
back to my channel thank you so much for
joining me I hope you guys are having a
fantastic day I'm very excited for this
video I am do another collab with my
friend leora if you guys watched my top
5 favorite um fall blushes that i posted
about a week or week and a half ago you
would have seen that i had done that
collab with my friend laura i love her
she's so beautiful she's just wonderful
she gives the most precise awesome
reviews ever I mean I anytime I want to
see a good review on a product or lip
swatches or things like that I go to her
channel because she reviews everything
and she does it really really well so
anyway we were talking and I reached out
to her and asked her if she wanted to go
ahead and do another collab and this
time we thought we would do high-end I
shadow palette so this is going to be
our top 5 series on high end I shadow
palettes I did recently what was it two
or three days ago film am I declutter
video for my high-end eyeshadow palettes
if you guys want to see all of the high
high-end I shadow palettes that I have
or that I had you can go check out that
one but I thought that this one would be
really really nice to do now because it
was kind of like in correlation if that
makes sense like you guys would see all
the pallets that I had and then now you
can see my top 5 out of all those so I'm
really excited to show me you guys um I
don't think a lot of these will come as
surprises I am one of those people that
does love color don't get me wrong but
when it comes to favorite favorite
products they're usually ones that are
everyday sort of looks or everyday sort
of colors if that makes sense you know
things that I can get a lot of use out
of so don't get me wrong just because I
don't have a lot of pallets in here that
have huge pops of color doesn't mean I
don't love color these are just the ones
that I love the most and that I reached
for the best and i highly recommend you
guys going and checking out liras
channel she's really really wonderful I
can't wait to see what her pics are i
will link her name and her channel right
in the description bar and then i will
link her video on her top five series
for a high-end eyeshadow palettes right
below that so I hope you guys enjoyed
this let's just get right into it the
first one is going to come as no shock
this is probably the only high-end
eyeshadow palette that I have started to
hit pan on this is the two-faced natural
I get this is like the old packaging
the cardboard box and this is what it
looks like and you guys can see I love
this palette boom gone hit pan hit pan
almost hit pan almost hit pan you know
like it's crazy i have really really
really used this i probably had it for
about three or four years and any time I
want a really really natural easy fast
look I jump in here I know exactly what
shadows I need to go for for the certain
look that I'm trying to create I take
Velvet Revolver as my transition I'll
put heaven all over my eyelid up to my
brow bone silk teddy right on my lid
I'll do push up in the crease or honey
pot and it's just like such an easy look
that I know I can do and I can create
within like five minutes hold on guys
sorry about that let me turn that off
yes my ringer is classical music of
course anyway where was I yes so I was
saying that you know I love these colors
I know exactly where I you know can go
with this palette like I don't have to
think about I don't sit there and look
at and I'm like where's like what kind
of color should i use today or where
should i go i'm just like literally it's
so fast it's so easy i don't even have
to think about it could probably use
this eye palette with my eyes closed
like that I know exactly where every
single shade is if my eyes are closed is
crazy so I absolutely love this one
highly recommend you will get the most
natural looking beautiful put together i
love when you use this highly recommend
alright the next one is the naturally
pretty palette from if cosmetics i love
this this is all matte it is absolutely
gorgeous and again if you like kind of
softer looks if you like um you know I
shadow looks that aren't too out there
and crazy you can get a little crazy
with this don't get me wrong they have
some beautiful beautiful like you know
blue colors this new our color is
gorgeous but overall this is a very soft
beautiful beautiful sort of pallet my
favorite section is over here you get a
lot of those pinks and those kind of
warmer orangi shades and I think it's
just absolutely stunning I know exactly
you know what I can do with this palette
and how long it takes me to put a look
together again I feel like my favorite
palette I always know you know
it's like I can grab them and be done
with a look in like under five minutes
which is why they're my favorites
because I've done the look so many times
but with this one I'm normally tend to
reach for these colors over here I love
that shade warmth sunset sunrise soul
full these are gorgeous gorgeous shades
that I really don't have a lot of in
different palettes and I just love the
undertones I think they're beautiful and
like I said you know you get into these
kind of cooler tones over here and you
can definitely do you know a blue on
your lower lash line or things like that
but overall beautiful just light light
makeup I especially love this during the
summertime these colors over here really
like with a nice little bit of a tan not
that I get very tan but if I can get a
little bit of a tan these colors over
here are just absolutely stunning so I
highly recommend checking this one out
absolutely absolutely stunning I don't
really use the what is they call
transforming pearl shade down here you
can use this to make any of these a
little more shimmery instead of Matt but
i think they are beautiful matte and
they're not even that map they feel a
little more like a satiny sort of
texture they're just absolutely lovely
so that is my second favorite my third
favorite is from a two-faced and it is
the semi-sweet semi-sweet semi-sweet
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette it
looks like this I had a hard time
deciding between this one and the
original chocolate bar palette I have
both I really love both but I go into
this one a lot more and it's just a
little more I don't even know if I can
say it's a little more cool toned or a
little more warm toned because this
one's a little more all over the place
than the first one the first one kind of
has just neutral warm shades in my
opinion but this one you get like you
know you can get like those shades over
here like peanut butter and then you get
new good up there like there's a mix of
cool and warm tones and it just has
everything I look for in here I tend to
be one of those people that sometimes
looks better with cooler tones I
sometimes look better with warmer tones
just depends on what I'm wearing and
things like that but overall anything
that I want I feel like I can dig in
here and get absolutely anything
literally any time that this goes with
absolutely everything and I feel like
the first chocolate bar palette does as
well if you're looking for a really
versatile palette that will just
combined with anything that you're
wearing any kind of Julie you're wearing
whatever you're wearing
these pallets go really really well with
that but I just reach for this one more
and like I said that shade up their new
good peanut butter these are absolutely
gorgeous they're beautiful as transition
shades the only shade in here that
doesn't really like impress me that much
is this pink sugar shade it's kind of
like a glittery weird wet shave can you
guys see that basically like doesn't
even show up but you can wear it you
know on the inner corner or on your lid
and it is pretty but overall there's not
a lot of mrs. in this palette actually
all of my favorites there's really no
mrs. in my opinion I think that's why
their favorites is because I can take
them and I know that I actually do enjoy
every single shade in every single one
of them um but beautiful beautiful I
mean to face you guys know two faces my
favorite high-end brand in general but
two faced their formulation of shadows
are beautiful i love the way they blend
i love how creamy and soft they are and
this semi sweet chocolate bar palette is
just absolutely stunning I feel like I
can you know create any sort of look I
want to with this so that is my third
favorite my fourth favorite is from
lorac it is the lorac Pro palette I feel
like this is for anybody that wants to
create any sort of look I know I keep
saying that but literally this is
absolutely stunning you've got your
matte shades on the top and then your
shimmers on the bottom it is neutral it
is beautiful you can go anywhere with
this some of my favorite shades are the
shade right here called Garnett a slate
is gorgeous you guys the pigmentation on
here is ridiculous the mask feel just as
nice as the shimmery shades the shade
right here called gold is beautiful you
see what I mean like you can grab any
color from anywhere on the palate and
somehow they still will all go together
nicely and I feel like you can't do that
with every single palette I literally
could pair these three shades right here
that I just grabbed from different areas
on the palate I could pair them together
and make a beautiful I look you cannot
do that with every single palette I feel
like that is something that I can do
with this palette and I love that
because you just can't go wrong there's
nothing you can do with this palette
that will go wrong if you are going to
create an eye look it is going to come
out pretty because they all look good
together so I absolutely love this if
you have never played around with the
lorac Pro formula it is even creamier
and
minted then the two-faced formula which
is hard for me to say because i love the
two-faced formula the only thing i want
to say is that these do blend too easily
and they will blend right off your eye
if you / blend so just remember not to
over blend and you just can't go wrong
with this one don't get me wrong the
mega Pro pallets are beautiful I don't
have the first one you guys did see that
I reviewed the second one but this one
is your everyday no matter what kind of
palette that you can go to its sleek
it's easy you can bring this to travel
like I mean look how tiny that thing is
it is just it's the best of the best so
highly highly recommend checking out at
the lorac Pro and the last one is also
from Too Faced no surprise there are
three pallets from to face but it is the
return of sexy palette a lot of people
did not like this I love this ballot it
is absolutely gorgeous you get basically
little sections of different colors you
get some cool tones some purples and
warm tones I think that these are so
buttery they can be over blunted the
formula is a little different than what
the typical to face formula is like but
you can see they're very very shimmery
and shiny and there's something so fun
about that like every single shade in
here has shimmer and it's like really
really like boom kind of out there I
would say this is probably the most
colorful palette that I that is a
favorite of fine um but it really really
doesn't look as bold on the eye you can
really really kind of make it a little
more subtle and I feel like they're just
so easy to put together like you know
the shades just kind of combine really
really easily you don't have to blend a
lot the formulation is a little
different than some of the other two
faced palettes you do get a little more
fallout underneath the eye so you might
want to put you know a little tissue
under there or something like that and
every single shape does have shimmer so
all of these brow bone shades up here do
have shimmer but you know what when i'm
feeling like wearing shimmer and i want
to wear a little bit of color but i
don't want it to come out like messy or
if I just need something that I know how
it's going to come out I go to this one
because it's awesome and they basically
have paired it into three little
sections so you can choose which color
section you want and if you're doing
this one you know you can use this and
you're crazy sat on your lid
that is your definer that wherever you
know up on your brow bone it basically
puts it into three little sections or
you can mix them and match them but I
usually like to just go by section and I
just I love this palette so I hope you
