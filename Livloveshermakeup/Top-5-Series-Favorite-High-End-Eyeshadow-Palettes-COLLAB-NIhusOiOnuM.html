let me move my camera a little uh
welcome back to my channel thank you so
much for joining me I hope you guys are
having a fantastic day I'm very excited
for this video I am doing another collab
with my friend Leora if you guys watched
my top 5 favorite fall blushes that I
posted about a week or week and a half
ago you would have seen that I had done
that collab with my friend Laura I love
her she's so beautiful she's just
wonderful she gives the most precise
awesome reviews ever I mean I anytime I
want to see a good review on a product
or lip swatches or things like that I go
to her channel because she reviews
everything and she does it really really
well so anyway we were talking and I
reached out to her and asked her if she
wanted to go ahead and do another collab
and this time we thought we would do
high-end eyeshadow palettes so this is
going to be our top 5 series on high-end
eyeshadow palettes I did recently what
was it two or three days ago film a my
declutter video for my high-end
eyeshadow palettes if you guys want to
see all of the high high-end eyeshadow
palettes that I have or that I had you
can go check out that one but I thought
that this one would be really really
nice to do now because it was kind of
like in correlation if that makes sense
like you guys would see all the palettes
that I had in the now you can see my top
5 out of all those so I'm really excited
to show you guys um I don't think a lot
of these will come as surprises I am one
of those people that does love color
don't get me wrong but when it comes to
favorite favorite products they're
usually ones that are everyday sort of
looks or everyday sort of colors if that
makes sense you know things that I can
get a lot of use out of so don't get me
wrong just because I don't have a lot of
palettes in here that have huge pops of
color doesn't mean I don't love color
these are just the ones that I love the
most and then I reached for the most and
I highly recommend you guys going and
checking out Leora's channel she's
really really wonderful I can't wait to
see what her picks are I will link her
name and her channel right in the
description bar and then I will link her
video on her top 5 series for high-end
eyeshadow palettes right below that so I
hope you guys enjoyed this let's just
get right into it
the first one is gonna come as no shock
this is probably the only high-end
eyeshadow palette that I have started to
hit pan on this is the Too Faced natural
eye kit this is like the old package
in the cardboard box and this is what it
looks like and you guys can see I love
this palette boom gone
hit pan hit pan almost hit pan almost
hit pan you know like it's crazy I have
really really really used this I
probably had it for about three or four
years and anytime I want a really really
natural easy fast look I jump in here I
know exactly what shadows I need to go
for for the certain look that I'm trying
to create I take the Velvet Revolver
as my transition I'll put heaven all
over my eyelid up to my brow bone silk
teddy right on my lid I'll do push up in
the crease or honeypot and it's just
like such an easy look that I know I can
do and I can create within like five
minutes guys yes my ringer is classical
music of course but anyway of our site
yes so I was saying that you know I love
these colors I know exactly where I you
know can go with this palette like I
don't have to think about I don't sit
there and look at it I'm like where's
like what kind of color should I use
today or where should I go I'm just like
literally it's so fast it's so easy I
don't even have to think about it could
probably use this eye palette with my
eyes closed like that's I know exactly
where every single shade is if my eyes
are closed it's crazy so I absolutely
love this one highly recommend you will
get the most natural-looking beautiful
put together I love when you use this
highly recommend alright the next one is
the naturally pretty palette from if
cosmetics I love this this is all matte
it is absolutely gorgeous and again if
you like kind of softer looks if you
like you know eyeshadow looks that
aren't too out there and crazy you can
get a little crazy with this don't get
me wrong they have some beautiful
beautiful like you know blue colors this
newer color is gorgeous but overall this
is a very soft beautiful beautiful sort
of palette my favorite section is over
here you get a lot of those pinks and
those kind of warmer orange shades and I
think it's just absolutely stunning I
know exactly you know what I can do with
this palette
and how long it takes me to put a look
together again I feel like my favorite
palettes I always know you know it's
like I can grab them and be done with a
look in like under five minutes which is
why they're my favorites because I've
done the look so many times but with
this one I normally tend to reach for
these colors over here I love that shade
warmth sunset sunrise soulful these are
gorgeous gorgeous shades that I really
don't have a lot of in different
palettes and I just love the undertones
I think they're beautiful and like I
said you know you get into these kind of
cooler tones over here and you can
definitely do you know a blue on your
lower lashline or things like that but
overall beautiful just light light
makeup I especially love this during the
summertime these colors over here really
like with a nice little bit of a tan not
that I get very tan but if I can get a
little bit of a tan these colors over
here are just absolutely stunning so I
highly recommend checking this one out
absolutely absolutely stunning I don't
really use the what is they call
transforming pearl shade down here you
can use this to make any of these a
little more shimmery instead of matte
but I think they are beautiful matte and
they're not even that matte they feel a
little more like a satiny sort of
texture they're just absolutely lovely
so that is my second favorite my third
favorites is from a Too Faced and it is
the semi-sweet semi-sweet - semi-sweet
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette it
looks like this I had a hard time
deciding between this one and the
original chocolate bar palette I have
both I really love both but I go into
this one a lot more and it's just a
little more I don't even know if I can
say it's a little more cool toned or a
little more warm toned because this
one's a little more all over the place
than the first one the first one kind of
has just neutral warm shades in my
opinion but this one you get like you
know you can get like those shades over
here like peanut butter and then you get
nougat up there like there's a mix of
cool and warm tones and it just has
everything I look for in here I I tend
to be one of those people that sometimes
looks better with cooler tones I
sometimes look better with warmer tones
just depends on what I'm wearing and
things like that but overall anything
that I want I feel like I can dig in
here and get absolutely anything
literally anytime that this goes with
absolutely everything and I feel like
the first chocolate bar palette does as
well if you're looking for a really
versatile palette
we'll just combined with anything that
you're wearing any kind of Julie you're
wearing whatever you're wearing like
these pallets go really really well with
that but I just reach for this one more
and like I said that shade up there
nougat peanut butter these are
absolutely gorgeous they're beautiful as
transition shades the only shade in here
that doesn't really like impress me that
much is this pink sugar shade it's kind
of like a glittery weird wet shave can
you guys see that basically like doesn't
even show up but you can wear it you
know on the inner corner or on your lid
and it is pretty but overall there's not
a lot of misses in this palette actually
all of my favorites there's really no
misses in my opinion I think that's why
they're favorites is because I can take
them and I know that I actually do enjoy
every single shade in every single one
of them um but beautiful beautiful I
mean to face you guys know to faces my
favorite high-end brand in general but
Too Faced their formulation of shadows
are beautiful I love the way they blend
I love how creamy and soft they are and
this semi-sweet chocolate bar palette
it's just absolutely stunning I feel
like I can you know create any sort of
look I want to with this so that is my
third favorite my fourth favorite is
from lorac it is the lorac Pro palette I
feel like this is for anybody that wants
to create any sort of look I know I keep
saying that but literally this is
absolutely stunning you've got your
matte shades on the top and then your
shimmers on the bottom it is neutral it
is beautiful you can go anywhere with
this some of my favorite shades are this
shade right here called garnet slate is
gorgeous you guys the pigmentation on
here is ridiculous
the masks feel just as nice as the
shimmery shades the shade right here
called gold is beautiful you see what I
mean like you can grab any color from
anywhere on the pallet and somehow they
still will all go together nicely and I
feel like you can't do that with every
single pallet I literally could pair
these three shades right here that I
just grabbed from different areas on the
pallet I could pair them together and
make a beautiful eye look you cannot do
that with every single pallet I feel
like that is something that I can do
with this palette and I love that
because you just can't go wrong there's
nothing you can do with this palette
that will go wrong if you are going to
create an eye look it is going to come
out pretty because they all look good
together so I asked
love this if you have never played
around with the lorac Pro formula it is
even creamier and more pigmented than
the two-faced formula which is hard for
me to say because I love the two-faced
formula the only thing I want to say is
that these do blend too easily and they
will blend right off your eye if you
over blend so just remember not to over
blend and you just can't go wrong with
this one don't get me wrong the mega Pro
palette are beautiful I don't have the
first one you guys did see that I
reviewed the second one but this one is
your everyday no matter what kind of
palette that you can go to it's sleek
it's easy you can bring this to travel
like I mean look how tiny that thing is
it is just it's the best of the best so
highly highly recommend checking out to
the lorac Pro and the last one is also
from Too Faced no surprise there are
three palettes from Too Faced but it is
the return of sexy palette a lot of
people to doubt like this I love this
palette it is absolutely gorgeous you
get basically little sections of
different colors you get some cool tones
some Purple's some warm tones I think
that these are so buttery they can be
over blunted the formula is a little
different than what the typical
two-faced formula is like but you can
see they're very very shimmery and shiny
and there's something so fun about that
like every single shade in here has
shimmer and it's like really really like
boom kind of out there I would say this
is probably the most colorful palette
that I that is a favorite of fine um but
it really really doesn't look as bold on
the eye you can really really kind of
make it a little more subtle and I feel
like they're just so easy to put
together like you know the shades just
kind of combine really really easily you
don't have to blend a lot the
formulation is a little different than
some of the other two-faced palettes you
do get a little more fallout underneath
the eyes so you might want to put you
know a little tissue under there or
something like that and every single
shade does have shimmer so all of these
brow bone shades up here do have shimmer
but you know what when I'm feeling like
wearing shimmer and I want to wear a
little bit of color but I don't want it
to come out like messy or if I just need
something that I know how it's going to
come out I go to this one because it's
awesome
and they basically have paired it into
three little sections so you can choose
which color section you want and if
you're doing this one you know you can
use this and your crease that on your
lid that is your definer that wherever
you know up on your brow bone it
basically puts it into three little
sections or you can mix them and match
them but I usually like to just go by
section and I just I love this palette
