blog spot her blog spot is that if any
saiful I'm spot I'm sorry her blog and I
follow her on Instagram so anyway I hope
you guys go and check her out but anyway
without further ado let's get into my
top five I was going to go 10 I keep
wanting to do that top five highlighters
so you guys are going to see a trend
here I love gold highlighters and I feel
like girls who have fair skin usually
try and like stay away from gold
highlighters because they think it's for
people who have like tan skin or medium
to deep skin tones but let me tell you
gold highlighters on fair skinned girls
it's beautiful it's beautiful on any
kind of skin tone so anyway the first
one I want to talk about is actually a
product that I reviewed before it got
all like hype tough and things like that
I remember reviewing this like last
spring yeah it is the Laura Geller I'm
baked gelato mm-hmm swirl illuminator in
gilded honey and I'm going to be picking
up the other color of this soon it's
kind of like a pinky color is called
ballerina I really didn't like this when
I first did a review on it I don't think
the texture is come like very soft it's
not completely soft I don't find it to
be buttery I don't think this is super
super easy to blend but this color you
guys this color is stunning and it's so
so pigmented that I just am okay with
the fact that it's not the you know most
creamiest thing and it is a little rough
to the texture or yeah the texture is
rough so I'm okay with that because look
at that it glides on beautifully and I
just love it I really really love it I
know that this got really popular once
i'm amber easy i think that's how you
say her name on instagram she started
wearing this and then a lot of people
started like commenting on my video and
I was like this has been out for a while
you guys but yeah it really is a
beautiful beautiful product you don't
get a huge ton amount a ton amount of I
cannot talk today you don't get a huge
ton of product in this little pan
however I have had this like I said
since last spring and I have not gone
through it yet and it is one of my
favorite highlighters so yeah there it
is or just gorgeous gorgeous I just love
the color alright the next one I want to
talk about which is also kind of in the
Gould family it's a little more cool
toned though this is from makeup
revolution this is the vivid baked
highlighter in golden lights absolutely
stunning it's got kind of like a white
base with tons and tons of gold shimmer
and you guys this is like I'm sorry you
guys know I've been having a cold that
I've been dealing with so please excuse
me but
I'm sorry do you see that this I'm even
means us watch it all the way down to
you see that what like what how this is
like a 499 product ok this is four
dollars and ninety-nine cents like on
the altar calm website how oh my god the
pigmentation the blend ability the
pigment is everything about it is
luscious and perfect and look at that
color so you're getting this kind of
like opalescent a cool-toned white color
with tons and tons of gold shimmer Oh
beautiful on fair skin beautiful on
medium skin tones everybody is going to
love this and if you don't like this
particular shade they also have one in
peach lights and pink lights I prefer
pink lights over peach light speech
lights just just didn't have the same
sort of formula as the golden lights and
the pink lights but pink lights is a
little more of a um I guess you could
say violet or purpley sort of shades
also very beautiful but this one is just
a Holy Grail you get so much product in
here and like I said it's under I
believe five dollars if not it's
definitely under ten dollars you can get
that on the makeup revolution website um
they are basically exclusively kind of
sold in the UK but you can also get it
on the elder calm website alright the
next one I want to talk about is kind of
one of those that's not super super
crazy pigmented but it just leaves a
glow to the skin it is the josie maran
argan enlightenment in new and I think
Vale beautiful packaging and this is
what the product looks like and again
you can see it kind of has like a
champagne gold color to it and it does
have sparkles in here there are chunks
of sparkles but they are so easy to
blend out on the skin so let me go ahead
and swatch that for you guys so you can
see it's beautiful it's got that
champagne kind of color but still it has
that um a little bit of golden color in
it and it's beautiful when I first wore
this for the first time I was like ooh
like I don't know that almost looks like
a broad like it's not like a bronzer but
it definitely deposited color on my face
which when I'm highlighting I'm usually
just trying to put a lighter color not
necessarily a darker color but if you
use this with
an brush like over a bronzer or things
like that it is just absolutely stunning
so I highly recommend checking that one
out from josie maran and one of it is
sort of similar if you guys want sort of
like a dupe for it from the drugstore is
the hard candy this is the so baked
bronzer in 129 T key but I swear I am
very very fair and this is a highlight
on me so this is what it looks like I
believe you can get this for under ten
dollars and it has the same sort its I
have to say it is creamier and a lot
more pigmented than the josie maran one
but it gives the same sort of glow so
it's got a little bit of color in it I
would say the Josie man when it's a
little darker but this one also just
gives a beautiful sort of glow to the
skin so there's the josie maran it's a
little darker and then there's the hard
candy one absolutely gorgeous I'm sorry
if these makeup remover wipes I'm
leading in my hands super super wet
hopefully the swatches are coming off
okay um but anyway yeah so if you don't
want to purchase the josie maran one
because it is up there i think it's like
$35 the hard candy one I in my you know
opinion looks the same when you apply it
on the cheeks or you know on the high
points of your face and the last time
that I want to talk about I love this I
use it as a highlighter a lot of people
use these for different things this is
the hourglass ambient lighting powder in
ethereal light it is a cool toned yes
the first cool toned one that I have
shown absolutely just like an opalescent
ethereal kind of color and it is very
very white cool toned like I'm really
liking this is not going to work for
every single skin tone in my opinion I
would say if you have medium to deep
skin tone this might not show up
amazingly on you the actual formula of
these ambient lighting powders it's not
like they're made to be highlighters but
I do wear this shade like pretty much
exclusively as a highlighter when I you
know set my under eyes with it I just
find it a little too brightening because
it is so cool tom so go ahead and swatch
that for you guys so you guys can see
and again you may not be able to see
very well because these are supposed to
be those multitasking sort of products
that you could use to set your makeup
you could
to set your under-eyes you can use it to
highlight but that is the lighter shade
that they have in the ambient lighting
um powder category i guess i'm pretty
sure that is the lightest one the other
one that's really light is more of like
a yellow toned so if you think that the
white toned one like this one will be a
little too obvious on your skin if you
want to say like your whole face with it
i would go with um the other one i
cannot remember what it's called you
guys I'm so sorry but anyway I do love
this one it was very very pricey but
there's a lot of product in here and
yeah it's probably my favorite I guess
cool toned highlighter because all the
other ones are golden yes I was just
talking with my friend leora about this
the other night she was saying I just
can't wear golden highlights I just
don't like them they don't look good on
my fair skin tone I'm like really are
you sure because like I love golden
highlights on my skin of course the day
that I'm wearing like a silvery one on
my face I'm saying it but seriously
golden highlights look absolutely
beautiful and went illuminating on any
sort of skin tone so anyway I hope you
guys enjoyed this video like I said
Rosemary's accounts and everything for
her blog and her Instagram and her
YouTube page will be below I'm sorry if
I was kind of hacking up some
disgustingness during this video I'm
trying to get over this little head cold
or whatever it is that I'm dealing with
um but I hope you enjoyed this and thank
you rosemary for making this video with
me and yeah I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
