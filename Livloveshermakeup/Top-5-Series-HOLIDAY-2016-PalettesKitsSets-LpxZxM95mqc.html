with you guys on my top five my top five
I know a lot of you have been asking for
this particular video and I think that
right now is a good time to go ahead and
put it out before stuff starts to sell
out so I'm showing with you guys my top
5 series on holiday kits pallets and
sets so far if things change i will
update you guys but these are them as of
right now so the first item and this is
the only lip item which is very
surprising is the urban decay of Vice
blackmail lipstick palette I chose this
over my Too Faced lipstick it over my
beauty kits which never happens I think
that urban decay just blew it out of you
know out of the park out of the water
out of the car out of water but with
this particular palette is beautiful i
love every single shade I think they're
all so comfortable to wear and normally
I would only reach for lip palettes when
I'm traveling but I have been reaching
for this all week literally like I
pulled this into my shop my stash drawer
that's how often I reached for it so
highly recommend checking this out it's
a beautiful beautiful palette I did it
pick up the junkie palette as well I
will be doing a review for you guys on
that but I do prefer this one alright
moving on it the next item I want to
talk about is from our glass now this
should come as no surprise if you
watched my review it is the ambience
Lighting's to real light palette a lot
of people do not like this palette I am
a huge diehard fan of the ambient
lighting bronzer blush whatever
formulation so this is worth it to me I
know that the pant sizes are small you
don't get a whole lot of product in
there it's eighty dollars but let me
tell you I reached for my 2015 holiday
pellet all of the time I travel with
that almost every single time I travel
so I really do like this year's palette
I do not think it is friendly for every
single skin tone I think that if you
have medium to dark skin this is not
even going to really show up that much
on you a lot of people were saying that
these are very warm toned and I do agree
with that but as someone who is very
like cool complected I can still wear
these and I still think they look
beautiful so that is definitely number
two number three is something that I'm
sure you guys have been wondering I have
not even reviewed this yet this is the
two-faced grand hotel cafe I did pick up
the macaroons palette I picked up the
chocolate shop palette and this one and
yes i will definitely review this for
you guys but so far out of all three i
would recommend this one I was very
prize because I thought they would put
all of like their time and effort into
the chocolate shop palette or the
macaroons but these are amazing so in
here you are getting three different
palette they are scented very very
lightly they don't smell like coffee or
anything like that one of them is just
average and kind of like the chocolate
shop palette and that is the peppermint
mocha one so this is what they look like
the shades are very pretty in this
particular palette the blush is very
pretty however everything in here is
very very firmly pressed and nothing
special in my opinion now these two
pallets on the other hand the eggnog
latte and gingerbread cookie these
reminds me of the chocolate bar palette
and that's like the kind of quality I'm
looking for you know so here are the
shades in the eggnog this is what eggnog
latte looks like really beautiful like
forest green color in there nice smooth
buttery blushes really impressed with
that and then the gingerbread cookie as
well very impressed with this it has a
gorgeous bronzer in here probably the
best bronzer I've ever used from to face
literally and here are the colors so if
you were curious as to what is my top
pick as far as like the Too Faced
pellets are concerned definitely
definitely beat grand hotel cafe alright
moving on this will come as no surprise
this is the tart color wheel Amazonian
clay blush palette this had to be picked
this year it has been it's amazing they
really really stepped up their game this
year they went outside of their comfort
zone they did some cool tone shade
darker shades they did some warm tone
shades they popped into highlighters
they made the you know packaging more
sleek and compact probably one of the
best Amazonian clay blush pellets that I
own from Tarte and I would say it's
right up there with each artist palette
so if you own that one I would highly
recommend checking this one out I'm not
gonna spend too much time talking about
it it's just perfect alright moving on
the last item we have here is it the
last item 1 2 3 4 yeah the last item is
the Bobby Brown Bobby to glow shimmer
brick palette I am in love with this
this is absolutely beautiful I think
this is only available for vib rouge
members I'm sorry if I'm bringing up
items that are only available for vib
rouge but honestly if you are vib rouge
you should spend a 65 or 75 however much
this was to get this because these are
beautiful I am wearing this shade wild
rose today and bronze mixed together on
my cheeks and then I do have gold on as
my highlight they are stunning on the
skin they don't really like you know
when you touch them they feel like
sandpaper they don't look super buttery
they're not super buttery but I'm
telling you they go onto the skin at
like magic so this is a beautiful
beautiful palette definitely the best
highlighting palette that has launched
for the 2016 season in my opinion and
now I have a runner up for you guys if
and I basically okay stop Olivia contain
your thoughts all right so what I want
to say is if you are looking for a good
blush palette but you do not want to
send the money on the torch or you don't
want to spend any money on the hourglass
I highly recommend checking out the
Sephora collection blushed bronze and
ready to blow I got so excited about
this as you could probably tell just now
this is a gorgeous palette and I almost
included it in the top five because it's
stunning I'm so impressed with this
you're getting a cool tone blush a warm
don't blush you're getting a bronzer and
a pretty decent highlight I feel like
this would work for the majority of skin
tones it's gorgeous there so oh my god
they're so buttery and smooth and creamy
and there's like barely any kick up it's
just amazing I am so amazed at the
quality of these but if I had to choose
I would still choose the hourglass I
would still choose the tart but if you
don't want to spend the money you need
to check this baby out so anyway that is
anti guys I hope you enjoyed this top
five series video thank you so much for
joining me as you can tell i get a
little i get a little heated sometimes
when I talking about things that i love
but i really do love the items that i
just showed you guys like i said i will
be doing reviews on all of the two-faced
items and then also on the junkie yes
junkie lipstick palette but these are my
top five picks as of right now so let me
know down below in the comments section
