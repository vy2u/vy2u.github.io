channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day I recorded two videos this morning
one of them you're gonna see a little
later and I probably look a lot more
fresh-faced
and better because that was recorded
this morning I normally record my videos
in the morning I recorded a thirty to a
minute long video for you guys this
morning on all of the hub nutrition
supplements I talked about all 14 I went
into life in-depth reviews on all of
them and it never recorded I literally
came home I just got off work I got off
work early and I was like oh it's a
great night I'm gonna go pick up some
food relax at home and just to realize
that that video I had never recorded and
I look like and I really wanted to put
out a video for you guys today on the
hub nutrition supplements so what I'm
gonna do is kind of reformat this just
to fit like my knife if that makes sense
I really am not in the mood to go and
sit down for another 32 minutes go
in-depth and review all of those
products again so what I'm gonna do is
that video will be coming in the middle
of March that is the next time that I
have a date open you guys know I
pre-planned my schedule so the next time
that I do have a day that is free is in
the middle of March so I promise you I
will be recording that video I'm so
sorry I don't know what happened I'm not
great with like these electronic sort of
things so I really don't know what
happened but I thought it would still be
fun for me to get on camera even though
I'm not gonna be making like a really
in-depth look at these products I
thought it would still be fun for me to
make you know what a top 5 series video
out of it I can go ahead and show you
guys my top 5 picks from home nutrition
I really really like hummingbird
nutrition they are sold exclusively at
Sephora you can also go on to the hub
nutrition website I'm not affiliated
with them in any way shape or form I am
going to leave a link below it's not a
referral link it will just bring you to
these Sephora hub nutrition webpage so
you guys can kind of look over the
supplements they aren't rather pricey
they range anywhere between 20 and 60
dollars and have tried all 14 of them so
I promise I will be doing a big in-depth
review on all of them I thought
what was gonna go up today but I think
just to kind of get this video out there
because they still do want to talk about
them and people have been really really
interested it'd be fun to show you guys
my top 5 because I definitely have a top
5 from the brand and yeah I want to say
really quickly just a little disclaimer
I'm not a doctor or a nutritionist or a
health care professional please always
consult your doctor before you start a
new supplement or medication or anything
like that
so let's just get right into it the
first one I want to talk about is the
one I get the most questions about this
is the how nutrition skinny bird it is
their weight-loss program I'm not trying
to lose weight I weigh anywhere between
a hundred and 115 pounds like on a
day-to-day basis I think right now I'm
around one hundred seven hundred eight
and I am short and five two so I am very
comfortable with my body I'm very happy
with how my body looks um one thing that
I'm trying to change is my nutrition
like the stuff that I reached for I just
don't eat very healthy honestly I just
don't eat very healthy and one thing
that I noticed is that I think my blood
sugar spikes at certain times during the
day either it's really low or it's
really high and I start to get intense
cravings this supplement completely like
kills off those cravings so that I don't
go and eat a huge whole like party thigh
bag of chips or like the whole container
of ice cream or something like that I
get really really intense cravings for
really really salty food or really
really sugary food I don't think this is
going to make you necessarily drop a ton
of waste because that's not what has
happened with me but it will help you
with certain cravings and I think that
that's huge because when I get cravings
I want like the crappiest food like the
crappiest of the crappiest so anyway in
here you get five HTTP which is supposed
to help with stress eating your green
tea extract which gives you a metabolism
boost you have caralluma in briana which
helps with appetite suppression and then
you have chromium which controls blood
sugar and I think that's what they hear
that like that
I think that's within your that I really
like
so what like controlled my blood sugar
that's what keeps me out like a steady
basis so that I don't go and start like
grabbing for really really crappy foods
so I really really love this
it says pounder like lovers they come
and go skinny bird has been formulated
to keep unwanted pounds in check our
unique SMAC formula has been designed to
reduce stress eating boosts metabolism
help curb appetite and help control
blood sugar all of you have nutrition
supplements are pure and potent they are
non-gmo gluten-free GMP certified they
are sustainably sourced and they have no
artificial colors or preservatives
you're supposed to take three capsules
per day 30 minutes before eating I can't
stomach these in the morning if I don't
have any food in my stomach I can't
actually stomach these so what I
personally do is I take two of these a
day I'll show you what the actual
capsules look like they don't smell bad
or taste bad at all they're pretty small
so they should go down pretty easily and
I take it 30 minutes before lunch and 30
minutes before dinner and I swear to you
guys this helps so much with cravings
cravings cravings cravings this killed
on the spot so absolutely love that that
is definitely one of my favorites the
next one I want to talk about is the hub
nutrition here comes the Sun now this is
not one that I think everybody needs to
take I already have like pretty low
vitamin D levels I got my thyroid check
my thyroid was fine but my vitamin D
levels were low and we think it is
associated with my autoimmune disease I
have lupus and we think that it's
associated with that but I am on a
vitamin d2 supplement which is actually
a prescription supplement it's a very
high dose of vitamin d2 but what really
surprised me about this one was that
this has vitamin d3 in it which is
something that you don't hear about as
often and I really really enjoy it and
my vitamin D levels have gradually been
going up so my doctor actually
recommends that I continue to take these
so it says charge up without some burns
here comes the Sun is high in vitamin d3
that is regarded as superior to vitamin
d2 it supports the skin mood immune
system and calcium absorption and you
take two soft gels daily with food
they're super super small you want to be
really really careful with vitamin D you
never ever want to take more vitamin D
supplements than you need none of these
products you should take more than they
recommend but especially vitamin D
because this can lead to toxicity in
your blood
string that's what my boyfriend told me
he's doctor so you want to be really
really careful with them but yeah these
are great I really really enjoyed them
and again I haven't noticed a difference
in like my skin or my hair or anything
like that beauty related but I noticed
that medically my vitamin D levels are
going up gradually so this is definitely
it one of my favorites the next one I
want to talk about is if you want nice
shiny soft hair I swear to you the hum
nutrition red carpet supplement is
amazeballs it is for glowing skin and
shiny hair I don't notice it does
anything for my skin honestly but I have
noticed a huge difference in my hair
like just it being shiny and being
manageable my share of tangles like a
rat's nest this the second it hits the
water it tangles up so bad you guys know
I don't really heat style my hair but I
do bleach it and like maintaining long
bleached hair is very very difficult and
I feel like blond hair looks quite dull
a lot of the time so sorry mellow puffy
sleeves
I feel like blond hair looks a very very
dull most of the time so I really really
like this supplement for it like keeping
the shine in my hair if that makes sense
so this said it's a vegetarian red
carpet formula that includes the perfect
balance of GL GL aala and vitamin E and
it says it has blackcurrant and
sunflower seeds and it will give you
glamorous hair and glowing skin this is
one of the cheaper ones on the website I
believe this is $25 you take two soft
gels daily again I take them with food
just so that it doesn't upset my stomach
and I really really like them they're
really easy to take they just look like
little tiny like rubies so I really
really like them I prefer these I don't
know about you guys but I prefer soft
gels to like capsules because I feel
like capsules like get stuck in my
throat a lot so I really really like
these ones and I have noticed a huge
difference in like the manageability of
my hair and also the shine in my hair so
definitely definitely recommend the hum
nutrition red carpet supplements alright
the third one I want to talk about I
associate with basically keeping my skin
relatively clear I have taken a month
off of this supplement and I swear to
you
I broke out like crazy and I am one of
those people I do get hormonal acne so I
have acne along my jawline on the outer
perimeter of my face especially when I'm
in the middle of my cycle I break out a
lot this helps so much like I said I
took a month off during the summer and I
had huge big painful like sore cystic
acne bumps all over my jaw started this
again and within two weeks my skin was
relatively clear so I love this they
taste horrible they're huge they're hard
to swallow and they taste horrible they
taste smell everything is horrible okay
this is what they look like they're huge
they have green algae extract in them
and they also have like selenium zinc
copper things like that which are
supposed to be very very good for
clearing up your skin and also detoxing
your body it says it detox is your
bowels your kidneys your lungs lymphatic
system all that kind of stuff but I just
noticed that it really really keeps my
skin nice and healthy and I used to get
a lot of breakouts along my chest and
back area and I don't have those anymore
whatsoever since I've been taking this
supplement so I really love the UM
nutrition daily cleanse like I said you
get sink in here selenium copper broken
cell wall Gloria algae yeah you have MSM
which is really good for your joints
your hair your skin your nails it also
has a beet root extract grapefruit
extract milk thistle extract some really
really good vitamins in here that will
keep your skin nice and healthy and
clear so I love the hub nutrition daily
cleanse and then the last one that I
want to talk about is a relatively new
one to me it is the hub nutrition Big
Chill this helps you cope with cope with
and remove the signs of stress you get
sixty vegetarian slash vegan capsules in
here and it says don't let stress room
your looks
stress releases hormones that make us
look unhealthy break out in age Big
Chill contains adaption adaptogens that
are clinically researched for the
ability to stop you reacting to stress
so you can keep a clear head and stay
beautiful during demanding conditions
you just take one of these daily I take
it with dinner I really notice a
difference with these and I did within
two weeks of using these I noticed that
I was just a lot more calm I do have
ADHD I think a lot of people know that
I'm a very hyper
and especially later at night when my
ADHD medication starts to wear off I
start to get really really like I'm not
I don't want to say anxiety-ridden
but a lot of the times ADHD symptoms can
be similar to anxiety you just feel very
like high-strung and when my medication
starts to wear off II start to feel like
that so taking this with dinner has
really really helped just kind of remove
and help me to cope with signs of stress
so I just don't feel like I'm just like
you know I don't move around as much I'm
just a little more calm and also it
helps my head from being like having
like 20 channels going at once
I always describe my ADHD that way like
having a television in your head and
having like 27 different channels going
at once like Animal Planet and MTV and
you know like that's how I describe my
ADHD to people it's like the best way I
can describe it I constantly am thinking
of so many things and this really really
helps to kind of turn off like half of
those channels if that makes sense so
overall I really really like what it
does like mentally for me but also
physically I feel like it kind of just
calls my body down so I'm not like
literally crawling up the wall so anyway
you get 500 milligrams of rhodiola
extract in here and yeah it seems to be
working really really well for me by the
way none of these have like starch yeast
wheat gluten corn milk eggs shellfish
preservatives anything like that they're
all vegetarian and vegan vegan capsules
as well so this one is a vegan capsule
so it's not a soft gel form it's small
it reminds me Ebert it doesn't taste or
smell bad really really liked it and I
like what it's been doing for me so
anyway I apologize that I couldn't get
that big long on nutrition video up I do
have other ones here as you guys can see
like turn back time and college in love
and when I do that in depth these are
the in depth of video on all of them I
will make sure that I touch on all the
ones that you know kind of are working
for me these two in particular the turn
back time and college in love I'm not
sure yet like I have a few of the
supplements that I'm just like I need
more time with them and then some of
them just straight up didn't work for me
and I never repurchase so anyway these
are my top five have a nutrition stuff
I hope that you guys enjoyed this video
I promise the big review in depth look
at Tom nutrition supplements will be up
in the middle of March thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
