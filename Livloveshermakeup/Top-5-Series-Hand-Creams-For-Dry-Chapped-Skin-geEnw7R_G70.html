video for you today and I am talking
about my top 5 picks for hand creams for
dry chapped skin I've been dealing with
some really dry skin on my wrists my
knuckles my hands even somebody pointed
out in a video actually more than one
person was like are those swatches on
your hand I'm like no girl that's just
my hand
that's just my skin okay like it's super
super cracks like an alligator but
anyway I wanted to share the products
that I have been using to kind of help
heal this like whatever this is that's
going on here it's gotten a lot better
in the past couple of days and I think
that this is a good video to put out
while it's still cold and like winter
time because I feel like in the summer I
don't deal with any dryness on my hands
and a lot of people don't so I wanted to
get this video up ASAP so I have five
hand creams to talk to you guys about
and then one little bonus item at the
end that's not a hand cream but works
wonders so the first one I want to talk
about is the Mario Badescu hydrating
hand cream this has hyaluronic acid in
it it's absolutely fantastic and absorbs
really quickly if you need a hand cream
during the day that doesn't leave a
residue on your skin this is the one
I've gone through I think three tubs of
this and I'm pretty much out of this one
it reminds me of my apartment in New
York I don't know why well I do know why
it's because when I first got my first
bottle of this not this one this was
like my fourth third or fourth anyway
when I first got my first bottle I was
using it and I lived in my apartment in
New York yeah I was a sophomore in
college and I have loved it ever since I
just keep repurchasing over and over and
over again so I love that one the second
one I want to talk about is from
Neutrogena so you can get this at the
drugstore it is the Norwegian formula
hand cream it is fragrance free and just
a DAB heels dry skin this is a very very
interesting hand cream it has the
consistency of like aquaphor or Vaseline
but it syncs them right away which is
really really nice the Norwegian formula
from Neutrogena is fantastic they make
it really really awesome lip balm as
well how many times can I say fantastic
they're really really good this
particular line within the line is a
very very good so it says it is so
concentrated that only a small amount
instantly leaves dried cracked hands
noticeably softer and smoother after
just one application and I agree with
that so you can wear this during the day
I prefer to wear it at nighttime but it
is very good all right the next one I
want to talk about I'm not quite sure
you can purchase this if anybody knows
the link it below so everybody can see
but this is the rituals ginkgos secret
jinxing and ginkgo biloba curing hand
palm and the reason I don't know where
you can purchase it is because I got it
in my cloths backs and I love it it is
actually quite heavily fragrance and to
be completely honest when my skin is
really really dry and cracked and eczema
prone I don't like to reach for anything
with fragrance because it just irritates
my skin even more this is really heavily
fragrance but it doesn't bother my hands
it doesn't sting or anything like that
it has a nice scent it's kind of natural
and like baby powder s good but overall
it's fantastic it really is a balm so
you want to wear this at nighttime I
mean it would drive me crazy if I wore
this during the day and got it all over
like my flute or paper work or something
like that that would drive me crazy so I
can't deal with the super super oily
like formulas and I feel like the hand
creams I'm sharing with you guys today
are a little more humectant and
moisturizing and oily I prefer usually a
heavily fragranced hand cream that sinks
in immediately but again when my skin is
very very chapped and dry I just can't
hang with those hand creams so anyway
really really love this one like I said
if you know where you can get this link
it below it smells great it is literally
like a balm for your hands so it's a
very very thick and I love the way it
coats my skin alright so moving on I
want to talk about these little la cita
hand creams specifically this one right
here these ones are pretty heavily
fragranced this one right here is the
rose one I have the cherry blossom and
then the almond milk those sometimes
will sting if I have like any open
wounds or like you noted mean any dry
skin that has opened up the ones that
have a lot of fragrance in them will
stain however this one just the original
20-percent shape shea butter yeah 20%
shea butter dry skin hand cream is
amazing I got this little set at Sephora
I think it's so good and I love
formulation it's really beautiful I feel
like it goes on a little oily but then
it dries down to kind of like a powdery
soft finish so you definitely can wear
it during the day and I'm gonna pop this
little baby in my purse all right and
then the last one I want to talk about
is relatively new to me I got this in my
allure beauty box was it allure
or was it glossy box I think it was
allure don't quote me on that but this
is the skin fix it's what we do
fragrance free ultra rich hand cream and
I guess you can get this at Target it
says it clinically is proven to help
treat dry cracked skin on hands and has
coconut oil invited me in it this has a
very interesting consistency to it you
really have to rub it in it does leave a
bit of a void cast on your hand and
again it feels kind of similar to the
Neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream
it just has that sort of Vaseline
aquaphor sort of feel but it doesn't
leave your hands feeling super super
greasy like Vaseline or aqua for so I
really really enjoy it I think it's
absolutely fantastic it is formulated
with natural ingredients it had snow
fragrance soy gluten parabens or fatal
aids so yeah really really nice I've
been enjoying this a lot and then the
final products I want to talk about it
is aqua 4 so I think it's you literally
like I'm just so cracked on your hands
and every single hand cream is like
stinging your hands or they're just so
dry that you just can't deal aqua 4 will
do the trick so we'll Vaseline but I
feel like aqua 4 is better it really
really heals the skin and it is
fragrance free sometimes the Vaseline
tubs they do have a little bit of
fragrance and then what you can get the
fragrance free one but I like to get
like the cocoa butter one and that
actually burns my hands when they're
cracked like this so I really love the
Aqua 4 I use this everywhere on my lips
on my hands on any sort of dry skin I
even use it on my face and it never
clogs my pores so really really
fantastic the Aqua for healing ointment
that is my top 5 series for hand creams
for a dry chapped skin I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see it in
tomorrow's one tomorrow's one tomorrow
video I've been talking so much today
you think I haven't noticed from like
the past four videos I'm filming in bulk
so it's it's starting to get all jumbled
up
anyway I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
