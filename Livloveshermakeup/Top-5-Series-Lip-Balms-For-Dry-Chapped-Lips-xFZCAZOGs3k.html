channel yes there's a little kitty in
the shed today
welcome back to my channel I hope you
are all having an absolutely fantastic
day I'm very excited for this video so
you can probably tell I'm very hyped
about this one because we are talking
about something that is like a must-have
in my skincare makeup just everyday
routine I'm doing a top 5 series on my
favorite lip balms for dry chapped lips
okay I have a lot of experience with lip
balms okay a lot of experience I have
three of these little containers that
are filled with the bombs and I know
that you guys may be thinking like oh
she's just like pulling this idea out of
her ass cuz it's kind of unoriginal like
talking about my favorite lip balms but
honestly this is like something that I
have been wanting to do for a while and
I thought it would be the perfect time
to release this video because right now
we are right in the middle of winter and
everybody's lips get really really
chapped and dry during this time of year
and I am one of those people I am a
musician
I mean flutist my lips have to be in
good shape at all times or else like
literally like my plane like my flute
plane it's just not as good I swear to
you so anyway let's just get right into
it I have three options from Sephora
like high-end options and then two from
the drugstore so let's start with the
drugstore options the first one I want
to talk about are these
Nivea Olivia Thank You Nivea lip balms
they look like this I have all four of
them and you can get these in like
unscented versions or scented versions
of course prepare these scented versions
but I do have the unscented version it
looks like this you can get vanilla and
macadamia this one smells like a
starbucks Frappuccino and tastes like
one you can get caramel cream this one
smells like a bath and Bodyworks candle
and you can also get raspberry brows a
which is one of my favorites so I've had
these for a while I feel like these were
really really hyped up when they first
came out because they really smell good
they're cute they've got adorable
packaging and there's a reason these are
hyped up I mean I feel like nobody
really talks about them anymore but they
are so so good you guys I think you can
get each one for under $5 at the
drugstore and they're amazing you get so
much product in here and I just feel
like when I use them overnight I wake up
and my lips are just like soothes and
glowing and moisturized and plumped up
and they just look perfect I will say
I would recommend not using them during
the day just because they do leave a
little bit of a white cast let me see if
I can show you guys what I mean by that
they are just very very thick that they
will leave a bit of a white cast so if
you want to wear them during the day I
recommend going ahead and just applying
a very very little amount of but I think
they're absolutely fantastic and so so
worth it all right the savings a product
that I want to talk about also from the
drugstore and I'm like where is that
there it is this is the neosporin
overnight renewal therapy white
petroleum lip protectant let me tell you
something my trio and I last year we had
three back-to-back performances at
Carnegie Hall and we're all woodwind
players so we all really really want to
make sure that we're protecting our lips
we put this on before each show and I
swear to you we had an amazing show
every time I know that I shouldn't
associate this particular ball with that
but I swear I wear this overnight before
big events because shows and it's like
my lucky charm it's not very cute I feel
like nobody talks about it because the
packaging is not cute it's from
neosporin it's just kind of like one of
those weird like products you wouldn't
think about getting and I think the
reason that I got it was because I read
really really good reviews on makeup
alley but just a fantastic fantastic
website we can go and read reviews on
lip balms hair products makeup all that
kind of stuff but anyway this is what it
looks like you guys can see I've made
quite a dent in this product it is a
very very sick white consistency it
looks like this I do not recommend
wearing this during the day no matter
how much you tried and sent it out it
will completely stay like opaque and
white on the lips so definitely not good
for it like everyday use but overnight
absolutely up mazing and I believe you
can get that little tub for under five
dollars all right now let's get into
some high-end lip balm so first ones I
want to talk about are from Cary Grant
these are the Cary Grant lip whips these
are free of any sort of parabens and
sulfates and petroleum jelly they're
amazing they do have E like I was gonna
say a due dates but they do have they
have they're kind of like lush products
they will write on the back when this
product is going to go bad so that you
know what you think is nice because they
are made of all natural ingredients but
they do write on the back like here it
says December 2017 this one will be done
so you do have to kind of make your way
through these rather quickly
I probably won't make my way through all
three of these I probably should have
just gotten one of them but you can get
them in lots of different um I don't
want to say sense because there's really
only two cents you can get you can get
cinnamon or peppermint so if you're not
a mint lover or you're not a fan of mint
you're probably not going to like these
but you can get them in different colors
so I have one that is naked which is
just completely clear I have one in the
shade marsala which is like a dark kind
of like black currant sort of shade and
then I have one that is called radiant
which is like a pinky color I'm trying
to open these and I can't open that I
wanna show you guys what they look like
but I tell them to follow me you know
and I can't open them but just take my
word for it they're amazing they have a
beautiful beautiful consistency and if
you are someone who doesn't want to use
petroleum jelly on your lips these are a
great option for you alright the next
one I want to talk about is a very very
hyped up and I almost didn't want to get
this because I was like how good can it
actually be this is the Christian Dior
creme de Rose lip balm it looks like
this beautiful beautiful packaging well
guess what guys it is really really darn
good I have completely hit pan on this
product it's amazing it's got a
beautiful beautiful consistency it's
smoother than like a petroleum product
but you can wear this during the day it
leaves a gorgeous gorgeous glossy finish
on the lips and of course it smells like
rose so it's a very very luxurious this
is one that I like to carry around
actually in my flute-like
others who say my fluke purse my flute
case I actually like to carry this
around I think it's amazing I can play
and practice with this on my lips so I
really really love it for that I like to
just carry it around in my suitcase and
I will apply it during the day it leaves
a nice little sheen on the lips and just
protects the lips and leave some very
great plumped and like pretty looking I
believe it is called a smoothing and
pumping lip balm so if you a little like
fine lines in your lips and things like
that you would really really enjoy this
one alright and then the last one that I
want to talk about is the bite Beauty
agave lip mask you guys this product is
very very like hyped up but it's worth
the hype I've had this for what like two
and a half years and you guys can see
I've barely used any of it it tastes
amazing it smells amazing a little
amount go super super far like you only
need this amount for your upper and
lower lip like it's amazing super super
thick free of petroleum jelly but it
just smells so good oh my gosh it smells
so good it tastes really good on the
lips and I feel like
just makes the lips so nice and soft and
luxurious you will wake up in the
morning with like excess product on your
lips but I like that like I like the
fact that it's a mask it's very very
thick and I really really like it this
particular one is like The Naked shade
so it doesn't have any sort of tint to
it however they do have tinted ones I'm
going to pick up the smashed one I
believe it's called yeah it's a mix of
like pink and ready ready ready it's
like a pinky reddish shade it's really
really gorgeous and I feel like I could
wear that on my lips while practicing as
well um it's not it's much much thicker
than the Christian Dior so maybe I won't
be able to practice with it on my lips
but it's really really nice just trust
me it's it's definitely worth the price
and definitely worth the hype
so overall those are my top 5 lip balm
picks like I said I have tried a lot of
them and I just think those ones are the
best in my opinion so I hope you guys
enjoyed this top 5 series video thank
you so much for joining me I'll see you
in my next line bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
