have an ugly little top 5 series video
for you guys today and if you would like
to see all the top 5 series videos that
I've done on certain brands or just on
certain products I will go ahead and
link the whole playlist in the
description bar because i do have a
whole playlist dedicated to this topic
but anyway today we were talking about
my top five products or pics from the
McLean brand and then the next brand we
will be doing is urban decay so let's
just get started the first item that I
absolutely adore from Maybelline is the
falsies push of drama mascara a lot of
people hate this mascara it is a very
oily wet slick formula and if you do not
like that you're gonna hate this so it
really is definitely not transfer proof
in my opinion I know a lot of people
don't like that but honestly this makes
my lashes look just as good as when i
wear my toothpaste better than sex
mascara or my benefit they're real
honestly every time i wear this
somebody's like are you wearing on your
eyelashes it looks amazing this will
give you length it will give you volume
it will give you a definition it's like
the trifecta three in one product as far
as like mascara is concerned I have
absolutely no idea if they make a
waterproof version of this but if they
do I will probably pick it up because I
think this is a fantastic fantastic
mascara all right the next product I
want to talk about again I don't think
people I really people either love this
or they hate it so I know a lot of
people won't agree with me on this one
but I really love the baby skin instant
pore eraser from Maybelline this is a
primer it is very very silicone II it
goes on completely clear onto the skin
and it basically just fills in your
pores now if you have really really oily
skin you can't even see it but if you're
really really oily skin this is going to
be a little too slippery for you i'm not
saying that it's moisturizing it's just
got a little too much silicone in there
and it's just going to be a little too
slippery on your skin if your dry skin
aging skin any other kind of skin I
think you're actually really going to
like it it's very similar to the YSL
primer and I personally just really
really liked it i think it is an
affordable drugstore Duke for the y el
primer but yeah I really really love
this I think it's great you only get
point six seven food ounces in here but
again if you're comparing this to the y
el primer you're actually getting like a
lot in here for the fraction of the
price so I
really like this I feel like it does
extend the wear of my makeup it feels in
my pores it both in my fine lines and
like overall it just makes my foundation
glide on really really nicely so yes I
love the baby skin primary from they
believe the next item I want to talk
about it's really hard I love these
bullet quads for may believe these are
the maybelline eyestudio little quads
now if I had to pick one I would go with
this one but I really like this one as
well this one is mad for mob which looks
like this and if I had to pick one I
would go with this one which is number
70 copper chic these are just kind of
like flimsy little packaging I honestly
am NOT a huge fan of the packaging
literally like you cannot even fit your
finger in there like you need really
small brushes with these because they're
so freaking tiny but these go on so
beautifully you guys they just go on
gorgeously onto the eyes I love the
colors specifically this copper chic
little quad here these are probably the
creamiest I shadows from the drugstore
in my opinion I love the way they blend
I think they have their very reminiscent
of like a makeup geek foiled I shadow
they don't feel exactly like that but
they kind of go on the same just like
without any tugging or like I don't know
you just don't get any patchiness with
these so I'm a huge fan and if I had to
pick one of them I have quite a few of
these I think I've like six of these
little quads but if I had to pick one I
would go with this number 70 copper shi
quan alright the next item I want to
talk about is the Maybelline master
concealed by face studio the shade I
have this number 10 fair or Claire and I
love this you guys I love this this has
a very nice kind of warm undertone like
yellow undertone which is great because
the only area that I use this is
underneath my eyes and also on my
eyelids it is very moisturizing if you
have dry skin you're going to love this
if you have oily skin you need to set
this in with a powder I personally have
combo skin and I really really like it I
don't like it anywhere except for
underneath my eyes because I feel like
it is so key imagine it really locks in
the moisture and you know it really
locks in the moisture underneath your
eyes throughout the day and it really
just kind of stays like that it's not
going to completely set um it kind of
sets down to like a demi matte finish
when you do apply powder but for the
most part it's going to say pretty
luminous
on the skin so I personally would not
recommend if you owe your combo skin to
put it like to you know spot treat any
blemishes and also it's not super super
full coverage i would say it's probably
a solid medium coverage but it's just
the overall consistency and finish of
this that is absolutely stunning and i
love it for underneath the eye area and
like i said has a little bit of a yellow
undertone so that helps to color correct
and cancel out any blue tone so really
really enjoy that and then the last
product I want to talk about that is my
favorite from Maybelline is definitely
the master drama by I studio eyeliner in
the shade midnight master now I love all
of these they do not have a very good
shade selection really really poor shape
selection this is amazing on the
waterline it is not going to budge it is
like the darkest blackest most gorgeous
color ever I'm really really in love
these are very very comparable to be
Stila stay all day smudge poop smudge
smudge proof water line eyeliners I
don't know what they're called this
smudge proof one is very similar and
also very reminiscent of the Urban Decay
24-7 glide on eye pencils those are my
favorite on my waterline these are very
similar and also the next ones are very
similar I'm wearing in next one today on
my waterline but this is absolutely
beautiful I wish they would make more
shades this particular one midnight
master is gorgeous I had a little bit of
a blue undertone which actually
Britain's up the whites of your eyes and
helps you to not look as tired but yeah
this is a fantastic fantastic eyeliner
highly recommends that you guys check
that one out so overall a mascara I have
a primer I have a concealer I have a
little eye shadow quad and then i have
the eyeliner so these are my top 5 picks
from the Maybelline bram let me know
down below what your top 5 picks are
from the Maybelline brand and I will see
you guys in the next one like I said we
will be talking about urban decay
alright guys see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
