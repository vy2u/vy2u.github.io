thank you so much for joining me I hope
you are all having a fantastic day so
far in today's video I am sharing with
you guys
finally my top 5 series on my top 5
foundations of all time
so I got two from the drugstore and
three that are high-end and I'm going to
start with a drugstore one that I
mentioned in a video about a week or a
week and a half ago I mentioned this in
a video called foundations that break me
out
yes unfortunately this foundation does
break me out but it is absolutely
stunning this is from hard candy this is
the glamoflage invisible camouflage
foundation in the shade 930 porcelain so
I absolutely love this foundation it's
so beautiful the only thing I don't like
is first of all it does break me out a
little bit and a second of all when you
pump it out you kind of get like either
a little bit or you like you don't get
enough or you get like way too much so
that's kind of a complaint of mine out
so the packaging is kind of cheap it's
just plastic but this is under $5 at
Walmart so I think it is worth it but
this is what the actual consistency of
the product looks like it's absolutely
stunning on the skin you guys and if you
do have very very fair skin like I do
this shade porcelain is actually a
really really nice match I really
enjoyed that the drugstore has finally
come out with a foundation that is
really really light this might actually
be half a tone lighter than my
particular skin tone and I'm pretty darn
fair so I love it the consistency is
beautiful it's very fluid like I prefer
what I like using a damp Beauty sponge
or like my Real Techniques sponge with
all of the foundations that I'm going to
mention but you can actually apply this
with your fingers or with a brush and it
looks absolutely stunning
it looks skin like and it actually has a
very thin fluid like consistency to it
but it builds up so nicely on the skin
you can apply one two to three layers
and really get full on coverage so that
is my first favorite my second favorite
is also from the drugstore this is the
L'Oreal Paris infallible Pro matte 24
hour foundation and the shade that I
wear is 101 classic ivory this thing is
all dirty and smudgy looking this is
probably the fourth tube of this that
I've gone through I love this I have
been in love with it ever since it came
out what was it like a year or
and a half ago it's absolutely
absolutely amazing if you do have combo
to oily skin you would love this it will
keep you matte all day long and the
actual coverage of it is definitely like
medium to buildable full coverage like
you can do two or three layers of this
it builds on the skin beautifully and it
really gives nice coverage so let me
show you guys what the consistency looks
like it's not as fluid like as the hard
candy you can see it kind of just sticks
on the hand but it's absolutely stunning
now if you do have dry or like really
dry skin or aging skin you might want to
be careful with this one maybe go in
with a really nice moisturizer before
applying it because it can cling to dry
patches on the face but for the most
part it stays on all day it's beautiful
I love the coverage and the shade is
really really nice on my skin tone
alright now let's talk about a high-end
foundation that is really really
severely high end the the Marc Jacobs
genius gel supercharge foundation in the
shade 10 shade 10 ivory light I love
this foundation this is the one
foundation out of all five of them that
actually has the most like skin like
appearance to it if that makes sense it
probably has the lightest coverage out
of all of them but I just have to say
Marc Jacobs really does a good job at
catering to the really really fair like
if you have a very very light skin you
will really enjoy this foundation and he
will enjoy all of his foundations in
general I think because he has these
wonderful shade he just has a really
good shape range and it seems like all
of them like the remarkable foundation
this one all of them this is not like
the remarkable foundation this is more
of a skin like foundation it's going to
give you I would say just medium
coverage you can't really build it up
you can mix it with other foundations if
you wanted to you know like the Kat Von
D locket if you want that to look a
little more skin like you can mix this
foundation in with it but for the most
part you can't really build this
foundation on top of other layers of
this foundation that makes sense it
doesn't really look very good
it looks beautiful with just one pump
applied all over the face with like a
damp beauty sponge it's absolutely
stunning it gives a little bit of a
sheen to your skin because they do have
combo skin I do have to powder and touch
up throughout the day in my t-zone but I
don't mind because it's so freakin
stunning on this game alright the next
one I want to talk about is somewhat new
to me
I would say and this is probably yeah
this is probably the newest foundation
that I've recently just fallen in love
with out of all five of them this is the
Josie Maran vibrancy foundation fluid
this has argan oil in it and at first I
thought no I'm not gonna like this
because it's just gonna be too much oil
on my skin but you guys they have to say
this is such a stunning foundation the
shade that I wear is called dynamic I
think I said that this is what it looks
like it's a little runny but it's so
beautiful on the skin I never have to
worry about that this is gonna be great
during the winter time I never have to
worry about this like kicking up on
certain areas of my face it gives
beautiful coverage with one to two
layers it builds on top of different
layers really nicely it's just stunning
and there's some sort of gorgeous sort
of like sheen in there but it doesn't
make me overly oily throughout the day
so I highly recommend this for people
who have combo skin normal skin and dry
skin I think he would absolutely love it
I've just fell in love with this
foundation one pump to two pumps is like
perfect for the entire face you can
build it it's just gorgeous I love the
packaging I love everything about this
foundation so this is kind of a new find
for me but it quickly has become a top
right foundation and then the last
foundation I want to talk about is the
Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation with broad-spectrum SPF of 15
yes SVO 15 sunscreen the shade I wear is
fair beige this is oil free it's
supposed to last for like 12 hours on
your face it really really does the job
this is probably my favorite like the
best out of all 5 of them in my opinion
I have been using this foundation for
years now it is so gorgeous it has a
moosie sort of texture to it as you guys
can probably see and what I love about
it is that it doesn't cling to my dry
patches and I always associated mousse
like textures like with you know
clinging to dry patches I don't know why
I always just think oh now I should stay
away from that because it's gonna cling
to the outer perimeters of my face this
one it never does that you can build it
on top of different layers of
foundations or on top of you know this
foundation you can do 2 to 3 layers get
super super full coverage it's beautiful
and the shade fair beige is perfect for
me like it's very neutral so it
doesn't go to pink or to yellow it's
right in between and if there's one
thing I can recommend for you fair
complected girls out there if you are
looking for a foundation and you're
scared that you know the foundation is
gonna have too much of a pink undertone
or a yellow undertone just go with the
neutral undertone and for the most part
that should be somewhat good for your
skin tone that's just something I've
noticed is that if I go for one that's
really really light but it has too much
of a pink undertone it's just too pink
or too yellow so I usually go for the
neutral undertone at the fair beige is
exactly that it's a beautiful beautiful
color it really helps to kind of color
correct redness and blue tones on my
face as well and this is just my
all-time favorite foundation of all time
so anyway those that were my top of five
foundations I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
