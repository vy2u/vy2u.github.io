you so much for joining me i hope you
guys are having a fantastic day um first
things first yes i am in the beauty room
woohoo if you follow me on instagram you
may see that i've been posting pictures
here and there up certain areas in the
beauty room that i've been organizing
and fixing up i have cleared everything
out on the floor so all i really need to
do now is find a way to organize all my
music because this is not only my beauty
room itself so my practice room you guys
don't know i am a musician um but yeah I
need to figure out a way of doing that
I'm not quite sure if I want this
particular setup um I don't really know
I haven't really decided there's a
little snow white back there um but
anyway I love these little posters I
found these at target are not posters
there like canvases basically I found
them at target you can get them at TJ
maxx my friend leora actually ended up
picking up Cinderella herself after i
posted a picture on Instagram and she
hangs it in the background of her videos
now too and it's adorable so let's make
this a trend having princesses in the
background um anyway I'm not quite ready
to give the beauty room tour yet I
promise it will be up soon but I will be
filming in here from now on I'll
probably be moving the camera angles
around until I find exactly how I want
to be doing it but for now I will be
filming right here today at least so
anyway I will be filming in here from
now on say goodbye to the kitchen videos
and yeah welcome to my baby bro the
second thing I want to say is I have a
face mask on i don't even know if you
guys can tell you probably can it's like
a little lighter its kind of crusting up
on my skin but the reason for that is
because i am sharing my top five
favorite mess with you guys today so and
this is part of my top 5 series i've
been doing a lot of these top 5 series
i've been doing collabs and also just
posting some of my own videos and this
one is not a club I'm just coming on
here and sharing my top five favorite
mass with you guys and just for
reference I have combination skin I'm
going to talk about each mask and let
you know if it would work for certain
like skin types but yeah anyway let's
just get right into it shall we I love
masking I have a lot of mass you guys to
see that when i show my skin care
collection in 2016 and
at the beginning of the new year not
like way next year it will be sometime
in January but you guys will see I have
a lot of masks I like to alternate them
out weekly and I probably mask three to
four times a week that's a lot but I
find that it really helps my skin so
anyway let's get started on my top five
I don't know why I'm putting 10 fingers
up top five um favorite masks the first
one I want to talk about is the one I
wearing on my face right now you can get
this for under ten dollars at Ulta it
might even be under five dollars it is
the formula 1006 deep down detox this is
a ultra cleansing mud mask with orange
and bergamot it looks like this you get
a really nice amount of product in here
3.4 fluid ounces for the price and this
formula 1006 brand is supposed to be a
brand that is targeted at people who
have like inflammation or acne or deal
with pimples and break out so really
really great for teenagers adults
anybody who deals with breakouts as you
can see I deal with breakups but anyway
I love using this it is wonderful it is
a super cleansing detox max mask that
cleanses impurities for a clearer
brighter complexion the energy of orange
recharges while sea salt cleanses and
bergamot balances your face will notice
the difference and I really really do it
is that time of the month right now and
I get hormonal acne I don't know what
that's going up there I have no idea
normally I get acne in this area and I
love this mask because it's not too dry
and sometimes you can put on a clay mask
and it literally sucks everything out
and it's hard to use it if you have
combination skin or even dry skin
because it makes the dry areas even more
dry however I find that this one goes on
really beautifully it has a somewhat
thick kind of liquidy texture to it it's
kind of like pink and it spreads so
easily and beautifully it does start to
harden and kind of tighten up on the
skin but not to the point where I can't
move my face as you guys can see so
anyway I really really love it I think
it is awesome I think you really could
get away with using this no matter what
skin type you have sensitive skin you
make it a little bit of a tingling
sensation the bergamot in here does kind
of tangle around my nose area but I
like it because it doesn't have
exfoliating particles and it doesn't
have any acids it literally is just a
mud mask and it's a nice mud mask that
doesn't completely tighten up and dry
out your skin so when you wash it off it
does start to get kind of smooth again
and buttery and it just has the greatest
texter so that is the first one I want
to recommend the second one is from
Freeman beauty these are awesome you
definitely can get these for I believe
under five dollars on the altar calm
website or in Alta you get a huge amount
in these masks you can get them in the
little single like sachets or you can
get them in the full size i recommend
the full size because these will last
you forever and it's better like deal
basically you get more bang for your
buck there are six fluid ounces in here
and like i said i believe this is under
five dollars and this is the charcoal
and black sugar polishing mask it is a
dual action purifying mask and basically
it has charcoal in it so when you're
putting it on your face it starts to
heat up and kind of warm your skin it
really pulls out any kind of impurities
and also it has exfoliating particles in
here like a lot so what I don't like is
when i'm using a mask and it has
exfoliating beads or like leaves or
something yeah glendalough I'm talking
about you I don't want to have leaves
like falling off my face you know what I
mean like TVs um so what I like about
this is that it actually doesn't start
to fall off it doesn't completely dry on
your skin I think that's why it works if
this were to dry on your skin the chunks
would start like coming off so you put
it on and it doesn't really go on evenly
it's hard to describe you kind of take a
little bit and you rub in circular
motions on clean skin and it feels very
very pretty because there's a lot of
exfoliating particles in there but it
just starts to warm up and you just kind
of leave it all blotchy all over your
skin and I swear to you none of it comes
off it doesn't start falling down on
your clothes or into your food or on
your neck or anything like that um and
after about 10 minutes they recommend
five to seven you basically wet your
fingers and you start kind of rubbing in
circular motions and putting it into
like a lather it kind of turns into a
scrub and the particles in here are
really really exfoliating so it is
really awesome it definitely purifies
and you get that exfoliating property
out of there so it also brightens your
skin the third mask I want to talk about
is the one I've been using this week
except
today oh this is the gross stem cell bio
repair gel mask from peter thomas roth
it looks like this I'm sorry if my voice
sounds a little raspy I think I'm kind
of getting something I hope that knock
on wood ah there's no wood but you know
no I really don't want to get a cold or
anything but I feel like I'm kind of
like it you know anyway um this is
awesome you get five fluid ounces in
here it is a little more pricey that you
cannot give us at the drugstore but it's
basically just this pink jelly that
smells amazing it smells like rose if
you love the scent of rose you'll love
this and you can put this in the
refrigerator you can use it as is and
basically you just glop this on like put
a large amount on and it makes your skin
feel so soft when you rinse it off it
really really stays thick on the skin
it's not irritating whatsoever Rose is a
very calming like property any kind of
rows like rose hips anything like that
very very calming and beautiful on the
skin I also really good for anti-aging
purposes um don't get this around your
eye area it does sting a little bit but
I don't notice any sensitivity when I
use this I think any kind of skin type
could use this so I highly highly
recommend checking this one out you can
also use a small layer of it at night
over your nighttime skincare routine to
lock in all the products and moisturize
all right the fourth mask I want to talk
about is from Mario Badescu and this is
for you ladies and whoever really i mean
i'm 23 but i still use this i use this
on special occasions it is called the
temporary lifting mask it says our
powerful lifting mask temporarily
tightens pores and leave skin smooth and
healthy it says apply a thin layer key
is a thin layer on clean skin and rinse
after 10 minutes you are going to want
to rinse this off after five minutes
which is okay you're still going to get
those tightening properties this dries
like no other on your face it literally
it's like a beautiful kind of pink cream
if I can open it it's like a beautiful
kind of pink cream and it looks so
luscious and smells very strange but um
it looks kind of luscious it has like a
undertone of rows in it but overall it
smells kind of gross and disgusting but
you put this on and literally it's like
it's like you think your skin is going
to hell like it tightens so bad you can
not move your face not the reason I like
this is because when I take it off my
neck like everything is like like
completely pulled back my fine lines
have disappeared my eyes are like really
tight not like that but you know what I
mean everything is really really tight
and firm and yes I don't really have
aging skin yet but I do take precautions
and use things like this especially
before a special event this is beautiful
but it tightens everything you can use
this on your neck if you kind of have
like a creepy neck as you're getting
older your decollete wherever you want
to use it but this really does tighten
and firm and it makes you look like
you're like eight years old I'm 23 and
when I use this I literally look like I
have the skin of an eight-year-old so
kind of awesome I do recommend it like I
said it sits on the skin horribly it's
so tight it's risking issue you want to
rinse it off but try and keep it on for
this full 10 minutes you will be amazed
and the last is this the last one yeah
1234 yes is the last one the last mask I
want to talk about is actually an
overnight mask I like to use overnight
masks when I can't be bothered to do my
nighttime skincare routine if I'm too
tired if I got home from work late if I
was out drinking or whatever not like
but you know what i mean at parties
things like that you don't want to come
home and like do your whole skin care
routine um so what I like to use this
for is on those nights I'll wash my face
I always make sure to take my makeup off
even if i'm a little tipsy even if i
drink a little too much wine um but this
is wonderful for those nights where you
can't be bothered you just take like a
dollop of this slather it on your face
and you will not look like you are
hungover or like you were up to later
anything like that it is wonderful it
smells incredible it smells like guava
passion fruit kiwi all kinds of like
sweet fruits it just smells amazing when
you're putting on like I want to eat
this stuff but you can get this in a
little trio this is the smaller size you
do get one fluid ounce in here I got
this in a trio for like twenty five
dollars on the support calm website it
is the holiday special go check it out
you also get two other mass you get
their charcoal masks and they're at
minute out of trouble mask but this is
my favorite I need to pick up a full
size of it once I go through this it's
just amazing and it's wonderful for
those nights where you just can't be
bothered it really really helps plump
your skin up put moisture back in just
the works so anyway that is what it
looks like and that is my fifth and
final favorite mask so anyway I'm going
to grab my makeup remover wipes here
from Neutrogena you take this mask off
so you guys can kind of see what it does
for my skin I don't know why make the
ears are so red today um and I noticed
and you guys will notice I'm very very
fair skin so when I rub things start to
get red so just give it a minute to kind
of cool down um but I want you guys to
see you guys can see fair skinned girl
problems pale girl problems you rub and
like everything turns bright red
horrible but anyway it will calm down in
a second but you guys will be able to
see that my skin looks a little more
even a little better like I said it is
my time of the month mother nature
dropped off her a little gift and I
always get so excited because she
packages it so cute you know in that
cute little box on the ribbon might tear
it open and boom there it is sorry i had
to i always joke about that um but
anyway I like I said I've been kind of
breaking out i get hormonal acne like
right here on my jawline um and I feel
like it's just much smoother after I use
that deep down detox mask um these
makeup remover wipes have a little bit
of oil in them so if you're seeing like
a little bit of a sheen that is why but
overall my skin feels really good right
now and let it sit for a second
hopefully you guys can see this is kind
of
not fading but it just makes it look not
as noticeable so anyway I hope you guys
did enjoy this video I'll of masking I
love the way my face looks and feels
after i mask it just feels so smooth
right now and that was from using a clay
mask you know you can't always say that
about a clay mask that's why it's my
favorite um but it's just I just love
masking it's really really good for your
skin I highly recommend getting three or
four masks and alternating them weekly
and using them basically what I do with
every other night you don't have to do
that even if you just do once or twice
weekly you will notice a difference in
your skin I am one of those people when
you have a certain kind of skin type I
do recommend sticking with a regimen
like a skincare routine that is for your
skin type however because masks are
something that you don't use every
single day I think you can pick up tons
of different ones ones for dry skin ones
for oily skin ones for all types of skin
you know what I mean you can try all
different sorts of things and see how it
makes your face feel I have a lot of
masks that are very hydrating that like
it's beautiful i get a very nice glow
when i use them because it puts moisture
back in i have mass that just kind of
make my face feel like even doubt and
nice um the deep down detox masks the
brand or yet formula 1006 also makes
like a cooling gel coconut cucumber mask
that's nice if you have like inflamed
skin and also peter thomas roth makes a
cucumber one so if your skin is just
feeling out of whack and you don't know
if it's too oily or it's too dry it's
just kind of everything that's really
nice to use a gel mask so anyway i hope
you guys enjoyed this video i'm all
fresh face now and I feel really nice
and clean um and yeah I hope you enjoyed
this thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
