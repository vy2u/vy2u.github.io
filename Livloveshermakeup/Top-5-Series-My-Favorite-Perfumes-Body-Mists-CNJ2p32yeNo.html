am continuing my top 5 series and I am
sharing with you guys my top 5 fragrance
mists or body mists or body sprays
whatever you want to call them and also
my top 5 perfumes with you guys I
thought for me it wouldn't make sense to
separate the two videos because I am
someone who combines my body mists with
my perfumes on a daily basis and yes I
will be doing a video on how I combine
my fragrances in the future but for now
I'm just kind of sharing with you guys
my top 5 from each category so
technically there's 10 products but I
hope you guys can forgive me anyway the
first one I want to talk about it's from
Pacifica and I'm gonna start with
perfumes by the way so this one is from
Pacifica this is the Indian coconut
nectar perfume the brand Pacifica is
just really really amazing they don't
test on animals they're very like
environmental friendly just their
bottles and everything they don't even
have like lids on their bottles um but
anyway this is a beautiful beautiful
fragrance and these perfumes I think run
for $22 which is relatively cheap
compared to a lot of the other ones I'm
going to show you guys so I highly
recommend checking out their line I hope
that they come out with more because all
of them smell amazing but anyway this
Indian coconut nectar one is definitely
one of my favorites it's a very very
warm scent there's a lot of vanilla in
it and a lot of coconut and then you get
a little bit of sweetness from the
nectar so this is definitely one of my
favorites I absolutely love it and I
think it's just as beautiful during the
fall and winter time the second one I
want to talk about is from Marc Jacobs
this is the modern waar perfume and I do
want to let you guys know right away
Pacifica does make a dupe for this
product or they have you know a
fragrance that is a dupe for this the
Marc Jacobs modern wash smells like
gardenia and it's a little bit of
gardenia mixed with kind of a
sophisticated perfumey kind of scent but
mostly it's gardenia which is a
beautiful beautiful floral scent and I
absolutely love it however I have to let
you guys know that Pacifica does make a
perfume called Tahitian gardenia which
is basically smells the exact same as
this the only difference with this one
is that like I said it has a little more
of that sophisticated kind of perfume
you scent but that's more of an undertow
for the most part this smells like
straight-up gardenia so very very floral
II I loved it during the spring and
summertime so that's my second favorite
my third favorites is a Versace a bright
crystal I love this bottle first of all
and every time I smell this I think of
like Barbie or like Legally Blonde or
something like I feel like if Barbie
wore perfume it would be this one okay
because it just smells so bright it just
I can barely even like describe this
scent it's citrusy but not like
lemongrass kind of like you know what I
mean like there's like that citrusy
scent that has kind of like a lemongrass
in it it's not like that it literally
smells like oranges Kiwis lines and then
it's mixed with a sophisticated like
perfume any kind of scent so really
really beautiful I love it I feel very
bright and bubbly when I wear it it is
definitely one of my favorites and I
love the way it looks it's like a pink
fluid it's absolutely adorable alright
the fourth one that is a favorite of
mine is this Burberry
it's the Eau de Toilette or ODA perfume
it's just called the Burberry for women
this is like one of their old school
fragrances this is one of the small
bottles but you can actually get a full
3 ounces of this on HauteLook for I
believe like $40 which is an amazing
deal I feel like a grown ass mature
woman when I really scent I just feel
like very like posh and like I don't
know have you guys ever seen most that
movie with Meryl Streep The Devil Wears
Prada like I feel like she would wear
this um it just smells so sophisticated
and like I don't know I just feel very
very woman like when I wear this and I
absolutely love it I can't really
describe it you would have to go and
smell it for yourself but it really is a
good fragrance and I highly recommend it
this is the smaller bottle and this was
$18 on HauteLook which is still at like
an absolute steal so love that one and
then the final um perfume I want to talk
about is from Viktor and Rolf this is
flower bomb love the packaging look it's
shaped like a little bomb my boyfriend
has spice bomb and that one's also
really really cute but this is one of
those perfumes when I first smelt this I
was like oh it smells like my
grandmother's perfume or something like
that you know it just smells kind of
aged it's kind of like an aged smelling
perfume but then once you kind of like
you know let it sink in and you're kind
of smelling it a little more once you
wear it on your body you notice that
there's a very sophisticated perfume II
sent in here mixed in with that floral e
powdery scent so overall I would say
it's a very floral scent with a lot of
like powdery undertones if you don't
like that kind of powdery baby powder
sort of scent you may not like this but
a lot of people love this and for good
reason it just it's very very
interesting it smells different when you
have it on your body then when you like
smell it um so I recommend going and
kind of you know misting it on you at
Sephora and just kind of letting it sink
in for a little bit because again every
time you spray a perfume like it smells
different on every single person but
this one I feel like smells better the
longer I wear it and I have to admit
this lasts for ever I can do three
sprays like across my decollete and neck
area and that will last me the whole day
this lasts all day so I really really
love a flower bomb all right now let's
get into body mist the first one I want
to talk about is a must at Mach half was
I gonna say I was gonna say much loved
and must have together but this is from
Victoria's Secret this is endless love
this is a mix of apple blossom and
yin-yang this smells like if you like
herbal essences like if you like the
smell of herbal essences like their
shampoos and conditioners and body
washes and things like that this smells
like something that they would make it
smells amazing it smells like you just
got out of the shower and every time I
wear this literally my boyfriend's like
it smells like you just washed your hair
or something it's it's such a good scent
so I highly recommend picking this up
again when I talk about when I do the
video on how I pair my fragrances I'll
talk about what I like to mix this
particular one with or well I don't know
if I'll talk about this particular one
but I'll talk about like in general how
I like to mix fragrances this is a very
clean scent so if you like clean scents
um you would definitely like endless
love from Victoria's Secret Bath and
Body Works this is like the old school
one this is plumeria amazing if you
I've never smelt plumeria it's so good
it is a it is infused with real plumeria
extract which is a flower if you guys
are curious I almost doesn't smell
floral like it's got no it's got a
little bit of sweetness in it as well
this is like they're old school
packaging and they're old school sense
this was one of the first ones they ever
came out with and it just smells amazing
and I remember having this body splash
when I was like a young girl so every
time I wear it now I have like a
nostalgic feelings but anyway it's
amazing I highly recommend if you like
the smell of sweet and floral fragrances
combined the next one is also from
Victoria's Secret this one is the pink
fresh and clean I had a hard time
between deciding between this one and
the warm and cozy scent the warm and
cozy is really nice it has a lot of like
warm like kind of like the Pacifica
Indian coconut nectar it's got a lot of
vanilla and coconut like undertones in
it but the fresh and clean ones just
smells so fresh and clean I can't even
like describe it it really really you
just have to go smell it for yourself
it's got kind of like a spicy undertone
in it almost but it's got a lot of sweet
fragrance on top of it so I highly
recommend going and checking that out at
your local Victoria's Secret because it
really smells good and you get a lot of
products here this is 8.4 fluid ounces
so yes the next one I want to talk about
I got at Walgreens this is the body
fantasy signature this is cotton candy
mm-hmm if you love sweet sweet
fragrances I love sweet fragrances if
you love sweet fragrances you are going
to love this it smells like what cotton
candy tastes like like when you taste
cotton candy that's what it smells like
it is so good like they got the scent
spot on it's just super super like cozy
and sweet very very sweet um like I said
if you do not like sweet fragrances you
won't like this but I absolutely love
this one and then the last one I want to
talk about is also from Victoria's
Secret this is the mango temptation this
has been a favorite for a long time this
is the third one that I have gone
through so I feel like that says a lot I
would say mango temptation is my
all-time favorite
that Victoria's Secret has in their
little like pink fragrance section or
whatever it is it is so sweet and it has
like a little bit of like a floral e
utter to undertone it's mango nectar and
hibiscus and I absolutely love it if you
don't like sweet scents you won't like
this one but it just smells so darn good
so that is a my fifth and final bunny
spray that I absolutely love so I do
hope you guys enjoyed this video I just
thought it would be fun to you know kind
of put out what are my favorites because
I do have a bit of a collection if you

seen pictures I do have quite a few
fragrances and I just thought it'd be
fun to share with you guys what do my
favorite ones are so anyway I hope you
