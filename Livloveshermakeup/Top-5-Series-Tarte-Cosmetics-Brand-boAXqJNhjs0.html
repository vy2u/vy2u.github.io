thank you so much for joining me in this
video I'm sharing with you guys my top
five products from the Tarte cosmetics
line so if you are not familiar I did
these top five series on certain brands
i alternate between drug store and I
don't know what the shirt is doing if it
just go like this it is what it is
anyway I am alternating between high-end
and drugstores so the next one that I do
will be on maybelline but today we were
talking about Tarte cosmetics and I have
picked my favorite items from the brand
by the way I know I have a lot of color
going on in my eyes and I did not do my
eyebrows like what I don't understand so
if it looks a little dramatic on my eyes
and my eyebrows are just kind of like
hanging out whatever I didn't even come
them through I don't know I just want to
feel like that's why all right let's get
right into this shall we the first item
I want to talk about from Tarte
cosmetics is the Tarte Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation with
broad-spectrum SPF 15 the shade i have
is fair beige and this is a 12-hour
makeup that is oil-free I love this this
is one of my literally top five
foundations you guys will see when i do
my top 5 series on my favorite
foundations this will be in there it is
full coverage it's lightweight on the
skin it's buildable literally you can
get like full-on full coverage like the
kat von d sorta coverage or Estee Lauder
Double Wear coverage but you also
maintain that really light quality on
the skin this is just an amazing amazing
foundation I've had it for a really long
time and I feel like I haven't even
gotten through much of it because a
little goes a long way with this product
if you do have dry skin i highly
recommend going in with like a
moisturizer ahead of time because since
it is kind of like a mu see a texture it
will cling on to dry patches but for the
most part for oily or combination skin i
highly highly recommend if you are
looking for a full coverage foundation
this is one of my all-time favorites
alright moving on i'm going to be
talking about a newer palette that
recently released from the charge rain
force of the sea collection this is
their eye shadow palette and it was
between this one and my coral crush
palette i really like these little
circular pallets that tart makes they
are made here in the USA and i just
think they are really really good
quality this is the rain force of the
sea she the rainforests of DC eyeshadow
palette I think it's absolutely
beautiful the colors in here are very
neutral and very very gorgeous you can
create all sort of all sorts of looks
and
the consistency and wearability of these
are amazing they're like a makeup geek
foiled I shadow or the makeup forever
what are they artists shadows I have two
pallets that have the artist shadows
these are very very similar so I
absolutely love this palette I know a
lot of people are complaining that it's
really really tiny compared to some of
the other like circular pallets from
Tarte cosmetics however I think it is
worth it i think this was around what
like $34 definitely definitely worth it
love this palette alright the next thing
I want to talk about is a blush palette
they came out during the holiday season
everybody hated this blush palette
because of the packaging I actually
really didn't mind it this was a 2014
Amazonian clay blush palette and it's
kind of like a little clutch I really
didn't I liked the packaging I thought
it was really cute a lot of people
thought it was very dated but the reason
this particular blush palette is my
favorite out of all the blush palettes
that they have whether it be be 2015
holiday one or the newt artiste one is
because I felt like the shades in here
we're wearable for so many people and
you could get so many different looks
you have a really nice plummy color a
new color you have a coral you have a
pinky of everything and I feel like a
lot of their palates like their blush
palette are kind of lacking when it
comes to like different sort of like
color arrangements like a lot of them
just kind of stay in the same category
and I don't feel like they're wearable
for everyone so that is definitely a
favorite the next item I want to talk
about is the tart a skin twinkle
lighting palette and this is all so new
from the target rain force of the sea
collection I am loving this and thanks
to one of my subscribers hi Alexandra
she told me this middle shade I really
like it was horrible it's basically a
setting powder and it just was so chalky
and not working for me like it was
horrible she recommended really like
getting your finger in there kind of
scraping off the top layer and now i
love this as a setting powder like it's
amazing it's beautiful super pigmented
very very lightweight it have they
buried like finishing powder sort of
texture to it like silica and then the
highlights are absolutely gorgeous you
have sunlight and moonlight here is
moonlight in here as sunlight I like to
layer these together they just give a
gorgeous gorgeous beautiful kind of wet
appearance to the skin they're beautiful
they're pigmented super silky amazed
highly highly recommend if you are going
to check out the new touring force of
the sea collection look into the eye
shadow palette and look into the skin
twinkle palette alright and the last
item I want to talk about is the tartlet
in bloom palette I do not only first one
but this has to be a favorite of mine it
is absolutely gorgeous look at the
packaging first of all stunning
packaging and then you have a huge
mirror and then you get let's see one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten eleven twelve shades in here that
are beautiful super super neutral you're
getting a mix of luster shades that's
what they describe them as they're
basically just like shimmery shades and
then you're also getting max and you get
tons of transition colors in here
they're very pigmented very easy to
blend and I just personally really
really adore this palette so that is my
final fifth favorite product from the
Tarte cosmetics line I hope you guys
enjoyed this video like I said the next
one will be on Maybelline and I will see
you guys then fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
