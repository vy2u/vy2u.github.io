so super excited for this video I really
hope you guys are having a fantastic day
I am here to do another top 5 series
video for you guys today but it's gonna
be a little different I recently have
been loving watching these videos where
people talk about their favorite
products from a certain brand and I was
like how can I incorporate that on my
channel and I thought well I love
filming top 5 series videos for you guys
so I could do top 5 series from you know
L'Oreal brand or top 5 series Too Faced
brand
top 5 series bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks brands so
I already have a few that I've written
down please let me know in the comment
section first of all if you like these
videos and second of all if you having
certain brands you would like me to talk
about my top 5 favorite products from
all right so anyway like I said today is
a two-faced wait did I say that again
we're talking about Too Faced products
today as you can probably tell from the
title of the video I am very very
excited because two-faced is my favorite
high-end brand and on top of that this
was super difficult this was super super
difficult to pick my top five products
but I finally did and I feel good about
them so let's get right into it the
first one I want to talk about is a
primer this is the Too Faced Proactiv
nourishing hangover RX replenishing face
primer I am almost done with this one
this is my second little bottle that I
have gone through it is a pump which is
fantastic I just love this if you have
dry skin even if you have combination
skin like me I personally love using
this during the winter it is amazing if
you have dry patches I think if you have
oily skin you could use it but maybe
like during the summer if you get a
little more oily I get very oily during
the summer I tend to stay away from this
one but I think it's absolutely
fantastic and moisturizing the skin and
prepping your face for foundation and
also it really does prolong the wear of
your makeup like I said it has a pump I
love that it smells like coconut it just
makes me so happy it is silicone free so
it doesn't have any sort of slip to it
or anything like that it really just
kind of puts nutrients back into your
skin and also hydrates and I absolutely
love it so that is my first pick from
the Too Faced brand
all right this second pick I have three
of I wanted to pull them all out because
I'm thinking of them as like one they're
pretty much all one product they're like
the same thing so these are the two
love flush long-lasting sixteen-hour
blushes and everybody always says to me
they're like why don't you just get your
hands on that pallet so that was out
during the holiday season because they
had all the little mini sizes of these
blushes in them and I am collecting all
of them so right now I have three and I
have three more to get I want them in
full size they are that good this is one
of my favorite blush formulations ever
they are beautiful they have like a
satiny finish and look to the skin they
have this smallest amount of shimmer and
glimmer like you can't even tell they're
sparkles on your face I am wearing what
is it love hangover today which is a
beautiful kind of peachy color I will
say the packaging doesn't really look
like what it looks like on the inside
but it's like a nudie peachy color and
it's stunning I have that on my cheeks
today and I just think it gives a
beautiful glow I do have the Dior
glowing gardens nude air glowing pink
highlighter on it quite a mouthful I
have that on right here but the other
little sheen that you're seeing
underneath is actually from the blush
it's absolutely beautiful
I think it looks great on so many
different skin tones they have a really
nice selection of six shades from really
really dark to really really light and
yeah I absolutely love them they really
do wear all day fantastic so this is
like I said love hangover I also have
your love is king which is a beautiful
kind of plummy color for the winter time
or just and then the last one I have
currently is the justify my love which
is kind of like a bright pink like a
Barbie pink but it has a bunch of kind
of silver and gold shimmers in here the
other ones kind of just have like silver
glimmers / shivers okay
I called the loom or anything and when I
associate the word glimmer I think of
shimmer but even more finely milled so
if you hear that come out of my mouth
that's what I mean but I feel like the
love hangover one and the your love is
king have more like silver or silver
glimmers and whereas this one has gold
and silver in it I love it it's just
amazing these blushes are so good you
guys you have to pick these up all right
they are much better than the other ones
that came in too little heart like boxes
I do like those I have the one in
there's something about berry but the
formulation on these
superb all right and the next product I
want to talk about is a mascara this is
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
love the packaging it's not better than
sex but it's pretty darn close it is so
good you guys it's got a great wand it's
huge I sometimes I don't know I
sometimes think I'm going to poke myself
in the eye with this but I never do I
don't know how that's possible because I
am so messy when I apply my mascara
I'm literally oh wow God it gets my hair
it gets all over my face like literally
everywhere I'm so surprised that I like
this formulation because I like rubber
Bristol wands this is a natural bristle
wand and also on top of that it has a
really wet formula I normally don't love
wet formulas I knew it I shouldn't say
wet formula it has an oily formula I
normally don't like that I do like wet
formulas but the kind of oily formula
I'm not always a huge fan of so I didn't
think I would like the applicator I
didn't think I would like the
formulation and then on top of that I
don't know I just was like I was not
really into it when I first got it I was
just like I'm not gonna like it then I
used it and I was like girl almost as
good as sex it is so good it's amazing
it will make your lower lashes look
really fluffy and long and then the
upper lash is super defined and just
tons of volume length it's like the
trifecta if you want a trifecta mascara
length volume and also definition get
your hands on this baby
alright the next product I want to talk
about is the two faiths return of sexy
palette nobody talks about this anymore
cause it's old news this is probably my
all-time favorite eyeshadow palette I
did a review on this when I first
started my channel and I said in that
video too this is my all-time favorite
palette out of anything and it's just
because the formulation is so freakin
fantastic this is what the outer
packaging looks like it's super bulky
and when you open it up my little mirror
always falls out I can literally like
take it out it's like embarrassing it
just falls out every time you do get the
little pamphlets in here to create
certain looks really really bulky
horrible packaging just horrible
packaging but you guys look at these
colors and I have to say this is the
best formulation on eyes shadow that
two-face has ever released in my opinion
a lot of people didn't like this palette
they thought you get a lot of fallout
with it you do but they're so easy to
blend I wanted
people I'm not a professional makeup
artist I want something that will blend
like a dream these are amazing amazing
you get like a little quad so you get
like a warm tone one and you get the
cool tones one and then like the smoky
one let me show you guys some swatches
on these just beautiful I mean they just
blend so seamlessly literally you don't
even need like your Sigma e-40 brush you
could just put it in the crease and
that's it you don't even need to blend
it out so good
love love love love love and it's funny
I really thought I would like the little
warm quad but I think I like the middle
one of the most so love love-love-love
and then i last product i want to talk
about it outs of an eyeshadow palette it
was so hard to narrow down my favorite
eyeshadow palettes from Too Faced
because I'm obsessed with the Too Faced
little 9 palette quads or quads
I'm obsessed with a two-faced 9 palette
9 pan palettes can you talk Olivia like
can you talk now you can palettes I love
the natural eye 1 I love the sugar pop I
love all of them but it finally came
down to this one against the natural eye
which is one that I have hit pan on I
have like I just love that thing like I
have gone out some of the eyeshadows in
there but I think I like this one more
this is the Too Faced - natural matte
palette it's amazing it is the sister to
the natural eye palette just in matte
form the formulation on these amazing so
buttery so creamy it looks like it's a
very like basic bitch kind of product
I'm sorry but like literally if you look
at it and you think that you could
probably do pit out from like a
drugstore palette like the little quads
from where are they from Physicians
Formula I thought I could do them I also
thought the Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral
eye on neutral is pretty darn similar
but nothing compares to the formulation
on these they're so blendable they're
beautiful on the eye you can create just
gorgeous gorgeous looks my favorite
colors are chocolate cookies strapless
and honey butter I'm just obsessed with
this palette and if you want a really
really nice everyday sort of palette
without any shimmer and you need to get
this actually you should get it anyway
it's just amazing you would think that
you can dupe it like I said but it
really is not completely dupes like as
far as pigmentation and formulation go
it is the best so anyway those were my
top 5 picks from the
to face brand I hope you guys enjoyed
this video let me know if you like these
videos and also like I said if you have
any brands that you would like me to go
over and pick out my top 5 favorite
products leave it down below and I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
