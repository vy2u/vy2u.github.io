thank you so much for joining me in
today's video I am sharing with you guys
another top 5 series last time i did a
drugstore brand so this time i am doing
urban decay so i'm going to share with
you guys my top 5 picks from the Urban
Decay bran so let's go ahead and just
jump right in the first thing I want to
talk about are the herb decay 24-7 glide
on eye pencils if you have been watching
me for a while this should come as no
surprise to you that I am obsessed with
these I have a lot of them I have a lot
of different colors here I really liked
their neutral colors like their black
colors like perversion I really like
their colorful colors i just love at
these 24-7 glide on eye pencils they are
my all time favorite for wearing on my
waterline i find that they just do not
smudge off whatsoever i have heard from
a few of you from a few of my
subscribers that you guys these don't
actually work for you at all i would
highly recommend checking out the knicks
slide on eyeliners they are comparable
to these but i do find that they
sometimes sit on the waterline a tiny
bit better than these but i think that
these ones are more pigmented so if you
try these and they didn't work for you i
would highly recommend checking out the
mixed ones and also the Stila stay all
days stay all day waterproof eyeliner is
i think that's what they're called those
are very good as well but anyway these
are definitely my favorite and i had to
include all them because i do not have a
specific favorite shade i love all of
them i think the colorful ones are great
i think the neutral ones are great
they're all just fantastic so that is my
first pick from the Urban Decay brand my
second pick from the Urban Decay brand
is definitely the Urban Decay perversion
mascara right now I do not have a full
size of this i think i have three or
four little deluxe ice samples which is
why i want to use these up before i
purchase a full size because you know
mascaras dry out pretty quickly so
anyway this is what it looks like the
wand is actually a natural bristle wand
which is a wand that I typically don't
like and it's very funny because lately
I've been obsessed with like natural
bristle ones I really love the Lancome
Hypnose drama I've been loving my Too
Faced better than sex but for the most
part I'm normally like a rubber Bristol
kind of girl but I really love this wand
the formulation is amazing it's a very
very wet slick formula which I
personally like your lashes can
definitely get a little clumpy if you go
overboard with this mascara I personally
don't mind clumpy lashes I
just think it makes your eyes stand out
more but some people don't like it so if
you don't like the more like clumpy
spidery lashes you probably wouldn't
like Urban Decay's perversion mascara
but this is definitely one of my top
picks from the brand alright the next
item I want to talk about is a palette
it was quite hard for me to narrow down
which palette of course you guys know I
hated the Naked palette so I mean I was
in no way shape or form going to show
those in this video but I really do love
the Urban Decay Naked basics and makes
basics to palette wait Urban Decay Naked
basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 pallets I really do like
those pallets and I do like my Urban
Decay reloaded palette but i have to say
nothing compares to the Urban Decay vice
for college so this was the limited
edition look at the cover of this a
isn't that cool it's like an oil slick
or like a spiderweb it's beautiful you
open it up you have a huge mirror and
then the shades are amazing you guys
look at these jewel tones these are
absolutely absolutely stunning and
there's something about the shades in
here that just like gets me going like I
really really love the colors in here
they're just jewel tones they're
beautiful and I feel like the Urban
Decay reloaded palette is more like
pastel II sort of colors I prefer these
jewel tones my favorite shades are
definitely fastball and flame is that
fastball yeah fastball in flame it's
like a beautiful orange color that is
flame and then fastball is the light
pink color they're absolutely gorgeous
some of the eyeshadows in here go on
like a foiled I shadow which I really
love and again you can use these dry or
with a setting spray to give them a
little more oomph but I'm really in love
with the shades in here I love some of
the blue tones and the green tones I
just really like the color combination
in this palette so this is definitely my
all-time favorite palette from urban
decay all right to the next item I want
to talk about our kind of new to the
Urban Decay line these are the Urban
Decay afterglow eight-hour powder
highlighters I picked up all three I
have fireball I have sinned and I have
aura I have been obsessed over the moon
with aura this is what aura looks like
it is a beautiful kind of iridescent
light pink lavender shade it's
absolutely stunning and i got these
around the time that I got my
och um I was going to say buildable
source know the lorac illuminating
highlighters and i thought that i liked
the formulation on those more than these
that I have to admit I'm just loving
these more and more they have a little
more like grip to them then the lorac
ones do and they actually stay on the
cheeks a little bit longer you do want
to have to buff them into the skin if
you really want them to look like they
are one with your skin or else it's
really just going to look like you have
highlight on your cheek and you can
actually see a little more like emphasis
with texture and things like that but
for the most part I have been absolutely
in love with these highlighters and it
was hard for me to pick between these or
the afterglow blushes which I have quite
a few of also am a big fan of those that
I think that these highlighters are the
bomb I did pick up this particular shade
right here sin for my 7,000 subscriber
giveaway which that will be coming up
soon and then the last shade in here i
have been wearing as a blush this week
and the shade is called fireball and
fireball is just a beautiful kind of
peachy color with a gorgeous gorgeous
lavender iridescent running through it
so in my opinion urban decay is like the
king of like color like they just do it
right they know how to do color right
and they come up with very interesting
color combinations like come on like a
peachy color with a beautiful like
purpley iridescent that's so unique and
different and you know aura also has a
little bit of like a lavender your ad
essence to it and then sin is pretty
much just a beautiful opaque sort of
like gold champagne e color but I really
love what they did with these
highlighters and I'm loving them more
and more the more I use them all right
in the last am i'm going to talk about
should come as absolutely no surprise to
any of you if you have been watching my
channel for even just a week or for
three months i have been in love with
the urban decay naked naked nathan the
urban decay naked skin color correcting
fluids i have all five i am obsessed
these are the best color correctors on
the market in my opinion honestly just
the best i have the shades pink peach
lavender yellow and green and i use
lavender to help like lift up fine lines
and wrinkles on my face i use yellow to
go on my eyelids and underneath my eyes
you can use pink as the same
I don't always use all of them together
i'll use me be yellow if i want more of
like a I don't know like a a warm
undertone that day if that makes sense
and then i'll use pink if i'm going in
with like a really kind of pinky
foundation that may not make sense but
it makes sense debate and i use the
shade peach to help with like
hyperpigmentation and also for
correcting dark circles underneath my
eyes and then obviously i use the green
on any sort of active breakouts or
rashes that I might have so I really
really love these I have never still to
this day never really gotten a full size
of the urban decay naked skin concealer
I did have a sample of it I think these
are in much better formulations are a
lot more opaque they're beautiful
they're creamy their blendable they are
the best color correctors on the market
and I've been absolutely obsessed I
would purchase I would purchase and
repurchase every single one of these
shades so anyway that is my top 5 series
from the Urban Decay brands i hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and i will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
