hello can you see me anyway welcome back
to my channel today's video is going to
be another installment in my travel
series I have not done a travel series
video in quite some time I think I only
did like two or three of them I don't
even remember if I added them to the
travel series playlist but always that
playlist down below but basically what
it is is where i share with you guys how
I'm packing what I used to pack and
basically you know all the little carry
items like the little bags and stuff
that I store all my items in when I'm
traveling like with a suitcase and
that's what I was going to do this time
I am obviously in minneapolis right now
and then i will be up at the cabin in a
few days and i wanted to share with you
guys what i will be bringing up there
because i feel like each trip is
different especially for me just
spending time with my family and also
just being up at the cabin I we're very
very minimal makeup just because it's
kind of in the middle of nowhere and
nobody is really looking at your makeup
it's a different story during like
Christmastime and things like that but
as far as the units of heaven as the
Kevin is concerned I really don't go
super super heavy-duty with skincare or
makeup or anything like that so i
thought i would share with you guys
everything that I brought I do have a
few things in the shower some shampoo
items and I do want to show you guys
really quickly a few items here that I
have so the first one that I brought was
this hundred percent body wash infused
buffer from the brand spun geology and I
believe they actually contacted me the
other day and they were wondering if I
wanted to be sent a few of their
products so we'll have to try this out
and see what it's like I remember
getting something like this similar in
my cup sugar must have box and it was
very very scratchy but the reason I
wanted to travel with it was because
it's basically a two-in-one products you
have like a body buffer or scrub and
then you have your body wash infused in
there so we shall try it out I'll let
you guys know if it's scratchy or not if
it is then up I don't want it um alright
and then the next item that I brought to
cleanse my face tis the bozhe
detoxifying black cleanser tom was
supposed to bring this to Iceland with
him but he for God so I have it here all
right and then I have my makeup eraser
for removing makeup and mitre be twisted
for my hair
and then a few shampoo items in the
shower behind me but everything else
fits in here all of my necessities I'm
going to walk you guys through what
exactly I have so let's go ahead and get
started all right the first item effect
I barata on this trip is the pharmacy
rise and shine daily moisture lock I've
been using this in the morning and at
night it doesn't have SPF in it so I
mean technically you can use it at night
but I just forgot my name moisturizer
anyway this is a pretty nice a
moisturizer it's kind of weird you do
have to rub it in quite a bit for it to
completely sink in but I thought it
would be good because it's a nice little
sighs and then I brought to you little
masks so the first thing that I brought
was the Palmetto derma rejuvenating
antioxidant mask I got this in this
month's FC bag and it has glycolic acid
in it and some really nice ingredients
so I thought I would try it out but you
guys know that I'm asked pretty much
every single day and I knew this would
not be enough for me for my trip so I
also brought two of these little
pharmacy what are these hydrating
coconut gel mask I used one last night I
really really like these they come
obviously in like single format they're
not sheet masks are actually like gel
sheet mass so they're super cool they
really really cling to the face nicely
and I thought those would be perfect for
travel and then if you guys watched my
alcohol I picked up a little set of
Pacifica wipes that had different sorts
of wipes in them so the first one is
these super detoxes deep purification
wipes purification wipes I also already
used up as the purified coconut water
cleansing wipes and then these ones are
pink grapefruits no these are the makeup
removing wipes I haven't tried these
ones yet I did try these ones these are
cool these are actually serum wipes so
these are moisturize energized serum
wipes and then this one right here are
the exfoliating are these right here I'm
sorry it's kind of early in the morning
these are the ends of Matt
exfoliating peach and apricot infuse so
yeah I thought those would be nice I
really like having wipes and things like
that for traveling just because I don't
know you never know when you need to rub
down your body with a wipe um when I was
traveling here in the car I was so
sweaty and I wish that I had packed this
in my purse so that i could go ahead and
rub my body down with a few of those so
i used them all over my body and also on
my face alright the next item that I
packed was a mini dry shampoo this is
the Amica per cup dry shampoo it's nice
i like it i also went ahead and packed a
tiny little nail polish from formula x
it's called the wing woman or wing a
woman I just thought what the heck I
have time to paint my nails now so I
might as well I also brought my love
vanilla the healthy deodorant this is in
the fresh vanilla lemon scent really
really really enjoying this so far it is
a natural deodorants and I really like
it alright then I also brought let's see
here a NARS eyeliner I'm not really
enjoying this I wore this yesterday it
was not water proof whatsoever this is
the larger than life long-wear eyeliner
in Via Veneto it's nice because it's
small and it's retractable but like I
said it did not stay on my waterline
very well and then I also brought a
travel size of the smush Fox Marsh Marsh
mishra Smashbox x-rated a volumizer
mascara I do like that when I has a
really really wet formulation and then I
brought three lippies oh god oh gosh oh
gosh there it is three Lippi's the first
one is the Revlon just bitten kissable
stain is that what it's called I
can't even read it TC it's like all worn
off just bitten kissable balm stain in
the shade honey this is the product i'm
trying to use up in 2016 and this one is
as well this is the mix of butter gloss
in the shade tiramisu and also the
l'oreal colour each bomb in the shade
Rose elixir so I thought I would go
ahead and use those and then I also have
the Hawaiian Tropic Selke hydration
after sun lotion here and this is in the
coconut papaya sense if you guys have
been watching me for a while you know I
love Hawaiian Tropic I use them for
after sun care and also for sunscreen
alright moving up here we have a powder
the powder that I brought is the Loreal
infallible Pro matte powder
in the shade number 100 porcelain it
does run a little dark but I do like it
and then I brought a little bottle of
the Chloe perfume this is what it looks
like I mean is unfortunately one of
those things that you have to like dab
onto your wrists and then onto your neck
but that's okay I don't need a spray
bottle of them going up to the cabin and
then I also packed the rollerball of the
Elizabeth James Nirvana white and then
here i have a tiny little deluxe i
sample of the two-faced hangover RX
primer I wanted to bring a hydrating
primer and also a smoothing primer with
me and then I have one of my foundations
here I brought the new l'oreal
infallible Pro glow 24 hour foundation I
wore this yesterday really really like
it so far it's very very beautiful and
then here in these little plastic
baggies I have a few of like my disks so
these are the rock resurfacing desk I
love these you guys notes I use these as
the second step in my makeup removal at
nighttime and I really really enjoy them
but they come in this big tub so I just
put them into plastic bags when I travel
I also do the same thing with my peter
thomas roth unwrinkle heel pads so i
just take a handful of them i use these
in the morning and at night and i just
put them in a plastic bag because again
they come in a little container are like
a tub and then these are the ultima
seller cleansing pads and i am liking
those so far alright moving on up right
here i have a little empty tea container
because i will be doing tea time with
live when i get to the cabin and I just
thought a few makeup brushes nothing
special i think my sigma e35 my eco
tools big like kabuki brush I brought
the Real Techniques blush brush and then
if you like flat shader brushes nothing
crazy I also brought to the bare
minerals complexion rescue tinted
hydrating gel cream my shade is 0-1 opal
and I am trying to use this up before
September first and I just thought it
would be a good way to use it if I bring
it up to the cabin I do like it I like
to wear an underneath where is it the
l'oreal pro blow this one i like to wear
that particular thing listen general i
like to wear underneath foundations
because it does leave me quite
see but it's a good product I have my
little um I was going to say clarisonic
no this is my little toothbrush head I
have some aquafresh extreme clean
toothpaste and then right here i have
the first day beauty ultra Repair
hydrating serum I also have the amore
Pacific future response H defense serum
and also the cargo lash accelerator
overnight gel and then I brought a body
creme or a lotion this smells amazing
this is the royal apothic I think it's
called cutting garden yeah its most
amazing I just like slathered my body in
that last night it was great and then at
the back there I have a secret
wonderland fragrance mist from Bath and
Body Works alright and then moving on
towards the top I have an eyeshadow
palette here and because i'm going to
the cabin i really don't do anything
crazy so I brought this little tiny
pocket friendly palette right here this
is the tarts what does it call double
duty beauty Amazonian clay young wild &amp;amp;
free i shadow palettes I can't open it I
can't open a free bike there I got it I
got it hold on let me see if I can flip
it around so this is what it looks like
and you just have a bunch of really
really gorgeous shades in here they're
very very neutral oh my god I totally
took a gouge out of that one
alright but they're really really
beautiful and they smell like chocolate
and they blend really nicely got it all
over my finger but you know this is like
literally the size of my palm so it's
awesome for travel and then I also
brought my new a bullet a black up black
my new Becca split pan you guys this is
in the shade let's see here champagne
pop and a flower child and this is what
it looks like I thought it would be
perfect for the cabin if you guys are
curious I wrap everything in bubble wrap
and the bubble wrap i use is what again
in my sephora boxes you know at the
bottom of the sephora boxes you get like
a piece of bubble wrap i save that for
travel and then i rap you know fragile
items to have powders in them I
basically wrap it in there so is this
didn't break it all right there i have
my nail in there of course I seem to be
abusing my makeup but this is a gorgeous
gorgeous blush and highlight and again
when i'm up at the cabin I don't need
more than one option for blush and
highlights and then I did bring a
bronzer this is new to me and I'm loving
it so far this is the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer and the shade that I have
is I guess the lightest one it's called
light bronzer but I guess the other one
is lighter technically I'm not quite
sure but this is what it looks like it's
really really beautiful can you just
open a little bit more please please oh
