channel today I have what I think will
be a very fun video I am testing out a
two toned I look meaning I have a
different colored eyeshadow on this eye
versus this eye I'm going to be using
the color pop yes please palette and I
kind of have a little bit of an idea of
what I want to do I'm thinking more of
like an orange II a red tone dye over
here and then more like yellow and brown
over here I don't want to go overboard
because I am heading to work today
luckily it is a Freaky Friday which is
where we wear what we want to work on
Fridays so I'm not a big deal but I
still think this is gonna be a lot of
fun and I know my students are gonna
love this I look today so I have never
done one of these before I've seen J
kissa Lauren make Beauty people who are
really really skilled with makeup do
this before so because this is my first
time I only have kind of like an overall
thought process on what I want to do but
I'm not quite sure how it will look at
the end now I'm gonna walk you guys
quickly through what I already do have
on my face and then I will zoom you in
and we will go ahead and get started I
am wearing at the Burt's Bees a suede
splash lipstick right now on my lips I
do have the a cosmetics brow power on
right now this is something I'm trying
to project pan to set my face I have the
Born This Way powder from Too Faced on
my skin as well as it be a Becca
brightening under-eye powder I found a
new way to use this and I actually am
really enjoying it so I will be doing a
video soon for you guys talking about
how I apply it and that will be a
product I was wrong about video yeah I
did find a way to use this than I am
enjoying it now I am currently trying to
project pan the vitamin enriched face
base from Bobbi Brown as well as the
extra SPF 25 tented moisturizing balm I
actually woke up with really really dry
skin around this area so I do have both
of these on today I'm making a lot of
progress on at the primer as you guys
can see and then when it comes to the
balm I have kept Anna but besides that
it's gonna take a while to get through
this now this is just a really really
light tinted balm so you guys will be
able to see my skin through it and
probably a little bit of dryness but
yeah I don't know what happened I just
woke up this morning and I was like my
skin that looks really shitty and then
it for concealer as well as a little bit
of an eye
I do have the active I liked corrector
from a meet a makeup on underneath my
eyes as well as on my eyelids and then I
do have a little bit of the lorac
unzipped palette on I have underrated
and unapologetic which is like this
matte kind of a neutral rose color and
then this kind of bronze II shade down
here I have that mixed on my cheeks so
that is everything that I have on my
face currently it let me assume you guys
in and we'll get started on the
two-toned eye okay so I did not realize
that I was already pretty far zoomed in
I'm just gonna keep the camera where it
is we're gonna jump into the color pop
yes please I am going to start with this
shade right here taking a sigma e40
brush I'm just going to dust that all
over my eyelid as well as underneath my
eye and the shades on here
they have like a sticker on the back but
if you have the color pop yes please you
know then unfortunately the names are
backwards so it's just easier for me to
show you exactly which one I am using
all right using that same exact brush
I'm gonna go into this kind of peachy
color right here oh and by the way we're
doing the kind of orange e red eye first
from the left hand side I'm going to
take that shade and I'm going to work
this in as my transition I'm tapping off
the excess and starting on the outer
corner of my eye and then taking it into
the crease I'm also doing circular
motions and blending it up towards my
brow I do have downward pointing eyes so
I want to take my eye shadow a little
higher I find that if I keep my eye
shadow too low in the crease it does not
lift my eyes it really makes them point
down where it's even more so I'm taking
it kind of higher up towards my brow
which I do enjoy alrighty and now let's
go ahead and jump into a little more of
a defining a brush I'm gonna take the
wet and wild crease brush which I
absolutely love and I'm gonna go into
this a bright orange right here it is a
really really dark kind of already
orange but it's super pretty I'm just
tapping on there and then I'm tapping
off the excess again going to start on
the outer corner of my eye and then
lightly take it in again because I do
have downward pointing eyes I find if I
take it too far in this way it just
makes my eyes kind of flop down even
more so I like to concentrate the
majority of my product on the outer
corner just so I can lift lift lift I
know it'd be helpful if I could do a
winged eyeliner as well but I just
really
winged eyeliner I attempted it again the
other day of for a concert and it still
didn't look good so you know
now going back in with that Sigma e-40
brush I'm just gonna go ahead and blend
that out and again I am doing small
circular motions I find this easier for
me because I feel like it does push the
product or bring it up a little bit
which again is what I am trying to do I
finally watched tutorials on downward
pointing eyes and I was like oh
that is my eye shape and this is what I
should be doing so I like to really
concentrate the product on is the outer
part of my eye alright let's go ahead
and deepen that up a little bit I am
going to take my don't I take a morphe
m5 13 it's a little stained and I'm
gonna jump into this kind of a brownish
color down here it's like a Reddy Brown
just gonna go ahead and take that tap
off the excess and then again it build
that into the outer part of my eye
taking this a little closer into my
crease and with this brush I like to go
more back and forth when I do circular
motions I find that it really scratches
up my eye because morphe brushes aren't
necessarily the most comfortable okay
just being honest so going up back and
forth
taking that same brush I'm going to jump
into our transition color again and I'm
gonna work this above the crease now so
I'm going to go right above where I
place to that color and we're just gonna
go ahead and start bringing that up a
little higher because again want to lift
my eye
now jumping back into that Sigma e-40
again we are just blending everything
out back and forth as well as circular
motions
alright let's go ahead and take a sigma
e25 blending brush I'm going to go ahead
and put a little color on my lower lash
line and I'm going to use that orange
that we used in the crease I'm going to
go ahead and pick that up on the very
tip of the brush and I am just going to
smoke that out kind of looking up a
little bit so I can get it really close
to the lash line and I'm just going to
take it in about halfway
all righty back into that Sigma e-40 and
I am going to blend everything together
one more time and then I think I want to
go with the even darker red shade and
just kind of play up a little more color
in the outer beard just so it's super
super contrasting contrasting there's a
big contrast between the left and right
eye alright let's go ahead and take that
reddish color right here and I'm just
going to Pat that into the outer V we're
gonna keep it pretty low I'm not going
to take this too high I just want a
little more definition right here so if
this is my crease I'm not going any
higher than that
oh and this is a Coastal Scents BRS co8
brush like this brush it's nice it's
also nice for the lower lash line
and then I'm going to blend that again
it with these Sigma e-40
alright guys it is time for a lid color
I'm gonna go in with again this sort of
a warm tone yellowy golden orange e
color I'm just gonna tap that right onto
my lid and then I am going to apply a
layer of B Charlotte Tilbury full-fat
lashes as well as a layer of the Marc
Jacobs a Velvet Nora mascara so let's
get started
we're done with the left eye I like it
so far now let's go ahead and move on to
the right eye I'm starting to think that
this may be a little difficult with this
particular palette originally I wanted
to use the Kat Von D synced and Center
because I wanted to do like a blue and
green or like orange and yellow or
something like that
well I guess I'm kind of doing orange
and yellow with this one but I'm
starting to notice that a lot of these
do kind of start to blend together and
meld together so I'm not quite sure how
popping this I will be but I'm thinking
we're gonna use some of the yellow maybe
darken it up a little bit with this and
then use some of the gold we will see
next time I do a two-tone eye look let
me know if you want me to use like the
Kat Von D's thing to the center or the
metal man I thought for my first time it
would be better to use something like
this and also I know this is available
currently on the colour-pop dot-com
website unfortunately Kat Von D Sinkin
centers limited edition you can't get
any more so what's the point of me using
it in tutorials and you guys can't get
it anyway let's go ahead and move on to
the right eye shall we all right we're
gonna start on the right eye with that
same base color that we took for the
left eye and then I'm going to take this
transition shade as well and do the same
exact thing and that I did on the left
eye and this time I am using a clean
what is this BH Cosmetics fluffy crease
brush one of my favorites so I'm just
going ahead and tapping that cream color
all over my lid all the way up to my
brow and then again underneath my eyes
as well I just feel like it gives a
little extra setting and I'm starting to
get those fine lines and wrinkles right
under here so I can do any extra setting
and that's a good thing all right and
then taking that transition again
starting on the outer part of the eye
and then taking it a little farther in
and I'm really gonna build this one up
because I'm worried that this is gonna
be really really dramatic and I'm not
gonna get as much yellow as I want on
the right so I'm really gonna kind of
build this up and again concentrating it
on the outer part of the lid and
bringing it pretty high up towards the
brow now I'm going to go in with kind of
a messy application of the bright yellow
down here that mustard yellow I'm taking
the same brush and I'm just lightly
going to start in the outer V
and then I'm taking it all the way in
here we really want the yellow to pop
because this is going to be the main
color over here and pretty much the only
eyeshadow that I really build up on this
side so I'm taking it I'm going all the
way up to the brow again and just doing
some circular motions
not taking a sigma e35 I'm really really
gonna build up that yellow color and I'm
starting to think with this a two-toned
eye maybe I should do that orange on the
lower lash line because I did a little
bit of yellow over here on the lid so
it's kind of like the colors are
different on each eye but then they have
a one pop of color that's the same from
each legs then what do you guys think
about that
so anyway I'm just building up this
yellow the yellow is really going to be
the main color all over this eye or at
least on at the top of my lid and then
on the bottom I think I will go for the
orange so I'm just taking this and I'm
going to be building it and blending it
and then I will blend it out with a
morphe M 5:11
Marie if the lady just changed I had to
close my shades because there was some
light popping through and I was starting
to show like little blotches of sunlight
on my face so now I'm gonna go ahead and
take that yellow I'm gonna tap it onto
my lid and then I'm gonna go on my lower
lash line with that orange shade using a
sigma e30
on the left eye over here I'm just gonna
go back in with that kind of yellowy
gold color because now we have the same
sort of colors on each side I just
really want to show that there was a
little bit of yellow over here so taking
that same ease 30 brush from Sigma I'm
just tapping a little more on my lid so
it's a little more visible because the
two-toned eye is now kind of overlapping
and I'm liking it I totally dig it I
think it's fine
all right now taking a morphe m4 for one
I am just making sure everything is
properly blended on the right hand side
on my lower lash line as well I poked
myself in the eye with that you thirty
brush hurt and now I'm gonna go
ahead and apply one coat of again these
Charlotte Tilbury full-fat lashes as
well as a one coat of the Marc Jacobs of
elvenmoor mascara
alright guys so that is it here is my
2-tone I look I think it's really really
fun I like it I definitely will try this
again with more bright colored
eyeshadows maybe pink and blue or maybe
like green and red or something like
that I still think it worked pretty darn
well with the color pop yes please
palette you guys can probably see I use
this out of this palette I think
it's absolutely amazing and incredible
and it's definitely one I would
recommend picking up for what sixteen
dollars so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this little eye look thanks so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
