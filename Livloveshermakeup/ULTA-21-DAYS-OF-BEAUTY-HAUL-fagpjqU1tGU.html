thank you so much for joining me i hope
you were all having a fantastic day I
apologize with this video and going up
later again in the day I've just been
not like in the mood at all to film in
the morning this past week I've been
really really tired so I am only when I
get home from work but I do have a halt
here for you guys that I'm very excited
about I ended up picking up quite a bit
of stuff from the alte 21 days of beauty
event so I thought I would come on here
and share with you guys what I got
originally I was just gonna pick up a
few things only a few things really
appealed to me and then like every day i
was on the autocom website picking up
news so yeah let's just get right
into it shall we the first thing I
picked up was this peter thomas roth
unwrinkle kit and this was eighty eight
dollars and was half the price so it was
somewhere around like I believe 42 or 44
dollars love this I was so so excited
because it has the peter thomas roth
unwrinkle peel pads which are one of my
favorite like decongesting sort of peel
pads they have like a chaise in them and
glycolic acid and just wonderful
wonderful things that really can even
out the texture on your skin they can
even out your skin tone in general
they're really really helpful no matter
what skin tone or type you have so I
love those and then it also comes with
the unwrinkle turbo line smoothing
toning lotion which I have never tried
before but I'm really excited to try
that out it's kind of like an essence
and then i have the unwrinkle night
cream which i have tried out before that
is a hundred and ten dollar night cream
I've actually gone through a full size
of that before and I really enjoyed it
and that also comes with the unwrinkled
turbo unwrinkle turbo face serum which I
also haven't tried out so I am really
really excited to try these items out i
mean like i said i have tried two of
them and i'm just a huge fan of the
peter thomas roth on wrinkle line in
general so there we have the peel pads
and then here is the little mini Ciro
I'm just actually a really nice size you
get a really tiny little sample of the
face cream which I understand since it
is so expensive and then here is the
unwrinkle toward I cannot say unwrinkle
I'm wrinkle turbos smoothing line you
know lotion so yeah I really
excited for that and I just thought it
was a great deal because normally that's
eighty eight dollars and that was like
forty four dollars which i think is a
great deal my hair is a hot mess again I
worked out at the gym and it's all like
fluffy and pissy and crazy alright
moving on the next thing I had picked up
it was this me rad closer I say this is
how I don't film at night time I cannot
speak this is the Murad clarifying
cleanser incest it reduces ninety-nine
point nine percent of irritating surface
bacteria in less than one minute on your
face um the reason I got this was
because you get six point seven five
fluid ounces in here and this was
literally like twelve or fourteen
dollars and it does have one point five
percent salicylic acid in it so I know
be helpful as a you know acne cleanser
and also I just felt like you get so
much product in here and it was such a
great deal for you know the price and I
particularly think that gel like
cleansers go a really really long way so
I know I'm gonna enjoy that the next
thing I picked up was the it cosmetics
number 50 serum serum a collagen bail
anti-aging primer it looks like this I
have the pink one so when I saw this
what's on sale for half off I was like
um yes I need it I need it I need it so
this is what it looks like and I'm super
excited to try this one out again that
was around like $25 I think because
those primers are super expensive so
really really excited i got my hands on
that also the peter thomas roth kids
came with this little mini irish more
mud purifying black mask which I really
love actually having full sides of this
in my collection so I do enjoy that the
next thing I got toward two of the it
cosmetics bye bye pores poreless finish
HD micro powder with hydro collagen silk
and vitamins ka c and e i love these
these are my all time favorite finishing
powder nothing compares I'm sorry but
nothing compares I personally do not
like the pressed version i like the
loose version which is really really
messy but yeah these were on sale I
believe twenty-five dollars apiece and
they're normally wait view it was like
15 apiece I can't remember they were
half off which was a really good deal so
I pick two of those out and then I also
picked up this Mario Badescu eye makeup
remover gel this is the non-oily virgin
I just wanted to try this out I used to
strictly use all Mario Badescu products
like I was a huge fan so and that was
in my college days when i was a freshman
and sophomore in college i strictly used
his products for skin care so i thought
i would try a few those out I also well
let me show you guys I got like tons and
tons of samples because obviously i made
like six different orders so i got tons
a little guys the sample in there i also
picked up the mario badescu facial spray
with a low herbs and rose water again it
was half off and I really do love this
spray it's not like these your leak
rosewater balancing miss that one is
better in my opinion but this one is
still really nice refreshing you can use
it to set in your makeup or setting your
skin care which is what i am going to
use it for all right i also got oh yeah
here it is the little Mario Badescu
drying lotion I have tried this before
and then one of my subscribers was
telling me she was like you need to get
it again because it's so great for you
know clearing up really big like nasty
cystic pimples you might have you just
put it right on there and I got it in
the glass bottle just you know this
formula is much better if it is in the
glass bottle the plastic bottle it tends
to go back quicker so highly recommend
picking up the glass bottle I believe
they are the same price I know that a
lot of people don't like this because
you can't really travel with it and
things like that but this does keep the
product in there just a little fresher
that's what I've noticed between my
glass bottle and the plastic bottle but
anyway this is just one of those kind of
like sulfur spot treatments where you
just put it on any area where you have a
big pimple and it clears it up like in a
day which is amazing and one of my
subscribers kept reminding me to pick
that out during the 21 days of beauty of
that the next thing I got was another
two faced sweethearts perfect flush
blush and I wanted to get the other two
I have there something about Barry and
then I wanted to get peach beach and
this one but this was the only one that
they had I think these were fifteen
dollars this one is candy glow and it's
really really beautiful and it just has
a bunch of kind of like peachy light
pink colors in it it's more peachy than
it looked on the website honestly
whenever I see this on websites it looks
like this very very light pink and then
I feel like well it kind of is light
pink when you swatch it it's just a
beautiful kind of like light pink flush
of color with a little bit of peach in
there as well so I was excited to get
back for half off and then I got to the
Anasazi of Beverly Hills perfect brow
pencil in the shade taupe every
he has been telling me to get this
pencil and honestly i don't think the
honest askia Beverly Hills products are
that amazing I'm talking about their
brow products I did declutter their brow
powder and also their dip brow pomade
because I wasn't that interested in them
honestly but then again I am one of
those people I really don't do much with
my brows like today I literally just
have a little bit of product right in
the front I don't do a lot with my brows
I prefer a pencil so everybody was like
no no no they're great you just got the
wrong kind of product so I have heard so
many things about this been sold it has
a spoolie on one end and then the pencil
on the other and again it was half off
so I thought I would try it I got these
sheep toes like I said and then the next
thing i got was this little street
becton kit this is the straw becton best
sellers starters trio best sellers
starter trio bestseller started trio yes
I said that right okay this has the
advanced retinol intensive night
moisturizer the st advanced intensive
concentrate for wrinkles and stretch
marks and then also the TL advanced
tightening neck cream which I'm so
excited about because honestly I love a
good neck Raven I really really do I
have a few that I really enjoy and I
just thought that this would be fun to
have so right here we have the advanced
retinol intensive night moisturizer
which I'm excited to try I really
believe in retinol products I think they
really do help your skin so I'm excited
for that and then we also have some keep
their own laptop little presents all
right this is the SG advanced intensive
concentrate for wrinkles and stretch
marks with collagen see II went wrinkle
repair complex so you can use the home
on stretch marks i have a bunch on the
back of my ass are you confuse them for
wrinkles and then here is the other
little product and this is the TL
advanced tightening that cream which I'm
super super excited about because like i
said i love a good neck cream alright
moving on the next thing i got was this
oh my god i have had my eye on this
forever my boyfriend was very interested
in HD h which is human growth hormone
and i'm aware in the leggy this is like
one of those products who probably
shouldn't really screw around with but
i'm willing to test it out for you guys
so much
no this stuff actually works this is
like a hundred and twenty dollar product
on the altar com website and it was on
sale for like sixty dollars during the
sale and basically these are little
packets of human growth hormone that you
take every day and it's supposed to help
with aging and also just like I don't
know it's supposed to like keep your
weight in check its supposed to do I I'm
not trying to really keep my weight in
check but I mean what i am trying to
like i would love for my skin to say
useful it says youthful skin integrity
lean musculature elevated energy
production I don't really need that but
of the house of adipose tissue
distribution I don't know this just
really really um I don't know I just
really wanted this I don't really know
what to say to you guys I know that it's
one of those things that's like okay
human growth hormone like it's not even
safe I had my boyfriend who's a doctor
look over this he said it's all natural
um so we'll see let me know what you
would like me to do a follow up with
this product obviously i will be doing a
follow-up all next week with these
products but maybe a follow-up after
using this for a month because it's like
a hundred dollars a month for this and
if i see results in a month then maybe i
want to repurchase if not then obviously
i'm not going to purchase a hundred
dollars like Randy's you know that's
just ridiculous but you take them every
day on an empty stomach either in the
morning before breakfast or two hours
after dinner prior to bedtime so i don't
know i have just had my eyes on this
forever on the ultra duck home website
literally for like a year and a half now
and so finally I got it during the sale
I don't know I don't know where my
interest lies with that but there's
something that just has sparked my
interest so let me know if you would
like me to go ahead and do a review on
that once I use the box up alright and
then the last thing i got was the maui
ever color poreless faced offenders
should be weirdest ever like the
weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life
everybody swears by it though
let me show you buy it comes in this
little like heavy weighted box heavy
little weighted container box saying I
cannot freaking open it open okay look
at those to see this the weirdest
ever you guys to see that it's like a
jelly literally that you but take with
the sponge and you pat it on to your
face and I have heard so many people
that love this and I'm like what is it
like what is this I have no idea what
this is like literally I just don't get
it um but of course I want to try it out
and see what the deal is it's just
supposed to help conceal pours it comes
with this giant a sponge of course i
will give you bike a follow up on that
so many people claim that this is an
amazing product I don't even understand
how it works looking for you a little
bit on the back it says swirl a sponge
in the face defender and softly Pat this
innovative sheer formula all over your
face never Swiper rub as this can remove
your makeup so you literally Pat it in
so it's so weird I will let you guys
