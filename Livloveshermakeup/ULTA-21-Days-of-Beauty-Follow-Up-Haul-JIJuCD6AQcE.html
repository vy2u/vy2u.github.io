video is going to be my Alta 21 days a
beauty follow-up hall so I will link the
original haul video in the description
bar if you would like to watch it but
exactly a week ago I did a hall from the
21 days of beauty event at Alta and i'm
here to share my thoughts on all the
products how they're working out for me
so far and yeah let's just get right
into it the first item that i can't
really give you guys my thoughts on yet
is the serovital or seer Obatala HGH
human growth hormone so i need to take
this for a month and i plan on basically
taking this until everything is gone and
then i will got to update you guys but
for the most part i can't really tell
you if this is working or not yet i've
only been taking it for a week I do
notice with these that although it says
to take on an empty stomach I feel sick
if I don't take these with food so I
have been taking these with food we'll
see if it works out I'll let you guys
know if you're interested in about a
month how these work differently alright
so the next thing I picked up in the
sale was the Murad clarifying cleanser
this has 1.5% salicylic acid I have been
using this to cleanse my face at night
time it was like filled up to like this
blue line and I barely have used any and
I just have the feeling that this is
going to be one of those cleansers that
I have like a love hate relationship
with it kinda reminds me of the peter
thomas roth gel cleansers because a
little goes a long way which is really
really great and i love it but at the
same time I feel like I'm gonna get sick
of this probably pretty quickly so i
plan on definitely swapping this out
with different kind of cleansers that i
have but for the most part this was
really nice i had my period last week
and i was left with some little active
bumps on you know my t-zone and my
hormonal areas where i tend to my
hormonal areas my hormonal acne tends to
like come out in this area so this was
helping with that definitely i don't
think it's as good as benzoyl peroxide
for clearing up like pimples but it is
nice and salicylic acid also does
exfoliate your skin so I do like it it
has kind of like a lemony sweet scent to
it and a little goes a long way like if
you're going to use this with your
clarisonic you only need the smallest
amount so yeah I am enjoying that so far
the next thing I got was the Mario
Badescu facial spray with a low herbs
and rosewater I a
or this spray um it's not as good as
like moisture leak rose water balancing
mess I love anything rose and I feel
like that really calms inflammation in
my skin but this one does as well and it
smells really really good it smells like
rose and herbs and I just like to set in
my skincare with this you can also set
in your makeup with it I personally
don't but it's been just wonderful this
week I really really have been enjoying
this alright so the next item i also got
that was from mario badescu is the
drying lotion in the little glass bottle
i've been using this on little areas
where again I've been having hormonal
acne it's amazing it does have alcohol
in it so it does sting when you use it
but what you want to do is make sure you
don't shake it up and just take your cue
tip dip it down into the a little like
creamy pink part here and then just kind
of plaster it on to the area that you
want to dry up and it really really does
work it's amazing definitely have
alcohol though it stings a little bit
and it does have sulfur so it doesn't
smell very good but it really does clear
up those big nasty pimples very very
nicely alright speaking of skincare I
also got the peter thomas roth unwrinkle
kit and in there we had the unwrinkled
peel pads which I adore I have had you
know full sizes of this at many many
times like in my life so far i probably
have gone through like 16 full sizes of
these little pads these are amazing they
have let's see here alpha beta and gamma
acids in it they have a twenty twenty
percent complex of amino acids
exfoliators just this is these are
amazing literally if you have to like
congested skin I cannot speak if you
have congested skin and you want to
decongest it i highly recommend using
these what you do is you put them over
clean skin you leave them on for about
60 seconds to three minutes depending on
your skin type and then you wash them
off with cool water and then you just go
ahead and continue with your skin care
routine they're amazing they clear up
texture on the face acne breakouts just
all sorts of things really really nice
product I also got the little unwrinkle
turbo face serum in there and this is
what it looks like I really enjoy this
if you have dry skin I think you would
absolutely adore this because this line
is kind of made for mature skin and
usually when your skin is a little more
mature you tend to be a little more
drive and say someone like me who has
kind of oily
them but yeah it's very very nice it
definitely has like a thin consistency
and I personally like my serums to be
very lightweight and just kind of sink
into the skin immediately this one
definitely doesn't it puts a little bit
of moisture back into your skin and have
a little bit of like a slick oily
consistency to it which is why I think
if you have aging skin or dry skin you
would love it but it's a really good
serum and I have been enjoying it and it
also came with the peter thomas roth
unwrinkled night cream I really enjoyed
this I have gone through a full size of
this at one point if you have dry skin
or aging skin again you're gonna love
this a little goes a long way like if
you have combo or oily skin like me a
little goes a long way it's a very very
thick kind of light yellow color and
doesn't really have a scent to it pretty
basic but it's really really nice and
very very hydrating and I do feel like
it plumps up my fine lines and wrinkles
on my face and then the last little item
that came in that kit was the unwrinkle
turbo line smoothing Tony lotion I can
never say that but yeah anyway this is a
toner and it is probably the thickest
toner I've ever used in my life it has
this like weird little thing where a lot
of the product just doesn't come out
right away because it is kind of like a
thick gel so I'm going to take that
little stopper out so I can just pour it
onto my cotton pad with no problems
because I was like really shaking trying
to get it out but it is a very very
thick toner it kind of reminds me of the
polished choice resist toner it has a
lot of moisture in there and it's not
going to like wipe away impurities the
way something like I don't know like a
l'oreal toner would you know and it
doesn't have to also look acid it or
anything like that in it basically is
just going to put moisture back into
your skin and actually / hydration back
into your skin so if you combine all of
these at night time you are going to
have very very hydrated skin alright the
next thing I picked up was the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow pencil in the shade
taupe right yes taupe I'm not that
impressed with this I don't know what it
is i've been using it all week I think
it's really just a basic product I'm
really not a huge fan of honest Ostia
pepper Lee Hill eyebrow products in
general um I don't know I didn't really
like their dipbrow I didn't really like
their powder and I'm not really a huge
fan of this pencil I think it is nice
that has a spoolie on one side and it's
nice and stiff so you really can kind of
get in there and blend the color out or
the pencil out but for the most part I
think the pencil is kind of rough um it
doesn't glide on nearly as nicely as
they my revlon brow fantasy in dark
blond and I don't know I just I just
don't think it's that impressive
everybody raves about this and I it
definitely was worth it for like i think
i paid thirteen dollars for it but i
would never purchase this at full price
honestly so that's just ok the next
thing I picked up with this little
Street Vechten starters kit and Ethier
we had the advanced retinol intensive
night moisturizer the TL advanced
tightening net cream tightening neck
cream and the st advanced intensive
concentrate for wrinkles and stretch
marks so we'll start with this one this
one is just okay it leaves a little bit
of a greasy residue on my skin and it
does smell a little bit like peppermint
because I feel like it's supposed to
help with circulation like if you want
to put it on the back of your ass for
something light um but I don't feel like
it's very nice for like wrinkles and
things like that because it does have
that peppermint oil in there which is
actually a skin irritant so I've been
using this on the back of my ass oh it's
my cellulite and I do like it for that
but i don't think i would purchase a
full-size let's see here the neck cream
on the other hand really really adore
this a very very thick and emollient
very very nice a little goes a very long
way it has a very buoyant sort of
texture to it I'm really really adore it
and a little tip I want to give you guys
a lot of people are like how do you
apply neck cream because you know you
take the product and you think you're
going like this or something it's just
kind of awkward movement I put it on the
back of my hands I rub it together and
then I go like this and you want to like
push upwards you don't ever want to take
your neck cream like this because then
you're just pulling the skin down and
gravity is going you know he's just
gonna fall okay you're just like pulling
the skin down so why I recommend is
using the back of your hands and going
up like this that way you don't get the
actual product on like the pop you know
the palms of your hands yeah and then
also um you're pulling upwards so you're
helping so that gravity's not like eight
you know all right anyway somebody asked
me they were like
I would like neck cream it's so awkward
i was like i just used the back of my
hands like this all right and then the
last thing that was in here with these
tree becton advanced retinol intensive
night moisturizer and this i really
really like it reminds me of the Paula's
Choice antioxidant serum I believe
that's what it's called yeah the
antioxidant serum I really like that
product this sinks in remarkably fast
and has a really nice scent to it as
well really like the texture this is a
product I would definitely consider
picking up in full size especially
because it has retinol in it and my skin
responds very well to mention all
alright the next two things I have
picked up where the it cosmetics / pores
translucent to loose powders I love
these they're amazing been using them
all week very very impressed I guess the
only thing I don't like is that like I
inhale these powders half the time
because they're so powdery but they
really do make your skin look beautiful
there are wonderful finishing powder and
do have it on today I love these alright
another product that I had picked up was
the Malley face defender now this is
like the weirdest thing ever and I hate
this packaging I can never open this
there we go I can barely open it but
anyway it has a nice little mirror and
then this is what it looks like and it
looks like just the strangest thing ever
what you do is you put your sponge in
there you kind of wipe it around and
then you literally push into your skin
and it it basically is like I think one
of my subscribers said last week they
were like what it reminds me of is a
silicone primer in like a pressed
version that's exactly what it is so it
really does work just remember to press
don't um you know don't pull because
then you are going to ruin your makeup
especially if you wear a lot of
foundation like I do but yeah if you
just press it into your skin it really
does help with pores it's amazing I
really really enjoy this weird little
thing it looks like a jellyfish to me do
you see that looks like a jellyfish
alright moving on the next thing I
purchased with the two-faced sweethearts
perfect blush blush in candy glow really
really enjoying this I think it looks so
pretty on the cheeks the only thing I'm
not a huge fan of is that there are
definitely flecks of straight up gold
glitter in here and I just think glitter
is
attractive on the skin it just kind of
emphasizes texture and pores so I try
not to concentrate it too much in the
areas where i already have big pores
like over here so i really try and
concentrate it more so like over here
and then bring it up to my cheekbone but
i really like the color it's beautiful
alright i also picked up the it
cosmetics number 50 serum collagen veil
anti-aging primer really enjoying this I
like the pink one more but I have been
enjoying this this one this week it
definitely has a little more of a tacky
texture to it so you kind of need to
work it through your hands and then
apply it to your face it's nice that it
has attacked the texture because it
really makes like your foundation and
everything that you put on top of it
stay on all day long but it's not as
hydrating as the pink one and it's not
as like silicone e feeling so just
wanted to point that out but yes I am
enjoying this quite a bit it definitely
prolongs aware of my makeup and then the
last thing I picked up that I forgot to
show in the hall was the state don't
stray I'm shadow primer right yes
eyeshadow primer / concealer from
benefit this is in light medium I
thought this wasn't going to work for me
but honestly it's been working really
really well when I tried this out the
first time it was when they had the
little pump and it was a really sticky
tacky formula and I tried that out like
four years ago when it first launched I
did not like it but when I saw that it
was on sale for like twelve or thirteen
dollars I picked it up again i forgot to
show it in the hall um it basically came
like the next day I was like I thought I
had everything but yeah it came the next
day but I really really like this
product it's really really wonderful I
feel like the consistency of it is
completely different than what it used
to be it basically just goes on like a
normal eye primer now it doesn't feel
too sticky it doesn't feel silicone like
it's just perfect it's a really really
good one and it definitely helps with
creasing on my eyelids alright guys so
that was my below photo on all the items
that I got during the 21 days of beauty
event at Ulta thank you so much for
