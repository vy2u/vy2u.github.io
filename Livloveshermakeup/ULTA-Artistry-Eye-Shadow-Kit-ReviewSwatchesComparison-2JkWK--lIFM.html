thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
please mind this little chunk near my
eyebrow i woke up this morning and I
like lost a little chunk of hair and
you're my eyebrow and I swear to you
it's like does that ever happen to you
guys where you wake up and you're like
where did it go where did that chunk of
eyebrow oh but anyway um there's like a
little bundle of hair and then there's
like a little spot and I just couldn't
really feel it and I was just having
issues this morning with filling it in
so please excuse if you can see a little
like spot of darkness and then there's
nothing but anyway um this video is
going to be interview and swatches on a
new little kit that I actually saw on my
friend mama loves mascara here on
youtube I saw on her Instagram and I was
so interested and intrigued by it i will
link her channel below by the way but I
was really intrigued by what I saw and
it was three little pallets from Ulta
for twenty dollars and it was called the
artistry artistry kit and there are
three compact I shadow sets in here and
like I said it was twenty dollars but
what caught my eye was the fact that
they look exactly like the hourglass and
modernist I shadow palettes literally
the colors look the same they are
formatted in the same way the shape is
like the same it was just the weirdest
thing and I thought you know what I need
to get that I need to review it and
honestly I thought it was going to be
really really crappy I did not think it
was going to be a good product it is
from the Altos like home or house brand
and I just thought that it wasn't going
to be that good and I'm actually really
kind of mad at myself for thinking that
because I actually really do enjoy the
three little I shadow palettes in here
and I should not be judging it just
because you know it looks like it's a
dupe for a different product now I will
say that it is not an exact texture dupe
for the modernist our shadow palettes
however I believe that the colors look
basically the exact same way and also
the way that the pallets are shaped so
anyway if you guys aren't familiar the
modernist I shadow palettes from our
Glasgow for let me see here fifty eight
dollars a piece on the
for website i'm on there right now the
one that i have is in the shade obscura
and it's really beautiful it's got some
nice goldie brown pretty tones and a
nice like pretty cream color up there
and is shaped like a wave it's very
beautiful and I actually really do like
mine I did a review on this I believe
these came out last year like last year
maybe in december or january i really
like mine a lot of people didn't they
thought that the shadows were just so
soft that they blend it away on the eye
or they had a lot of kick up a lot of
powder and what I agree with those
things but I mean they are so so
pigmented and beautiful and I really can
create a beautiful smoky eye with this
palette so I absolutely love the obscura
um modernist eyeshadow palette but
because they are so pricey sixty dollars
for that amount of product I only ended
up picking one so when I saw these like
I said on my friends Instagram I was
like you know what I really should check
those out so these are the artistry kit
little compacts that you get you get
three and i'm going to show you guys
each one the first one is this one and
they do come with a little um dual ended
these are not sponge tips these are
actually like little like rubber trip
tip brushes and I actually do like them
I used one of them to smoke out some
color on my lower lash line today and
they worked out quite well anyway this
is the first one and as you guys can see
um it really does look like the
modernist I shadow palette like the way
it's formatted the way it's kind of in
that wave the amount of product that you
get is a little different I feel like
this one is sits a little more tighter
like a little more horizontal whereas
the hourglass is a little more longer
it's this one's a little more compact if
that makes sense but the pans maybe
deeper I'm actually not sure the ones in
the obscura palette um or the modernist
i shadow palettes are actually not that
deep people thought that they were
getting more product than they did in
those but anyways that this is the first
one that you get and this one like I
said I have the support website pulled
up right here this looks very very
similar to the one right here called
graphite which is a smoky one so this is
what it looks like on the Sephora
website you can see it has those blue
tones the gold and then
that pinky peach color and I think that
this one was kind of supposed to be the
copycat of that particular one the next
one is kind of like an earthy toned one
it's got some green color in it it's got
another kind of pinky color some Gray's
just some dark kind of hunter green
smoky colors and this one look appears
to be the hold on let me pull it up here
it appears to be the dupe for the shade
do I have to go and dig through them
hold on one second it appears to be a
dupe for the shade either infinity or I
would go more with color field color
field looks very similar so this is what
color field looks like on the Sephora
website you can see it's got those dark
smoky kind of Hunter gray colors and
also that kind of beige color so this
one appears to be the duplicate or
replicate replicant of that one and then
the last one is the one I am wearing on
my eyes today and this appears to be the
duplicate for the shade let's see here
it looks very very similar to exposure
which is like a plum set so anyway as
you can see really really beautiful
colors this is probably my favorite one
out of the bunch I do have this on my
eyes today I have that lighter color all
over all the way up to my brow bone all
over my lid I have this beautiful kind
of topi shimmery color on my actual lid
I have this beautiful plummy color in my
crease and on my lower lash line and
then this really dark purple on my outer
V and I think he created a very
beautiful beautiful look so anyway i'm
b'fer there are basically um like a
replicas or they're trying to be like
the modernist a shadow palettes it just
so happens that the actual modernist i
shadow palette that i have they did not
try and replicate in this set so i can't
actually give you guys side-by-side
comparison because the one that i have
does not go with the colors that they
tried to go with
I will say these are actually really
really beautiful for twenty dollars i
think they are totally worth it like i
said i am wearing that kind of plumbing
/ bleak it today and I really really
like it I feel like I got a really nice
I look these shadows seem to stay on
very very well as long as you're wearing
an eyeshadow primer I'm wearing it with
my elf one dollar eyeshadow primer today
I believe it's the one dollar one the
one dollar or the three dollar one and
it seems to be sticking really nicely
and the colors stay on really nicely i
padded this color on with my finger
today and I felt like it went on really
really nicely and opaque on my eyelid
and I just think that these are really
beautiful I will say they are not a
texture dupe for the actual modernist
eyeshadow palettes they do not feel
anywhere nearly as soft as the modernist
I shadow palettes those ones just seem
to have this absolutely buttery buttery
texture that like ah you know it feels
like I don't know like those little
cardboard palettes that you can get from
Too Faced or like lorac shadows lorac
Pro shadows it's kind of like that
formula super super soft and buttery
these ones are not like that they feel a
little textured but i have to say they
are beautiful they are blendable they
don't just blend right off your eye if
you're gonna put down a dark color like
i did in my outer v today at that color
is going to be there and they are quite
easy to blend um and yeah i'm actually
pretty excited and happy about this
little kit I think that this would be
fabulous if you are someone who wants to
do like stocking stuffer ideas um you
know younger girls would love these
older girls I'm 23 and I love these um
so I really really recommend these
actually I'm really quite excited
because I think um three little eye
shadow compacts like these for twenty
dollars is an absolute great deal and um
you know the way that they're packaged
and the way they look is really really
pretty so I really don't have that many
complaints I will say that the texture
is not super buttery it is a little like
crisp but overall they create a pretty I
look and that's all I really care about
one thing that I will say that I find
really interesting is that none of the
colors get muddled together you can see
a distinct difference in the colors that
I put on my eyes today I don't know if
it's picking up on camera but what
I look in the mirror I can see oh that's
where I put to the darker color in my
crease or that's the color that I put
underneath my lower lash line they don't
just muddle together and I feel like it
takes a good eye shadow formula to do
that because sometimes they do get
muddled together if it's not a great
formula so anyway I have quite happy and
I really am excited I hope that Kristin
my friend mama loves mascara is watching
this review because she is the one that
kind of got me started on wanting to go
and pick this up and try it out i think
it would be an awesome stocking stuffer
idea and i really do like um you know I
like the eye looks that they create like
I said I cannot give you guys a
side-by-side comparison with the
hourglass modernist I would say just
from looking at the pictures of you know
the ones that they seem to color match
they would be side by side color matches
texture matches I can definitely say no
because I have you know I have this
obscure one and they absolutely do not
feel similar whatsoever but I don't feel
like these are super chunky and glittery
and like hard to you is I feel like I
can blend them out and I really like
that so I'm really really happy it's not
awesome when you can get three little
cute adorable pretty palettes for twenty
dollars that's awesome so anyway I'm
going to go ahead and swatch these for
you guys i am going to start with the
little plummy colored one so this is the
one I'm wearing on my eyes today I'm
going to start with that one I'll start
with the lighter color and work my way
down so that is the lightest shade then
you get the more plummy color the next
one is the one I'm wearing on my lid
then you get that dark um like really
really dark purpley color let me go
ahead and swatch those because I don't
have enough fingers
and yes you'll see me going on here and
like blowing it off but honestly I do
that with every single shadow when i'm
doing swatches you guys have probably
noticed that but overall really
impressed with these you guys this is
these are impressive little palettes not
just for the little girls you know you
would think like i don't know i am at at
myself for thinking like Oh alta
eyeshadows i like little kids sort of
thing is i like high-end pallets or like
this for that but these are good i
should not be judging anyway that is
what the purple palette looks like as
you guys can see really really beautiful
I mean the color variety it's really
really gorgeous i love the way those
look together and yes I can't really
give alta credit and be like oh they put
together this beautiful palette because
literally from looking at the modernist
i shadow palette it really does look
like they kind of copycat at the colors
but i mean you can still get those
beautiful colors without paying fifty
eight dollars for a palette that's kind
of awesome so that is the first one that
is the purple eat own one that is my
favorite the second one I am going to
show you is the one that mimic mimics
the graphite pallet on the from the
modernist eyeshadow palettes it looks
like this got some smoky colors a nice
gold color you get this nice and kind of
pinky all over like lid sort of color
gold brown blue swatch those for you
guys really impressed guy should
definitely check these out I really
didn't think I was going to like these i
know that's horrible huh all right and
one more
so that is the graphite I don't want to
call a Duke palette because I don't know
if the colors match exactly but it looks
like a little replica oh really really
pretty I like these colors like I feel
like the blue and the gold are really
pretty together this was one of them
that I was looking at when I was trying
to pick my modernist I shadow palette I
was like oh do I go with that one it's
so pretty i love the tones in there so
that is that one and then the last one
is kind of the earthy tones you get some
hunter greens in here really really
pretty and then you get those kind of
like beige colors nice watch those for
you guys that's what they look like and
like I said like they you know it's not
like they're chunky glittery um they do
have a little bit of texture to them and
again I said you know they don't really
feel super creamy or anything on the
eyelids or like as your you know fingers
watching is the worst because you could
never really you get i get so picky i'm
a total snob I'm like I want something
super buttery it's just gotta like glide
onto my finger but let's be honest you
know when you're doing I make up most of
the time you're using eye brushes and
you can't actually really feel it like
oh it's so soft on my eye so I shouldn't
be such a snob when it comes to things
like that and that's that last color in
there that really really dark green so
this is matt one and those are all three
of them swatch so um I hope that you
guys kind of got a better idea I'm sorry
that I don't have one of the particular
modernist I shadow palettes to actually
do like exact color matches with it it
just so happened that my obscure one
they didn't try and replicate and
replicate um but anyway I think that
texture wise they're definitely not a do
but just from looking at pictures on
sephora.com I also looked up for
swatches like on Google of the obscure
or not the modernist eyeshadow palettes
keep wanting to say obscura no the
modernist eyeshadow palettes it looks
like they really would be colored oops
so if you are someone who doesn't care
about texture if you are someone who
just wants to put a nice I look
gather and you really don't mind as long
as it's a good you know somewhat good
formula and I think that you would like
these a lot so I'm actually quite
excited I'm definitely going to be
playing with these taking them out and I
just love that even though like they are
the Ulta like house brand they still go
on beautifully they blend out nicely and
um they're pigmented so yeah I am quite
excited as you guys can probably tell i
hope you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches i will link below where you
guys can pick this up and i'll see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
