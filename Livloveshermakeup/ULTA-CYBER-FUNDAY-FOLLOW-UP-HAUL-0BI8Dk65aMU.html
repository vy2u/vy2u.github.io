video is going to be my cyber fun days
follow-up haul from Ulta so exactly we
could go on my channel I shared with you
guys the items that I picked up from the
cyber monday event at Ulta I am here to
give you guys on my final thoughts or my
first impressions on the items so let's
jump right into it the first of all set
I had picked up was from the auto brand
itself this is the makeup blending
sponge duo so it looks a little
something like this
I did lose one of these this morning to
apply my foundation and I have been
using it all week this is absolutely
beautiful it is still slightly damp as
you guys can see it's a little bigger
than the Beauty Blender but I think this
is so comparable to the Beauty Blender
probably the closest dupe that I have
ever found even more so than the Real
Techniques sponge now I still prefer the
Real Techniques sponge because I like
that it has that nice flat kind of
slammed going on so you really can stamp
on the foundation but this is absolutely
beautiful a lot of you were saying that
you loved this as well a few of you did
say it did not work out for you I would
love to know why it didn't work out for
you I'm just curious out of curiosity
but um you know to each their own
it really works for me very very well I
like it it I feel like it just it
doesn't absorb too much product it's
just a really nice way to apply your
foundation and it really looks flawless
on the skin so I have been loving this
little sponge do again if you have tried
it and you didn't like it let me know
why down below the second item that I
picked up it was the peach nectar shower
gel bubble bath and shampoo three-in-one
smoothie this is also from the Ulta
brand and this smells incredible it
smelled absolutely amazing
very uplifting this time of year when is
starting to get really really cold so
I've been enjoying this a lot I have
already used quite a bit you do get
let's see here 710 ml or 24 fluid ounces
which is a huge amount especially for
the price this was around four or five
dollars so the one thing I want to say
is that I don't like using this is a
shampoo I did try it it's just okay as
the body wash I like it as a bubble bath
but if you are someone who likes to take
very long luxurious bubble baths then
you may not like it now I take a bubble
bath every other night it's just kind of
my way of relaxing and treating myself
to a little bit of something so I take
pretty quick fast just because I do it
every other night the bubbles dissipate
very very quickly with this and you do
need to put in probably about five pumps
so if you were hoping it would make the
same kind of bubbles as like the
philosophy three-in-one products it does
not but
I still like these I think they're
really really cool and obviously this is
a huge container all right the next two
items I had picked up we're from the
knit plus fab line so this is the knit
plus fab exfoliate glycolic scrub fix
and then this is the overnight purifying
gel so I have to say you know if you
don't have the money to go and spend on
items like Sunday Riley or whatever like
literally the little skincare routine
that I put together for myself from
Sunday Riley cost me around $400 for
like three products it's crazy they work
very well but if you're maybe younger
and you don't have the money or you just
don't have the money for those kind of
items in general
honestly the Mario Badescu line and the
knit plus fab line are really really
good they have some awesome ingredients
in here this is filled with three
percent glycolic acid and salicylic acid
and then the overnight gel has four
percent glycolic acid in it in it so
really really good ingredients in here I
highly recommend checking that out I
think this is just amazing these are the
two products I have been using all a
week on at my skin I think my skin is
looking a relatively good this week I
haven't been dealing with as many
breakouts you know that the Luna foreo
mini that I talked about to make me
purge for a while but I haven't had any
sort of breakouts or yuckiness on my
skin which is crazy because I have my
period right now so very very
interesting just the two of these at
night time have really been doing
wonders for my skin and the scrub is
very very scrubby if you have very
sensitive skin I would not recommend
this it does have a little bit of a
citrusy scent to it as well but it's
very scrubby I feel like it really kind
of microderm the hell out of your face
and then the purifying gel I will say is
slightly sticky and tacky but it does
completely sink in do not use it around
your eye area glycolic acid is very very
harsh around your eye area that's in
like skin area so though use it around
your eyes but everywhere else it's
really good especially if you have a lot
of congestion in your skin you can also
use it if you have dry skin because
though glycolic acid is great at
exfoliating but yeah would highly
recommend looking into the two of those
they were half off and I think like five
or six dollars apiece so really happy
with those like I said I also love the
Mario Badescu line Mario Badescu line is
something that I've used probably my
freshman year and sophomore year for
skincare like exclusively so this is the
Mario Badescu facial spray with aloe
herbs and rosewater it's absolutely
beautiful if you don't have them
to buy like the surely grows water
balancing nests this is just as good it
is just as good so it's beautiful
I still do prefer miserly gross water
balancing this just a little bit because
it's just overall a little more um I
know it's like a frosted glass bottle I
like to smell more things like that but
this is very very good at hydrating this
game so I'm enjoying that I also did
pick up this little $9 Satsuma cube so
if you guys didn't know I love the set
zoom a line from the body shop and this
is adorable we'll be showing it in my
gift guide up video as well
it comes with a tiny little loofah
that's actually really really soft and
then you do get a Satsuma body lotion
and a sept suma shower gel I love the
scent I feel like the shower gel is nice
I wish it was a little more able to
lather up on the body I feel like you
have to use quite a lot with the shower
gel but the moisturizer is very nice
thinks and very very quickly I also had
picked up this $15 Body Shop jingle gel
a rock set so this is what it looks like
you get four of their different shower
gels in here like I said I really love
the Satsuma one I've used quite a bit of
this already I love the scent on this it
just makes me happy honestly it really
just smells like happiness in a bottle
yep happiness so I really really love
that and then I haven't tried these ones
yet but I'm guessing the formulation is
the same because the ingredients are the
same they're just different scents so
this one is Fuji green tea I like the
scent of this but Tom likes it more so
maybe I'll give that to him the Moringa
or Moringa and then also strawberry is
quite a sweet scent so I think that's a
great little set as well for $15 a nice
way to try out some of their products I
also did pick up their hand cream trio I
haven't tried the strawberry one yet but
we had a mango in here and also
grapefruit I've been using the
grapefruit one all week it is amazing it
smells amazing I love it because it
really smells like a real grapefruit
like when you're cutting one open um
and then I do like the consistency I
feel like it goes on really really
nicely it's got a little bit of like two
methyl comb slip to it so it's very easy
to blend into the skin and it does not
leave you greasy whatsoever and then the
mango one I gave to Tom's mom while she
was visiting and she said that she
really likes it as well so that's a
great little set as well I did pick up
this lorac what is it called dance till
dawn I and chic palette let me know if
you guys want a full review on this but
this is beautiful very good quality so
you have a nice little mirror here I
think the blushes are the standouts in
here so the blushes are amazing is this
especially let me swatch
see you guys can actually see this
gorgeousness it is literally like a
pinky peachy blush it is so incredibly
gorgeous do you guys see that color
really really beautiful the other blush
is very nice as well the eyeshadows are
very creamy I would say the ones that
have a little bit more of like a sheen
to them are very beautiful they go on
quite foiled there's definitely a little
bit of kick up and fall out but for the
most part this is a great little palette
I believe right now it's on sale for
like $12 so if you do want to jump on
that I would highly recommend it I think
it's a good one
not as comparable as say like their
lorac Pro palette or anything like that
but still pretty good quality and the
final item that I had purchased were the
Peter Thomas Roth now I have to wipe my
fingers Peter Thomas or ELF unwrinkle
peel pads I love these I use these every
single night on my skin you have let's
see here 20% active complex of glycolic
salicylic and lactic acids it's a great
product I would recommend for anybody
except for those of you with really
sensitive skin I put it onto my face
after I have removed my makeup before I
put on my mask at nighttime and I just
let it sit there for about three minutes
and then you do wash your face with
water to neutralize the actual appeal so
it's beautiful I feel like this really
helps with the congestion in my skin and
also it just helps with breakouts and
things like that so anyway those are my
thoughts on all the items that I
purchased during the Sunday Funday or
cyber fun day haul or sale so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I'll see you
tomorrow for a look of the week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
