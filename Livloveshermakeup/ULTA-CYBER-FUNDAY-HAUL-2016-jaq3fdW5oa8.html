video is going to be my Ulta Cyber
Sunday I believe it was called haul so
they had a bunch of different brands
that were on sale and I picked up some
goodies so I'm gonna share with you guys
what I got and of course exactly in a
week I will do a follow up all on
everything I did try one of the items
already so let me start with that one
the first item that I picked up with a
little sponge set to that I heard emily
noel 83 here on youtube talking about
and this is the ultimate e makeup
blending sponge duo and i just used one
of them to apply my foundation at you
guys and this is so freakishly similar
to the beauty blender i'm not even
kidding you so freakishly it's similar
so you get two little beauty sponges in
here and i definitely will be talking
about this set when I do my three-part
gift guide for the holidays so this is
what the little sponge looks like you
get two of them and this was a great
price I think around ten dollars so very
very happy with that little set so far I
also picked up a little peach nectar I
should say a big a big peach nectar
shower gel bubble bath and shampoo
three-in-one smoothie this is also kind
of way of doing the philosophy
three-in-one product so you can shampoo
you can use it as a bubble bath and also
a shower gel so this is what it looks
like you do get 24 fluid ounces in here
this was on sale for like four dollars
you guys I'm not even kidding and it
smells amazing yeah it smells really
really good I don't really know why I
wanted the peach nectar this like time
of year because it's a very very like
springy and kind of summery scent but I
did pick this up and I'm very excited I
usually use these as the bubble baths if
you aren't sure yes alright I did pick
up the Mario Badescu facial spray with
aloe herbs and rose water I have been
using this for years I do not like it as
much as the Shirley Crowes water
balancing mess but it definitely comes
in a close second I also did pick this
up from nip and fab but this is the
exfoliating glycolic scrub this does
have a 3% glycolic acid and salicylic
acid in it so I felt this would be a
really really nice scrub to try out
maybe in the morning I definitely will
follow up with sunscreen don't worry but
yeah super excited to try that out and
then I also got this from Nippon fab
this is the exfoliating glycolic fixed
overnight purifying gel so this is what
the little box looks like and this is
something that you put onto your skin at
night time it really really spoke to me
because it is a gel I thought that would
be
really nice for my combo to oily skin
and it basically says a nighttime
clarifying system for dull plus oily
skin glycolic and salicylic acids
combined to help resurface purify the
skin by gently lifting dead skin cells
away for continuous deep pore cleanse
action so we're very excited to try that
out I did get a little palette this is
the lorac danced tell dawn I and cheek
palette so this is what it looks like I
know first time opening this little
package up but let me show you guys and
definitely definitely let me know down
below if you guys would like a full
review on this but it's a very very cute
little palette I believe this was only
19 dollars and you do get let's see here
six eyeshadows in here and then like two
blushes or I guess you can say well yeah
no that's totally a blush not a bronzer
so a blush and then another blush so I
thought that looked absolutely stunning
and beautiful really really perfect for
my complexion and my fair skin tone so
very excited to give you guys my
finalized thoughts on that I also got
this little body shop trio this is going
to be shown in the gift guide video as
well or at least one of them if this is
just a little set of three hand creams
originally this was like $19 I got it on
sale for ten one of them is missing
because Tom's mom took the mango one but
in here you get strawberry and also pink
grapefruit so I picked that up and then
I love the body shop so I also got this
little stuff suma cents so the Satsuma
scent from the body shop is my all-time
favorite this was a $9 valued at 11 is
just a little box and you get basically
a little mini orange loofah in here you
also get the Satsuma um gel lotion which
looks like this and then you also get
these shower gel and it just smells so
good you guys when you use this in the
shower it makes your whole shower just
smell absolutely incredible and amazing
oh my gosh it just smells like freshly
cut oranges I'm just I adore the scent I
love love love it so I picked that up I
also picked up some more of my Peter
Thomas Roth unwrinkled peel pads I was
running low on these so I got another
container of those and then another
little set that I got from the body shop
is this one this is called the body
shops jingle gel rock and you're
supposed to be used it as like an
ornament which is adorable
you get four different shower gels in
here and again if they are any good I
will of course show them in the gift set
a video or the Gift Guide videos
so the first one you get is Fuji green
tea it looks a little something like
this and this one smells really really
nice yeah it's a very very fresh kind of
green tea scent I like that a lot
you also get of course Satsuma which is
my all-time favorite we'll be travelling
with that for the holidays you get
marina or Moringa is it Moringa or
Moringa I feel like it's marina but this
smells amazing very kind of like perfume
me it's just the scent of a flower but
yeah it smells really really good and
then the last one you get is strawberry
which again it smells really really
sweet so a very excited to try out that
little set and then I did get some
samples this is the first one it is the
japonesque the Velvet Touch primer and
also the it cosmetics CC cream in the
shade in the shade medium so I will be
passing that along to someone else
