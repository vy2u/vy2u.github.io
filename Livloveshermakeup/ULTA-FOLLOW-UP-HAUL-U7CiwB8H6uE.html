happy Wednesday today's video is going
to be an ulta follow-up hollow and if
you're wondering what is going on with
my hair it's just really greasy and
dirty which is why I pulled it back in a
headband anyway I am here to share with
you guys my first impressions or my
final thoughts on the items that I
picked up exactly a week ago I did a
original haul video I'll link it down
below in the description bar if you
would like to watch it but I'm here to
give you guys my first impressions or my
final thoughts on the items that I had
picked up so let's go ahead and get
started the first one I had picked up
from Ulta was the pacifica Persian rose
perfume I am a huge fan of the Pacific
up perfumes I think they are beautiful
but I will say this Persian Rose scent
is very very similar to one that they
already have which is called Malibu
lemon blossom and you would think this
one's rose this one's more like lemon
like how are they similar I feel like
the rose one actually has a strong like
lemony kind of undertone so if you don't
like lemon you would not like the
Persian rose or the Malibu lemon blossom
but I do think that these smell kind of
similar that doesn't bother me I think
that they will pair together really
really nicely during the summertime give
a really nice fresh scent so I think
it's good but I wish it smells just a
little more like straight-up rose
because I love everything rose-scented
alright the second item I had picked up
was the Catrice cosmetics prime and find
mattifying powder this is a waterproof
powder in the transparent version it
does come with a year which is quite
nice and then it's just a really silky
smooth transparent powder I think this
is just okay it's nothing that is super
super impressive to me I still do prefer
my essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder which if you guys didn't know
essence does own Catrice cosmetics now
Catrice cosmetics I find is a little
more pricey and that essence is a little
cheaper so I personally would not
repurchase this I don't think it's just
it's just okay it's nothing special i am
wearing it today i would definitely
repurchase the essence all about Matt
fixing compact powders though I have not
cracked into this one yet but these are
beautiful one of my all-time favorite
powders in their only three dollars and
49 cents apiece from Ulta so really
enjoying that let's see here moving on i
also have really been enjoying my
soothing himalayan salt scrub from
treehouse this isn't the cherry blossom
scent so i don't think that these salt
scrubs are as good as their sugar scrubs
you guys know I talk about their sugar
scrubs all the time I am
them usually they have buy one get one
fifty percent off of this particular
time that i ordered they didn't so i
just thought i would spend the extra two
dollars and get one of their salt scrubs
these are very nice if you have like
sore muscles because the salt kind of
act like epsom salts and actually help
to like sue that area so i do think it's
a good scrub it is a little more um
jelly-like inconsistency I feel like the
salt is really binded in there in like a
jelly kind of form so if you're not into
that you may not like this and also I do
want to say the scent is super strong it
smells like cherry blossom I think it
smells great I don't mind really really
powerful sense but if you are someone
who is super super sensitive this may be
a little too much for you alright moving
on i also have been enjoying the it
brushes for also this is called the
brush bath purifying brush cleaner so i
have used quite a bit of this i don't
know if you guys can tell i'm about down
to there and it's been exactly a week
i've been using this every single night
to actually spot clean my brushes i
think this is fantastic it doesn't leave
your brushes too oily it doesn't have a
little bit of oil in there but it
doesn't leave them to oily i think it
has a really nice kind of aromatherapy
like spa-like said to it i would say it
is just as good as the sephora citrus
brush clean cleanser like the instant 1
i've tried everything i've tried the
cinema secrets i've tried to make up for
ever one all of them this one and the
sephora collection one are definitely my
favorite so i will be repurchasing this
although this little bottle right here
which is only 3.4 fluid ounces was
around twenty dollars so yes who do go
through it quickly but i do think it is
worth it here is an item that I'm not
really loving and it's just because the
color is wrong this is the essence I
heart stage eyeshadow base you guys know
like i said i love essence cosmetics
that um not fixing compact powder is one
of my all-time favorites and this was
only around three dollars as well i
picked up the wrong one i guess there's
one called like I hurt illumination or
iheart intensifying something which is a
little more kinky toned it has obviously
a lighter color than this but I have
still been using it this week this is a
cruelty-free brand and i am going
cruelty free this week so i was using
this and i think it's nice I've been
mixing it together with my Kat Von D
locket concealer creme in the shade
whiteout just to kind of lighten it up a
little bit but what I'm thinking of
doing is going ahead and picking up the
other one which is also around three
dollars and then mixing them together
because this actually has a release
nice yellow undertone and I do think it
cancels out blue tones on your eyelid so
I think that it's a good one it's just a
little too dark for me when I use it by
itself and like I'm not self tan anymore
or anything like that even during the
summer time I think this would be a bit
too dark for me so I plan on mixing it
together with the other one but still
good quality here I do enjoy that let's
see here this has been a fail I talked
about this in yesterday's video this is
the junk here micellar cleansing of
water I was so excited to try this out
because I'm doing that battle of the
micellar cleansing water video for you
guys I just don't think that this is
good quality it really really stings the
eye area and one of these second
ingredients in each in here is propylene
glycol which is like whatever so um not
into this at all i'm guessing it's the
alcohol that stings my eyes but I could
be completely wrong yesterday I was
talking about that Josie Maran and
Nirvana hydrating treatment mez I
thought that had alcohol in it it turns
out it doesn't so I don't know if I'm
just sensitive to one of the ingredients
in here but i will say i feel like it
has alcohol in it because anytime i put
it near my eye it just really burns and
stings so i don't recommend checking
this out if you are someone who uses
micellar water to kind of remove excess
or residual makeup from your eye area
now this does work relatively well on
the face I've used it to kind of cleanse
my face really quickly this morning and
I thought it was okay but it's
definitely not as good as the Gorn gay
pink cat version or the simple micellar
cleansing water all right in the last
three items I have purchased with makeup
removing wipes so I will start with the
two that I did not like the first one I
mentioned yesterday again in the product
sales video these are probably divorce
and makeup removing white I have ever
put on my face these are the Shea
Moisture these are the new super fruit
multivitamin renewal facial wipes sees
you have rip seed yep grapefruit seed
oil in them and also load a seed extract
I feel like the claims on here are super
high it says it removes makeup and dirt
and smooths out uneven texture and fine
lines with one cloth now I had to use
five to six of these to remove my whole
entire face of makeup I know I do wear a
little like a lot of makeup sometimes on
my face but it was just ridiculous how
dry these were so I did store them
upside down and no luck whatsoever it's
kind of it's kind of a shame because I
really do like the Shea Moisture brand
but i would recommend stayin away from
these i will use them i will finish them
up and use them for squatches
I did finish up the Olay fresh effects
wiped out refreshing makeup removal
cloth these are nothing special either
they do have alcohol in the ingredients
and they did burn my eye area so i would
not check these out either they have a
little more of a textured cloth and
they'll simply leave an oily residue and
these ones to do these ones do as well
um excuse me sorry guys but the ones
that I really really really did enjoy
where the ultime cup removing facial
tell lassies or gentle cleansing mate
with a hundred percent plant-based
fibers so these are ones that I would
repurchase these are basically identical
to the what is that the Neutrogena blue
pack can make up remover wipes the cover
the blue pack these are pretty much
identical you get 25 pre-moistened
towelettes in here I think they're
beautiful they smell grades but they
don't leave my face greasy they just
leave it feeling nice and moist so out
of all three that I purchased I think
the altar ones are hands down the best
these are probably my favorite wipes
from Ulta kind of like how I recently
discovered these Sephora cleansing wipes
I think these are really good from alta
so anyway guys those are my thoughts so
far on all of these products that I
picked up I hope you guys enjoyed this
video tomorrow I will be doing my
support vib sale haul or I will be doing
an honest PR reviews video just
depending on when my next Sephora box
comes in it's either coming in tonight
or will come in tomorrow so depending on
when the box comes in you will either
see an honest PR reviews video or you
will see that hole but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you tomorrow
