video for you tonight I wanted to go
ahead and walk you guys through what my
Ulta follow up haul so about a week ago
on my channel I did an Ulta haul I'll go
ahead and link that video the original
video up in the cards if you would like
to check it out but I wanted to come
back and kind of give you guys my first
impressions and my final thoughts on
these items now I want to start with two
that I have already returned the first
was the bare minerals oil obsessed
cleansing oil and the second was the NYX
HD concealer so the NYX HD concealer
from me personally was just a little too
sticky and tacky it felt very very heavy
on my skin and that is just not what I'm
looking for in concealers currently I
want something that's a little more
lightweight I want something that's
slightly luminous and has a really nice
kind of satiny finish so I did go ahead
and return that and then as far as the
oil obsessed cleanser or cleansing oil
is concerned and that made of me a
breakout like crazy I was getting big
zits all over here a few on my chin as
well I had some in my t-zone and then on
top of that it really gave me just a
little bit of a skin reaction I feel
like I had a little tiny of red dots all
over my forehead and they weren't
necessarily pimples it was just kind of
skin irritation so there was definitely
something in the agreed ingredients list
there that did not work for me but yeah
those are two products that I did end up
having to return it's always a bummer
when I feel like I have to return or
declutter something that I recently
bought cuz I feel like when you haul of
course you want everything to work out
for you but those two products did not
now let's go ahead and talk about the
products that are really working very
very well and the first is the NYX hydro
touch primer I am really enjoying this I
feel like it's a very simplistic primer
it has a little bit of slip to it but it
also remains quite hydrating on the skin
it isn't overly hydrating I feel like
anybody could really use this no matter
what skin type you have it's very
simplistic like I said I've been
enjoying it a lot I mean does have a
rather strong smell to it kind of smells
like that Nivea postmen shaving balm or
whatever it's called so if you don't
like the smell of that or really really
kind of spicy cuz I would like cents you
probably would not enjoy this but this
is a really nice primer I'm enjoying it
and I want to look further into
purchasing some more next time errs as
well up next we have the LA girl Pro
conceal and now this is so much of
better than the NYX
you know HD concealer in my opinion this
particular shade that I picked up is
called a light ivory and actually not
just me perfectly and I know that might
sound crazy because when you're looking
in the - it looks super dark but I
like it kind of oxidizes but it actually
lightens up on the skin is that possible
for oxidation to go the other way around
where it lightens up on the stand I
squared that's what happens with this it
is a great match for my stand I've been
using it to kind of color correct and
then going in with another concealer on
top of it which is definitely not
necessary and this gives a lot of
coverage it is beautiful it is blendable
I really really like this my only
complaint with this you guys is that I
feel like I'm already starting to go
through quite a bit of this now I'm not
super heavy handed with my makeup I am
very heavy-handed with my powder but
when it comes to foundation and
concealer I'm really not that heavy
handed so I wanted to let you guys know
I'm already starting to make a little
bit of a dent on this concealer I know
I've only been using it for like 10 days
so I think that's that's a little
excessive I have been using it every
single day but I just wanted to give you
guys a heads up so what I highly highly
recommend the LA girl Pro conceal I am
very very happy with this particular
concealer alright moving on we have two
foundations here I know a lot of you
wanted to get my final thoughts on these
I have not done my first impressions yet
so I can't really give you guys my
thoughts but I've been doing a little
more research on the by bylines
foundation this sounds like something
that's going to be very nice from my
skin out personally now it's supposed to
give you a really nice of luminous the
beautiful glow to the skin is supposed
to be very hydrating so I have very very
high hopes for this this is the by.bite
lines foundation from it cosmetics and
then a lot of you were telling me in the
comment section of the original haul
video that you love absolutely love the
Alta HD soft focus liquid foundation so
I'm very happy I picked this up as well
again I will be doing a first-come prep
first impressions first impressions um
the state I have here is called light
cool and this is supposed to give a
natural finish it's paraben free it's
oil free this seems like it's going to
be very very promising with a nice
medium to buildable full coverage from
what I have heard so again I will be
going ahead and doing a first
impressions on that up next we have the
Oprah blisful highlighter you guys oh my
god I love this I absolutely love this
I've been using it as a blush topper I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys a
little swatch here because it is a
little bit on the darker side but when
you do blend it out I feel like you can
see that it does get a little lighter if
you have a deep deep deep skintone I
feel like this would be an amazing
highlight on you it's kind of like a
rose gold color with a little bit of a
silver shift it's just absolutely
beautiful I love the formula on the /
highlighters Rodeo Drive is a better
match for my skin tone personally but
that doesn't mean that I haven't been
wearing this you can also take this and
put on your lid as eyeshadow and it was
really really nice as well just make
sure you have like a glitter glue on but
I really been enjoying this highlighter
like I said been using that as a blush
topper alright up next we have the
essence all about matte fix and compact
powder I did purchase two of these you
guys know I love these powders so I've
been using this for a week and you can
save already making a dent I mean I go
through these really really quickly like
I said I'm not particularly heavy-handed
when it comes to all of my makeup in
general but when it comes to powder I go
pretty heavy-handed I don't know why
it's just that Way's been a thing for me
and I can even use this on my dry skin
I've been getting a lot of questions
about that since your skin has changed
can you still use this
I still set my entire face with this
practically every single day so yes I
can very very happy with this absolutely
love that powder and finally guys the
last I don't we have here is the Mario
Badescu enzyme cleansing a gel so happy
I picked this up this was during the 21
days a beauty event it was on sale for
$8 but you can still get 8 fluid ounces
for only $16 on the LG comm website
Mario Badescu is a cruelty-free skincare
brand this is a really really a nice
sort of basic cleanser it does give a
little bit of exfoliating properties to
it because it does have a chaise in it I
think it's really really great if you
have dry skin really great if you have
combo oily skin I used to use this to
clear up my breakouts when I was in
college I think it's really really
fantastic as you can see it is good for
all skin types um it does have a little
bit of an offensive smell I want to say
that in general I feel like a lot a lot
of Mario Badescu products have this
scent including the HK body wash
botanical body wash so if you've tried
that so that is the identical scent to
this one kind of I don't even know how
to describe it's like lemon pledge and
cucumber and some sort of chemical it's
not great but I will say this has a
fabulous consistency to it it actually
is a gel but like more of like a thick
gel creme and it doesn't foam up on the
skin so if you don't like that foaming
sort of lather this is gonna be a great
cleanser for you I've been very happy
with this and I'm glad that I went ahead
and picked it up so anyway guys those
are my final thoughts on the items I
picked up from Ulta thank you so much
for joining me guys and I will see you
tomorrow
