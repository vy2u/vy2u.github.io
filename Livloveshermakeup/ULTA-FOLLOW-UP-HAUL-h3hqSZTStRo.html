today's video is going to be an Ulta
follow-up hall I did an alcohol about
four weeks ago on my channel and I am
here to give you guys my final thoughts
or an update on the products you may be
thinking about Olivia what about your
base and how-to videos fails and holy
girls will have to wait until next week
you guys I actually have been using the
same exact products that i was using
when i went up to the cabin so i just
didn't want to like be too repetitive
and talk about them again if you would
like to see the items that i brought up
to the cabin i will link a video calls
products i'm bringing to the cabin have
that video I'll link that down below for
you guys you can go check it out but
yeah anyway I will be back next week for
fails at Holy Grails and also tomorrow
for shop and swatch my stash I did shot
my stash tonight or today so anyway
don't worry that will be back next week
but yeah let's go ahead and get into the
bottle up Paul shall we they first item
that I had purchased from Ulta was the
micellar water makeup removing cleansing
pads these are hydrating they have a
no-rinse formula they do have a low and
cucumber in them as well this is what
the little container looked like and you
did get let's see here 30 paths in here
I used them all up and I was talking
about this particular product the other
day on my snapchat I was like I don't
know if I love or hate this I think I
hate it these pads dry out extremely
extremely quickly and although they are
quite deep cleansing they do not remove
makeup well at all so i would not
personally repurchase this product's you
guys will see that in my empties the
next item i had purchased was a little
lip oil duo from physicians formula i'm
wearing one of these on top of my lip
color today this is the lip oil in i
believe it's called pink party or
something pink um it doesn't say but
this isn't some sort of a pink color and
these are basically just very very
transparent barely-there kind of lip
oils this particular one is called
liquid gold which is more of a cold
color and then the pink one I really do
like these they smell really good they
taste really good and I think they are a
really really nice quality product I
have noticed you guys that I just don't
touch like half of the lipstick or lip
products in my collection because I'm
all about comfort and I'm going to be
decluttering a lot of my lip products
because I really come to the realization
that the only kind of lip products I
really where our tinted lip balms lip
oils
and then something like maybe if I have
a liquid lipstick that's super hydrating
comfortable to wear but for the most
part i would say that i really do like
these i think they are really awesome
and i am looking into the Clarins lip
oil next all right I also purchased the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer in the
shade light bronzer I have fallen
absolutely in love with this it smells
like coconut it's amazing i love the
packaging i love the way that this goes
on to the skin i have it dusted all over
my face today it's beautiful you guys it
is so buttery and soft i did go ahead
and actually purchase the other one
which is just called bronzer i believe
that that one is a little lighter in
tone but yeah i'm really excited to have
both of them i definitely will be
decluttering quite a few of my bronzers
this year because all i need is this and
the other one I swear to you they just
have a gorgeous sheet to them and
although they are a little more pricey
like fourteen dollars if you don't have
a coupon I really do you think they are
worth it and I know a few of you were
asking me do you actually really like it
because I was talking about this a lot
when I was on my trip and yes I actually
do like it it has a beautiful satiny
sort of Sheen to it and it's just
gorgeous on the skin it really just
gives a beautiful beautiful glow so I've
been loving that I also picked up the
Loreal infallible Pro matte 16-hour
powder in the shade porcelain 100 I
really really indoor this powder I think
it's really really good it is I would
say maybe like a shade and a half darker
than my skin tone but once I kind of
buff it in and blend it and you really
can't tell but I really do like it it
keeps me quite matte all day long it's
got my all-time favorite setting powder
but it is a good one from the drugstore
and then the next little item I had it
picked up were these a little Pacifica
makeup removing wife's will not just
makeup remover wipes they're just like a
whole collection of wife there are five
different wipes in here and I got these
in a kit and one of my subscribers told
me that this little kit is on sale for
eleven dollars right now at aldo so
definitely check it out if you are
interested in trying out some of the
pacific of wipes this was a really
really great way to try them all out I
did empty all of them out um the first
one we have here is the essential makeup
removing whites with jasmine and coconut
water these are probably the ones that I
like disliked the most out of the whole
entire kids I did not think that these
were very good my only complaint with
all of these is just the fact that I
don't feel like the actual cloth is that
thick and it's kind of small I wish it
was a little bigger um but these were
probably my least favorite out of all of
them would not purchase a full size of
those but I would repurchase this kit I
really really like to these ones these
are the purified coconut water cleansing
wipes this is what they look like so
these ones just smelled like coconut
they were really really nice you can
wipe down your body your decollete your
face whatever you want to wipe down with
these I really adored these ones these
ones were just okay these are the
moisturize energized serum wipes with
floral water this is what they look like
and like I said they were just okay
these ones were just okay also I do
prefer the Burt's Bees ones these are
the peach and willow bark and apricot
infused enzymatic exfoliating wife so
they were quite good but I do prefer the
Burt's Bees ones and then the final ones
I actually went ahead an already
purchased a full size of these are these
super detox deep purification wipes they
have kale cucumber and mango steen in
them and these are absolutely fantastic
especially if you do have combo to oily
skin so really really enjoyed having
that little kit I would pick that I
would pick that kid up again you guys
but I don't think that I would pick up
probably half of these wipes in a full
size I would only get the purifying ones
and also these super detox and the final
item that i have here to give you guys a
little bit of review on is the l'oreal
paris infallible Pro glow foundation the
shade that I have is 201 light ivory I'm
sorry classic ivory and this is supposed
to be a radiant finish kind of
foundation for normal to dry skin it's
also supposed to be hydrating I
definitely think this is a beautiful
beautiful Foundation it has a very very
liquid like consistency to it so here is
on the back of my hand it actually
reminds me a lot of like a serum or
water foundation inconsistency except it
gives a lot more coverage it spreads
really evenly I love the shade match it
does have a little bit of a interesting
kind of strong smell I don't know if if
that is from the actual sunscreen in
here or not but it does have SPF let's
see here 15 yeah only a SPF 15 which
isn't that much but this is what it
looks like on the back of my hand is
beautiful it does give it quite a nice
glow to the skin I would
this particular shade right now while IM
self-tan is about a shade lighter than
my skin tone but i do think it's really
really beautiful my only complaint with
this you guys is the fact that this does
not wear on my skin very well whatsoever
I do like to apply it with a damp sponge
I just don't really feel like it buffs
in very nicely with a brush every time i
do that i noticed that it starts to
break up around my nose area like on the
inner corners of my eyes especially in
my t-zone so i don't think that the
actual where time on this is very very
strong which is very strange because
this has a 24-hour claim now i will say
the l'oreal Pro matte foundation is
amazing that definitely has that 24-hour
claim and I feel like I could keep that
on for 24 hours and it would stay on my
face but this one I just felt like it
started to move around during the day I
did try it out with a hydrating primer
and also a silicone or dometic own
primer or a smoothing primer so we shall
see maybe I want to try it out with
something a little more tacky but I do
think it's beautiful it has a wonderful
consistency nice coverage I love the way
it looks on the skin I just wish the
where time was a little longer so that
is that you guys I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
