my channel today's video is going to be
and all to follow up hall so if you are
interested in seeing my final thoughts
or my first impressions on some of these
items I got two weeks ago then please
keep on watching alright so the first
item that I had picked up during that
Hall was the necklace fab exfoliating
glycolic fixed overnight purifying gel
so this is the second time i have
repurchased this item this is what it
looks like and it is absolutely
beautiful you guys I really do feel like
I notice a difference in my skin when I
do use this at night time you don't want
to wear during the day because it does
have glycolic acid which will make you
stun sensitive but it is beautiful I
like it a lot especially if you do have
pretty much any sort of skin type if you
have sensitive skin this won't work for
you but if you are dry it will exfoliate
your skin if you do have acne prone skin
or your more combination to oily it will
help with break out so it's kind of like
the best of both worlds and i believe
it's under ten dollars at alta so i have
been loving that really really happy i
also did purchase the Loreal voluminous
butterfly mascara this is what it looks
like and i am joined this a lot I really
feel like it gives it really fanned out
look to your lashes and it's kind of
like a natural looking at mascara which
normally is not my fan of mascara I
really like spider lashes I just do I
like clumpy lashes but this is a little
more fanned out and natural I think it
actually looks really beautiful yet
defined on the lashes so this is
something that I am interested in
however I will not be purchased because
L'Oreal does test on animals alright
moving on I did have to pick up the it
cosmetics superhero mascara now this i
am not happy with a lot of people love
this and I recently talked about it in a
field in holy grails video I guess I
should have gotten the waterproof
version because this one is just way too
dry the formulation is too dry i like
with the wanda they feel like the wand
does give a nice amount of separation
and a volume and definition to the
lashes i will probably actually keep the
wand but once i get through the entire
bottle of the actual like formulation
i'm going to go ahead and just not
repurchase this it's just too dry and it
starts to kind of fall down onto my
cheekbones throughout the day so I was
not a fan of this but I know a lot of
people do like it if you do want to
scoop it up I would recommend getting
the waterproof version i did also go
through a pack of my these are the altar
brand makeup remover cleansing cloths in
the normal version
did already kind of rip off the thing
there you'll see them in my empties
video this month but I really want to do
a video for you guys on my top five
series for like cleansing cloths or
makeup removing whites these are
definitely one of them they are
beautiful really really happy with these
I like them a lot more than the
Neutrogena ones I feel like I can
actually use these around my eye area
without them really really burning and
stinging so very very happy with those i
did also pick up the becca beach tint
shipper souffle in the raspberry / opal
shade this is what the packaging looks
like really really pretty currently
these are on sale for seventeen dollars
unlike fifty cents on the ultracaan
website as well as the sephora com
website and this is the actual color so
you're getting that makes a berry tone
with a little bit of the golden opal
highlight and when you put your finger
in there it's really bouncy and it feels
like a souffle and that is what the
color looks like so when you do the
actual swatch it's very very light not
super pigmented this is great for those
days where you want like a barely-there
kind of color on or if you do have
really dry skin you can build this up
really nicely on the skin without
looking like it's super super chunky and
dry looking so I really like this I
think it's beautiful I like the way it
sits on the skin if you are very very
oily or acne prone I don't feel like
this is going to look amazing on your
cheeks just because it does have that
shimmer in there which will emphasize
any sort of breakouts I wore it the
other day I have a little bit of
breakouts over here right now and it
really emphasized that area and second
of all if you are very oily this is
probably going to slip off of your face
it does have a DeMatha comb base but
it's a beautiful product especially if
you do have normal or dry skin and then
I did pick up the ulta beauty nectarine
Rose moisturizing body lotion this does
have shea butter in it it has aloe
vitamins A B 5 C and E and it does have
10 fluid ounces of product in there
which is a lot for the seven or eight
dollar price tag so I'm liking this a
lot I think it's beautiful it's not
hydrating enough for me right now I'm
actually dealing with such dry skin that
I have started to get a little bit of
psoriasis on the outside of my mouth as
well as on the back of my hands near my
wrists and things like that so this is
not something that will cure that or
take care of that situation it really is
a light gel moisturizer but it is
beautiful it smells really good you kind
of get these products for the actual
scent they're sort of like the bath and
bodyworks lotions now the body cremes
but the lotions where you're kind of
getting the product because it smells
good and not that it's going to do a
huge amount of moisturization for
you but yeah the nectarine Rose scent is
very very nice if you do like rose you
would like this and the sweetness from
the nectarine is quite nice and then I
did also pick up two tubs of the soap &amp;amp;
Glory flake away scrubs so one of them i
already used up you will see that in
this month's empties video this is the
other one that is still completely full
you guys can see this has peach seed in
it it also has shea butter and sugar
granules in there so this is really nice
that exfoliating the skin I love this a
lot I do not like it more than a mite
retouched a sugar scrubs I still
definitely prefer those those are
cheaper as well but sometimes they have
buy one get one fifty percent off for
the soap &amp;amp; Glory brand which is what I
did for this but yeah this smells
absolutely incredible if you don't know
the normal pink sent from soap &amp;amp; Glory
it is a mixture of like a cologne and
perfume in one in my opinion I love it I
think it's absolutely beautiful very
very unique the scent is not anything
that I have ever been able to do so
would highly recommend that especially
if you do kind of want your body scrub
to be more of like an experience in the
shower because their smells amazing so
anybody love that and it really does
help to you know take off any sort of
dry skin but it doesn't leave any oily
breastfeed so anyway that is it for this
all to follow up holla I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
