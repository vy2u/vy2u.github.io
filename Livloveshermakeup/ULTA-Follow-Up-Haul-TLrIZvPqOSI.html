this video I am sharing a follow-up help
with you guys for you guys with you guys
yes and it is on that the alcohol that I
did about a week and a half ago on my
channel so let's go ahead and talk about
those items so they first item that I
had picked up was the simple micellar
cleansing water and I have pretty much
almost used this up completely I've gone
through a lot of bottles that these you
guys have probably heard me talk about
them they simple micellar cleansing
water is my all-time favorite cleansing
solution or micellar water it's so
gentle on the skin and beautiful and I
really really enjoy it so yes I have
been loving that I also did pick up the
Garnier skin active micellar water in
the pink cat version which is for the
sensitive skin and it's funny because I
actually find these simple one to be a
lot better for sensitive skin than this
one this one is like super deep
cleansing I haven't cracked into this
one yet however I have gone through I
think one or two full sizes of this and
probably three or four of these but I
think this one is probably like money
wise probably better to get this one
than the simple one just because you get
6.7 fluid ounces here you get 13.5 to
almost double the amount in here and I
believe this one is actually cheaper
than this one so I think if you're going
to try a micellar water for the first
time if you do have copper or oily skin
definitely look at the garden a skin
active with the pink cap if you have dry
or aging skin check out the blue cap
version but yeah I really really love
both of these and I'm excited to have
them all right the next two items I had
picked up we're sunscreens and after or
actor care suncare things like that
suncare and aftercare sun care the hurry
big boys item is the Hawaiian chocolate
silk hydration after Sun ultra hydrating
lotion and soothing aloe gel in coconut
papaya and I'm sorry if you hear
background noise yeah i just realized
that our roomba is out who just came out
and I can hear him I think he's sucking
up a port or something great but anyway
this smells really really good and it
does have a low in it so if you are in
the Sun and you get a little bit of a
burn this is super super nice to put on
top of like your shoulders or anywhere
that you get a burn it's very soothing
it smells really good and it's very
cooling so I do love that and I have
also been loving the Hawaiian Tropic
silk hydration weightless this is like a
lotion + suncare in one it smells or gas
like amazing it comes in a pump like
this and it is broad spectrum SPF 30 I
love the Hawaiian Tropic brand they make
the best sunscreens in my opinion if you
want to feel like you're not wearing
sunscreen you should look into the
Hawaiian Tropic brand because it doesn't
smell like sunscreen it doesn't leave a
white cast and on top of that it doesn't
feel greasy so yeah really really have
been enjoying this as well as the next
couple of items that I got were a makeup
wipes and I have used all of these apps
so I definitely have some opinions on
them so the first little set that I got
here were the Garnier skin active clean
plus purifying oil-free cleansing
towelettes with charcoal they instantly
draw out dirt oil and make up there are
they are for oily skin or combo skin and
they remove and they remove oil and
mattify your skin goodness I cannot
speak this is what they look like I
really really love these I think I'm
going to go back and forth between
buying these and buy the Olay henriksen
grace relief cleansing cloth for
cleansing my face in the morning when I
am in a hurry I really like to just grab
a makeup wipe in the morning when I am
in a hurry like a who has time to wash
their face and do a whole skin care
regimen if you have to be ready in like
10 minutes so I do enjoy having
something like this around and I think
this is very comparable to the oly
Henrik's increased relief one so yeah I
did purchase recently from Sephora the
Greeks relief cleansing cloth so i'll go
through that pack and then i'll pick up
another one at these and i'll just go
back and forth they're both really nice
very invigorating and I just like the
way that they took the oil off of my
skin I did not try using them to kind of
remove my makeup I think I tried it once
they did work quite well but I'm trying
to get away from using makeup wipes to
remove my makeup I mostly just use them
for swatching or if I need to cleanse my
face in the morning all right the other
two wipes sets that I got were these so
I got the yes to blueberries age refresh
cleansing facial wipes and i got these
to remove squatches i did not like these
i prefer the cucumber ones these
actually have a really greasy hume
acting kind of feel to them and I
understand it's because they're supposed
to be moisturizing and rejuvenating but
yeah I i was using them for swatches and
they were just leaving my hands oily so
I would not repurchase these however I
would repurchase these birds bees
exfoliating facial cleansing towelettes
with peach and willow bark these are
probably my all-time favorite to use
when I am swatching they smell so good
like real peach and it just have a nice
consistency to them they never leave my
skin
or my arm or my hand feeling greasy
after so i really liked these and i
definitely will repurchase the next two
items i had purchased were lipsticks
from urban decay Urban Decay basically
like I was going to say recall they did
not recall what they just continued
their old lipstick formulation because
now they have the new formulation so
basically these were on sale for like
ten dollars I got the Urban Decay
revolution lipstick in the shade streak
which I was wearing a couple of videos
ago I think and people were asking what
was on my lips this was what was on my
lips it's a beautiful kind of coral
color these are so so humectant and
moisturizing they really lock the
moisture in on your lips very very
comfortable to wear if you can still
pick up some of the revolution lipsticks
I highly recommend checking out the
original formula I also did pick up the
shade 1993 which is in the matte formula
which comes in the black tube these are
also quite comfortable but honestly the
just the regular formula is a lot more
comfortable in my opinion as you can
probably tell here's 1993 and hair
streaked 1993 the map version has a lot
more pigmentation and does a lot more
opaque but overall I would rather just
where the revolution like just a regular
formulation but yeah this is really nice
as well I haven't really worn this too
much I think it worked one or two days
and I did wear a bomb underneath it and
I think it looks extra good if you do
wear a lip primer like the lip insurance
or laura geller slip spackle so anyway I
won't be using that next week I plan on
doing like a warm toned makeup like I'm
gonna be playing with my peanut butter
college I'm going to be having this
shade on my lips so we'll see how that
goes and yeah you guys will see that for
next week and then the last two items I
had purchased were the soap &amp;amp; Glory
original pink body spray and the orange
Adam zesty fresh and revitalizing body
wash so I am loving this this is my
go-to body spray for the week it smells
so good I love that original pink sense
and you know what it kind of reminds me
of after smelling it it really reminds
me of that shade not that shade that
sent love letter it's an old-school
fragrance that is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
I still have a body spray but it's
called like love letter or something
like that it smells exactly like this
but anyway this is a blend of like
bergamot and citrus it smells so good
it's kind of a unisex scent I really
really enjoy it it's
the center that is in the hand food hand
cream and also the soap &amp;amp; Glory
what's it called clean on me clean on me
body wash so if you like that sense you
would love the original pink spray and
then this item I talked about in my
files and how the grails a few weeks ago
I do not really like this i will use it
up completely I've been using it for
like shaving my legs and things like
that it's a good body wash but the fact
I'm not crazy about when I smell it out
of the tube I'm actually like yeah i did
that i really like it it smells good but
when i put this all over my body in the
shower it just smells too zesty like too
much of urbana or too much like I don't
know like it's kind of smells like grass
I don't know what kind of strange so I
love really really sweet smelling things
and this just is not really up my alley
so although it is a good formulation i
would go ahead and pick up the clean on
me next time instead of this one so
anyway that was my follow-up all on the
alcohol that i did a few weeks ago i
will link the original video down below
if you would like to watch it and yeah i
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
