my channel my hair today's video is
going to be an alcohol so if you are
interested in seeing what I picked up
during the twenty percent off sale and
then please keep on watching alright so
the first item that I picked up was from
the ulta beauty brand itself this is the
nectarine rose moisturizing body lotion
this is what it looks like and this does
have let's see here shea butter aloe a
vitamins a b 5 c and e in it it says
moisturizing body lotion super hydrating
non-greasy formula softens and
conditions the skin so I like this a lot
when you guys see sample spotlight at
the end of the month you will see that I
did actually use up a sample of this it
smells absolutely amazing just like
nectarine and Rose mixed together if you
have really really dry or like mature
skin I do not think that this is going
to be hydrating enough for you but if
you are like me and you have kind of
like combination to oily skin even on
your body i do think that you would like
this alright i also picked up another
nip + fab exfoliating glycolic fixed
overnight purifying gel if this is what
it looks like in my last alcohol i also
picked this up and i really really like
it it does have four percent of glycolic
acid in it it does have stella cilic
acid and also vitamin b3 and those are
all just really really good high quality
ingredients i am really enjoying the nip
+ babble i'm so far they also have a
really fantastic glycolic fixed scrub
but i'm going through the purifying gel
a little quicker than the scrub so i
wanted to pick up one of those i also
picked up two tubs of the soap and glory
flake away scrub this is what it looks
like it says it has shea butter sugar
and peach seed powder for a spa body
polish finish so anyway these smell
fantastic they are the signature pink
sense so the clean Omni sent or the hand
food sent they really smell good they
were buy one get one fifty percent off i
like the formulation a lot so I'm very
excited to try those I also did pick up
the it cosmetics superhero mascara so
this is what it looks like and I have
seen a lot of first impressions on this
it says if your lashes superhero powers
in just one coat the proprietary elastic
stretch technology wraps each individual
lash in a volume boosting lengthening
and ultra conditioning super black cape
a power in color for your strongest
longest thickest and most define lashes
ever
the actual packaging on this looks a
little something like this is this is
like my all-time favorite packaging for
a mascara I have ever seen it is a
natural bristle wand which normally I'm
not that into but I feel like this is
going to be a good one because it is
very densely packed as you guys can
probably see so I'm very excited to try
that out it does smell like really
really bad for a mascara I don't know
why that has sort of like a wet finish
but also kind of like a dryer finish or
actual consistency to it so I feel like
that is going to be a good one I also
picked up the altar brands legendary
lengths lengthening mascara i love this
like lacquered like mid-tone pink shade
here so pretty this one is right up my
alley i by accident did pick up the
black brown shade but this is what it
looks like the actual wand is a rubber
bristle wand it has kind of like an
hourglass shape to it I'm very excited
to try this out I feel like that is
going to be a really really good one I
also did pick up let's see here the
L'Oreal what is this called voluminous
butterfly mascara so now they have like
an extensive version they have like a
dramatic version a waterproof version
this is just the regular version the
shade is called 867 and black and it
says slammed out slammed out fanned out
lashes and volume so this is the actual
packaging and then here is what it looks
like on the inside I feel like this used
to be a bluebottle I don't know why but
now it is silver as you guys can see it
says voluminous butterfly and I don't
know why I picked up so many mascaras I
don't need any new mascaras but I really
wanted them and this is what it looks
like it does have like a very
interesting wand to it so I'm quite
excited to try that out I also went
ahead and picked up one of these abeka
on beach tint shimmer souffles the shade
i got is called a raspberry / opal so
here is what the actual packaging looks
like and then the like I said the shade
is called raspberry / opal so I already
do have one of these but this was on
sale for seventeen dollars normally
these are not seventy dollars they are
around 30 very very souffle light kind
of cream blush and I'm not someone who's
really into cream blush but I do already
own the watermelon / and moonstone shade
and it smells amazing it goes on to the
cheeks beautifully and it is water
resistant and oil free so I really do
like this let me show you guys what the
actual shade looks like so that is
it looks like as you can see it's a very
very light in the pigmentation area but
it's still beautiful beautiful beautiful
on the skin even if you do have
combination to oily skin I feel like
that sits really nicely on the cheeks
and then finally I did pick up three
packs of the Ulta makeup remover facial
towel at so these are 25 pre-moistened
towelettes and this is what the little
packaging looks like and I picked up
through those like I said because I
really really like these they are very
very very comparable to the what-is-it
neutrogena makeup removing towelettes in
the blue version it says it is a gentle
way to cleanse refresh and moisturize
your skin these soft tail lights
effectively remove all traces of dirt
oil and waterproof eye makeup no need to
rinse after and yeah I really really
like them so they do have a sensitive
version as well but if you want
something that's like a compared to and
the are like yeah like they compared to
for the Neutrogena makeup cleansing
towelettes you would really really like
these so anyway guys those are all the
products that I picked up from Ulta for
the twenty percent off sale I would love
to hear what you guys got down below and
I will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
