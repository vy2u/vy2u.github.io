today's video is going to be an alcohol
so if you're interested in seen the
items that I picked up from the online
website too then please keep on watching
I will obviously do or obviously I guess
it's so obviously I've not done a haul
in a while but I always do like to do a
follow up haul exactly a week later or
like a week in a day or two later so
next week I will do a follow up haul for
you guys where I basically give you my
first impressions or my final thoughts
on these items so if you want to see
them reviewed and that will happen next
week but yeah let's go ahead and jump
right into it everything shown in this
video is cruelty free so the first thing
that I did pick up is from uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills I wanted to get my hands
on the Sun dipped glow kit I was going
to call this the glow tip no the glow
kit this is lutely sudden its glow kit
looks like it does come in nice kind of
bronzy packaging and the shades that you
do have in here are bronzed summer
tourmaline and moonstone so here are the
four shades that you get and I just
think these are absolutely gorgeous as
you can see I've already dipped in my
fingers in here I could not help myself
I think my two favorite shades are
definitely tourmaline tourmaline
tourmaline I think is term alignment or
wine and then I'll fill this stage right
here which is summer kind of reminds me
of moonstone from Becca so let me do
some swatches for you guys these are
just so beautiful I really love the
formula on all of the honest hacia
Beverly Hills glow kits look at that
it's just like a foiled gorgeous like
in-your-face kind of highlight and I'm
all about that life so very very excited
to be playing with that it seems like
the formula is very consistent to what I
have like with the sweets glow kids and
then also with the well not so much the
moon child but kind of the new nicole
guerrero glow kits these ones definitely
feel a little more firmly pressed but
still really beautiful so super excited
to try that out next i did pick up two
different sponges from Real Techniques
these are nila the first one is the
miracle face and body sponge so this is
like a huge version of the miracle
complexion sponge but it's made for your
body not I will say it does feel a
little firm to the touch but I think
this thing is awesome it is huge and I
think this would be great for
self-tanning or if you want to take your
foundation like down your neck or onto
your decollete or even for highlighting
your body I have noticed that my tan has
completely disappeared off of my face
but the rest of my body still has a
little bit of color so it's been very
hard to match my actual face to my neck
lately and I think this would be a nice
way to bring my foundation
down onto my neck so that is the new
miracle complexion body sponge and then
I also did pick up this guy this is the
bold metals collection this is called
the miracle diamond sponge now I have
heard good things and also bad things
about this so I do hope that it works
for me I will of course return anything
that doesn't work for me but this is
what it looks like it's so beautiful
it's almost like a marbled kind of
finish this little point right here
seems really flimsy and I can't really
imagine using it underneath my eye area
but the flat surface right here seems
like it will be really nice for stamping
on foundation I also did pick up two
items from Burt's Bees the first one is
the cleansing oil with coconut and argan
oil it does say it is meant for normal
to dry skin but I'm gonna use this
actually as a cleanser to remove my
makeup so this will be my first cleanse
and then I will double cleanse with
another cleanser so anyway my friend
Darlene told me about this she said it's
really beautiful and it smells quite
good so I am super excited to try that
out again I will keep you guys updated
on that and then I did pick up a little
lip gloss stick which I definitely
didn't need I picked this up from Burt's
Bees I just don't need anything like
this in my collection I don't really
know why I got it but it was on sale and
I thought the color was really pretty it
is the Burt's Bees gloss lip crayon it
says 100% natural and the sheet is
called Pacific Coast pink so that is
what it looks like it definitely looked
different on the website I feel like
Ulta never has like true descriptive
colors on their actual website but this
is what the shade looks like it looks
like it's gonna be really easy to just
pop on to my lips and I like quick like
lip crams like this because they're very
comfortable and you can just like put
some color on your face instantly all
right the next item that I did pick up
is from ELF cosmetics so this is the HD
powder in the shade of sheer so I wanted
to pick this up I feel like so many
silica partners part of it so many
silica powders are the same this one is
very similar to the tarte one the makeup
for everyone the only two silica powders
that I feel like are absolutely
incredible and amazing are the by by
pours from it cosmetics analysis the
bite area hyaluronic hydra powder but i
really wanted to get something like this
for baking now this is very cheap you
can literally get what is this 8 grams
of product for around 4 dollars so I
thought if I was going to bake it with a
silica powder it should be this one so
it's a very very finely milled it looks
like they have changed the packaging on
this I used to have the big kind of
clunky one that had like the little
square packaging but yeah super excited
this out I don't know if the formula has
changed since I tried it but I used to
use this in college and it does remind
me a lot of like the Tarte one and also
the Make Up For Ever one and then I did
pick up two different body products from
hemp so hemp is a cruelty-free brand as
well as a vegan brand the first item
that I picked up was the white peach
Rose a and peony herbal shave gel how
amazing does that sound you guys it
literally smells like heaven this is
what it looks like beautiful beautiful
packaging as well and it just says
massage onto wet skin and shave it says
rinse blade with hot water often so I'm
guessing that does have some oil in it
but yeah like the first ingredient in
here is let's see here water and then it
also has aloe juice or aloe vera in it
it has citrus lemon peel it has
safflower of safflower oil it has
vanilla fruit vanilla fruit vanilla
plant a floral flute I don't know proof
absolute vanilla plan of flora fruit I
don't really know but it smells amazing
it seems like it has a lot of good
hydrating oils in here so I'm super
super excited to try this out that is
what it looks like and then they were
having buy one get one 50% off so I also
did pick up the blushing grapefruit and
raspberry creme in shower hydrating
herbal body moisturizer I really do like
the Nivea in-shower body moisturizer but
Nivea does test on animals so I thought
this would be really really nice to try
out it says as seen in InStyle magazine
and this one smells like even better
than the peach one oh my god it smells
amazing so it's super super excited to
try those out and then the final item
that I did pick up was from Pacifica
this is the happy essence hydro mess it
says it refreshes and fights the look of
fatigue on your face with coconut water
green tea and very happy extract so this
is basically just a facial mess I have
been looking for a good cruelty free and
also vegan facial mess and this one is
right up my alley
you do get four fluid ounces a product
in here and it is only $12 so I will
keep you guys updated on that you know
that I absolutely adored this really
gross water balance EMS but lately
honestly it's been giving me rashes I
think they changed up the formula and
also unfortunately it surely does tests
on animals so I wanted to find something
new I hope that this works out well so
anyway that is it guys those are all the
items that I picked up from Ulta I hope
you enjoyed this haul like I said I will
have me follow up haul going up for you
guys next week and yeah that's pretty
much it thank you for joining me see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
