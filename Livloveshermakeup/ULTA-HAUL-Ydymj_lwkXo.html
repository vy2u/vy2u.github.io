thank you so much for joining me in
today's video I have a quick little
alcohol for you guys well I don't know
how quick it will be but I order some
stuff autumns out the awesome out of i
order some stuff on the Ulta com website
and I'm going to share with you guys
what I got so the first two things that
I picked up her from the soap &amp;amp; Glory
line recently on the altar calm website
these have been like buy one get one
fifty percent off for buy one get one
free just a really good deal I did pick
up the soap &amp;amp; Glory I'm clean on me body
wash and I really like it so I thought I
would get the orange chasm zesty fresh
and revitalizing body wash this is what
it looks like you get like 16.9 fluid
onto the product in here let's smell it
smells really good I love anything
citrusy this smells like lemon zest and
kind of like a little bit of like
bergamot kind of spicy so I'm excited to
try that out and then I saw on the
website oh my god something just fell
anyway I found the website that they had
the soap &amp;amp; Glory original pink body
spray and this is the scent if you are
curious this is the scent of the clean
Omni body wash oh my god and also the
hand food hand cream it doesn't smell
exactly like just as good as those two
but it's pretty darn close I think it's
a blend of like patchouli bergamot and
like flowers or something like that but
it smells amazing so I knew I had to get
that particular body best me next two
items I got worse unsterile related
sunscreen related sun care related so
the first is the Hawaiian Tropic silk
hydration weightless broad-spectrum SPF
15 sunscreen I mean SPF 30 that is great
I did open this already because they
wanted to smell it and make sure that it
smell just as good as all of the
Hawaiian Tropic sunscreens I love the
Hawaiian Tropic blend or the brand I
love the blend of sunscreen that they
make and I love the brand they really
really smell good and they're not greasy
whatsoever and this one is actually new
so it comes in like this pump style
format and this is the silk hydration so
it has the mixture of the hydrating
ribbons in there so you're getting sun
care and you're also getting lotion in
there but this one is supposed to be
weightless I have tried the sheer
version and I have also just tried the
regular moisturizing ribbon version and
all of them sink in
typically quickly but this one's gay
when I was very very curious because it
says it feels as if it's barely on the
skin so I did pick that up and they were
buy one get one fifty percent off as
well so i got the Hawaiian Tropic still
hydration after Sun which is a blend of
ultra hydrating lotion and soothing aloe
vera gel and the scent is coconut papaya
so that is what it looks like this is
just nice if you do tend to burn I burn
so easily especially because of my lupus
and very Sun sensitive so i already know
i'm going into the summer that I will
burn so I like to have that so that I
can kind of calm down any sort of ration
as I might get all right the next two
items that I picked up weird makeup
removing wipes and I probably won't use
these to remove the makeup on my face
I'll probably just use them for removing
swatches so the first hack I got is the
yes to blueberries age refresh cleansing
facial wipes and recently the yes to
brand has reformulated like their white
like the actual consistency of the wipe
it's super super soft and plush so I
wanted to try these ones out so I got a
pack of those and then I also got a pack
of the Burt's Bees peach of willow bark
exfoliating costs and I really really
like these they smell so good just like
peach like real peach not like
artificial peach real peach and you know
bursaries is known for having pretty
natural ingredients with us in ninety
nine point two percent natural
ingredients so this does have willow
bark in there which is just a fancy term
for salicylic acid if you aren't curious
but these are quite exfoliating they
don't have texture on them the
exfoliating property in there is the
salicylic acid so technically it's like
a how would I describe it it's basically
just like a chemical exfoliant but
anyway I really do like these and I like
the scent so I will use those I will
remove those oh I am filmed too many
videos today I will use those for
removing two watches alright the next
two items I got were more my seller
waters because i have recently gone
through quite a few so i picked up the
Garnier skin active micellar cleansing
water in the obviously the waterproof
version not the waterproof version this
is the one with the pink cap this is the
sensitive version I love this you get a
lot in here a lot of bang for your buck
this is more like
Lucien and the one that has the blue cap
is more like an oily weirdness it's more
like a dual face or eye makeup remover
this one's more like a solution which I
like so I picked that one up and then I
also picked up these simple micellar
cleansing water which i also enjoy and
we'll be doing a video on my seller
waters like a battle or showdown of the
micellar waters i'll probably call it
micellar water is the good the bad and
the ugly so I can share with you guys my
favorite ones the ones that I thought
were just okay and then the really
really crappy ones so you guys will see
those in there and then I also picked up
these Garnier skin active clean plus
purifying oil-free cleansing towelettes
and it was because the garden hey was
also buy one get one fifty percent off
and I had fallen out of love with the
clean plus scrub I'll talk about that a
little bit in my project pan at video
that will be coming up I think on let's
see here when is it coming up probably
June second it will be my finished seven
by Saul I'll talk about that a little
more but I thought like out of love with
that scrub so I was kind of like I
didn't really want to get these but then
I thought well come on if I won't get
one fifty percent off and I thought
these would be nice not for removing
makeup but just for rubbing over my face
in the morning when I'm in a hurry I
really like the old a henriksen um what
are they the truth cloths and also the
what are they called the oil-free poori
finding ones the grease relief so I
thought these would be kind of similar I
believe that they do have two percent
salsa like acid in them so they remove
oil and mattify with charcoal and they
draw out dirt oil and makeup so I would
just use them to cleanse my face really
really quickly when I'm in a hurry in
the morning so I did pick up a pack of
those i have heard good things but like
i said i fell out of love with the scrub
I don't know what happened alright and
then the last two things I picked up
we're to make up items these are the
Urban Decay Matt revolution lipsticks
and then just the regular revolution
lipstick these are on sale right now for
like ten dollars a piece which is
amazing they are just continuing this
particular line I already have one of
the regular revolution lipsticks I think
it's in the shade shame which is like a
deep berry i love the
Malaysian so I did want to try out the
mat one this shade is called 1993 really
really cute packaging and it's just like
a brown color and I have never like I
said try it out the matte formula but
I'm excited this is a beautiful color
look at that color yes that's like the
Kylie Jenner your lips but better shade
like the epitome of it and then the
other one I got is just the regular
version and the shade that I picked up
is called streak which is kind of like a
hot coral and the original ones come in
this beautiful sort of gun metal
packaging what you think is amazing and
these are so creamy and moisturizing
like we're really really beautiful so
here is streak oh I love it i thought i
was going to have more red in it but i'm
glad that it doesn't because this is the
perfect color for the summer time there
is streak so we have 1993 which is the
mat and then street which is just the
regular formula so I'm so excited to
play with those I think this is going to
be great for the summer time and yeah
that is my alcohol I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
