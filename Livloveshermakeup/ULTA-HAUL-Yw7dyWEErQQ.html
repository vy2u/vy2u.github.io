hope you are all having a wonderful
weekend today's video is going to be an
alter hall i ordered a few things from
the online website and i am eager to
share with you guys what I got because a
lot of these items are coming up with me
to the cabin next week and yeah let's go
ahead and just get started shall we so
the first item that i purchased and i am
going to bring this to the cabin is the
Loreal infallible Pro glow foundation
the shade that I picked up is 201
classic ivory this has broad spectrum
SPF 15 sunscreen in it which is perfect
for the cabin it's supposed to give a
radiant finish for normal to dry skin
and it's also supposed to be a hydrating
formulation now you guys know I have
oily two combo skin but I have heard a
lot of people say that this is good on
all sorts of different skin types so I'm
very very excited to try this out and
I'm going to go ahead and so watch this
on the back of my hand so you guys can
kind of see it looks very very liquidy
but it looks like it is a good color
match right now while I have a little
bit of self tanner on and it feels quite
lightweight so I do want to bring this
up to the cabin with me and kind of test
it out and see if I like it and then
when i do my follow-up all for you guys
i can go ahead and let you know if I
like it or not alright so the next item
that i picked up i'm going to use right
now these are the ultime cup remover
facial towelettes they are gently
cleansing made with a hundred percent
plant these fibers you get 25 in here
and they are pre-moistened obviously and
yeah I want to see how these are i like
to use you know makeup removing facial
wipes to remove swatches and also if i
am in a hurry and i need to remove face
makeup i will use them but these ones
smell really good oh really really good
cut damn they smell like yes sorry but
they smell like candy they actually felt
really good so and they say to try those
out the next item that I picked up was
the physicians formula are gone where
ultra nourishing argon lip duo in the
liquid gold and pink version so this is
what they look like and lip oils are
such a craze right now like every brand
has some sort of lip oil my friend
Tiffany did a review on these or not a
review I think she called them and she
said she liked them they don't give any
sort of pigment to the lips they go on
completely clear only the tiniest amount
of color
she said they were very very nice on top
of like lipsticks and liquid lipsticks
and you guys know that I'm not really a
fan of uncomfortable lip products so I
thought these would be nice to top any
sort of lipstick with so i will be using
these this coming week i'm not going to
bring these to the cabin obviously
because they're you know oils and i'm
scared that they will explode in my
luggage and that would be a disaster but
anyway they come in really really cute
little packaging as you guys can see and
they don't really have that much of a
fragrance i was worried because honestly
the argon where'd line from physicians
formula tends to have kind of a strong
fragrance going on there but i did
Squatch these earlier and i couldn't
really smell anything very very light
fragrance so anyway there is the pink
one on the back of my hand as you guys
can see it's like a barely-there sort of
color but they do have a nice little
applicator and i'm excited to wear these
so i will talk about those a little more
in shop and swatch my stash alright
moving on the next light is that i
picked up where some micellar water
makeup remover cleansing pads this is
also from the alte brand it curious
about the altar brand I don't know what
it is I just have been wanting to try
more like items out from them ever since
emilynoel83 started talking about like
there are sponges and all that kind of
stuff I thought I would try these out so
I don't want to travel with like a
bottle of micellar water when I go up to
the cabin just because I'm scared it's
going to spell all over my luggage so I
thought these would be nice I probably
will just put these into it definitely
remove that swatch nicely um but I think
what I'll do is probably just take like
15 of these and pop them into a plastic
bag hopefully they won't dry out but
this container is actually quite big I
was not expecting that but yeah you get
30 in here and I definitely will do a
video you guys know I'm going to do a
battle or a showdown video on my cellar
or cleansing water so i will definitely
include those in there and we shall see
how these work alright the next item
that i purchased is the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer this is the
murumuru butter bronzer you guys have
been recommending that i picked this up
forever my friend tiffany on my friend
rochelle my friend kristen they're like
you need to get this so anyway the shape
that I got is a light bronzer 6675 and
it says
skin loving Brazilian butter blend in it
so that is what it looks like I did
smell this and swatch it already you
guys oh my god it smells so good and its
really really really nice and creamy I
was very very surprised so and this is
what the actual packaging looks like
super cute and tropical and it smells
amazing it just smells like the tropics
like I don't know coconut butter mixed
with coconut oil or something like that
it has a beautiful little like imprint
ation on it and then you go ahead and
scroll your finger in there and it
literally feels like butter so I'm super
excited for this I do have self-tanner
on right now so this looks a little
light on my skin but I think it will be
perfect to bring up to the cabin so
there it is swatch and has a beautiful
Sheen to it and it blends out like a
dream so I am so excited to test that
out and play with that when i am up at
the cabin and then the next item that i
went ahead and got hold on let me grab
those micellar water pads to get rid of
this swatch the next item I gods are
actually like a little set of facial
wipes there from the brand Pacifica and
it was like seventeen dollars for this
little kit and I'm almost like why was
it even worth it i hope it is worth it
but I was really really drawn in by
these and this was actually why I place
the alta order because i really wanted
to get this little set these are the
travel ready facial wipes you get five
different packs in here with ten at ten
cleansing towelettes in each I cannot
speak um so anyway I was super excited
to try these out you guys know I love
cleansing wipes and I think these will
be perfect for 10 days after the cabin
because I'll be in and out of the lake
and I don't want to have to go and you
know like wash down my face or wash down
my body every single time I get on Lake
I think it's nice to have like cleansing
wipes just so you can wipe all over your
body or under your armpits or wherever
the hell you want to wipe so these are
the pacifica purified coconut water
cleansing wipes this is the first little
set and all of the pacifica items are
sulfate in paraben free the second
little pack is the super detox deep
purification wipes these have kale
cucumber and mango steam in them so that
is what they look like and then we also
have the enzymatic exfoliating wipes
these have peach and apricot in that
and they look like this I think these
will be very very similar to the ones
that I like from Burt's Bees those like
exfoliating peach and willow bark ones
and then we have this little pink back
here which is jasmine and coconut water
and then the last little pack is super
super cool you guys it's actually serum
wife so and these are the moisturize
energized serum wipes with floral water
extract so they look like that so yeah I
thought that would be the perfect little
kit um to bring up to the cabin I'm just
going to take him up in this little box
and I hope that I like them all right
and then the last item that i purchased
from Ulta is the Loreal infallible Pro
matte 16-hour powder in the shade 100
porcelain i have been using another one
of these like for the past couple of
weeks i really like it it is a little
dark on me but i think it gives me a
nice kind of glow to my skin and it
definitely keeps me mad so i picked up
another one of those and then i also got
a little l'oreal tote filled with a
bunch of samples i already put them into
my little sample pile or my little
sample um bin so you guys will be seeing
those in sample spotlight but alta also
gave me two samples so they gave me
these Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer light and also the seat booth
egyptian argan oil body butter so
anyways you guys to see those in sample
spotlight and yeah i hope you guys
enjoyed this video i will have a
follow-up hall when i get back from my
trip so probably around the second week
of august i will do a follow-up all for
you guys and also i will give you a
little more of an in depth review on
that l'oreal infallible Pro blow
foundation i'm not going to make a
separate video but i'll go more in depth
when i do the follow-up house so anyway
