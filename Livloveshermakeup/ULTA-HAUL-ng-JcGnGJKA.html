haul for you guys today this time we are
going through some items that I picked
up from the alte com website now most of
these were items that I just needed to
repurchase like makeup removing wipes
and you know like body scrubs micellar
water but I do have two little items
that I'll share at the end that are kind
of like items that I didn't need but I
picked up anyway so anyway look good I
get started anyway anyway anyway alright
so the first three items that I picked
up a were makeup removing wipes I like
having makeup removing wipes for
removing swatches I like to have them
while I'm doing my makeup to like wipe
my hands off on instead of just wiping
like off on a towel and obviously I use
them sometimes to remove my makeup I am
very aggressive or when I remove my
makeup actually when I put on my makeup
when I put on anything and when I take
things off I am very very aggressive
with my face so I've been trying not to
use makeup remover wipes and I just I
just hurt myself I've been trying not to
use makeover mover way so good I do
think that I'm very very aggressive and
I pull up my skin a lot so I've been
trying to kind of stay away from that
but I did want to pick a few up just to
have her swatches of what not so the
first one that I picked up was the
ultime cup remover facial towelettes I
will be doing a video of altas like
compared to brand versus so far as
compared to brand I think ulta has some
really good skincare products and ass
before I has some really good makeup
products so these are just the ones that
are very comparable to the Neutrogena
makeup removing wipes if you want
basically a dupe for like a fraction of
the price these are awesome they're just
like the ones that come in the blue
container they smell the same and they
have the same sort of soft consistency
the actual wife does so these are gentle
cleansing made with 100-percent
plant-based fiber and you do get 25
pre-moistened towelettes in here so that
is the first item I picked up and then I
got two other packs of makeup removing
whites that are new to me the first ones
are the Olay fresh effects and I thought
that I had tried these before but it was
the Garnier ones that were like the
fresh effects or something that I had
tried so these are called swype out to
refreshing makeup removal claws I
actually day to use these last night to
remove my makeup and want to do a little
bit of a first impressions for you guys
I didn't think these were that great
they were very very oily and I'm not a
huge fan of super super oily makeup
removing wipes the only ones that I like
that do you have a little bit of oil to
them are the Rose cleansing wipes from
Sephora and also the makeup removing
wipes from Neutrogena in the
moisturizing version but these just
very oily and gravely so I don't think I
would repurchase them but when i do my
follow-up hall i will give you guys some
more insights on those and then here i
was very excited about these these are
from shea moisture i love the shea
moisture line and these are their super
fruit multivitamin renewal facial wipes
these do have grapefruit seed oil and
also lotus seed extract in them and they
are supposed to listen to the claims on
here smooth uneven texture and fine
lines on your face with one wipe and
they are supposed to remove makeup and
dirt without rinsing or dry now I used
one of these last night to kind of
cleanse my face very quickly I do like
the actual wipes I think they're very
soft I like the packaging I didn't even
know that shea moisture had facial wipes
so this is really cool the concept is
cool but they were so dry they were so
incredibly dry so I'm gonna start
storing mine upside down to see if I can
get a little more moisture in them but I
do like to Shea Moisture line because
they are vegan cruelty-free family-owned
company and they do have some good
ingredients in them so anyway I'm going
to try those out and again i will give
you guys on my final thoughts when I do
my follow-up hall I did pick up some
more powders of course a new essence all
about Matt fixing compact powder what
would my life be without this particular
powder i love this for setting in my
makeup if you do have fear to light skin
tones this is awesome it will not show
up like when you use like a camera or
something with flash like it's not super
super white on the face if you are very
fair but if you do have like a medium to
dark complexion this is not going to
work for you but i love it it's 399
keeps me mad all day and then you guys
are recommending i check out this
Catrice cosmetics prime and find
mattifying powder this is waterproof and
it is transparent but the actual
packaging got a little got a little
scrubbed up but this is what it looks
like and it looks beautiful you do get a
mirror here and I think this is around
seven dollars so not too bad I really do
prefer buying powders that are from the
drugstore just because I go through
powder very very quickly but this feels
so silky like ridiculously silky you
guys so I'm very excited to try this out
we shall see there is kind of swatched
and yeah I'm very excited to try that
out so thank you for the recommendation
moving on I did get a tree had a
soothing scrub this one is actually the
salt scrubs so it just so happened this
time that I was ordering from alta they
did not have the by one fifty percent
off buy one get one fifty percent off
deal going
normally I get their sugar scrubs but I
thought I would just spend the extra two
dollars and get one of their salt scrubs
their salt scrubs are great as well and
actually they're really nice if you have
like sore muscles that kind of acts like
epsom salts and basically they will help
soothe that area so this is in the
cherry blossom scent and I have tried
this one before I do like it I don't
like the charcoal one as much even
though that does activate and heat up on
your skin but this one smells amazing
and you get a lot of product in here so
super excited to have that and like I
said the scent is really good it is very
very strong though so that's something
to be aware of I was running low on
brush cleanser or brush cleaner and i'm
not talking about like you know like
deep cleansing brush stuff I'm talking
about everyday spot cleaning so I want
to try out this it brushes for alta
brush bath purifying brush cleaner I
thought the packaging was cute which is
why i bought it really bad i know but
the packaging is adorable and I was just
running low my favorite one that I have
found so far I have tried all of them i
have tried these cinema secrets I have
tried the what is it I feel like I've
tried everything the Sephora brand I've
tried the ooh what does it make up
forever brand the best one in my opinion
has been the Sephora one these citrus
brush cleanser I love that for spot
cleaning my brushes it is oily but it
has just the right amount of oil so that
it's not to the point where it will make
your bristles on your brushes all like
stoppie and gooey so I'm hoping that
this one is not too oily we shall see it
was quite expensive for this little guy
was 3.4 fluid ounces and I think goes
around twenty dollars but we shall see
if it's good that I will be purchased
and then I was running low on micellar
water and I will be doing a battle of
the micellar waters video for you guys
soon and I'm gonna call it the good the
bad and the ugly I how we've been
talking about it forever but I will be
doing that soon so I wanted to try out a
new micellar water this time you guys
know I love the simple one I love the
garden-gate pink cap version this
particular one is called these
jean-pierre micellar cleansing water
this was actually the most highly rated
micellar water on the alta calm website
originally I was trying to find the what
was it the birds bees cleansing water
because my friend Darlene said it was
really good but I couldn't find it on
the Alta website so i decided to go
ahead and pick this one up you don't get
that much product in here but this was
literally like three dollars and 49
cents so that's pretty cool we shall try
it out and I will let you guys know if
it's any
good and then the last two items that I
got were definitely not necessities but
things that I wanted to try out the
first one is from essence this is the i
heart stage eyeshadow base a lot of you
have been recommending this to me now
this shade looks hella dark it just says
a daf on the back I don't know what that
means but it's a little doe foot
applicator and he looks very very are
orange and dark on my skin as you guys
can see and I actually threw on a layer
of self tanner the other day just
because I was looking very muddy and
uneven from my lupus flare so I wanted
like a little bit of glow going on on my
skin and even with the self-tanner that
is so so so dark so let me know if they
have different shades of this they only
had that one when I order it online but
you guys know I love drugstore I primers
in fact if you watched my eye primer
declutter or just my primer declutter
video I declutter all of my high-end
primers except for my glitter glue from
to face because I do prefer the ones
from the drugstore so we shall see if
that works I normally do go ahead and
cover up my eye primers with concealer
so maybe that will work and you know
even if it's dark it will still work out
but we shall see and then the last item
that I picked up was a pacifica perfume
I definitely am NOT in the need for more
perfumes but I love perfumes I collect
perfume so I did go ahead and pick this
one up I love the Pacifica perfumes I
feel like they have a lot of dupes for
like high-end perfumes like they're
Tahitian gardenia perfume is literally
like the exact tube for the mod waar
from marc jacobs so i really like their
perfumes they are completely natural
they are vegan cruelty free free of
parabens phthalates and propylene glycol
which is awesome and they only have six
ingredients in them which is amazing so
anyway here is what to the actual little
bottle looks like and let's go ahead and
spray this you guys know I love
everything rose oh my god it smells
really good yeah it smells really really
good probably has like a little bit of
lemon in there as well and I thought it
was funny because every time they have
new sense i noticed that they're kind of
like duping newer sense that came out of
like sephora or something like that so
they have the persian rose right now in
one called sandalwood and it made me
think of the new elizabeth and james
nirvana rose and bourbon perfumes and I
was like I wonder if those are kind of
dupes so this one doesn't smell exactly
like the Nirvana rose but it still
smells really good with a little bit of
like that
malibu lemon blossom cents thrown in
there that they have so really excited
for that and yeah that is a guy so those
are all of the items that I picked up at
Ulta of course I will have a follow-up
hall for you guys next week and I will
let you know how all these items are
working out for me that is it for
today's videos I will see you guys
tomorrow and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
