my channel today I have an Ulta haul to
share with you guys I'm very excited I
don't feel like I have done an Ulta haul
in a while I did place an order for two
different products from the Ulta 21 days
of ship event because it was pretty
shitty it was not a lot of good stuff
for that particular event but it did
pick up two of those items and then also
there were just some other items on my
wish list as far as Ulta is concerned so
I went ahead and scoop those up as well
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
I want to start with a little bit of a
rant here
they sent a whole lot of samples even
though I asked for no samples with every
single order that I place now one of the
hard things about being cruelty free
it's kind of distinguishing it between
do you still go ahead and take samples
that are non cruelty free do you use
them up and then you can't purchase the
both sides it just seems really
pointless to me so I'm kind of
disappointed that first of all so far
I've been sending these samples even
though I haven't been clicking for any
samples and then also Ulta has been
doing that so kinda disappointing it's
not like I'm ever gonna purchase a
full-size of like your cream or anything
like that anymore I mean yes I may have
some D or products in my collection but
they were there before I make my cruelty
free so please Ulta and Sephora stop
sending me samples if I don't
want that anyway let's go ahead and jump
into the haul you guys wow I just hit
one of my lights but anyway let's do
this so the first two I can play picked
up were actually drugstore concealers
I've heard really good things about
these the first one is called the LA
girl Pro conceal HD high definition
concealer little dark dark on
the shade I picked up it's called light
eye for you guys and that was because I
was super super self tan probably about
a week ago when I placed this order so I
really thought this would work for me
but this is a little too a dark it looks
a little too orangey however I can
always use it as eye color corrector
before I go in with my foundation so
that's the first item I picked up I've
heard great things about that I also
picked up the NYX HD focus soft focus
concealer yeah it is in the shade affair
or CW 0 2 and
is supposedly it do for the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer let me know if you
guys want me to do a side-by-side
comparison between the two and I have
been trying out the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer over two kbreeze at least
set that over to me through octal II and
I really do like it but if there is a
dupe for it that has half the price that
would be amazing and I would purchase
this one instead so definitely gonna try
add that out up next I did pick up two
at different foundations now I would
like to do first impressions on these
guys recently I have gotten away from
doing first impressions because a lot of
first impressions are useless unless you
have a follow-up and I was finding that
I wasn't having enough time to do
follow-ups on or I was do filming
different videos instead of follow-up so
anyway I definitely want to get back
into foundation first impressions
because for me personally my skin type
has changed a lot and I know a lot of
you want to know what foundations work
for me now I'm definitely a little more
on the dry side I don't have as many
breakouts I'm not as oily so I thought
we would try these out together the
first one is the it cosmetics bye bye
lines foundation it says anti-aging skin
smoothing invisible coverage and drops
of light optical blurring technology I
got the shade light and this is what it
looks like super super cheap packaging
you guys it's like plastic very very
cheap but I feel like this will be a
pretty good shade match for me so I'm
excited for that and then I also did
pick this guy up from uLTA Beauty this
is the HD soft focus liquid foundation
it was on sale for four
ninety-nine which is really really cheap
and I just thought it would be
interesting to try out and it does have
let's see here a physical sunblock which
is great I prefer titanium dioxide and
zinc oxide over you know oxy been
delayed or whatever the it's called
I can't do chemical sunscreens but if
this is the HD a soft focus liquid
foundation like I said natural finish
paraben free oil-free the shade that I
have here is called light cool so I
guess let me know if you would like a
first impressions on that
alright guys moving on we have an item
that I did pick up from the Ulta 21 days
of beauty event this is the Mario
Badescu enzyme cleansing a gel now this
is made for all sorts of different skin
types but I remember using this the back
when I was in college and is exclusively
used at Mario Badescu products and this
doesn't really have like foaming
features to it but does have alpha
hydroxy acids in it and originally I
would like I don't really know if I need
that for my skin now that it's a little
more dry but let
I've been having a lot of buildup of
blackheads I did have a little bit of a
severe break out probably about a week
or two ago if you go out to my
livestream than I did about a week ago I
tried to show you guys up close um I was
having a lot of big painful sits is like
hormonal area so definitely along my jaw
line and things like that and that's
just from birth control and all that
kind of stuff I talked about that on my
snapchat but yeah I thought that this
would be interesting to try out because
AJ's are really good at exfoliating the
skin so it will really help to kind of
bring that debris out I guess you could
say and I really want to make sure that
I can clear up those blackheads so I did
pick this guy up and it was only eight
dollars which is a great deal for eight
fluid ounces and then I need a new a
cleansing oil or I was running low on
cleansing oil recently I picked up some
burpees
makeup remover cloths as well as I
makeup remover things I'm just not into
the makeup remover class anymore I feel
like I am one of those people that pulls
too much on my skin so I prefer
cleansing oils now originally I was just
gonna get my Burt's Bees cleansing oil
with argan oil as well as coconut oil
one of my favorites but instead I
thought I would try out the bare
minerals oil obsessed total cleansing
oil it is a delicate blend of bilberry
borage cucumber and sunflower oil plus a
mineral rich sea salts for all skin
types so I thought I'd drag this out I
will have any follow up haul for you
guys exactly a week from today to let
you know how this worked yeah pick those
babies up I also did pick up two more of
my all-time favorite powders or my
second all-time favorite powders I
should say you guys know I love my ELF
tone correcting powder and goldimouse
but I do adore at my essence all about
Matt fixing compact powders as well and
these are 399 on the auto comm website
they are fantastic I really enjoy those
so I picked up two more notes and then
another item that I got during the 21
days of beauty event is the over a
highlighter initiated blissful also and
this is what it looks like I hate the
packaging on over products I feel like
it's really really crappy for what they
are inside and especially like the price
these are pretty high in price but if
these were on sale for around $16 apiece
I do have room Deo Drive and it's a
beautiful powder highlight I feel like
I'm really really into make Chalet
highlights and things like that but this
is a gorgeous formula and look at this
colors just this just gorgeous so let's
go ahead and swatch it I am noticing
maybe there's a little more glitter in
this one then Rodeo Drive but I just
that's gonna be absolutely stunning on
the skin I would say it's like a silver
rose gold sort of color you might be
thinking lip that looks way too dark for
you but I feel like I'll be able to pull
it off we'll see how it goes so anyway
it did pick up blissful really really
hope that I like that I already know I
love the formula and then finally guys I
did pick up a new a primer and I think I
will go ahead and use this primer when I
do of my first impressions with these
foundations this is the new NYX hydro
touch primer actually it's not
necessarily new but it's new to me this
is supposed to be a dupe for the
smashbox hydrating the primary for
Jessica Braun or Jimmy 89 talking about
it and this is what it looks like it
comes in a squeezy tube and I'm super
excited to try it out like I said it has
been more normal to dry so hopefully
that will work for me but yeah anyway
guys that is it for my Ulta haul I hope
you enjoyed this video like I said a
week from today I will go ahead and
happy person impressions follow-up for
you guys or just kind of like a follow
up hull which I like to do on my channel
but yeah that's it thanks for joining me
again and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
