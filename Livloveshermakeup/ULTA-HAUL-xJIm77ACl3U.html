thank you so much for joining me as you
can probably tell i have already started
swatching things this is going to be a
quick alter hall and i started recording
this and then I realized halfway through
that it wasn't recording so we are
trying again the second time and I do
already have the swatches that I will
walk you guys through the products that
i swatched and yeah so I placed an order
on the Alta com website for some skin
care and also make up and yeah let's
just get right into it so the first two
things I had picked up that I already
swatched are the palladium crushed of
metallic eye shadows I've heard really
good things about these they feel very
similar to the knicks prismatic I
shadows there are very very good quality
I think there are about 399 or 499 a
piece on the Alta calm website so they
are botanical and vitamin-infused and
the first shade i got is called eclipse
and it's a beautiful kind of copper
shade I thought this would just be
gorgeous during the summer time and I
have that swatched right there so
they're really beautiful they kind of go
on like a foiled I shadow they're just
absolutely stunning and then the second
one that I picked up kind of matches my
nails today this is the shade is xenon
this one is not nearly as pigmented but
it still was very very buttery it's kind
of like a dirty green yellow shade and I
have that once washed right there so
yeah I picked those two up and then I
also picked up two other different eye
shadow singles these are the Catrice
cosmetics liquid metal I shadows these
don't feel very buttery whatsoever i
found out that they have an overspray
over them at which I don't like but I
did swatch them right here so this one
is called 100 what do you see I just
thought they look so pretty they have a
wonderful texture to them but they do
have an overspray so there is what do
you see however they are ultra ultra
pigmented so I do like that and then the
second one is kind of a champagne II
white color this is 010 look me in the
ice so that is what it looks like and I
have that once watched right they're not
nearly as pigmented as well what do you
see but still pretty good if I were to
choose another
I shadow single I would go with the
palladia ones and not the Catrice
cosmetics ones alright the next thing I
picked up was another tub of my rock
daily resurfacing disk I use these red
I'm used these cities I use these as the
second parts of my makeup removal at
night time so I'll remove my makeup with
like you know whatever makeup remover I
want to use whether it be wipes or my
makeup eraser or oils whatever my bosha
makeup breakup cool cleansing oil and
then I will go in with one of these they
have a textured side and then a softer
side so you can cleanse your skin or you
can exfoliate your skin I will go over
my eye area with these everywhere and
then I rinse my face and I just love
them they take off all the excess makeup
which there really isn't a lot of
depending on what kind of makeup remover
I use but really really awesome and I
feel like they do kind of help to even
out the texture in your skin so I love
those the next thing I picked up was a
palladium matte blush I already own two
of these but I wanted to get this shade
for the summer time this particular one
is called toasted apricot and I did
swatch it it is squashed right there
hopefully you guys can see it's a
beautiful just kind of toasty to apricot
a sort of shade I thought it would be
gorgeous during the summertime and those
palladium at blushes are amazing they're
very creamy a very blendable very
pigmented and I love them all right and
then I picked up at this Ecotools makeup
brush shampoo it says it deeply cleanses
your makeup brushes dermatologist tested
and hypoallergenic the reason that I
picked this up it was because I have
been deep cleansing my makeup brushes
every single night I have heard from a
lot of people that that's not good for
your makeup brushes for the bristles
however I have had no issues and I don't
know I've just gotten into the habit of
deep cleaning them every single night so
I thought I would try this out and
speaking of cleaning your brushes
sponges i also picked up another Real
Techniques deep cleansing gel I love
this for cleaning any sort of little
SpongeBob's I have like
my beauty blender or my Real Techniques
sponge this cleans them so well so I
picked that up and then I also picked up
two of my essence all about match-fixing
compact powders I got two more of these
I purchased these all the time I believe
there are 2 99 or 399 a piece on the
altar dot-com website they leave your
face completely am at I need to put some
on after this because it is so hot in
this beauty room right now and it's so
hot outside and I'm just thinking about
how crazy it's going to be trying this
summer time if it's already literally
like 60 degrees here it's going to be
hot this summer right uh-huh but anyway
this is what it looks like it's just a
matte compact fixing powder and it just
leaves your face completely mad it does
leave a little bit of a white cast even
on my skin tone so if you have darker
skin just be aware of that maybe use a
really really fluffy brush instead of
something this super densely packed
alright so I got all of those and then I
also picked up two of the where are they
all right two of the jcat beauty powder
blushes i'm so sad i already swatched
this one because they had the cutest
little overspray in it of a kitty but
these are really really cheap packaging
however they're beautiful so these are
the lovestruck blushes in the shade 103
coral dumpling and 105 pumpkins so this
is what they look like I've not swatched
pumpkin yet this is what they look like
they have a cute little kitty embossed
on them they do have a little bit of an
over spray but nothing terrible and they
just feel so buttery and smooth you guys
and I believe these are 3 99 or 499
apiece so I'm really interested in this
Jake a beauty line now so right there we
have pumpkin super pigmented and creamy
and the right there we have coral
dumplings so really really beautiful
colors they are super super powdery you
guys can see they do kick up a lot of
product but they are beautiful and here
is coral dumplings you guys can see so
really beautiful blushes very excited to
play with those the two of them are
squashed right there all right and then
the last three things that I picked up
were some new tree hotshame sugar scrubs
they came out with 3 vo sense and I
could not resist
guys no these are my favorite or this
particular like formulation is my
favorite body scrub ever they don't
leave your skin oily they don't over
exfoliating solely eight they really are
just the perfect exfoliating scrub and
they're very very cheap they're like 599
or 699 a piece at Ulta so the first new
sense that they came out with is lychee
and plum and this one is definitely my
favorite so far it's like a beautiful
purple color and it smells amazing like
absolutely amazing i love the smell of
lychee i love the taste of lychee this
smells more like plum but i love the
taste of lychee little side note um my
boyfriend's mom every time she goes into
Chinatown she picks up like three pounds
of lychee and she will literally FedEx
it to me so I could eat it so I love
that really really good it smells
amazing and then the second one that is
new is the marula and jasmine this is
what it looks like it I got it because I
thought oh my god it's going to smell
just like jasmine it doesn't smell that
much like jasmine more so like marula
oil but really really smells nice and
I'm excited that they came out with new
sense I've been waiting for them to do
that for a while and then the last one
is Moroccan rose look at that beautiful
color isn't that gorgeous and this one
smells good it doesn't smell exactly
like rose I wish it smelled more so like
rose but really really good and look at
that beautiful color so yeah I'm so
excited to try those new ones out I just
love the formulation on the shade sugar
scrubs they're just amazing tree hut did
an amazing job and yeah so that is my
little alcohol I hope you guys enjoyed
this video sorry that I couldn't watch
these with you guys in person I
literally started recording and I was
like oh there's no little red red top
blinking I'm not good morning what's
happening so anyway thank you for
joining me guys and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
