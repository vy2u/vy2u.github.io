thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having an awesome day today
i am doing a haul for you guys it is all
skincare and haircare so I'm sorry no
makeup in this one but everything is
from Ulta I ordered from the online
website they're having their like 21
days of hair event right now which is
sort of like they're 21 days of beauty
except for hair care so you can get like
buy one get one fifty percent off on
drugstore and high-end brands or buy one
get two free buy one get one free 24 24
great great deals and i'm mostly stocked
up on shampoo like literally bought
shampoo in bulk for like the next year
so i will show you guys everything that
i purchased and yeah let's just get
started so the first thing i got were
two of the tree hut shake sugar scrubs i
got different sense this time ones that
i have not tried before but if you don't
know the tree hut brand really really
cheap and cheerful brand that you can
get at the drugstore these were buy one
get one fifty percent off so together
these were twelve dollars they're
normally eight dollars apiece and then
you get one that is fifty percent off so
twelve dollars for both of these which
is a great deal this is a really nice
formula it doesn't leave you greasy
after you get out of the shower which is
sometimes I do like but normally I don't
it's really nice if you're having if
you're having like skin conditions that
are acting up for something like that
because it can really seal in moisture
but most of the time I like to get out
of the shower and just like not feel any
remaining product from my scrub if you
guys know what I mean so anyway I picked
up to a different sense this time I
normally get the tropical mango scent
which is amazing but I picked up the
passion fruit in guava scent which
sounds absolutely amazing and I also
picked up the Hawaiian Kakui which I've
heard smells really really good as well
so yeah those are the first two things i
got like i said buy one get one fifty
percent off definitely go check it out
if you guys like that alright second i
picked up let's see here the Shea
Moisture they were having buy one get
one fifty percent off on this brand as
well so i picked up the raw shea butter
moisture retention shampoo with seek
help and argan oil for dry damaged hair
and also the extra moisture detangler i
really really like this this is a
sulfate-free shampoo but i seem to
really really good results with it I'm
normally someone who does not like a
solvate free shampoo I like something
that really really lathers on my scalp
and this doesn't at all but it really
really leaves my hair silky so I picked
that up and the extra moisture detangler
is really good to you guys can see it's
kind of like a gel formula but it turns
into an oil when you start putting it
through your hair so really really like
that next I picked up from the oh gx
brand or the organics brand or the old
organics brand I guess it can't be
called organics anymore because they
actually didn't have that many organic
ingredients in it but anyway from OGX i
picked up the hydrating argan oil of
morocco body lotion this is really nice
I guess you get thirty percent more in
here for free according to this bottle
but really really nice smells really
good and sinks in immediately so I
really really like that product and then
redken was having 24 24 so twelve
dollars apiece on their shampoos and
just hair care in general so i picked up
the redken sulfate free frizz dismiss
sulfate free shampoo I've never tried
this but I've heard good things and I
also picked up this one I haven't tried
either it's the redken diamond oil
shampoo so I haven't tried that either
heard good things though and then I
picked up another two redken products
that I have tried this is from the all
soft line which is an amazing amazing
really softening line that they have and
this is the all soft heavy cream for dry
brittle hair yeah super treatment for
dry brittle hair and also the shampoo so
this is like a softening shampoo and
then a deep conditioner these are
amazing really really good and
definitely definitely moisturize your
hair and soften it up a lot I picked up
the husk monoi coconut oil moisturizing
and revitalizing nourishing deep
conditioner this was like five dollars
and this is the brand that normally they
have like those little packets that you
like deep conditioning packets and I
always loved those and I literally just
got a sick of like buying the actual
packet so I was so happy to see that
they actually had like a bottle of this
stuff and it smells so good a smell like
really really strongly of coconut so I
like that a lot
I picked up to facial masks of course I
don't need these but Freeman was having
a buy one get one fifty percent off and
these are normally like under five
dollars so basically it was like five
dollars in like two dot fifty cents and
these ones I don't have yet this is the
charcoal and black sugar polishing mask
it's a dual-action purifying mask and
I've heard really really great things
about these this is like their
best-selling one and i also picked up on
the golden grain brightening mask for
dry skin that hydrates and brightens
normally like with skincare i would say
definitely stick to products that are
made for your skin type but when it
comes to masking i use all sorts of
different products yeah all right i
picked up to dry shampoos the Batista or
batiste dry shampoos were on sale buy
one get one fifty percent off as well so
i picked up the one in the sassy and
daring a scent which is the wild sent i
reviewed a trio from them like literally
oh god oh just like hit that on my mouth
probably like a year ago i reviewed a
really cute little trio that they had
they had like this one and two other dry
shampoos in it and i was so happy to see
that they released this scent in like a
full size is it really smelled good yeah
it really really smells good so I like
this one and then this one was newer
this is called these strengths and shine
dry shampoo so I don't know I guess it's
supposed to help like I don't know
supposed to be kind of conditioning I
guess it's supposed to help build
strength and you can see more shine so I
thought I tried that one out it's well
it is new and then the last couple
things I got um so basically the oh gx
brand the one I just talked about the
head like the body lotion um I love that
brand their shampoos and conditioners
literally I can never choose anything
like they have everything their
packaging gets me every time it all
looks so pretty they claimed so many
things like on the front that they have
all these wonderful like oils and things
in them and honestly I have tried their
shampoos before I really like them I
feel like with OGX you at you either
really really love the brand and it
really works for your hair or it really
doesn't work for your hair
um and so I decided like I could not
pick like it's hard because I wanted to
get like five full sizes of their
shampoos but honestly it takes forever
to get through shampoo and things like
that and I was just like oh I don't want
to narrow down to one or two so they
have these like smaller sizes that were
like I think three dollars and I just
thought it would be a great way to try
out a few of them to see which one works
the best for my hair tight basically so
I or just see which one I want to pick
up in full size so the first one I got
is the nourishing coconut milk shampoo
and it looks like that and I think they
have such cute packaging and I just love
that they put everything on the front
because it makes me want to use it it
says indulge your senses with this is
exclusive blend of coconut milk to
nourish your hair while ultra whipped
egg white proteins add strength and
elasticity along with weightless coconut
oils to add hydration and balance like
that like soul like I love that that all
sounds so good and you know it sounds
really good so yeah anyway I got a small
size of that one again these were like
three or four dollars i think and then I
got to the renewing argan oil of Morocco
shampoo that one I got the thick and
full biotin in college and shampoo I
think I got all of the small little mini
ones that they had and these are
actually not that small and mini like
they have three fluid ounces in them and
then the last one I got was the
weightless hydration coconut water of
shampoo which looks like that so anyway
that was my oh let me show you guys I
guess there's like a little pamphlet for
Catrice cosmetics have you guys tried
this brand I've not tried this I want to
try their stuff and then let's see
you're a little coat cops healthier
sunscreen blemish-free sunscreen sample
but anyway that is everything that I got
from Ulta during their 21 days of hair
or hair Palooza whatever the event is
that's going on right now I believe it
is in stores and online so if you guys
want to you know pick up some of this
stuff all of this was under a hundred
dollars which i think is really great
because I got high end stuff I got you
know drugstore brand and I just got so
much like shampoo literally it's gonna
last me like the next two years no more
buying shampoo for me but
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll see you my next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
