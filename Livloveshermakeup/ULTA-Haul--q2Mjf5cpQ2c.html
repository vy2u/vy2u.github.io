have an Ulta haul for you guys I'm just
going to go through this
I remembered for like the first time in
Everett receipts so I have that I will
tell you guys all the patience of
everything
which I know somebody asked me to do in
my haul video is usually the only reason
I don't is because I tossed the receipt
right away or I leave it in my purse or
something like that but I do have it
this time so I'm just going to go
through everything and all I guess start
at the top and just go through it so the
first thing I got and let me pull it up
as it is listed here on the actual
receipt the first thing I thought is the
Tarte Park Avenue princess contour
palette and this was $34 it looks like
this I got this at the checkout area I'm
at Ulta and it was sitting there and
there was one that was like $24 and the
other one was 34 and of course I ended
up liking the one that was 34 go figure
um but it looks like this it's just a
little cute palette like this and you
open it up and inside you get the park
app princess bronzer you get a blush in
the color posh and a highlighter in the
color champagne gold so those are the
colors you get I did swatch them already
they're super super creamy and lustrous
and beautiful I think I'm really really
gonna like this the other one that they
had it just had a darker blush color but
I really liked this blush color so I
didn't get the other one but the other
one is you know ten dollars cheaper or
on sale right now at Auto so definitely
check that out if you guys can but I
just thought this was really really nice
and compact and I will be doing a full
review on this when I get a chance all
right let's see here next on the receipt
is the lorac party talent yes so we
rocked our new palette I also got this
at checkout I thought it was such cute
packaging this is only $24 right yes $24
at Alta and inside you just get some
amazing amazing shadows they're so cute
so first of all let's just talk about
this packaging look at that look how
sparkly oh my gosh I love that and the
reason that looks like that on the
outside is because on the inside it
continues that really really sparkly
glittery
concept so really really fun I did
swatch a few of these already they feel
nice and creamy really pigmented so I
will do a separate review with my
thoughts on that the next thing I got
let's see here The Body Shop vitamin E
toner and the reason I got this was
because I'm currently not using a toner
and this was on sale let's see here the
price was ten dollars and fourteen cents
and normally it's twelve fifty but you
still get two bucks off but um I just
saw this and it looked nice it looked
right up my alley for how my skin is
acting currently it says the body shop
vitamin E hydrating toner it's
alcohol-free toning liquid with a shot
of vitamin E protection for all skin
types and I just thought that that
sounded really really like luxurious and
not like stripping to the skin so I
thought that would be fun to try and I'm
excited to give it a shot let's see here
the next thing I got was the body shop
tea tree facial wash and I've heard
really really good things about this it
just comes like this it's like a green
gel and the price of this was eight
dollars and ninety three cents which is
like a tub steal so that's really cool
um and it says it is tea tree skin
clearing facial wash suitable for
blemished skin intense daily cleansing
removes impurities for clearer looking
skin and it smells exactly like tea tree
oil I did take a little bit ha and I'm
really excited to use this I like gel
formulas of cleansers so once I'm done
using the current times are amusing
which is the ROC resurfacing discs which
I really do like but I like to switch up
my cleansers and scrub since you use
them for such a long time you can't get
bored of them so I'm excited to try that
one out let's see here the next thing on
my little receipt is the Freeman avocado
and oatmeal
clay mask this was just one of those
little single-use packets this is what
I've been using I like this kind of form
I guess what I've been using when I've
been traveling just because you don't
want to take whole masks with you it's
easier to just take like this
just little dangers of this can dip is
not a container this is just you know
little envelope of this I'm calling it
enough look so it's easier to just
travel with this than to take you know a
big like huge thing of I don't know like
the mint julep mask or whatever you know
like that's not very travel friendly so
I've been using those and that was only
let's see here one dollar 61 cents the
next thing I got was the Marc Anthony
what is that oh yes okay these are these
sorry these are the treatment mask these
are for hair I've been picking these out
lately because I'm absolutely obsessed
with them and I love that so basically I
got two of these and you guys have
probably seen these in previous hauls
the past couple of weeks this is the
Marc Anthony hydrating coconut oil shea
butter treatment and then I also picked
up one other that I haven't tried yet
and that is the repairing macadamia oil
deep healing conditioning treatment so
these are really easy to travel with to
time traveling they're very good for
that and those were each one dollar and
sixty one cents so yes I'm sorry two
dollars and 86 cents yes two dollars and
eighty success the next thing was one
dollar 61 cents and that was a another
face mask this is the green tea peel off
it looks like this you can just find
these at the drugstore at Ulta and like
I said they're easy to travel with and
easy to use so I picked that up the next
thing I got let's see here do alpha
hydroxy retinol cream which was $9 and
30 cents
$9.50 it looks like this it says retinol
rescue topical vitamins a c e
anti-wrinkle and I've heard really good
things about this it just comes in a
little squeaky - I'll show you ice looks
like this and it just is you know just a
typical retinol product and
I think I'm going to start it off and
use it every other day just to make sure
I don't get too sensitive
I get pretty sensitive to retinol so I
want to be careful but um I thought I'd
give this a go since I got really really
good reviews on makeup alley um let's
see here the next thing I picked up was
the L'Oreal age perfect new glow okay it
doesn't say the whole thing on here but
this was twenty dollars and thirty cents
and I'll show you guys what it is this
is the L'Oreal age perfect glow renewal
facial oil treatment it looks like this
you open it up and you get this little
bottle of goodness it looks like this
it's a nice glass bottle and it comes
from dropper form and this is just a
facial oil so basically after you apply
your serum in the morning but first you
want to apply your toner I plan on using
tomorrow the vitamin E toner then I'm
going to apply it my my serum which is
the Estee Lauder advanced night repair
and then I plan on putting this on top
as my moisturizer this is the L'Oreal
age perfect low renewal so it says apply
for to five drops onto the palm of hand
small dots one to cleanse skin blah blah
blah blah so I plan to use this as a
moisturizer I'll let you guys know what
I think I've heard pretty good things
and like I said that was twenty dollars
and thirty cents and the next thing I
got was the Too Faced melted lipstick in
melted candy this was $21 this is my
first liquefied or liquid uh melted lip
gloss from Too Faced I know these are so
popular I don't know why I have to
picked a few of them up when I was
looking at the shades I could not even
decide which one I wanted but I opted
for this beautiful like fuchsia wine
it's like I said melted candy it looks
like this really really excited to use
this heard really really good things
about this so I'm sure if I love the
formula I will go back and try a few
other colors um and let's see here the
last thing I got was the body shop BB
cream tea tree oil it's weird like on
the receipt you know it always does like
it says BB CRM tea tree light 40 ml so
this was seventeen dollars and twenty
which is kind of pricey for the sides of
this product it looks like this this is
a biggie cream but the color really
looks like it was going to match my skin
and not look orange and that gets me
every time and also it says you know
it's got tea tree oil in it so it's
gonna help to prevent any blemishes
maybe when it's like your time month or
whatever you could use this
that's probably what I'll be using it
but it says tea tree flawless BB cream
suitable for blemished skin instantly
spotless looking skin and this shade is
0-1 so I'm excited to try this out like
I said it is a little pricey for a BB
cream what was it again 17 dollars and
20 cents yeah so a little pricey for a
BB cream but if it works really well
then you know hopefully it'll be worth
it so anyway that was my Ulta haul I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
