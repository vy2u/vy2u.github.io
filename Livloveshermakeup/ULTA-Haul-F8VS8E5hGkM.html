have an ulta hall for you guys today
please excuse the lighting I'm in my
boyfriend fashional building mess and
it's kind of late at night so I'm sorry
it's so dark but anyway I have eight
alcoholic you guys I went to Alta and
picked up some goodies I wanted to show
you guys what I got and I guess i will
start with this this is probably the
biggest bunches but i did today this is
the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette I
finally went ahead and purchased this
and I think it's mostly because for a
while I'd really didn't pick this up and
I didn't want it and I think the reason
I went ahead and picked it up with
because the Pantone color of the year is
marsala and I don't know why that really
changed my mind but I just feel like
these colors really really like speak to
that and i just think this is kind of
you know these are the colors that are
in this year so here is a closer look at
some of the colors i think it's really
beautiful I did swatch a few already and
i think that the matte shades are
extremely extremely pigmented and soft i
really love that i also asked watched
trick which was kind of like a shimmery
shade not as soft and picking to it i'm
kind of disappointed but I'm nooner
let's see here anything that's really
not in here really really feels creamy
and soft to the touch so I'm looking
forward to playing with this a little
more and as you can see you get a duel
and did brush which is nice and I think
the colors are really beautiful so I
will play with that two more and i will
do a review and swatches for you guys
once i'm ready to share my full opinion
on it and let's hear the next thing I
picked up was one of the Real Techniques
brushes this is their new one this is
called the sculpting brush and I was
thinking of using this for a foundation
that's kind of like what I hope to use
it for I think it kind of looks like the
expert face brush but um it's more
slanted if you can see the actual brush
is a little more slanted and it's a
little more um you know
just ankle just a little more angled so
I'm excited to try this out i think if
Duncan can use it for foundation and I
will let you guys know what I think
about that the next thing I got with
this little kit of batiste dry shampoos
this is called their batiste dry shampoo
a wild party trio this was only like
eight dollars and you get three little
dry shampoo thin there I thought they
were really cute and I think that they
smell different like different sense I
think they're like just I don't know
they're just really cute i love the but
east brand it's one of my favorite for
dry shampoos so I thought this was
really cute and it was only eight
dollars and it comes in the door of a
little travel pouch so I am looking
forward to using those i'm not sure if i
should use them now or if i should save
them for travel because they are so
travel friendly so not sure yet but I'll
figure that one out the next thing I
have is used era minerals it is the
convertible eyeshadow palette it looks
like this and let me pull it out of here
so I probably should have unpackage some
of this stuff so basically what this is
is a palette and then you get this
little palette at the top so it is
convertible so you get these gorgeous
shades in here and then you can i Jes
pop out all of them and put them into
the convertible one so these are the
shades you get the ready eyeshadow
formula is really really gorgeous i
really like it they're super super
creamy and pigmented and i like the
thought of being able to pop out three
of any color all these pop out of the
tray and then you can use that small
little palette up here and just carry it
with you throughout the day so I thought
that was cute I thought it was worth the
money it was like I don't know maybe
let's see here it's on the packaging
thirty-nine dollars so i thought it was
a quickie oh I don't have a convertible
eyeshadow palette yet so like that I
have to try it the next couple things I
got are basically all hair care I have
gotten really into hair care since i
have been coloring my hair and going
lighter and blonder you probably can't
tell in this lighting but I happen so
I've been really into making sure that
my hair is really full of moisture and
just making sure that I don't get dry
and brittle and damaged so the next
couple of things like eight things are
all hair care products but i'll be happy
to review them separately for you guys
if you'd like so
the first thing i got was from organics
this is the ever straight brazilian
keratin therapy anti-breakage serum I
picked up the coconut milk one and i
love it so i wanted to try this one i
really love the smell of this particular
the brazilian carotene keratin formula
that they have and i really like the
brand organics so I thought this would
be great to pick up it has a really nice
like coconutty smell and I'm excited to
try that out the next thing I got was
from another brand that I really love
the Shea Moisture line I really really
love this brand it is just really
natural they're really into just good
good products for your hair and it's
sulfate free paraben free all that stuff
so this is the Shea Moisture a raw shea
butter extra moisture detangler right
now i'm using a duck detangler the
nourishing oil here which i absolutely
love but i am happy to switch up once in
a while you know you get sick of using
the same thing over and over so i am
happy to switch up and this is the 1 i'm
going to try next it is with seek help
and argan oil it says it's for dry
damaged hair and it helps heal
strengthen and grow the hair so I'm
excited to use this it almost looks like
you click a gel and it doesn't come in a
spray so I'm guessing that you just pump
it into your hand and then work it
through and it should help with
detangling and also softening so I
definitely like that but it's an extra
moisture on there that's always nice and
a detangler so I'm excited to try that
out the next thing I got were three of
these Marc Anthony deep treatment masks
I picked up probably two of them the
other day when I did my other Paul and I
loved one of them the one I loved the
most was this hydrating coconut oil one
with shea butter so this is the marc
anthony hydrating coconut oil with shea
butter sulfate-free deep nourishing
conditioning treatment I didn't like the
Morocco one as much the Morocco argan
oil one smell just kind of not as great
and it honestly didn't really hydrate my
hair the way this one did I used this
one last night and I loved it so I went
ahead and picked up three of these I am
going
just I know I'm going to love them just
use them up I'm wondering if I can buy
these in like a box I love them and I
wish they actually had them in like a
tub formula or like a bottle of course
they didn't when I look today they just
come in separate satchels but I'm happy
to buy them that way I actually really
really like them so the next thing I
picked up was this L'Oreal of luminous
miss manga black angel mascara I just
haven't tried this yet and I'm super
cute packaging and a lot of people talk
about it say it's really good so I got
to be I didn't want to get the water /
formula because i saw on make a valley
the battle got really really bad reviews
is probably hard to remove so I just
went with the regular formula 386 extra
black black angel so excited to try this
out i will try it tomorrow and if you
guys are interested i can definitely do
a review on that and the next thing I
picked up was also from Shea Moisture
this is the raw shea butter extra
moisture transitioning milk i was
thinking i can use these two together I
kind of like using brands together
because I feel like they work really
well if you use them in combination with
each other I love the shea moisture what
is it the extra moisture retention
shampoo so I'm thinking that when i use
these two i will also use the shampoo
that goes with them but this is the
extra moisture transitioning milk with
seek help and argan oil it helps dry
damaged hair and it helped it says it
helps heal strengthen and grow so um I'm
just excited to use this I think after I
use that detangler I can put this in as
my leave in conditioner so excited to
try that out I also really love the
biotin and thickening one from that line
machine ways to actually brought that on
my trips so I love that one so I know
I'm gonna love this and I think it's so
worth it these are like 8 fluid ounces
and it takes you forever to get through
these so really really excited to try
this out the next thing I picked up
let's see here is this healthy sexy hair
soy try we'd leave in conditioner I saw
this at the front of Alta it was at the
checkout and I remember seeing really
good reviews on this it is basically
just a leave-in conditioner that you
spray all over dhampir once you get out
of the shower and I've just heard really
really good things so I thought I'd try
it out if I'm really trying to get my
hair in a good place now especially
because my hair will be lighter and I
actually have a hair appointment on
Tuesday I'm going to get full full on
highlights everywhere on top of the
coloring I've already down myself so I
think it's really important to just keep
it healthy at this point because I want
to keep the link so i will try this out
also with all my other hair products
that i picked up so I'm excited for that
I got that one just in the mini size the
next thing I picked up was also like
mini it's not many sides it's like a
travel size I guess so this is the Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion this is
the anti-aging formula I have not tried
the anti-aging formula and I thought
this was a nice little trial size it was
only twelve dollars for those which I
thought was a great deal so I'm going to
try that out see how it works i heard
that is just a lower moisturizing which
can be nice during the wintertime so as
long as i have that same like staying
power as the original one i'm gonna be
happy with it so uh let's see next I got
one of these mix I and eyebrow pencils
in white I just needed a white eyeliner
pencil I've gotten kind of stick of
using my Laura Geller I brightener one
that had like a banana color to it I
just want sometimes you just want a
really really white one that's going to
make your eyes just to pee really open
and dolly and key so I pick that up I
have not tried this yet any of those
eyeliner pencils they usually get the
wet and wild one so hopefully that works
as well in my waterline and will stay
there all day and looky here it just
last day you bless it the last thing i
got was also from the organics line this
is the renewing argan oil of morocco
penetrating oil and this is in the
little like trial size this is just a
penetrating oil that you apply to damp
here again i just thought that you know
these kind of things are good to use
even in combination since this is a
serum and this is an oil you can use
them together and like i said i really
really enjoy the organics
and so I'm excited to try this one out
see if it's as good as their serums
because I do love the coconut one so far
and i think i'm going to love the
brazilian keratin at therapy ones but
we'll see it smells really really
luxurious and fresh and nice so i'm very
very excited it says it is a unique
precious blend of argan oil of morocco
which instantly kind of traits the hair
shaft restoring shine and softness while
strengthening and creating soft
seductive silky perfection so that's a
lot of claim right those are not a lot
of claims so I will definitely use this
and I'll let you guys know maybe in
future videos I'll just let you know
what I'm doing with my hair and what's
been working so definitely excited to
try that again this is was just one of
those little sample sizes that I saw at
checkout and I thought you know what the
heck I've gained so much hair south-
I'll get that too okay so anyway that
was my alter hall I hope you guys
enjoyed this um leaving a comment below
and let me know if there are any
products that you saw today that you
would like to see more in-depth review
of I'd be happy to do that and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
