hope you guys are having a wonderful day
I wanted to come on here and share a
makeup haul with you guys I ordered only
make up from ulta.com so I have a few
things I wanted to share with you guys
some high-end some drug store things
like that i'm going to swatch with you
guys as i go through them excuse me if I
kind of going like this throughout the
video I seem to have a really runny nose
today I think I woke up with a bit of a
head cold because i also have a sore
throat so i'm like really hoping keeping
my fingers crossed that I'm not sick but
if you see me wiping my nose it's
because I have a runny one so anyway I'm
trying to get all the nose blowing out
of the way before I started this but um
let's just jump right into this um like
I said I got some drug store items and
also some high-end and most of the stuff
i found was actually in the sale
department I don't know why I did
quotation marks um but I love shopping
online and just going straight to the
sale section on like any kind of website
basically i think these get more bang
for your buck and I just like having
more makeup than less makeup so anyway
let's just get started the first two
things I picked up were the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi powder glow illuminator blush
plus highlights these are just
highlighters and they look like this I
bought to the first one I got is um in n
202 and it's called rose and this one is
supposed to be for neutral skin tones
and i also got to be one in c 302 which
is ice and this is supposed to be for
cool undertones of course you can get
any a kind that you want um it can be
hard to kind of determine what your
undertone is I'm still trying to figure
out mine a lot of people say it's cool
but sometimes I find that I'm a little
bit warmer it's very difficult that um
but anyway I think these up I've heard
good things and I've heard bad things so
of course I want to try them out myself
and see what I think there was also
another shade and it was for warm skin
tones you can get any of them it doesn't
matter but um it was more of like a
golden e1 and it looked like it was
going to be a little bit too dark like
as a highlight for my skin tone I think
it looked like it could actually
maybe possibly be a like bronze color on
my skin now that is just from looking at
the website it could be completely
different in person but anyway these
were the two that I got because I
thought they would complement my skin
tone well so the first one like i said
is ice and can we just take a moment
look at that beautiful packaging the
rose gold I love that but anyway this is
what ice looks like so super super I see
it does come with the little brushes in
the back um so I'm going to swatch this
i'm just going to swirl it around in all
of the colors and it looks like it's
very very icy looking so hopefully you
guys can see that that is ice you guys
see that vicious watch a little higher
so that shade right there is ice I think
it looks very very nice i think will be
good on my skin tone um i'm going to be
using this micellar water to take off my
swatches I hate this micellar water so
i'm trying to find any way to use it up
so i'll use it for swatches today but
anyway so yeah that looks very very like
icy and very very silvery hopefully it
will be nice on my skin tone does look
like it kicks up like a lot of products
so hopefully that won't be an issue but
i'm excited to try that out and let's
watch the rows one this is what Rose
looks like so it got a little more pinky
tones in it I think this one might look
better on my skin not sure though so oh
I can't even see where I swatch the
other one so this is rose hope you guys
can see these you know what let's do it
on the other arm I can't see it through
the viewfinder so I don't know if you
guys can see it it might pick up on
camera but you never know and I just do
it on my hand so that is rose very very
pretty and let me swatch ice on my hand
just making sure you guys can see it and
this is ice so they're both very very
nice hopefully they will be you know
very pretty on the skin tone the ice
colors a lot more cool toned obviously
and the rose color has a little more
pink in it um they both seem like they
have a little bit of like I said kick up
like kind of powdery but we shall try
that out and see
uh yeah yeah stay updated I will film a
follow-up hall for this video so that's
kind of a new series that i started i
don't know if you guys saw my other one
but after I hall um you know products
i'm gonna start doing follow-up Paul's
not so much for like a bath and body
works and like you know clothing things
but really just like makeup like Sephora
all tests stuff like that I think is in
skincare you know things like that are
definitely worth um doing a follow up
video on and kind of telling you guys
what I think of them and all that kind
of stuff so that follow-up hall will be
up in a few days maybe a week I like to
give myself a good amount of time before
I can kind of share with you guys what I
think of them so anyway those were the
first two products i got and then the
next your products i picked up worthy
maybelline better skin this is the
better skin line this is like a new line
that they came out with i think it
launched first in the UK and I've heard
really really great things so i picked
up the concealer which i've heard great
great things about even better things
than the foundation and the shade i got
was 10 ivory i'm hoping that this will
be an okay skin tone match maybelline
tends to run a little dark this was
their lightest shade that they had on
the website and i believe they have in
line but i will swatch it quickly so we
can kind of see but it says super-state
better skin corrector avec till see so
with act I'll see I don't know what that
is but it is oil freights comes with
this nice little like doe foot
applicator and let's just put it on the
back of my hand I hope it's not too dark
this is the color hopefully you guys can
see that lets blend it in a little bit
and see what the texture is like I've
heard really really good things about
this so with the texture is really
really buttery and soft and it looks
like it's gonna be a pretty good match
for my skin tone so I am excited
actually it looks like it may have come
out even a little lighter which is great
because it's a concealer I like to
brighten up under the ISO really really
excited for that I'm definitely going to
be using that under the eyes I heard it
is comparable to the maybelline fit me
and also the NARS what is the one that
has the wand I don't know what that
one's called um I don't have either of
those
i actually may have the maybelline fit
me but i don't think it's that
remarkable but anyway i hope that i like
this one a lot we will see hold on guys
I feel snot coming on um I hate like
when you have a cold and you keep wiping
your nose and the makeup starts coming
off and it's like what a bummer it's
okay though i am wearing like a CC cream
today so hopefully it's not like a
foundation wiped off but anyway that
seems really really good i'm excited to
try this out seems like it has good
coverage too and i also picked up the
better skin superstay skin transforming
foundation with titanium dioxide
sunscreen which is nice it's a physical
sunscreen with broad-spectrum SPF 15 it
also has the active or a still see
oil-free this is what it looks like I
like that it has a pump really nice
packaging and this shade is actually 15
ivory so in the concealer it's called 10
but ivory and this one is called 15 so
we will see I'm going to pump that out
okay comes out pretty thick you can see
that it doesn't like move anywhere on
the hand let's rub it in and see who it
goes on really nice and smooth but it
doesn't have like a silicone II feel to
it interesting so this is actually
picking up a lot of like a pink
undertone so it's actually kind of
lightening it up a bit lighter than it
looks in the packaging hopefully it
won't oxidize but it looks like I may be
able to pull this off hopefully we will
see so I am excited to try those out i
will definitely give you guys my
thoughts on that um yeah so that's going
to be really really nice I heard that
it's really good for like building up
coverage so you can kind of like apply a
thin layer and then build it up so
you're excited for that okay moving on
we have some higher-end items the first
thing I picked up was the bare minerals
the color compatibles this is a
complementary shades for eyes and cheeks
and this was $39 however I think I got
this for 29 on the website if you go on
to the Alta website look in the sail
area because the prices are even lower
hopefully they still have it but this is
what it looks like and it's supposed to
be eyeshadows and blushes that are like
complem
three for each other so I'm excited so
let's see packaging is super cute it's
like this little box kind of thick
probably not the best for traveling but
really really nice says hello gorgeous
like always for the bareMinerals
products and this is what it looks like
so you get one two three four five six
different eyeshadows I think that's a
brought ya a bronzer and then I think
the one in the middle might be a
highlight it could be a blush on my skin
tone actually probably could be a blush
and then you get another blush on the
other side you get a little dual ended
brush here so it looks like they were
trying to make a face and I brush they
don't feel amazing but a lot of your
minerals brushes don't feel amazing they
feel a little rough but I guess this is
for the blush too small for that and
this is the eye brush I don't know if I
use those maybe I'll find a different
way to use them but anyway so yeah this
is what it looks like holding it upside
down now so I don't blind you guys but
let's just watch some of these so
basically let's see if it came like a
little yeah came in a little pamphlet so
the color compatible show it shows you
three different looks so I guess you are
supposed to use an eyeshadow on the lid
and then one in the crease and then one
of the blushes or yeah I guess that one
in the middle is a blush so I says love
match it's true these shades were made
for each other and they never want to be
apart this formula are this palette
features nine harmonious hughes for eyes
and cheeks expertly paired so you'll
never wonder which shade which shades
where well together in three stunning
color combinations to get ready for any
occasion from dreamy peaches to sell
tree metallics this palette may just be
your style soulmate so anyway it shows
like three different looks you can get
and it seems like it's probably pretty
easy they just recommend you know one
eye shadow on the lid one in the crease
and then one of the cheek colors so I
guess that that one in the middle is
actually this color right here is
actually a cheek color probably wouldn't
be a cheat code for a lot of people but
anyway let's start watching I'm just
going to start with number one which is
called Empress really really buttery
this is a nice like transition sort of
shade
mat completely matte that's picking up
I'm going to be wiping these off as I go
alright so that was Empress number one
they do have a bit of kick up or I mean
fall out number two is called bragging
rights and this is like a gorgeous kind
of coppery shade oh that's pretty oh god
that was bad swatch sorry guys but that
went on really nicely really really
buttery you can see that's like a little
bit of excess but really really pretty
kind of like a coppery buttery sort of
color really really beautiful that went
on without any kind of like um you know
like skipping so that's really great the
next one is called shiver and it's kind
of like a light Lackey color it looks
like it is pretty Matt that is pro it's
not mad at all looks Matt in the
packaging but it's definitely got some
iridescent Stu it so that is really
pretty so far I'm pretty impressed these
are nice I don't know which formula this
is of eyeshadows i know that i love the
what are they like the four-point-oh
formula or the two point oh those are
really nice i don't think these are
those but they do feel nice the next one
is matt it's called priceless it is like
a nice gray color that is what it looks
like very very pretty that one did have
a little bit of skipping it's got tiny
tiny little silver flecks in it very
very pretty though the next one looks
gorgeous it's called hoopla this is
number five it's like a kind of dirty
gold color it's got like a greenish and
um kind of brownish undertone oh that
one went on really nicely very very
pretty kind of blend that out a little
bit very very pigmented this one seems
like it's the same like type as the
coppery color maybe these are like
metallics or something really really
pretty I like that formula and and then
the last I shadow color is called ritzy
it's number six and this one also i
think is going to
nice legs very like a buttery so oh yeah
very nice very very nice a little bit of
fallout but very very nice pigmentation
very pretty color so I really really
like those kind of bronzy shades those
look very very nice to me I keep saying
very nice but those look really good so
far of course we'll have to see how they
go on the eyes but let's swatch so those
were the shadows let's watch the blushes
now number 7 is called the summer fling
and it looks like it is a matte peach I
would say and it feels really really
buttery and soft though that's what it
looks like and let's just put that right
here okay so pretty pretty light and
peachy um but like a very pretty color I
think that would look nice on fair skin
tones it definitely has kind of like a
neutral undertone which I actually like
I think that's quite nice um very nice
for fall ah the next one is called the
five-star treatment and this really
looks like a highlight but they say it's
a cheek color probably wouldn't be on a
lot of skin tones I mean that looks like
a highlight to me but whatever let's put
that on my hand this looks like
highlight I mean I can't imagine putting
that all over your cheek um but I guess
you could highlight with it but very
very pretty it's very nice kind of like
a pinky neutral peachy color and it's
got a lot of silver iridescent to it and
the last one is that bronzer shade right
there and I actually do have this in
another cheek palette from bareMinerals
it's called the high dive and this is
like a really nice matte actually it's
not mad i shouldn't say that this is the
one that's tricky it's got tiny tiny
little flecks of gold shimmer in it but
they almost don't pick up on the skin
but this is a nice one because it's got
like a ready kind of brown color to it
so it picks up it doesn't pick up like a
lot of orange it's more like ready kind
of like you got a sunburn / pan if that
makes sense I have to be very careful
with this shade I remember because i
have used it before it really really
goes on quite dark so i have to use it
quite a light hand in like a really
fluffy brush but very very nice bronzer
shade definitely not for contouring it's
a little warm for that but for the
cheeks it's really pretty and you can't
really pick up the tiny little gold
shimmer flecks in it so anyway that is
the color compatibles cheek and I get
from bareMinerals like I said I pretty
sure this is twenty nine dollars not 39
on the website right now if you go under
the sale items you could also check out
the bare minerals website but um yeah
I'm really excited to play with this i
will give you guys my thoughts on that
in the follow-up hall and the last thing
I picked up was a kit from Smashbox this
was also in the sales part of the
website it says it's forty nine dollars
but I'm pretty sure I got this for 30
yeah 30 something so really really good
deal you get um let's see here one two
three three full sized items and really
the reason I got this was for this
product right here this like color wheel
thing Smashbox release this with um
another one to like i rememba seen on
the Sephora website at the beginning of
summer it was like this beautiful like
mosaic kind of color wheel and they had
like a pinky color and they had this
kind of neutral one and I remember
wanting it so bad but i just never ended
up slurring on it for the money so when
i saw this kit that was on sale and it
is a hundred sixteen dollar value so
really really good I thought oh my gosh
yes that's so worth it to pick it up
because you get all these other products
with it as well so um this was the
product I really wanted it is the fusion
soft lights baked starburst color wheel
it looks like this I think it's so
beautiful this is the full size um look
at it isn't it pretty I think this is so
gorgeous like I said they also had like
a pinky one on the support website but
unfortunately on the Alta website they
did not have like a kit with the pinky
one in it but this was the real reason I
picked it up and I thought it was a much
better value because I got all the other
products with it so swirled all together
that is what it looks like you could use
this as a highlight as like a blush
topper it looks like that so super super
gorgeous I am very excited to play with
this I think it's lovely you
could try and go into each little
section separately but I'm probably just
going to swirl it together and wear it I
think it's gorgeous i'm so excited love
the packaging love the way it looks I
think it's just beautiful yeah so that's
in baked starburst and let's see here
let's see if I can read on the back here
yeah fusion soft legs and baked
starburst that is the full size what
else do you get in here you get a full
size of the photo finish foundation
primer in light which is the oil free
one this is a really nice primer I think
Smashbox makes really great primers that
this one is really nice especially if
you have more oily skin it does make
your makeup lasts like all day it has a
really nice texture I believe this is
the one that doesn't have that kind of
silicone e texture to it and just watch
it right now or kind of feel it on my
skin I have tried a lot of the Smashbox
primers I just don't remember exactly
what this one's like let's see here oh
no so it does kind of have a bit of a
silicon e leixlip to it but it's not
crazy by any means and it really just
kind of mattifies your skin instantly so
really really like that I know that I
already like that product I have used it
before and I do recall that it did
extend my makeup where it says increase
the longevity of foundation and reduce
the appearance of fine lines and pores
while in parting a matte finish apply
over clean moisturized skin so you get a
full size of that a full size of the
baked starburst you also get a full size
of the eyeliner it's the always sharp
waterproof kohl liner in Sumatra this is
like oh by the way this is like one of
the best you know it's like their
best-selling kind of products to it's
like a summer kit but also their best
selling products and I have never tried
this pencil but I've heard really good
things I heard it does stay in the
waterline quite nicely and it's one of
those twist off caps which is kind of
cool so that you don't like ruin the
product so that is what it looks like
I'm going to swatch it on the back of my
hand for you guys really nice just mat
chocolatey brown color so I'm excited to
pop that in my waterline and see if it
wears all day i def
we heard good things about this Sumatra
color and i love that it has that little
cap that goes like this and twists
because a lot of the times you know with
you / tractable you'll have it up and
then you put the lid on and then at
smushes them in a black ah so that's
really cool so you get a full size of
that and then you get a I believe this
is a deluxe size this does not look like
a full size to me this is one of these
Smashbox lip glosses right this is the
be legendary lip gloss in coral een so
yeah I think this is a deluxe size but
again for around thirty dollars you get
you know those three full-size products
and then this is the deluxe size and
then you get another deluxe size so this
is what it looks like the wand is really
nice kind of flat on both sides and then
skinny and that is the color really
really pretty um hopefully it's not too
sticky it does feel a little sticky but
that's okay that's what makes it stay
around all day I'll wear this on a day
where I'm wearing my hair up so it
doesn't get in my face but anyway that
looks really really beautiful I like
that kind of peachy color um yeah so
excited to try that out i'm not sure i
have that already um I know that
Smashbox came out with a kit over the
winter time and I picked up something
and had a lip gloss like that but I
don't know if it's the same color I
don't think so and then the last thing
you get in this kit is also a deluxe I
sample but this will last you a long
time this is the photo finish hydrating
under eye primer so I'm really excited
for this too I just have heard really
really good things about this particular
under eye primer I use the one from elf
and I just kind of thought it was like
adding an extra layer of moisturizer
underneath so hopefully this has a
different consistency it has a bit of
like a pearly pink color so probably be
good for brightening under the eye as
well but like I said this is for under
the eyes so you only need the smallest
amount so this little tiny little sample
deluxe eyes will last you a very long
time so that is what it looks like it
looks like it's quite thick let's rub it
in oh that feels really nice so it's got
a little bit of slip to it I'm which
Smashbox is kind of known for I think
they kind of started the whole silicone
sort of thing but a little bit of slip
to it and it seems like it is a little
bit brightening so um I'm excited for
that because I think that
the elf under eye primer was just like
moisturizing and it's like oh I could
just wear an eye cream or whatever but I
think that this has a little bit of slip
so it will kind of help to camouflage
and you like fine lines kind of help
your concealer to go on smoother so I am
excited to try that also emilynoel83
here on YouTube talks about that product
that product quite often so that is the
Smashbox summer essentials kit like i
said i think i got it for around thirty
dollars so really really good deal for
the three full sizes and then two deluxe
size samples definitely go check out the
sale section of the ulta beauty website
and then the last thing i purchased was
the Urban Decay supersaturated
high-gloss lip color these are on sale
at sephora and also alta for like ten
dollars right now and it says it is a
look my gosh just like choke too
seriously like a bug just flew into my
mouth I'm sorry it'll bug it says the
electric color and this lip pencil
conjures edgy straight off the runway
ilorin seconds so I don't know about
this one because I got a really really
neutral color but they had some really
really outstanding colors on there like
really really poppy like in your face so
it's basically just like a cran and I
got the shade called love child oh my
gosh she drives there's something in my
throat mm-hmm love child so it's really
really nice pinky everyday color and it
does seem to have quite a bit of like
glossy finish to it it's not super super
pigmented like what I expect from a
typical urban decay lip product however
like I said it was ten dollars and
that's like the price that you could go
to the drugstore and get a lipstick or
something from Maybelline so or around
the price range so definitely worth it
for urban decay and I do like that color
um let's see here and then I got some
samples so they gave me after purchasing
these summer essentials kit from
Smashbox you got like a little deluxe
size sample of the Smashbox photo finish
primer water which i do like i really
like this product i have a full size of
this so i'm excited that i have that
little thing because i am running low
they also gave me a little sample
the Porefessional um from benefit always
nice to have those around this is the
perfect size for just hitting right on
like your t-zone area so little tiny
sides of that and then a sample of the
pureology serious color care smooth
perfection cleansing conditioner low
lather for friz prone color treated hair
so I don't like anything that doesn't
lather very well so I don't know if I'll
like this but it has anti fate complex
it is for friz prone hair which mine
does get frizzy and it is for
color-treated hair so I am excited to
try that out i do like pureology and
then they just put some little pamphlets
in here one for shadow of your it's a
little sample and then the Eternity now
from calvin klein maybe boy and girl i'm
not quite sure and then i love reading
this thing i don't know if you guys go
through this i go through this with like
a highlighter and i like literally
highlight things that i want to pick up
oh i got two more samples giorgio armani
see and gucci bamboo love perfume
samples but anyway um this is the
ultimate ii this is like they're 21 days
