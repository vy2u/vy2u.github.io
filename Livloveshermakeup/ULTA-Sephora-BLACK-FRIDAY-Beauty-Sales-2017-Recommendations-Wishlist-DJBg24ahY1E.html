welcome back to my channel today I
wanted to walk you guys through my
recommendations as well as my wish list
for the Ulta a Black Friday events as
well as some of the events at Sephora so
there are tons of sales going on right
now look if you go to the weekly Wow
from Sephora you'll see a bunch of stuff
listed Ulta is gonna be having a bunch
of Black Friday steals and deals
starting I believe at 6 p.m. tomorrow in
the store as well as online there's just
a lot of stuff going on and I really do
like a Black Friday shopping for makeup
I don't actually physically go out I
just like to like black friday shopper
on line usually but I thought I'd go
ahead and share with you guys my
recommendations and wishlist because
there are some pretty damn good steals
and deals going on a lot of stuff under
$10 a lot of stuff under $25 nothing too
expensive so let's go ahead and jump
right into it and I will give you guys
my recommendations and wishlist so the
first item that I want to recommend to
you guys is actually a brush and sponge
kit from Real Techniques this is
normally $19.99 you can get this for
$9.99 tomorrow
it is 50% off it is called the Real
Techniques all about that glow strobing
set you are getting two double ended
brushes in here you are getting a small
little sponge for underneath your eyes
as well as a full-size miracle
complexion sponge and this is a great
deal if you never tried out any of these
synthetic bristle brushes from Real
Techniques they're really really
fantastic in my opinion I love
absolutely love the miracle complexion
sponge it's my all-time favorite sponge
of life so this is definitely something
I would recommend looking into it up and
next you guys and the honest off through
Beverly Hills glow kids in moonchild
Aurora and Sun dipped are $25 that is
40% off a very very good deal you guys
already know I love the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills glow kids if you have a
really fair to light complexion I would
recommend going with the moon child if
you are medium to deep and you love a
colorful highlighting palette I would go
with the Aurora and if you do have a
medium to deep complexion you can't go
wrong with the Sun dipped it's
absolutely stunning so obviously I'm
gonna recommend those to you guys
because you know I love the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills at glow kits up next we
have a little brush set here from it
cosmetics now I personally pick thinking
of picking this up it is only going to
be $15 it's called the it brushes for
alta your face and eye essentials mini 5
piece travel set when I was traveling to
Hawaii a couple of weeks ago I noticed I
don't really have a lot
travel-size brushes now I know some
people are really not into travel-size
brushes I don't really particularly mind
the size of like the handles for brushes
so I was thinking this would be really
really nice for travel I do have one
that was sent to me a while back from
Charlotte Tilbury that I ended up just
not liking at all they were the perfect
size but I didn't like how scratchy and
yucky they were on my face so I was
thinking of going ahead and picking this
up and maybe picking one up for my
friends as well and kind of showing
those as stocking stuffers in my holiday
gift guide for tomorrow because I feel
like this is gonna be a really really
fantastic little set and the it
cosmetics brushes are really good
quality so what am I only recommend you
guys look into that that is currently on
my wish list up next I have another item
here that is on my wish list and another
recommendation for you guys it is going
to be 9 dollars it's from the body shop
it's called the nutty body butter trio
and this is normally $18 and actually
every single product from the body shop
is going to be 40% off tomorrow so
definitely something to look into my
all-time favorite scents from the body
shop if you guys are curious are the tea
tree scent which I don't think they make
it a body butter but look into Satsuma
if you're someone who loves orange and
citrus you are going to love the Satsuma
scent but I really do like their tea
tree line even though my skin is a
little more dry right now as well those
were those products worked really well
as as well as well as well as well but
yeah this is like a little trio of body
butters these are great body butters
they're not as moisturizing as the Josie
Maran Argan
body butters but those ones can be very
very heavy on the skin you know like you
can feel them on the skin these ones
that do sink in really quickly they
smell really good
they're cruelty free and I believe some
of them are vegan so anyway but I highly
recommend you guys check out that set up
next we have the Too Faced better than
sex ultimate mascara sachet this is a
$34 value it's going to be $14 and here
you get the better than sex waterproof
and the better than sex mascara and then
also the mascara melt off now I'm not a
fan of the mascara melt off
I got a full-size at one point and I
showed it in a product sales video I
find it very unhygenic because you're
basically putting the little thing onto
your eyelashes kind of like it's a
mascara wand and it melts away it has
oil on it then you take it and put it
back into the tube so unless you're
actually wiping off the residue every
single time before you put it back into
the bottle you are basically putting
your dirty mascara
little bits back into the bottle which
is very unhygenic in my opinion but
better than sex waterproof is
fantastically better than sex mascara is
fantastic definitely a favorite of mine
so I'd highly recommend you guys check
that out for $14 if you are interested
all right up next I have an item here
that is on my wish list so buxom
recently sent over some PR for me I'm
not loving the mascara I'm actually
wearing it today they sent over a
mascara they also sent over their little
eye shadows but I have to say their eye
photos are really impressing their buxom
is not really a brand that I buy too
much from they kind of bored me a little
bit which would make sense because
they're owned by bare minerals or
they're under the same
what is it parent company as bare
minerals and I just find that that both
those boys kind of Brad me but anyway
long story short I've been loving the
little eyeshadows that they sent and a
lot of people talk about how fantastic
their lip glosses are so there's this
little kit right here called lip exotica
it is a 31 dollar value you're getting
like a new two lipstick as well as a red
lipstick and then one of their little
lip glosses which again I hear such good
things about so this is on my wish list
I think I want to go ahead and try it
out I've never tried a single lip
product from buxton before so I'm gonna
go ahead and check that out up next
let's talk about Becca so I believe
Becca that is going to have 50 or 40%
off their shimmering skin perfectors you
guys know I love me some shimmering skin
perfecter press I recently talked in a
video the other day I talked about how
it's really really sad how expensive
Becca shimmering skin perfecter czar $38
for one highlighter is a lot but if you
can get it to for half off you guys this
is a really good time to go ahead and
pick one up I love lilac geode I love a
moonstone
I love Prosecco pop I've really gotten
into that one lately and champagne pop
is great as well so those are some
shades I would recommend you check out
or like prismatic amethyst actually I
think prismatic amethyst is only at
Sephora check out lilac geo that one is
exclusive to alta it's a beautiful color
but anyway they also have this little
set called the ikonics cheeky glow kit
so if you're not quite sure if you want
to try the press highlight version or
the liquid version you can get two of
these for $15 so you're basically
getting a little sample of the liquid
version and then also a pressed version
or it might be the port version but it's
a nice way to try them out because some
people are not eating to the actual
powder version of the Becca highlighters
they prefer something like this so I
highly recommend you guys look into that
up next we have something that's
definitely on my wish list as well oh my
god
so NYX has obviously been going up in
price I'll be talking about them when I
do my repricing popular makeup products
for the second installment but this is
their lippy countdown advent calendar it
is normally $65 it's gonna be $29.99 you
get 24 different lip products in here
now I'm a huge fan of the NYX lip
products I think they're really really
fantastic especially their glosses as
well as their lipsticks so I kind of
want this I don't feel like I need 24
new lip products but this might be
something I'd give to a friend instead
so that's definitely something I would
check out if you do have a lip lover in
your life like a lip color lover or if
you are one yourself maybe you want to
go ahead and treat yourself to that up
next there are going to be technical or
select mascaras so it looks like it
cosmetics is gonna have some buxom as
well as tarts I personally don't like
tart mascaras they make my eyelashes
fall out every single one of them the
man-eater the gifted mascara the
other one lights camera lashes they all
make my lashes look like but the it
cosmetics one right here is kind of like
a trifecta mascara would highly
recommend you guys check that out or the
buxom one and that one is the rubber
bristle one the one that I have on today
is called like the full and pump or
something like that I'm not loving it
but the other bucks in mascara I think I
have tried before and I did enjoy it
alright guys up next we have another
product here for the lip lover in your
life and this is the ultimate e
collection lip glossary it is a $49
value it's normally $16 it's gonna be
$90 you get 15 different lip Kranz in
here if you're a big fan of the Tarte
lip surgence lip prints you are going to
love these they are very very similar in
my opinion so would highly recommend
that and then up next we have the urban
decay advice liquid lipsticks as well as
the 24/7 glide-on lip pencils these are
on my wish list I want to try out one of
the vice of liquid lipsticks they're
normally 18 they're not going to be $9
and then over here the 24/7 glide-on lip
pencils are normally 20 they're going to
be 10 I have these shades I believe
absolute as well as The Naked 2 and they
are helpful you know they're helpful for
keeping your lip products in place
throughout the day I need to get more
into using a lip liner but yeah I would
definitely recommend those they are on
my wish list and then finally guys we
have another little lip set here from
Smashbox this is the studio to go lips
kit it is a $28 value you are getting it
for $10 which is amazing again would be
a great stocking stuffer you're getting
both sides of a be legendary lipstick
and a beautiful red shade and then you
are getting their insta mattes which is
basically a transformer that you can tap
on to maybe legendary lipstick and it
will make it matte so anyway guys those
are the recommendations I would give you
from Ulta now let's go ahead and jump
into Sephora alright guys moving on to
the picks from Sephora so far as being a
little more coy with their products that
they will be releasing for Black Friday
I'm you have to download the app and
then you can't really see the exact
prices of the product so all of these
are in the 10 to $15 range or the ones
that I wanted to share with you guys
recommend definitely go check out these
Sephora sales section and the weekly
Wow's because there are tons of products
on there that I think you guys would
really enjoy but anyway let's go ahead
and jump right into it and start with
the Tarte precious fix color set now
this includes a deluxe size of the
Amazonian clay at 12 our blush formula
you also get one of the little quench
lipsticks from the rainforest of the sea
line as well as a mini a mascara now I'm
not a big fan of the mascaras but those
a beautiful beautiful rainforest of the
sea lipstick seem very tempting I
recently picked up a kit from the vib
sale still waiting for the other half of
my vib sale order to get in so that's
why I haven't done my haul yet if you
guys are curious but once it does get in
I'll share with you guys and you guys
know I love the Amazonian clay true
formula in the little singles when it
comes to these parts of luscious so this
is definitely something I would
recommend you guys check out up and next
we have a Becca set here and this one is
called the wake up call set and you are
getting a little liquid as shimmering
skin Perfector it's kind of like in the
form group you take it out looks like a
spatula you apply it to the face it's
either in the shade champagne pop or
moonstone I'm pretty darn sure it's
moonstone or it could also be opal it
could be opal because that one's kind of
a best-selling shade but then you're
getting a deluxe size of their first
light priming filter which is really
really nice if you do have more combo to
oily skin so if you're interested in
these products Rebecca would definitely
recommend you guys scoop that one up
alright up next we have another buxom
set here I'm more drawn to the one at
Ulta so I'm not gonna pick this one up
but still if you want a bigger lipstick
this is the bucks impact on the prowl
lips X I believe this one is $10 you do
get one of their little lip polishes aka
their little lip glosses and then you do
get more of like a true deluxe size of
their lipstick
it looks like it's been kind of like an
orange e red color so that one looks
very very pretty and then up next we
have in the Ola Henrickson the truth
clean foaming cleanser and these to your
transformation perfecting moisturizer
and this was called the dashing through
the glow set and is very very cute only
ten dollars if you are interested in
trying some products out from Ola
Hendrickson would highly recommend you
look into that
next we do have the bite of multi sticks
this is a little duo and these look like
beautiful beautiful colors now I know
that the multi says sticks multi sets
multi sticks are supposed to be
something that you can use on your
cheeks as well as your lips I would only
use them on my lips I'm a little worried
to pick this up they are on my wish list
but I'm a little worried to pick them up
because they don't they don't have like
the typical bullet form you know it's
just flat on the top kind of like their
old school a butter lipstick formulas
which I love I have that shade Heather
which is just gorgeous or I used to I
have to declutter it because I went bad
but the flat kind of part I feel like
it's hard to get around the lip line and
I wouldn't use these on my cheeks but
they are on the wish list for now we
shall see it and then finally guys it
cosmetics is releasing the it's your
secret to beautiful skin set it's a $35
value for $15 you get their new miracle
cleansing water as well as a little
deluxe size of I believe it's the secret
sauce moisturizer which I have been
dying to try some this is on my wish
list and picking it up I want to see
what all the hype is about on these new
skin care products from it cosmetics but
yeah and those are my recommendations I
my wish list for all of the little sets
that are coming out for the holiday
season for Black Friday I should say and
probably Cyber Monday all that kind of
stuff I hope you guys enjoyed this video

will see you guys tomorrow for my
