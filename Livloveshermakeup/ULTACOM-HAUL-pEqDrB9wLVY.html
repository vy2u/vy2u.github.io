have an Ulta com haul for you guys today
let's just get started let's open this
baby up first thing I got was this Stila
putting on the glitz lip playset it
looks like this it is beautiful as you
can see you open this top thing up and
you get this cute cute cute little
headband and then you also get this
little like jar thing to hold them in
and you get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Stila lip glazes in different colors so
I thought that that was super cute the
packaging totally caught my eye so the
colors you get are glamour which looks
like this you get let's see here Glory
which looks like that you get glimmer
gleam glisten
glitter
glow and the last one is glint so really
really pretty you get some neutrally
colors neutrally neutral colors and you
also get some nice like darker colors I
think they're beautiful I'm super super
excited to play with them and like I
said I think the package you using
really really cute it's just that little
gold holder and they have little spots
there and then you can actually take
this headband out and wear it but it's
kind of cute on there I'm not quite sure
maybe I want to keep it on there we'll
see alright next I picked up the
Smashbox on the rocks photo op eyeshadow
looks palette it looks like this and I
just loved the way this looked and when
it actually came in the mail I was like
oh my god little babies like it's
amazing it's so big and so beautiful so
let's open it up and take a peek and
like I said the packaging you guys look
at that and it's like quilted it feels
like soft it's beautiful and it opens
like magnetically like that so you get
this little piece of paid like matte
paper what is this like padding to make
sure nothing cracks and then you get all
of the colors but you get the sheet on
top of them that has the actual names
which I never keep because I just don't
like it it always falls out lovely oh
shoot
never mind I thought they had the names
on the back but they don't so maybe I do
need to keep that little sheet in case I
do well I will be doing a review and
tutorial and whatnot well you know
swatches and stuff so anyway let me just
show you guys that is the palette it's
gorgeous it's beautiful it's big I love
it swatches and review will be coming on
that soon whoa every single time I film
a video my cat goes crazy so I'm just
pretend she's not there next I got to be
naked 2 basics palette I've been looking
at this for a while I wasn't sure if I
wanted it and then I realized you know
what I do I want it so I picked it up
and
I love my original you know make it
basics just the naked basics one or
whatever you want to call it and so I
just thought you know nice look at this
one too so it's basically the same
packaging I think this one is like it
looks like that same size I think and
you open it up and these are the colors
I guess these are cooler colors then the
other one is a little more like warm
based but I thought this was beautiful I
really do
I love it so I'm excited to play with
that and the last thing I got was this
lorac okay best packaging ever can we
just take a moment this little lorac
what is this called the royal eyeshadow
collection so it looks like this how
cute is that with the little bow so you
take the bow off and you get four little
palettes here so you get Queen Countess
princess and Duchess and they all have
like little like felt things like
they're like soft so this is Queen and
when you open it up you get these colors
Lily my god my cat is going crazy this
is the color you get for Queen you get
four in each little palette so this one
is more like rosy tones I would say the
second one you get is called countess
and it comes in a green that little felt
like a dark green and this one you get
more like neutrally tones pretty pretty
then you get princess which is probably
my favorite I say these are very like
nice warm tones kind of reminds me of
like what is it the unzipped palette
from lorac so love that very very cute
and the last one you get is Duchess it
matches my shirt and
and it is the blues and the Smokies so
really really gorgeous I'm excited to
play with that little kit and yeah that
is what I got in the Ulta box I hope you
guys enjoy this and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
