have an ulta com hall for you guys today
let's just get started this open this
baby up first thing I got was this Stila
putting on the glitz lip glaze set it
looks like this it is beautiful as you
can see you open this top thing up and
you get this cute cute cute little
headband and then you also get this
little like jar thing hold them in and
you get one two three four five six
seven eight Stila lip glazes in
different colors so I thought that that
was super cute the packaging totally
caught my eye so the colors you get our
um glamour which looks like this you get
let's see here glory which looks like
that you get glimmer gleam glisten
glitter
glow and the last one is glint so really
really pretty you get some neutrally
colors neutrally neutral colors and you
also get some nice like darker colors I
think they're beautiful I'm super super
excited to play with them and like i
said i think the package you use really
really cute it's just that little gold
holder and they have little spots there
and then you can actually take this
headband out and wear it but it's kind
of cute on there i'm not quite sure
maybe I want to keep it on there we'll
see alright next I picked up the
Smashbox on the rocks photo op eyeshadow
luxe palette it looks like this and I
just loved the way this looked and when
it actually came in the mail I was like
oh my god a little bit like it's amazing
it's so big and so beautiful so let's
open it up and take a peek and like i
said the packaging you guys look at that
and it's like quilted it feels like soft
it's beautiful and it opens like
magnetically like that so you get this
little piece of paid like not paper what
is this like padding to make sure
nothing cracks and then you get all of
the colors but you get the sheet on top
of them that has the actual names which
i never keep because i just don't like
it it always falls out lovely oh shoot
nevermind i thought they had the names
on the back but they don't so maybe I do
need to keep that little sheet in case I
do well I will be doing a review and
tutorial and whatnot well you know
swatches and stuff so anyway let me just
show you guys that is the palette it's
gorgeous it's beautiful it's big I love
it swatches and review will be coming on
that soon whoa every single time I film
a video my cat goes crazy so just
pretend she's not there next I got to be
naked to basics palette I've been
looking at this for a while I wasn't
sure if I wanted it and then I realized
you know what I do I want it so I picked
it up and
I love my original uh you know make it
basics just the Naked basics one or
whatever you want to call it and so I
just thought you know nice look at this
one too so it's basically the same
packaging I think this one is like it
looks like that same size i think and
you open it up and these are the colors
i guess these are cooler colors then the
other one is a little more like warm
based but i thought this was beautiful I
really do I love it so I'm excited to
play with that and the last thing i got
was this lorac okay best packaging ever
can we just take a moment this little
lorac what is this called the Royal I
shadow collection so it looks like this
how cute is that with the little bow so
you take the bow out and you get four
little pellets here so you get queen
countess princess and Duchess and they
all have like little like felt things
like they're like soft so this is Queen
and when you open it up you get these
colors Lily my God my cab is going crazy
this is the color you get for Queen you
get four in each little palette so this
one is more like Rosie tones I would say
the second one you get is called
countess and it becomes in a green that
little felt like a dark green and this
one you get more like neutrally tones
pretty pretty then you get princess
which is probably my favorite I say
these are very like nice warm tones kind
of reminds me of like what is it the
unzipped palette from lorac so love that
very very cute and the last one you get
is Dutchess it matches my shirt and my
your names and it is the blues and the
Smokies so really really gorgeous i'm
excited to play with that little kits
and yeah that is what I got in the outer
box I hope you guys enjoyed this and
i'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
