coming at you with an Ulta haul today I
told you guys I had ordered a few things
on their online website and the Box just
came in so let me just start out with
the first thing the first thing I picked
up was from the body shop this was their
$25 little like Christmas what is this
like a little dome of their body butters
I've never tried their body butters and
I thought this was a great way to try
out a few of the flavors I believe they
have shea butter in there the Satsuma
one let me see here
coconut shea butter Moringa strawberry
and Satsuma so I am very very excited to
try these out I have heard great things
about them and it was only 25 dollars I
think it's a great little gift gift idea
too so the next two things I picked up
were from essence this one is called all
about paradise I shadow palette and this
is what it looks like so you got some
really really bright colors there but I
thought they were gorgeous and I love
that middle color right there that kind
of peachy one in the bottom row so I'm
excited to use that I also picked up the
essence all about nude eyeshadows so it
looks like this also very beautiful the
next thing I picked up were two of the
NYX butter lip balms I have not tried
these yet and I've heard really good
things so I got one in red velvet and
the other one in parfait so just a pinky
color and a red color so I'm excited to
see how those work out I'm also from
essence I got two nail polishes one is
this really really coral color and the
other one is a pot well-known a hot pink
it's kind of like a bright pink with
sparkles in it so excited to try those I
also got two eyes shadows from two
single eyeshadows from essence they are
called they're metal glam eyeshadow
this one is in frosted Apple very very
highly shimmery and the second one is in
what's it called coffee to glow so
excited to try those those look like
very holiday II kind of things they kind
of go well with the outfit I'm wearing
today very sparkly um the next brand I
kind of tried out was from what is this
this is profusion I've never seen this
brand before I don't have an Ulta near
me so when I order I have to order
online this is called the Barry bloom
six colors from Bright to vivid and soft
and subtle this is a little runway I
shadow palette I thought this was really
really cute and you guys i swatched some
of these already like I get my fingers
in here these are so creamy these oh my
gosh these are so creamy you can
probably see where I put my finger in
those too so so creamy so pigmented I am
really really excited to try these out
because this was a really really cheap
brand on the website so I am very very
excited for that
I also got another little palette from
them I thought this was really cute it's
purple this is also from profusion it's
called the Neo pearl eyeshadow journal
set and these are what the colors look
like I don't want to blind you at the
mirror and I haven't swatched these ones
yet but if they are anything like the
formula of the other one I know I'm
gonna love them so these are more
purpley kind of bluish colors so really
excited about those that will be a new
brand to me and I like to try out you
know I I love eyeshadow palettes but I
love to try out all different kinds I
like high-end low-end I like to just try
them all out and see how they work
Oh another thing I picked up from
essence was the all about matte fixing
compact powder I've heard a lot of
really great things about this that it's
an amazing setting powder and it really
picks up any oil you have hopefully it
doesn't go on that color I'm just
kidding it definitely doesn't it's
translucent but I've heard some really
good things so hopefully that will suck
up all the oil on my face can't wait to
try it and the next thing I got was the
NYX wicked dreams 24 shadow
palate and I thought this was really
beautiful I'm gonna take these little
things out I don't use these sponge
applicators very often so these are the
colors gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous and if
you know you know anything about NYX you
know that they really do have good
pigmentation hopefully these are nice
and soft and creamy and I can't wait to
try the salad up the next thing I picked
up was the Stila what is this Stila
portrait of a perfect eye palette it
looks like this on the outside I thought
that was really cute and these are the
colors they kind of have those like rosy
rosy tones to them kinda remind me of
like The Naked 3 palette which I don't
own yet but I thought this would be a
nice way to kind of try those tones out
so I'm excited for that it seems really
sleek and easy you can toss it in your
purse just an easy little palette to
carry around and the last thing I got
was the NYX pure decadence butter gloss
set in red velvet tiramisu and devil's
food cake this comes in a little trio
here are the colors and I saw Emily
Noelle 83 on her Beauty broadcast
Express channel reviewed these and she
said this one right here a devil's food
cake is amazing so I can't wait to try
these I love the butter and you know I
love the butter formula the butter
glosses lipsticks so I'm really excited
to try these out I'm definitely really
excited about that color so anyway that
was my Ulta haul I hope you guys enjoyed
this thanks so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
