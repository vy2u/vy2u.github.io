coming at you with an alcohol today I
told you guys I had ordered a few things
on their online website and the box just
gave in so let me just start out with
the first thing the first thing I picked
up was from the body shop this was their
$25 little like Christmas what is this
like a little dome of their body butters
I've never tried their body butters and
I thought this was a great way to try
out a few of the flavors I believe they
have shea butter in there the Satsuma
one um let me see here coconut shea
butter moringa strawberry and Satsuma so
I am very very excited to try these out
I have heard great things about them and
it was only twenty-five dollars I think
it's a great little gift a gift idea too
so the next two things I picked up were
from essence this one is called all
about paradise eyeshadow palette and
this is what it looks like so you got
some really really bright colors there
but I thought they were gorgeous and I
love that middle color right there that
kind of peachy one in the bottom row so
I'm excited to use that I also picked up
the essence all about nude eye shadows
so it looks like this also very
beautiful the next thing I picked up or
two of the NYX butter lip balms I have
not tried these yet and I've heard
really good things so I got one in red
velvet and the other one in parfait so
just a pinky color and a red color so
I'm excited to see how those work out
also from essence I got to nail polishes
one is this really really coral color
and the other one is a pot will no doubt
hot pink it's kind of like a bright pink
with sparkles in it so excited to try
those I also got to I shadows from two
single eyeshadows from essence they are
called their metal glam I shadows this
one is in frosted apple very very highly
shimmery and the second one is in what
they're called coffee to glow so excited
to try those those look like very
holiday econ
they kind of go well with the outfit I'm
wearing today very sparkly and the next
brand I kind of tried out was um from
what is this this is profusion I've
never seen this brand before I don't
have an altar near me so when I order I
have to order online this is called the
Barry bloom six colors from bright too
vivid and soft and settled this is a
little runway eyeshadow palette I
thought this was really really cute and
you guys i swatched some of these
already like I dip my fingers in here
these are so creamy these oh my gosh
these are so creamy you can probably see
where I put my finger in those too so so
creamy so pigmented I am really really
excited to try these out because this
was a really really cheap brand on the
website so i am very very excited for
that i also got another little palette
from them I thought this was really cute
it's purple it says also from profusion
it's called the Neo pearl eyeshadow
journal set and these are what the
colors look like I don't want to blind
you with the mirror and I haven't
swatched these ones yet but if they are
anything like the formula of the other
one I know I'm going to love them so
these are more purpley kind of bluish
colors so really excited about those
that will be a new brand to me and I
like to try out you know I I love I
shadow palettes but I love to try out
all different kinds i like high-end
low-end i like to just try them all out
and see how they work Oh another thing I
picked up from essence was the all about
Matt fixing compact powder I've heard a
lot of really great things about this
that it's an amazing setting powder and
it really picks up any oil you have
hopefully doesn't go on that color
getting it definitely doesn't it's
translucent but um I've heard some
really good things so hopefully that
will suck up all the oil on my face
can't wait to try it and the next thing
i got was the knicks wicked dreams 24
shadow palette and I thought this was
really beautiful i'm going to take these
little things out i don't use these
sponge applicators very often so these
are the colors gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous and if you know you know
anything about Nick's you know that they
really do have good pigmentation
hopefully these are nice and
soft and creamy and I can't wait to try
the salad up the next thing I picked up
was the Stila what is this Stila
portrait of a perfect eye palette it
looks like this on the outside I thought
I was really cute and these are the
colors they kind of have those like
Rosie Rosie tones to them kinda remind
me of like the naked 3 palette which I
don't own yet but I thought this would
be a nice way to kind of try those tones
out so I'm excited for that it seems
really sleek and easy you can toss it in
your purse just an easy little palette
to carry around and the last thing i got
was the knicks pure decadence butter
gloss set um in red velvet tiramisu and
devil's food cake this comes in a little
trio here are the colors and I saw
emilynoel83 on her beauty broadcast
expressed channel reviewed these and she
said this one right here a devil's food
cake is amazing so I can't wait to try
these i love the butter um you know I
love the butter formula the butter
glosses lipsticks so I'm really excited
to try this out i'm definitely really
excited about that color so anyway that
was my alcohol i hope you guys enjoyed
this thanks so much for watching and
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
