thank you so much for joining me for
this video um this is going to be a
boxing video for the lure beauty box for
the month of September's so basically
September 2015 unboxing of these little
beauty box so let's see what's in here
um you know typical usual thing with a
little pamphlet at the top like this and
i will read for you guys about all the
products once i go through them very
nice so it looks like i'm seeing lots of
like skincare sort of things right away
which is great because i've been dealing
with some issues with my skin with
dryness breakouts just like hormonal
stuff so um well that's really only been
in the past week but you know at my
skin's been changing a lot like the past
two weeks have been like whoa so
different like a really really dry skin
really really oily skin very odd but
anyway so hopefully I got the stuff will
help so the first thing I see in here is
the tangle teezer and then i will use
another one of these these are great
this is the original detangling
hairbrush this is what it looks like so
these are those kind of brushes that you
can use like on wet hair to help
detangle your hair i beat Anglia's hair
ever so when i get out of the shower
even in the shower i have light come
through with my conditioner but this is
nice because it's got the short bristles
and the longer bristles and it really
really gets in there I just wish I'd had
a handle but excited for that let's read
about it it says the tangle teezer what
it is a handle this plastic brush really
tangling wet or dry hair how it looks
and feels the spiky disc fits in your
palm and have a pliable plastic bristles
that glide through hair and why we like
it this tool inspires real devotion
models including cara delevingne swear
by it during fashion shows for quick
hair changes beauty editors go just as
nuts it won an alors best of beauty
award for its ability to gently detangle
all hair types even curls which is very
impressive um like a wide tooth comb but
also tame like a good old-fashioned
brush the no handle thing makes it
perfect for the purse too I guess it is
yeah but easier with a handle um even
top pros love this colorful Hedgehog for
a styling to a little very head job
someone said I like that it fits
perfectly into your palm which allows
more control and less tucking so that
that would make the hair snap so that
was said by
else Tommy okay the UC k ET tee okay
okay something um and this is fifteen
dollars so this is legal size i had had
one of these before i think it was this
one or maybe it was like I not profit
this one but I guess this was the
original one day for the first month to
come out with it they're all over and
out but you can get it on Lisa 4.com
website all right very nice I can always
use more of those ok the next thing I'm
so excited about I've been looking for
this everywhere so um if you watch tati
glenn like guru here on youtube i highly
recommend her she's amazing she always
always raised about this pixie um skin
treats flow tonic exfoliating toner and
I swear to you I've gone on to the
website I have gone to multiple multiple
targets I cannot find it and she just
says it's so nice it has like like colic
acid in it really makes your skin look
fresh and she's beautiful skin so um I'm
so happy this is in here so this is the
pic see a glow tonic exfoliating toner
and it says five percent glycolic acid
to accelerate cell renewal I'm sorry
someone someone just looking at my phone
someone texted me and I was an emergency
so five percent like colic acid to
accelerate cell renewal fructose and
syrup Costa to balance in Brighton for
clear skin witch hazel to minimize pores
and alcohol-free and gentle and all skin
types clip clinically proven results so
I'm really really excited for this
cannot wait to try it I mean I've heard
such great things and I could not find
this little piggy anywhere so really
excited for that let's see what they
write about it pixi by petrol glow tonic
what it is an alcohol-free toner what it
does exfoliates and brightens skin key
ingredients are glycolic acid aloe vera
and witch hazel and it says how it looks
feels smells a peach colored liquid it
smells clean almost like classic slope
and only slightly antiseptic why we like
it one of the saddest days for a clean
skin freak is when she learns that too
much soap and astringent strict skin of
the oils and needs and leaves her
feeling her face feeling tight and
perched this toner revised that story it
removes dead skin cells excess oil and
makeup funk that's gotten into your
pores all while allowing you to hang on
to the good stuff that your skin
actually is
even if it sensitive it makes skin
legitimately brighter over time because
it contains five percent flat colic acid
but it's not irritating because the
asset has been personally neutralized by
ammonium hydroxide as for what your skin
feels right away no tightness no flushed
heat just a pleasant cleanliness our
tester um with combination skin looked
brighter the first week of her month of
using it twice twice a day remote twice
a week on her forehead chin and nose our
testers with drying sensitive skin each
notice more radiance and zero redness or
flaking after a light dose all over
every night for two weeks so um for 3.4
ounces for the full size it is fifteen
dollars you can get it at Target or
target com but I'm telling you they're
hard to find alright the next thing I
see here is the caviar anti-aging
replenishing moisture milk it is a
leave-in conditioner through that
pamphlet over there how we should have
done that so it says um yeah it's a
leave-in conditioner it says apply
evenly to clean towel dried hair and
style as desired let's see what they
write about this baby um I'll turn out
replenishing moisture milk a leave-in
deep conditioning spray for hair made
without parabens sulfates or fatal AIDS
what it does hydrates and add shine to
dry brittle hair kien greens are the
dometic own which helps to smooth
glycerin caviar extract and vitamin c c
silk and okay that's why it's the
company called it's damaged repairing
marine botanical blend okay so it's got
like marine extracts he's stuck in it um
it feels looks smells it's clear white
very thick conditioner smells and it
smells like line that's nice different
why we like it a few pumps and even the
most damage or thinned with age hair is
less likely to snap and will dry with a
healthy-looking sheen our editors by our
editors fine highlighted hair drank up a
pea sized block after each shampoo and
even when she added heat protection
spray on top she wound up with a bouncy
blowouts that's nice as this doesn't way
down the hair hopefully um and thick
hair editors like to apply it as a
second conditioner after the rinse out
one which she's going to air dry
doubling up makes her end stick together
one morning the citrusy smell is strong
and lingers you may catch it with and
wonder who's drinking a mojito so 5.1
ounces you get 0.85 in here
thirty dollars this is pretty good size
I make clean about that I'm excited that
it doesn't weigh down fine hair
supposedly alright the next thing I see
is a little bar soap but oh I don't know
if I like that fence interesting but I
think it's for your face so i will try
it i probably wouldn't use this on my
body I only like good smelling stuff but
um this is the ER no Alice a low-loss lo
a fur marine bar soap it's a
moisturizing soap for your face it
cleans and softens your skin it's got
spirulina maxima in it algae extract
essential fatty acids shea butter and
vitamin E and C so I don't know though i
can't help i like or dislike the scent
it's interesting i'll leave it at that
it's interesting um the translucent blue
bar has an expensive smelling beach east
end now i don't know if i would describe
it as that i was there with
smell-o-vision because it's very
interesting i would like to give you
guys a whip it says why we like it
simply getting rid of dirt would be a
little pedestrian for a $45 bar soap
yeah $45 okay wow that's crazy um this
bar contains more than just the usual
fatty acids it's rich it helps reinforce
skin's natural protected lipid layer as
well as Anna kewley annamalai those
sinister little collagen busting free
radicals that collect on your face
throughout the day it says what we
really love about the bar is its
consistency it's actually silky as it
foams and it leaves your skin feeling
smoother and more supple once it's
rinsed away speaking of rinsing there's
a whole video on the company's website
on how to do it the earn alot slow way
um it's a Phyllis think with hot water
dip the bar on the water rub it on your
face and lather with exactly thirty
splashes very specific so you actually
rub this on your thing I don't know I
would do that I contaminate it I don't
know I feel like I would just lather it
up in my hands but maybe it would go so
quickly it is $45 um it says or you
could just rinse the herbs go away in
the showers we did and feel just as nice
and soft and clean so um yeah I don't
know the smell is a little offensive to
me but it's okay i'll be using it on my
face my face washes don't need to sell
amazing not the ones that I
at night and this seems like it's more
of like a treatment one like you know a
scrub the helps you wake up in the
morning so I will try that out I'm
excited alright the next thing I see is
the kaplan md this is cellular
rejuvenating concentrates comes in a
cute little pouch to a fairy pouch and
it looks like it is a little serum which
is great i love triangle stands with a
little baby oh yeah so tiny okay um
let's see here what do they say about to
these nothing oh there we go kaplan md
cellular rejuvenating concentrate it is
an anti-aging serum made without
parabens sulfates petroleum castle
castor oil poke poke them the ones i
call problem yes that's it propenyl
propylene glycol mineral oil pa ba
animal ingredients and no animal testing
so he doesn't put a lot of stuff in here
which is good what it does is fight
sprinkles and increases collagen it has
hyaluronic acid bio fusion 3s which is
the company's combination of anti-aging
plant stem cells juvinity which is the
company's cheeky named for its patches
and antioxidant it has mitrik cyl since
six which is a peptide that stimulates
collagen production at the thin
translucent white to fluid have a faint
atmos sent that's really a lift small
apple why we like it the point of any
serum is to deliver mega doses of
ingredients into the skin more
effectively than I think Meister Iser
and this one packs in an anti-aging and
hydrating arsenal the formula is 50%
hyaluronic acid acid an unusually high
level of an expensive ingredient that
dermatologists love for its ability to
hold moisture in this gift it says then
there are the even fancier more s say
some of the stuff that they have in here
okay like literally I'll be reading this
like every month there's stuff that I
just can't pronounce and people are like
mad and I'm like yeah I'm you know edit
my video sound like this it okay let's
dress I can do esoteric and I know that
word like sometimes I look at oh my god
knows where esoteric so let's just start
that sentence over even fancier more
esoteric ingredients that fight wrinkles
over time peptides to increase collagen
production and several different
antioxidants to protect skin from all
that's fab
universe to cope your face and neck he
only need the most miniscule drop
because one ounce of this full size is a
hundred seventy dollars girl don't
expect it to totally replace your
moisturizer our tester with combination
skin found that her oily area still
needed some lotion still all of our
testers appreciated the instant
plumpness it gave their skin so I'm
excited to use this I do use serums in
the morning so I will try that out the
next thing I see is from soap &amp;amp; Glory it
is the pillow plump sexy mother pucker
lip gloss in pink well oh my gosh sorry
if the lighting is changing guys um it's
dark like stormy clouds when the Sun
pops out and then dark stormy clouds and
then the Sun pack that all right so this
is what it looks like it's a really nice
kind of like peachy color very very
pretty let's read about it it says soap
&amp;amp; Glory pillow talk plump extra extra
large lip gloss and think Belle think
well think about pink well Tinkerbell
well be cute they should do that it is a
pale pink glass that claims to plump up
your lips planes it's opaque coral pink
in the tube it goes on sheer petal pink
that's unusually shiny and definitely
sticky at first and though your brain
may expect a mint or bubble gum sense
surprise a totally smells like chocolate
well that's really fun it says remember
the first generation of lip glosses that
claim to plump your lips but instead
just stung burn and left your mouth dry
and chapped this thick gloss is another
thing entirely imagine pop pop pop rocks
on your lips the longer I read the more
I stumble pop rocks I knew lips there's
an intense feeling that pings all over
your mouth for about 30 minutes after
you swipe it on 30 minutes while that's
crazy thanks to some mighty zesty flower
oil and peppermint beyond the trippy
half hour of little explosions on your
lips we didn't actually notice the kind
of bee stung results we would have seen
bloggers claim to achieve but we did
fall in love with this rigid very
moisturizing lost the pretty pink sheen
was clear enough to look flattering on
all of our testers so yeah full-size is
fourteen dollars and you can get it at
skin store calm yeah because you know
somethin Gloria is not at support
anymore they used to be in there or not
I'm gonna happen with that alright we
are on to the last products oh my gosh
stormy clouds out there and do not like
that alright last thing is the gene are
smooth affair this is a facial primer
and brightener looks very cute and it
says a moisturizing makeup primer it's
slippery as a serum with a light pink
tint and smells like fresh orange juice
at this primer one on a lower best of
beauty award because it delivers so many
skincare benefits first it provides as
much moisture as a lightweight lotion it
also packs in antioxidants and soothing
ingredients such as a low a green and
white tea extracts it's safe for
sensitive and readiness prone skin if
large pores are an issue if blur some
remarkably well and no not done yet it
helps absorb excess oil making ideal for
combination skin so 1.7 ounces that that
is forty-eight dollars so um yeah so I'm
pretty excited with this month back I'm
really Bob this month's box I can never
talk after I do one of these videos like
they really they have fancy words over
there at allure guys man but anyway um
I'm really excited it seems like there's
some good skincare stuff in there I'm
gonna try out that so far for my face at
night and the pixi gloat on it was so
excited got my hands on that detangling
brush so nice to have in the shower or
just all the time for me because my hair
tangles if the wind flows the wrong way
