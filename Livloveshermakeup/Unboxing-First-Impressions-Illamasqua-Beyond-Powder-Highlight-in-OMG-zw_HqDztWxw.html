this video I have a unboxing and first
impressions for you guys on the new
illamasqua beyond powder illuminator in
the shade oh my god oMG but anyway I'm
really excited I was originally going to
review this product but I just got it in
the mail and honestly I have a really
busy week coming up Thursday Friday and
Saturday I will be out of town for a gig
so I just thought it would be better to
go ahead and do a first impressions and
get the video after you guys soon and if
you are curious yes they both have proof
films videos going up when I am out of
town so don't worry about that but um
yeah I just kinda wanted to show you
guys like what this product looks like
I'm gonna demo it on my face I pulled
out my Sigma tapered highlighter f-35
brush you just clean this and we're
going to put this on the face and see
what it's like it's supposed to be like
a subtle sort of illumination to the
skin you're supposed to be able to use
it dry or wet depending on like what
kind of look he wants I'm guessing that
if you apply it wet it gives a lot more
umph to the color and also to like the
glow but it supposed to be very very
lightweight and they do have two
different shades there was one that was
kind of bronze II and then oh my god is
more like a champagne color I personally
chose this one just cuz I thought it
would be really nice on my skin tone
personally and I thought the bronze c1
was gonna be a little darker and I
didn't really know if I wanted it as a
blush copper because and illamasqua I
believe does not do returns and I think
these are around 40 or $45 on the
Illamasqua website a link below in the
description bar you guys can check them
out if you're interested
unfortunately Illamasqua is no longer
sold on the sephora website so I did
have to order this from I believe
they're in the UK so I ordered it and I
believe standard shipping is around
seven dollars and fifty cents which is
not too bad
but again these are around forty or
forty-five dollars so in total it's
gonna cost you you know well over sixty
dollars to probably order one of these
or two depending on if you want both of
them so anyway I thought I would just
unbox this with you guys and let's put
it on my face see what it looks like
it does say this is a baked highlighting
powder and that adds a warm hue to your
complexion for a natural radiant glow it
says whether you want to achieve an
all-over illuminating finish kind of
like the hourglass ambient
powders or you simply want to highlight
certain points beyond lightweight
texture glides onto the skin
effortlessly creating a healthy flawless
skin finish it says with the choice to
apply wet or dry it provides
long-lasting results and can also be
used on the body to achieve a natural
bronzed skin effect so anyway you do get
seven grams of product in here or 0.24
ounces which is actually quite large so
let's go ahead and unbox this baby shall
we so here is the packaging
I always thought is that the Illamasqua
packaging was actually quite sleek even
though it is just plastic I have a lot
of their blushes and I'm hoping that
this has to be similar oh my got a big
fingerprints all over them but I'm
hoping that this has a similar sort of
texture like the blushes because I
really enjoy the blushes but here is the
color oh my god it's so beautiful it's
like a gold champagne color can you guys
see that and this is kind of big and
bulky but I feel like you do get a nice
amount of product in here so anyway
that's pretty cool I'm like you said
seven grams of product or 0.2 24 ounces
and yeah let's go ahead and put this on
my face you do get a mirror here which
is great you don't get that with the
blushes so let's go ahead first I'm
going to kind of feel this
okay so doesn't feel exactly like the
blushes the blushes feel very very
creamy I have like I think six or eight
Illamasqua blushes and especially their
matte blushes feel like literally like a
baby's butt like so smooth and creamy
this feels a little crispy I don't want
to say crispy but not like it's a harsh
texture but it feels very very
lightweight so that is what the color
looks like I'm just watching on the back
of my hand and then we're gonna apply
this on the face but it looks so
beautiful oh my god this color is like
it's oh my god can you guys see that how
beautiful is that color it's got like a
beautiful kind of yellow opalescent
color to it it kind of reminds me a
little bit of Becca's moonstone so
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and apply this
and then I'll give you guys kind of my
first thoughts on it and of course I
will be back in a week to give you guys
my final thoughts on the products but
I'm going to take my Sigma tapered
highlighter f-35 brush and I'm just
gonna tap into here you do get a lot of
kick up and you guys see that tons
how's it kickoff but I'm gonna go ahead
and put this on on my chin take it down
the bridge of my nose oh it's so glowy
it really reminds me of the what is that
the new highlighting powders that came
in the little trail that our train for
us at the ctrio those look like they're
almost wet on the skin I feel like this
gives sort of the same sort of
appearance like it just looks like whew
wet wet skin so I feel quite glowy
already I know they said that you can
use this as like an all-over
illuminating powder but honestly these
don't remind me of the ambient lighting
powders this is like this is very glowy
in my opinion I hope it's picking up on
camera you guys know I'm really really
fair complected so sometimes these
highways don't even pick up on my skin
they just blend right in
but it's definitely a beautiful sort of
golden glow and it's one of those
powders it's not like a baked jewel a
formula or texture or anything like that
it's one of those things you can just
put on with like a fan brush or like
really really just you don't have to
like pop it into your skin that's what
I'm trying to say it really just glides
on nicely so it looks really beautiful I
hope you guys can see that like the glow
is gorgeous I don't think I need to go
in with a second layer I think it looks
really really pretty but it feels like
it just puts a lot of color down like it
deposits a lot of color without really
buffing it into your skin so my first
impressions are that it looks very wet
on the skin I would not I personally
would not wear this all over the face
because I feel like I don't know it's
very glowy I don't think I would
personally wear this all over the face
like that the finishing powder doesn't
remind me of the hourglass ambient
lighting powders at all if anything I
reminds me of the hourglass ambient
light strobing powders like in the shade
brilliant it kind of reminds me of that
but yes it is very very very glowy I
actually think this is beautiful I will
say um I'm looking at this right now can
you guys see there's like a little bit
of texture on there when I dipped my
brush in I hope that's not the
beginnings of hardpan because I will be
pissed I
hardpan the anyways it looks really nice
on the skin I think it's beautiful
so I don't really know what to say
hopefully this will wear all day long I
will keep you guys updated and I will be
back in exactly a week to give you guys
my full review of this product but so
far so good and the packaging is a
little bit bulky but I do like that it's
black and sleek you do get a mirror and
I feel like you get a nice amount of
product in here for around $45 so anyway
so far so good I will let you guys know
how this holds up for me and I will see
you guys then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
