hope you guys are having a great day
today i will be doing on a begging for
you guys or i guess you can call it an
unboxing of the Melissa Autry
subscription box or subscription bag
service that she recently started but
this one is the first month that she has
released it is for the month of July so
July 2015 and she partnered with real
style ree l st yoe which is also the
brand that she partnered with to make
her cosmetics line and I did if you guys
saw my review on her cosmetics I did
purchase quite a few of her lipsticks
and things like that and I really really
enjoyed her products so I'm really
hoping that her subscription bag is just
as good as the products that I purchased
with my own money obviously this is not
sponsored I did purchase this with my
own money as well but I just like hoping
that for the fifteen dollars that this
bag was plus the I believe 595 for
shipping so it totaled out to be a
little over twenty dollars i am hoping
that this little subscription bag is
worth it because I do love subscription
bags and subscription boxes so yeah
anyway let's just get started I will
link below um both of melissa's channels
if you guys are interested in checking
her out she has a makeup channel and
then she has a newer channel that is
recent that she recently just kind of
started and it's more it's called more
than make up with Mal i believe so i
will link both below if you guys are
interested in checking those out but i
really really love her as a person she's
so funny she's really real and i'm
really excited that she did decide to do
a little subscription bag or a
subscription box thing oh I've been
flashing you my address hopefully can't
see that anyway um let's just get
started so I'm just going to open it up
and we're going to take a peek inside
and yeah so the first thing I want to
comment on is actually the bag that it
comes in this looks exactly like the
Ipsy bag and it's not so much that it's
a problem I do like the fact that she is
doing a bag instead of a box um I do
like like glossybox and things like that
I like that they have those nice little
boxes that you can reuse for storage and
things like that however I do think it
is more economical
just you know easier for people to pay
because you do have to pay for the box
so it is a cheaper if people can just do
the bag so I do like that she decided to
do that she could stay on her channel
that she decided to do the actual bag
because it was a lot cheaper but um it
really just reminds me of the Ipsy bag
and it's I guess a little confusing um
but I don't actually have a subscription
with ypsi so it's not that it's
confusing for me but I was even
surprised I thought that she had
partnered with AC when I opened up the
actual bag when I saw that it was here I
thought oh she must have partnered with
ypsi but it is with real style who are
located in Toronto Canada so everything
is made in Canada I believe it is
cruelty free also and yeah anyway but um
so I just want to show you guys she has
her little sticker right there that says
M Autry but anyway let's open it up and
see what we've gotten here so the first
thing we have is a little carmen says
hey honey and this was slow like Melissa
I think that's so cute says thanks so
much for purchasing my subscription
service your overwhelming support means
the world to me please enjoy all of
these products they were made
specifically for you I hope you love
them as much as I do XOXO Mel so really
really cute and there's also another
little card in here and it says lucky
you enjoy twenty percent off an email
autry lipstick with code mdl 20 and i
highly recommend going and using this
code because i do love her lipsticks i
did try quite a few from her line and i
love them so anyway the first thing I
see in here are these cute little hair
ties um these are those nice little hair
ties that don't leave like a dent or
crimp in your hair so you get like a
nice little like seafoam colored one
looks like that and you get a hot pink
really really cute Oh a hot pink one
that looks like that kind of matches my
nail color and then you get a dark like
um I don't know like ocean blue color
really really pretty so that's really
cute I do like these little hater ties
so I will use those I'm excited for
those the next product I see is wrapped
in this little faggy it says M autry so
this must be one of her
one of her products I think all of them
are focused on being her own products
but it says sea salt hairspray it says
directions spray on damp or dry hair
finger dry or let dry naturally for more
fullness diffuse with heat works on wet
hair to create volume or on dry hair for
PC texture so that's really fun that's
I'm exciting i do like like sea salt
sprays and things like that because i do
have very flat um very straight hair so
this might be fun to get a little more
volume and create some texture so i am
excited to use that there is how many
fluid ounces the suits it's kind of like
just normal sized for a beauty box i
would say our subscription box like kind
of like a deluxe size um the next thing
we have in here it looks like i have an
eyeshadow trio this is a baked eyeshadow
trio and its really really nice it looks
like it has some really really nice warm
pretty pretty colors in here I know she
did stay in a video oh they feel like
butter I know she did state in a video
that she was going to really like warm
bronzy colors for this particular box
and she did say that her next box is
going to be more like rosy tone colors
but let me just watch these for you guys
so um they feel really really soft
they're not as pigmented as I thought
they would be but they're really really
soft and beautiful beautiful colors so I
am definitely excited to use that and
try that out a little more and ok so
we're approaching on the last thing here
and I must say this subscription box or
the subscription bag is fifteen dollars
and like I said 595 for shipping and
this is the last thing and i must say
already i'm not super super impressed i
do think that um she really did find
like a diverse amount of things to put
into the box but it just seems like i'm
not quite sure if they are quite worth
the fifteen dollars yet but the last
thing we have here is the melissa autry
hydrating lip balm and oh this is a
gorgeous color it's like a beautiful
coral coral really really pretty color
I'm going to swatch it here oh wow it's
super pigmented so really gorgeous color
and it is soup
super pigmented it does not look like a
lip balm it's more of like a I don't
even know like a lip cream or something
but it's really nice it feels like a
like the Revlon lip butters or the all
may ones those really really nice thick
luxurious butters so that's a really
beautiful color however i must say that
that is all that in the bag and what
we're only like six minutes into filming
here but um I so yeah so again let me
show you guys the five products you get
the sea salt texturizing spray the lip
balm which is really nice i'm very
impressed with that you get the little
eye shadow trio which is cute it's not
super pigmented but it does feel nice
and creamy to the touch and then you get
the three hair binders so I would say um
yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not quite sold
yet I'm not like amazed or by any means
of everything I think everything
combined is like very cute and whatnot
but maybe she could have done something
different and you know done something
different with the air binders or
something just because maybe she could
have thrown like I don't know another
like maybe like a bath product or
something in just because I feel like
that doesn't seem like a lot of product
to me it doesn't seem like that all of
that equals fifteen dollars so um
overall I will um order next month I beg
just because I want to see if it can you
know get better and things like that
again this was her first month of doing
this this was her first bag so you can't
really be like oh it's so horrible you
know what I mean I would say that this
one I'm not quite sure if it is worth
the fifteen dollars plus the 595
shipping um I think that maybe she
should take off 595 shipping and maybe
it would be a little more I don't know
it would seem like it's more worth it
but I will order the next month box i
will show you guys the bag for next
month you know sometimes when these
things get started especially when it's
a youtuber um they have to like get
kicked off the ground first before she
can really start putting good good
products into the bag so
I will continue I will do two more
months and we will see if things get
better and if not I obviously was set
for purchasing but um overall not super
super impressed however I think that
there is room for improvement and I
think she will make that improvement so
um I want to believe that she will
because I do love Melissa on tree and I
think she's wonderful so um yeah anyway
i hope this was helpful this was the
unbinding for the Melissa Autry
subscription bag um and yeah I hope that
you guys enjoyed this if you did please
give it a thumbs up I will link
everything below if you would like to
purchase the bag if you would like to
