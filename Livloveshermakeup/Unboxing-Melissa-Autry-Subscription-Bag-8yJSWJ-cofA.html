hope you guys are having a great day
today I will be doing on a begging for
you guys or I guess you can call it an
unboxing of the Melissa Autry
subscription box or subscription bag
service that she recently started on but
this one is the first month that she has
released it is for the month of July so
July 2015 and she partnered with real
style REE l st yl e which is also the
brand that she partnered with to make
her cosmetics line and I did if you guys
saw my review on her cosmetics I did
purchase quite a few of her lipsticks
and things like that and I really really
enjoyed her products so I'm really
hoping that her subscription bag is just
as good as the products that I purchased
with my own money
obviously this is not sponsored I did
purchase this with my own money as well
but I just I'm hoping that for the 15
dollars that this bag was plus the I
believe 595 for shipping so it totaled
out to be a little over $20 I am hoping
that this little subscription bag is
worth it because I do love subscription
bags and subscription boxes so yeah
anyway let's just get started I will
link below um both of Melissa's channels
if you guys are interested in checking
her out she has a makeup channel and
then she has a newer channel that is
recent that she recently just kind of
started and it's more it's called more
than make up with mal I believe so I
will link both below if you guys are
interested in checking those out but I
really really love her as a person she's
so funny she's really real and I'm
really excited that she did decide to do
a little subscription bag or a
subscription box fame oh I've been
flashing you my address
hopefully can't see that anyway let's
just get started so I'm just gonna open
it up and we're gonna take a peek inside
and yeah so the first thing I want to
comment on is actually the bag that it
comes in this is exactly like the Ipsy
bag and it's not so much that it's a
problem I do like the fact that she is
doing a bag instead of a box um I do
like like glossy box and things like
that I like that they have those nice
little boxes that you can reuse for
storage and things like that however I
do think it is more economical and just
you know easier for people to pay
because you do have to pay for the box
so it is a cheaper if people can just do
the bag so I do like that she decided to
do that she the state on her channel
that she decided to do the actual bag
because it was a lot cheaper but um it
really just reminds me of the Ipsy bag
and it's I guess a little confusing
um but I don't actually have a
subscription with Ipsy so it's not that
that's confusing for me but I was even
surprised I thought that she had
partnered with AC when I opened up the
actual bag when I saw that it was here I
thought oh she must have partnered with
Ipsy but it is with real style who are
located in Toronto Canada so everything
is made in Canada I believe it is
cruelty free also and yeah anyway but um
so I just wanted to show you guys she
has a little sticker right there that
says eMCON tree but anyway let's open it
up and see what we've got in here so the
first thing we have is a little card
missus hey honey and this was so like
Melissa I think that's so cute it says
thanks so much for purchasing my
subscription service your overwhelming
support means the world to me please
enjoy all of these products they were
made specifically for you I hope you
love them as much as I do
xoxo Mel so really really cute and
there's also another little card in here
and it says lucky you enjoy 20% off any
Mel Autry lipstick with code any l20 and
I highly recommend going and using this
code because I do love her lipsticks I
did try quite a few from her line and I
loved them so anyway the first thing I
see here are these cute little hair ties
these are those nice little hair ties
that don't leave like a dent or crimp in
your hair so you get like a nice little
like seafoam colored one looks like that
you get a hot pink really really cute
whoa a hot pink one that looks like that
kind of matches my nail color and then
you get a dark like um I don't know like
ocean blue color really really pretty so
that's really cute I do like these
little hanger ties so I will use those
I'm excited for those the next product I
see is wrapped in this little baggie it
says an artery so this must be one of
her again what
her products I think all of them are
focused on being her own products but it
says sea salt hairspray it says
directions spray on damp or dry hair
finger dry or let dry naturally for more
fullness diffuse with heat works on wet
hair to create volume or on dry hair for
pasty texture so that's really fun
that's exciting I do like like sea salt
sprays and things like that because I do
have very flat um very straight hair so
this might be fun to get a little more
volume and create some texture so I am
excited to use that there is how many
fluid ounces the sea it's kind of like
just normal sized for a beauty box I
would say or subscription box like kind
of like a deluxe size the next thing we
have in here it looks like I have an
eyeshadow trio this is a baked eyeshadow
trio and it's really really nice it
looks like it has some really really
nice warm pretty pretty colors in here I
know she did stay in a video oh they
feel like butter um
I know she did state in a video that she
was going for really like warm bronzy
colors for this particular box and she
did say that her next box is going to be
more like rosy tone colors but let me
just swatch these for you guys so they
feel really really soft they're not as
pigmented as I thought they would be but
they're really really soft and beautiful
beautiful colors so I am definitely
excited to use the back and try that out
a little more and okay so we're
approaching on the last thing here and I
must say this subscription box or the
subscription bag is $15 and like I said
595 for shipping and this is the last
thing and I must say already I'm not
super super impressed I do think that um
she really did find like a diverse
amount of things to put into the box but
it just seems like I'm not quite sure if
they are quite worth the $15 yet but the
last thing we have here is the melissa
audrey hydrating lip balm and oh this is
a gorgeous color it's like a beautiful
coral coral really really pretty color
i'm gonna swatch it here oh wow it's
super pigmented so really gorgeous color
it is super super pigmented it does not
look like a lip balm it's more of like a
I don't even know like a lip cream or
something um but it's really nice it
feels like like the Revlon lip butters
or the all main ones those really really
nice thick luxurious butters so that's a
really beautiful color however I must
say that that is all that in the bag and
what we're only like six minutes into
filming here but um I so yeah so again
let me show you guys the five products
you get the sea salt texturizing spray
the lip balm which is really nice I'm
very impressed with that you get the
little eyeshadow trio which is cute it's
not super pigmented but it does feel
nice and creamy to the touch and then
you get the three hair binders so I
would say um yeah I'm not I'm not I'm
not quite sold yet I'm not like amazed
or by any means of everything I think
everything combined is like very cute
and whatnot but maybe she could have
done something different and you know
done something different with the air
binders or something just because maybe
she could have thrown like I don't know
another like maybe like a bath product
or something in just because I feel like
that doesn't seem like a lot of product
to me it doesn't seem like that all of
that equals fifteen dollars so overall I
will um order next month's bag just
because I want to see if it can you know
get better and things like that
again this was her first month of doing
this this was her first bag so you can't
really view like oh it's all horrible
you know what I mean
I would say that this one I'm not quite
sure if it is worth the $15 plus the 595
shipping I think that maybe she should
take off so 595 shipping and maybe it
would be a little more I don't know it
would seem like it's more worth it but I
will order the next month's box I will
show you guys the bag for next month you
know sometimes when these things get
started especially when it's a youtuber
um they have to like get kicked off the
ground first before she can really start
putting good good products into the bag
so I will continue I will do
two more months and we will see if
things get better and if not I obviously
will stop for purchasing but overall not
super super impressed however I think
that there is room for improvement and I
think she will make that improvement so
um I want to believe that she will
because I do love Melissa Autry and I
think she's wonderful so um yeah anyway
I hope this was helpful this was the
unbagging for the Melissa a free
subscription bag and yeah I hope that
you guys enjoyed this if you did please
give it a thumbs up I will link
everything below if you would like to
purchase the bag maybe you would like to

of that will be linked below for you
