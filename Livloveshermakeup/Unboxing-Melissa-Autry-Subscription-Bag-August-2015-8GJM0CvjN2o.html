hope you guys are having a great day and
if you hear strange noises in the
background we have our Roomba on right
now he cleans the floor every day he's
like a little robot vacuum to clean the
floor so if you hear weird noises he is
cleaning but um I have to run very very
shortly but I wanted to get up a video
today because my little Melissa Autry
subscription bag for the month of August
came in the mail so I wanted to do a
quick on begging with you guys if you
watched my last one um I was pretty much
disappointed in the bag and I told
myself that I would continue for two
more months to see if the bag has gotten
any better it is a $15 subscription bag
every single month and unfortunately um
shipping is like 595 so it told us out
to be around $20 a month and on top of
that um it's just last month's like
products were just I did not feel they
were even worth $15 let alone 20 so I
was pretty disappointed
I love Melissa Autry don't get me wrong
I'm not a hater i watch her all the time
I am like a religious subscriber of hurt
just subscribe you know what I mean like
i religiously watch her i love her
I've watched every video she posts I'm a
huge fan and I was just kind of
disappointed in the July guy so anyway
um the August bag did come and I did
watch one of her videos she posted that
this was going to be the month of Rose
things so I love anything rose so this
says Melissa actually right here with
the little rose I did open the little
top her um just so that I don't flash
you my address but I did not look inside
yet so let's just open it up and
hopefully it will be better than last
month like I said I will give it another
month if it's not that great but
hopefully it's good and I can continue
you know wanting to purchase it so
anyway a little card that you get in
here is really cute this month and it
says stop to smell the roses and it says
roses are red violets are blue here's
what I've got for you so it shows
everything and the price and yeah so
let's start going through it and then I
will brief you guys on what it's valued
at so the first thing I see in here
looks like an eye shadow I think or a
blush
this is the fleshy rose hypoallergenic
mineral blush from Melissa a tree so it
looks really nice it's like this pretty
pretty pink shade with lots of lots of
gold glitter it feels pretty good on the
hands like it doesn't feel it feels
pretty buttery you know it doesn't feel
too dry and that's actually a really
pretty color so that is the color very
nice I like so far so kind of like a
cool toned pink with little flecks of
gold glitter in it very nice and on the
card it says blushing Rose blush valued
at $22 I don't know about that but it
does say be sweet as pie or as they
blossom and throw this bad boy on so
anyway that is the swatch of the blush
it looks nice it's not extremely
insanely pigmented I'm gonna is kind of
a smaller size I'm not quite sure if
that is value to $22 I don't know but um
for you know a couple of dollars or
whatnot that I paid for the actual bag I
think that this is worth it so if that
is cute like I said the pigmentation
it's not incredible but it is a really
really pretty shade and I think it can
share out nicely so let's stick our hand
in and see what's next um this I saw she
was wearing in one of her videos she did
say it would be in the next month's box
it is a headband and it's one of those
that has like that little like um like
wire hanger kind of thing in it so it
can punch up any way you want you can
kind of wear it like this or you can tie
it like a little bow at the top of your
head really really cute
I was excited when she said that this
was going to be in the August box so I
think that is super cute it has roses on
it of course so let's see what she wrote
about that one it says the headband is
valued at $12 again not quite sure if
they are actually valued at this price
he's kind of high but I think it is cute
and it says we are this in your hair to
spice up your outfit y'all so again I
don't know if she's just putting the
prices out just so that she feels like
people feel like it's worth the money I
don't think she needs to do that because
so far for this month things look really
good and
I'm happy so far with the two products
so let's see what other products are in
here I guess um there will be two more
right yeah she does for products them
out alright the next one is Melissa goes
so it looks like it's a little rose back
bomb and you can actually see that
there's like little flowers that's so
cute
so it looks like there's Drive like rose
petals or flower petals in there it's
most really good smells exactly like
rose so you know I like this this is
really nice I really really like this
and it has all of the ingredients on the
back right there for you it says he
grows guarded bath bomb and it looks
like it has maybe 12 ingredients tops so
um I like that you know I'm happy I'm so
far this this is the step up from last
month bag all right
and let's see here's all I think yeah so
this is the last thing in here it
appears to be some sort of a lipstick
this is the Melissa Autry Rosie stone
lipstick shade talked about I just did a
haul last night and I was like picking
up a lot of shades like this like a Mac
swirl and you know like mink from Revlon
Super Lustrous so that is what the color
looks like and this is not one of them
that I had picked up from her cosmetic
line I do love her lipsticks I will say
I have picked them up before I picked up
what was it
I can't remember the exact name so they
were like two pink shades in a purple
shade I think we and two other shades
but this is definitely a new one and I
you know the pigmentation is good it's
nice and creamy so uh yeah really really
nice I love that kind of strain you guys
I really like that
pop that on very very pretty I really
really like that color that was really
nice
alright so this is funny because last
month like you could definitely see in
the video that I was pretty disappointed
but I am actually quite surprised and
happy with this month what's in the book
what's in the bag for this one I do I
think that the products are actually
valued at what they are written on the
card by the way they say the Philip
stick is valued at $17 which I do you
think is accurate because those are what
her other lipsticks are cost so that
would make sense but um like the Rose
blush I don't know if that's actually
valued at $22 a headband $12 you know I
don't know um but I will say this is a
step up from last month's bag I'm very
very happy
I like the products more I like the Rose
theme I like the colors I like that you
get a blush you get a bath product cute
little headband and then that lipstick
it's really really pretty and I think if
that's a color that a lot of people
could wear so I'm actually quite happy
with this month's box or bag let's keep
our fingers crossed that next month
sighs it's just as good if it is just a
good as this month bag I will continue
to repurchase if it's not then I will
stop my subscription but this bag is
definitely a step up from the July bag
go back and watch my video on the July
bag it's just I don't think it was worth
you know the twenty-something dollars
that I think but this definitely I in my
opinion and my eyes is so I'm very very
happy with this month bag so I hope you
guys enjoyed this I will link below
where you guys can purchase this bag if
you'd like it's not sponsored in any way

let's keep our fingers crossed that next
month bag is just so good and yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this and bagging
