thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day this
video is going to be on a boxing on my
popsugar must have box for the month of
december this is a very pricey box it is
3995 and month i am not affiliated with
them in any way shape or form I'm not
sponsored by them the only reason I put
that out there is just because I know
that a lot of youtubers are sponsored by
these subscription boxes I'm just not
one of them i purchased all of mine with
my own money but anyway um like I said
3995 a month this is the most expensive
subscription to little subscription box
that I get every single month but I love
it because um usually one or two of the
items always ends up being more than
thirty nine ninety five so basically you
get about four to five items in each box
and it's really cute because they always
do you like a food item they'll have
like a jewelry piece something makeup
related so if you're just like a lover
of all things beauty or girly things you
would probably really really enjoy this
box and sometimes they throw in like DIY
things or a book or something like
whimsical so for super cute so anyway
I'm excited to do this unboxing for you
guys I'm just going to open the box up
and the first thing I see on top is the
little pamphlet and this basically shows
you how much everything is and it tells
you a little bit about each product so i
will read for you guys out of that as we
go along and then there's some tissue
wrapping and the first thing that I see
let me show you guys the box after you
take the tissue wrapping off it's a
surprise love enjoy and the first thing
I see is the food related item for the
month this is called be my cup of cake
warm Belgian chocolate souffle cake that
you make in under three minutes in your
own cup in the microwave so that looks
really really cute um it looks like one
of those products that like you put a
little bit of like canola oil or cooking
oil in you put that in you put some
water in and then it like bakes it in
your own cup um yeah so it says yeah add
a third cup of water 1 tablespoon of
canola oil the soufflé mix and then you
basically microwave it for 2 minutes and
then you have cake in a cup so that is
really really cute let's read about what
they say it says the
my cup of cake and it is a classic
Belgian chocolate cake the retail price
is 599 and it says in just three minutes
satisfy any sweet tooth with this
gourmet souffle it uses the finest dark
silky Belgian chocolate and has all
natural ingredients so your guests will
never know it was such a piece of cake
to make super super cute i'm excited to
try that out that looks delicious
alright the second item i see here looks
like it's from stowaways it looks like
this and it says it is a creme lipstick
trio it is a collection feechie
featuring cranberry raspberry and melted
oh sorry muted plum lipsticks so let's
open it up and see what's in there
they're so cute look at those little
tiny lipsticks I really like that
packaging it's kind of like the NARS but
it's like a matte grey and the first one
is called cranberry and it looks like
this I'm gonna swatch these for you guys
beautiful kind of red color let's go
ahead and swatch these oh wow beautiful
super super pigmented and silky that's
cranberry the second one in here is
called muted plum and is kind of a pinky
muted plum sort of color swatch that one
too wow it's a nice um a nice formula
I've never heard of this brand though so
that is muted plum that one right there
beautiful and then the last one is
called raspberry I can't I'm gonna like
this one it looks like it's a very kind
of pinky color and watch that for you
guys beautiful gorgeous colors aren't
those pretty wow really really love that
so cranberry needed plum and then a
raspberry at the bottom sorry when I
look in my viewfinder and I try and
point I'm like what is going on but
anyway those are the colors and those
are really really cute little minis and
let's read about what they sitting here
it says the stowaway cosmetics creme
lipstick trio it is thirty dollars for
those three on the retail price so it
says stowaway cosmetics hashtag right
size lipstick trio was designed
the girl on the go Lisa sugar
hand-picked to these dreamy hughes
perfect for holiday parties and small
enough to fit in the smallest of
clutches and I agree how beautiful with
those colors be like for the holiday I
really really like that so let me just
remove those swatches quickly so that
I'm not getting it all over because I
would probably get it all over my face
in my hair and everywhere um but anyway
really excited and like I said that was
thirty dollars that little tiny set
those are retailed for thirty dollars so
again you basically have almost paid for
the box in itself so really really
excited for those the next thing I seen
here is from nima Oberoi it looks like
this is a bright orange a little box and
it's literally wrapped up like a tiny
little present um let's see what is this
oh it's a wine stopper how cute is that
um so it is a wine stopper and this
actually feels like really really heavy
and waited it's not like flimsy at all
it feels like it's like I mean it's like
waited like heavy metal so that looks
really really cute can you guys see that
oh let's see what to say it says Nima Oh
burial lunaris geo stopper wine drinkers
will love this exclusive geo stopper San
Francisco designer Nima Oh Barry oh I
handcrafted this bottle stopper to not
tarnish or break so that you can reuse
it time and time again and it is
retailed at twenty four dollars and
actually I'm gonna wrap this back up and
give it to my mom for Christmas because
I got her a big huge gorgeous bottle of
wine for Christmas she loves wine so I
think that that would be the perfect
little gift to go along with it so that
is really really fun all right um moving
on the next thing I've seen here is
called glitter tape and this is Reuben
adhesive skin to lent whatever that
means um let's open this a little bit
because I I don't
understand I don't know really what it
looks like um oh it's so cute it's got
little stars on it so it's glitter tape
that literally has tiny little silver
stars on it and one of the main like
themes in my beauty room you might not
be able to tell but it is silver so this
would be so cute to kind of put on
certain areas or just to decorate I
think that that is adorable let's see it
says silver stars on white glitter tape
it is retailed at four dollars it says
when you have the perfect gift every
detail matters Mary Mary's festive white
glitter tape will add the finishing
touch with an ad added element of
sparkle so yes you could totally do some
gift wrapping with this but also um I
think it's super cute and I might want
to like tape up some area back there or
something really really cute with the
beauty room kind of thing but really
really adorable alright moving on the
next thing I see is in this gorgeous
little black pouch and open it up it's
like a little kind of like leatherette
sort of pouch really really pretty kind
of goes along with the black theme I
have going on today let's see here Oh
wrapped up really beautifully ooh pretty
it is a bracelet can you guys see that
isn't that pretty I very very small
wrist so I hope that this fits if it
doesn't I will just gift it to somebody
else but I want to go like that see if
it will fit right now actually um
actually it looks up it looks like it
might be okay if I can notch it kind of
um like very very tightly but how pretty
is that so it's got gold and then silver
and then rose gold I think that is just
absolutely lovely and it says this is
the UM gold ombre bracelet this is a $65
bracelet it is from love aaj the rose
ash the rose this must have a designer
ombre bracelet will be an eye-catching
addition to your wrist we're broke
the mix of silver rose gold and gold
plating blends effortlessly together for
a unique ombre effect and it's very very
heavy and waited and it just looks
absolutely gorgeous I'm super super
excited for that that is beautiful
alright and then the last thing we have
in here is quite large this is from
swing design it says it is the Nova
collection oh my gosh it's a jewelry box
how sweet is that how beautiful alright
let's take a look at this open it up
look at this precious little jewelry box
you guys oh my goodness it's a beautiful
light blue color it's got a little metal
tab here that you open it up and of
course inside you have areas to put your
jewelry in and its got like a soft
quilted thing on the inside but how
precious is that wow it smells like
leather I think this is actually leather
not pleather yeah I think this is
leather how beautiful is that this
little light blue jewelry box oh my gosh
precious um it says this is the swing
design Nova Blue Mist jewelry box if it
says if you're like us there's no such

can probably tell from behind me I have
a whole table dedicated to jewelry so
you bet your ass sorry you bet your butt
haha I am going to be using this um but
yeah that is so sweet I have a lot of
jewelry so it would make sense and then
at the bottom they always give you a
little like coupon sort of things so the
first thing you see is the stowaway
right size make up half the size half
the price this is an exclusive offer for
if you buy Oh get
three additional lipsticks free with the
purchase of your first stowaway kit so
that was the lipstick brand and then the
my cup of cake it says save twenty five
percent and then tiny prints oh yeah oh
this is so cute i'm sorry i missed
something there was one of extra singing
here it says tiny prints these are gift
tag stickers basically I think this was
from the same brand that did the tape
and it says to whoever and then it says
with love and that's like from you know
so you could say to dad you know with
love from Olivia so super super cute i'm
actually going to put a few of these on
some of the presents that we have under
the christmas tree hold on a minute let
me make sure we just read on the
pamphlet that that is from the same
brand because I could be completely
wrong yes okay so it is the tiny prints
brand the one that had the stickers or
the um I'm sorry the one that had the
pretty little tape and it says these
delightful heart give tag stickers
designed by Lisa sugar are such a sweet
way to seal your gifts if you want even
more from tiny prints enjoy twenty
dollars off your purchase so it's the
same brand that did the cute little
glitter tape so really really adorable

box I would say my favorite thing is
definitely this beautiful leather
jewelry box like I'm sorry that is just
absolutely adorable um I really love
