you are all having a fantastic day i am
here to do my popsugar must have
unboxing for the month of january i'm
going to link everything you need to
know about popsugar must have boxes
below it's not an affiliate link I'm not
sponsored or affiliated with the brand
in any way shape or form but just so you
guys know it will be links below this is
a pricier box but I am so excited every
single month when I get it I am so
excited about everything that's in there
and I always end up loving it it is
definitely my favorite um or second
obviously the to my second favorite on
subscription box that I get my first
favorite is definitely GlossyBox but
this one comes in a very close second so
anyway I thought I would unbox this on
camera for you guys so you open the box
up and inside you have the little
pamphlet that says january 2016 box and
i will be reading for you guys
everything that is in here and then you
take open or you take open you'll rip
open if you're like me the tissue paper
and there you can see it's a surprised
love and enjoy and i have not peaked so
i'm super excited about it i sometimes
people with this box because i'm honest
and so excited every single month but
the first thing i see looks like it's a
0 a 13-inch dimension x 12 inch height
little bin this is really really cute is
this like a longer then oh my gosh can I
put my empties in here I've been looking
for a bin to put my em season for the
month easier to put in here alright so
this is really really cute let's read
about it um it says to do these fair
designs p eh r pebble spec bin it the
suggested retail is forty dollars on
this so it's a forty dollar bin and it
says beautifully organized your things
with this must have exclusive storage
bin great for your hats scarves toys
books or anything that needs a home we
love the grace product print which can
easily tie into any room decor this is
so cute i don't know if this will
actually fit all my empty
if you guys watch my empty videos you
probably know um but she might it's very
very wide look I'm huge oh I can't wait
I really wanted to pull out my MGS with
it I've been looking for you know how
people have really cute little empty
spins i am the girl that comes on to
camera at the end of the month with a
trash bag so i think that baby i will
try and fit some of my empties in here i
think that they might work because it is
very very like even though it's not
super tall is very blind so this is
super cute and i love the little print
on it it's basically just little pebbles
very very cute and i feel like this box
is always so different it's kind of like
a whimsical you just get a nice variety
of everyday so anyway moving on the next
thing i've seen here is what is this
soap it says not soap radio original
bubbles for bath and shower and it's
like this cute little set right here of
a guest shower gel when it comes with a
little plastic bag it is so cute it says
looking to hit the reset button you
don't need a bath tub time machine go
forward look to the future it's a blank
slate relax reflect refresh take a
minute and take it back meditate on what
really matters you can accomplish
anything you like and be whoever you
wish use these aromatherapy shower and
or bubble bath oh yeah to kick-start a
new you so I love shower items you guys
know I actually take a bath every other
day I know it's a little excessive but I
do so I'm saying that these can also
double as bubble bath so let's look
inside and see what they're all about so
this one says um liquid food coconut
milk plus Mango Plus vanilla when you
need to turn up the volume on your inner
voice of reason it is an emotional
well-being bath / shower gel look how
cute that is so this one is like I said
coconut milk mango and vanilla oh this
is cute this is really cute this one is
lemon plus sugar and this is a joy
inducing bath and shower gel how cute is
that and then you have this little
purple one which is lavender and
Clementine it says the anti mania /
stress relief bath and shower gel to
sleep full of sweet dreams
without waking up in the mad panic at
3am that is what it looks like really
cute let's smell these actually oh that
smells nice I like that I'm sure I'll
like the other ones as well and then you
have a little blue one and this one says
beach + sky blue water it says bathing
with sharks for that competitive edge in
work and/or play it's an achievement
through self-confidence bath and shower
gel that is too cute that is really too
cute that was smells really nice too oh
my god this is a really really cute
little idea very very kind of indeed I
think this is a little indie brown but
really really cute and then the last one
is the green one and it says the green
and white t + clover this is an
intensive positive love bath and shower
gel smell this one it smells really
really good and it looks like they're
kind of breaking up a little bit but
that usually is the sign that it is like
a natural product so that is really
really cool that is the good look shower
gel cute i love that i love the whole
idea of that I think that's adorable and
they all have a certain herbal extract
in them so the green one has shamrock
oil for exceedingly good luck the blue
one has the royal jelly that kicks up
energy level and will lead to success
the what is that one the white one yeah
that one has st. John's wort that works
to balance emotional extremes and
elevates your mood the purple one has
lavender and chamomile that will come
and relax your body in mind and the
yellow one had lemon essential oil which
will energize and uplift you so that is
super super cute I cannot wait to try
those I love shower gels but I love
bubble baths even more so I'm definitely
going to try those out and it says not
so radio bath and shower gel gift set
and that is a $22 gift set and it says
perfect as a gift for travel or at the
gym this exclusive shower gel set is
ideal for anyone on the go the set
includes very
cents each infused with different herbal
extracts that will inspire you as you
begin the new year super cute i love
that that was adorable alright the next
thing I see oh I've seen this brand at
target I picked up their vanilla cupcake
it's yeah the gourmet sugar-free gum
this is the summer snow gourmet gum
great tasting and world-changing so this
is what it looks like it looks like it's
supposed to be a um what does that look
like a snow cone snow cone flavored
let's read about it it says to do um
spark joy that's not where it is weird
but it doesn't even have it on here well
you're not going to talk about it oh ok
here it says chapstick and oh the
special extra it's a special extra of
the box are they chapstick and the
summer snow gum I guess it doesn't
really need any explanation it's just
gourmet gum and it tastes like a snow
cone apparently so I'm excited to try
that the next thing I see in here oh my
gosh the planner yeah it's a weekly and
monthly planner really really cute I do
use my um where is it Lilly Pulitzer
addenda I have a lilly pulitzer agenda
you can never go wrong with having an
extra little planner like this maybe i
will use this one for a my youtube video
ideas and then have my lilly pulitzer
agenda for everyday use because i have
found that lately i owe the extra-large
Lilly Pulitzer genta and I have found
that I don't have enough room especially
when I write in my youtube video ideas I
don't have enough room at for every
single day so maybe this will be like my
youtube agenda so it's a planner from
January 2016 through December 2016 it
includes monthly calendars weekly
calendars yearly reference calendars and
notes pages so let's look at this this
is from blue sky designs that is what it
looks like it's a beautiful pastel minty
aqua color and it just looks really cute
inside oh cute it has like right down to
your personal goals and when you want to
accomplish them by and then it has like
to do list ideas and things like that
this is going to be great i think i will
use this as my youtube agenda / planner
so that's going to be a lot of fun that
is so cool let's read about it it says
the blue sky day designer weekly planner
is 1599 and it says date designer and
blue sky collaborated to inspire you to
make 2016 your best year yet the chic
and portable weekly pant planner will
keep you on track all year long really
really cute excited about that and then
the extra little thing that they threw
in with the gum as well was the
chapstick total hydration I believe
chapstick sometimes sponsors these boxes
because I get a lot of these soothing
vanilla chopsticks so I think I will
keep it in the packaging and just give
this to my boyfriend because they have
the same thing in last month's box and
then the next thing I see is from
pathology and it says results in five
minutes this is the flash mask trio five
minute facial sheet masks and you guys
know I love to mask so this is perfect
so there's one that exfoliates one that
hydrates and one that illuminates and
comes in a little pouch like this it
says the perfect trio to revitalize and
give skin a youthful boost 3 fast-acting
facial sheet masks deliver results in
just five minutes and traditional sheet
masks can take up to 20 minutes simply
apply take five and go no rinsing
required so you just rub in the essence
again I guess after you use up so this
is what they look like they're just
sheet masks so you have the let's see
flash mask hydrate which is ideal for
dry skin types or anytime that skin is
fatigued and dehydrated and then you
have the illuminate flash mask and this
is ideal for dry skin types or anytime
skin as fatigue and dry dehydrated as
well are they all the same yeah ideal
for dry skin types well it's okay i'm
pretty sure you can use those for any
kind of skin tight but this is the
illuminating one and then you have the
exfoliating one so i'm really really
excited to try these I love masking you
guys probably know that cuz to talk
about math all the time but let's read
about what they say it says pathology
flashmaster trio after the holiday rush
we're all in need of beauty rejuvenation
and fast these fast-acting facial sheets
will revitalize hydrates and illuminate
your skin
in just five minutes and better yet
there's no rinsing required so three of
those are twenty dollars not a twenty
dollars a piece but for the whole trio
all right and then the last thing that I
see in here is a book this is why I love
this box I find like it's so cute so
this is called spark joy it is an
illustrated master class on the art of
organizing and tagging up and I love
organizing I loved hiding up I love all
this kind of stuff it is the number one
New York Times bestselling on tidying up
I guess and yeah it looks super super
cute it gives you different um the
clutter photo shock treatment it
illustrates how to do certain things
have a fold certain clothes to make them
fit into your drawers oh my god this is
cute this is cute that is what it looks
like spark joy and this is a hard cover
which is 1899 so I'm so excited for that
and it says spark joy by Marie Kondo the
New York Times bestselling author and
expert cleaning consultant Marie Kondo
teaches us how to spark joy in our lives
throughout tidying up in the house this
illustrated manual uses her signature
Connie Maddy method to help you stay
organized in the new year and it is 1899
for that book and then at the bottom
they give you let's see here for the
fair this is for the little um like the
bin you can get twenty-five percent off
your next order with the code peh RPO of
P so really really cool I am very very
happy about this box I think it's super
super cute if you are someone who like
enjoys beauty boxes but you also enjoy
boxes that are a little different ones
that have to do with like um organizing
and just having like cute things I feel
like I always get an organized like
organizational piece from them I always
get something that has to do with like
um like not like self-help sort of
things which is like uplifting it's a
very uplifting box I really enjoy
everything that again I always get some
kind of a food item some sort of like
gourmet food item that's really cool and
I just love this box is definitely not
if you are just looking for like a
makeup box it's definitely not
what you're looking for but if you love
all things cute and whimsical and all
