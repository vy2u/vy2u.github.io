sorry if I look a little I don't know
undone I just worked out about 45
minutes ago I've been trying to hit the
gym in my building a little more
frequently and I have not showered yet
so I feel like my hair got really like
you know you could like sweaty and their
hair gets kind of stringy and I really
didn't plan on filming today but I have
this little trip of time right now and I
thought what the heck I know I kind of
look like a mess my makeup did stay on
relatively well I feel like my hair is a
mess but my makeup did sting on
relatively well for running on the
treadmill for 45 minutes but I really
wanted to go ahead and do an unboxing
for you guys because I want to get this
up before the end of the month so this
is the popsugar must have box for the
month of October and I know it looks
like I've opened it but I really haven't
and yeah so let's just get in here the
first thing I see is the little card and
this just shows you guys what you get in
here and i will read for you guys as we
go and then a little card I'm talking
about breast cancer awareness and then
we have the product so the first thing I
see is food related this is the Belgian
boys stroopwafel authentic Dutch caramel
waffle so you get to authentic caramel
waffles in here so these are like those
little cookie waffles they have caramel
in them those look really good really
really yummy um let's read about what
those are I feel like they're just
cookies with them purple in them but we
will read it anyway it says um good to
do deer stew room awful you're steaming
cup of coffee or tea is now complete
with this delicious caramel filled
waffle with its crunchy outside and
chewy inside is the perfect anytime pick
me up and it's one dot 59 cents so yes
the next thing I see in here is the
honest company sea salt push sugar body
scrub in lavender vanilla it is ultra
hydrating exfoliating and softening and
I'm really excited to try this you guys
know I love me some body scrubs so this
looks really really great and it looks
yeah it's got salt and sugar in it so
salt can be a little more abrasive in a
scrub sugar is usually the one that
brands go for because it is a little
more gentle but it is sometimes nice to
have like salt in there because it
really really like sloth off
um top layer of the skin so anyway I'm
excited to try this and it's enriching
and naturally drive hyper allergenic and
I know that honest company is a little
more pricey so let's see what the pipe
is on that the sea salt plus sugar body
scrub is seventeen dollars on the honest
calm website and it says this body scrub
is just what you need after a season in
the Sun the whole grain sugars and sea
salt exfoliate while shea butter and
almond oils hydrate for irresistible
silky skin so I'm excited to try that
out I don't love body scrubs that leave
me with like a huge amount of oil after
i get out of the shower um but i have
been dealing with some eczema on my
wrist lately a dry area so maybe i will
use this on those areas because those
oils in there can actually be very very
nice and healing so um yeah maybe i'll
wait and use this when i'm in a flare-up
or just use it on certain dry areas of
my body but we will see all right to the
next thing I see oh my gosh is so funny
okay so this is the savvy sleepers 100%
satin pillowcase and this is funny
because I am a big advocate of using a
silk or satin pillowcase um i think last
january or februari i did a review on
the illuminage it's like a sixty-dollar
pillowcase from sephora and it is filled
with like copper oxide or I don't even
know there's like some kind of like
copper like sewn into the actual like
satin case and um I know this is totally
not for everybody it feels like this box
was like made for me because literally I
love this kind of stuff um but it really
really does help to not tug at your skin
and your hair I noticed that my hair is
a lot less frizzy in the morning when I
use my iluminage one and also my skin
like I'm not just pulling on it and
tugging on it because you know if you
sleep on your side like this which I do
you know you can really be pulling you
know on the skin near your eye and
things like that and a lot of people
probably will think that this kind of
stuff is unnecessary it's not that it's
unnecessary I think if you're just a
really big skin care advocate and you
love stuff like that it is something
you'll be interested in but I'm sure a
lot of people probably wouldn't care but
I do so I like this
so it says these sappy sleepers welcome
to the slumber party meet your new white
russian one hundred percent pure satin
pillowcase our soothing hand-picked
blend of satin is recommended by top
hair stylist and dermatologists it's
ultra smooth bruh hair and skin with the
secret pocket for love notes lavender or
a sweet surprise so it has like a little
pocket where you can put like dried
lavender leaves or you know something
like Roma therapy-wise I don't know not
like a liquid but you know something
that's dried that's really cute our
little rose pedals or something because
that does help you sleep also um and
easy care instructions machine wash cold
and tumble dry on low and indulge in
this daily spa treatment to wake up with
her fresh skin and calmer hair so I'm
excited for this I will use this one um
when my illuminage one is in the dirty
hamper so I can kind of switch them out
so I'm actually really excited about
that and let's see um it says that
retails for thirty-six dollars which I'm
not surprised about satin and silk
pillowcases tend to be a little more
expensive and it says the luxury satin
pillowcase 100% satin pillowcase
prevents sleep wrinkles reduces hair
breakage and protects salon blowouts for
the ultimate sleep experience so I'm
really excited about that oh my gosh I'm
actually really excited about these do
I'm actually wearing a pair of these
right now I don't know if I can like
lift my leg up here but I am wearing a
pair of light pink ones that i got from
Bath and Body we're not back to
fireworks Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond I always mix
the two up they are aloe infused and
these are just those really really nice
like comfortable soft socks that have
the little grip knees at the bottom so
that you don't slip when you're walking
around I always have these kind of socks
on or slippers when i get home just
because it's just something I do and
also my boyfriend is Asian and that's
just kind of something you do you put on
your socks or your slippers you protect
your feet basically and I've gotten to
habit of doing that and um I also like
what it does for you know my feet it
makes them really really soft but
anyways um I don't know if these aren't
aloe infused these are super cute
they've got the little groupies on the
bottom and then little stripes are very
stretchy and super soft and it says for
richer or poorer hope slipper socks
we're wearing these pink slipper socks
designed by popsugar through October to
support breast cancer awareness
yay yay for pink and it says richer
poorer probably supports the fight
against breast cancer and the important
walk of a right action for women so
these are fifteen dollars I don't know
if these are actually fifteen dollars I
feel like you can get socks like these
for like the ones I got from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond that were like seven dollars with
aloe infused but these are really really
cute though and I do like that it's
court the best cancer and let's see what
else next I see this little one or this
is not a sample sites more like a deluxe
sample size of the it's a 10 miracle
even product and i have the silk leben
and i also have the keratin one i have
those in full sizes i really really love
those too but when i first tried this
one which is just the normal formula it
really weighed my hair down and made it
look greasy so I didn't like it however
that was when I had virgin hair I hadn't
started dyeing it yet and um maybe
that's why it waited down so much so I
will try this out and we will see how it
goes but i really recommend the keratin
and the silk infusion one and it says
it's a 10 miracle even product detangles
as shine stops phrase with this leben
product that works miracles beyond
offering 10 benefits in every bottle
it's a 10 hair care is a proud partner
of right action for women helping
provide advanced cancer screening to
women so that's great suggested retail
of 1196 I don't think it is 1196 for
this um kind of deluxe I sample you
could probably get this well I think
I've gotten one of these for free from
Aldo before but there probably around
more four or five dollars for that kind
of size um alright moving on oh my gosh
these are blind bags oh this is so cute
these are wine bags hmm little paper
weinberg so this one says eat drink and
be amazing super cute i love these
really cute um and this one says x/x x x
rated wine bottle right here and this
one says Cheers these are super cute I
really like these days are really cute
Cheers
and then we have best wine ever super
super cute I like these these are nice
for if you are traveling with wine in
the car things like that you're
traveling to a friend's house whatever
your family house could tack it in here
so both are really really cute I can't
imagine that those are too expensive but
let's see here easy tiger brown paper
liquor bags for whole set is eight
dollars that sounds about right and it
says these easy tiger brown bags are
perfect for your next housewarming or a
halloween party to accompany your
favorite bottle of wine Cheers so that's
a cute little touch and then the last
thing in here oh wow I'm excited about
this so this is the why not need book
this is a hardcover New York Times
bestselling author this is mindy kaling
and i actually watch her show the mindy
project i love that show it is so funny
it's now on hulu I'm exclusively but it
is so funny she's amazing and I've heard
good things about this book and this
book retails in the US for twenty-five
dollars and in Canada for 32 that's what
it says on the back here and this is a
hardcover so I'm really excited to read
this I like reading books like this
right now I'm reading that book by
Michelle Phan never actually really love
her booktube so I'm kind of fun to read
this stuff so if that looks awesome and
yeah awesome i'm excited i'm excited to
do that and that's $25 and this box is
expensive this is thirty nine ninety
five months um but this is 25 plus the
sea salt scrub plus the pillow case
you've already outdone the 3995
definitely on why not me by Mindy Kaling
our favorite author producer and writer
is back at it with her second book why
not me Mindy Kaling shares a collection
of essays that are not only laugh out
loud funny but also shed like to her
less than perfect fit in Hollywood so
really really excited for that that is
awesome and then at the bottom they have
some cards here we've got forty dollar
off forty dollars off the Daniel Stevens
jewelry company so there's a forty
dollar coupon there and then for savvy
sleepers which have those wonderful
little of pillowcases they've got
different sort of colors you can get
twenty percent off another pillowcase
and then
we have the honest company and this is
um thirty percent off your next order so
really really cool I'm definitely happy
with this month's box I really love the
socks I really love the satin pillowcase

on a daily basis and i really love so um
