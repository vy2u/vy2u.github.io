you so much for joining me i hope the
lighting is okay in this video i have
some artificial lighting and natural
lighting coming in but anyway this video
is going to be an unboxing today i'm
very excited this is the popsugar must
have box for the month of September's so
September 2015 unboxing of the popsugar
must have this is an amazing box I have
actually had I think three maybe four of
these boxes so far and I never have
actually shared them on my channel which
is crazy um because I have dug into them
before I can turn on my camera um this
is like a very tempting box it is 3995 a
month which is very very expensive and I
remember the first time I got the box I
was like this better be amazing because
it is probably yeah it is the most
expensive subscription box that I am
like subscribe to so basically it's like
I said 3995 a month that's like that's
that's a lot but I find that every
single month I get products that um
literally there's always like one
product in here that goes over like
forty dollars or 3995 so like you
basically get your money's worth if that
makes sense you usually get over like a
hundred dollars in product like that's
like the retail so um a very very
impressive this is probably my second
favorite subscription box that I get
besides GlossyBox GlossyBox is my
favorite um but yeah so i thought i
would share with you guys for this fun
since i have not opened it yet i've only
taken off like the tape on it so i
thought we would do an unboxing together
and yeah let's get started so this is
what it looks like inside it's a
surprise love enjoy and it has a little
pamphlet that shows what is in here
which whoa I'm excited and I will read
you guys everything so the first thing I
see in here which is amazing and
definitely definitely goes over like a
3995 is the two-faced brow envy this is
a brow shaping and defining kit I
actually do not have this so this is
amazing
if this is like the actual product full
size and this is thirty-nine dollars
that is the retail of this product so
you basically have already paid for the
box with just this one product it says
for MV inducing browse use this
foolproof kit filled with all the tools
you'll need for defined arches and
framed browse it has customizable colors
so you'll get the perfect brows no
matter your face shape or hair color so
like I said that is what it looks like
let's open it up I love to face you guys
know that is my favorite high-end brand
I'm so surprised that I actually don't
even have this but it comes in one of
those little liked it is kind of like
their little boxed um I shadow kids and
this is what it looks like on the inside
has the little pamphlet like usual
that's very two-faced s I guess you
could say it probably has like
directions on how to get a glamour guide
and it looks like it also has the little
mirror right here when you take that out
um let's see what's inside this little
thing who they actually have browse
stencils in here so that's really cool
if you want to follow a brow stencil and
then it has like instructions on how to
get a certain kind of brow and inside
you get a setting wax a highlighter
blonde and brunette so you get the
setting wax the highlight which is kind
of pink toned and then you get the
blonde brow powder and you also get to
the brunette powder so really really
nice you also get a small little angled
brush a spoolie and any little pair of
tweezers so very very cute so excited
for this this already pays for the box
itself this one product so yes already
very very excited and very impressed so
let's see what else is in here um
there's this little ooh little thing
here it says share surprises and is this
thank you for being a loyal must have
subscriber here's ten dollars to give to
a friend family member or co-worker
co-worker to use toward their first must
have box we hope they'll love your
recommendation and enjoy the monthly
surprises so that's really cool to get
to little cards and you can give those
to your friends so they basically are
paying 2995 for their first box which is
great deal alright next we have two
little products in this little bubble
wrap thing here let's pop it open and
check it out so I can find the entrance
um this is the mcla Los Angeles
treatments beauty fashion California so
rich vitamin E enriched cuticle oil it
says a luxurious oil treatment that
promotes strong and healthy nails for a
look that says I've never worked a day
in my life so that's really cute the
packaging looks like that and this is
great for me because i have been using a
nail polish remover that has literally
been ripping my nails to shreds um
probably the fact that it's like a
hundred percent pure acetone so i could
really use this right now so yeah it's a
vitamin e infused cuticle oil it looks
like that comes in kind of like a you
know a little glass container with a
drop or form and a kind of a pink color
and let's see what they say about this
be so rich vitamin e in rich cuticle oil
it's easy to postpone your next trip to
the nail salon with this cuticle oil
that both softens and conditions it says
with just a drop to the cuticle this
strengthening oil will keep your nails
moisturize and smelling divine and this
is a full-size and it is an $18 oil so
again you are basically with this and
the Too Faced combined you have already
paid for the box itself so I'm excited
to try that out and the other little
product that was in here in this little
um packaging is so cute it's like a
little um it's like one of those little
bottles that looks like you're stranded
on an island and you'd like sent
something out you don't even like the
little glass container with the cork at
the top so cute this is the Kris Nations
made in the USA these are symbolic
inspirational and personal recycled
brass with 14 karat gold overlay and
surgical steel post so they are EXO

um Chris nations XO stud earrings feel
the love wherever you go with this
handmade California XO jewelry cut from
recycled brass and plated with 14 karat
gold it will add an understated
sophistication to any ensemble and it is
a $35 so again you have paid for the Fox

see that all those are so cute I will
definitely be wearing those it's like
hugs and kisses and it comes with such a
cute little bottle oh I love that I'm
going to have to keep this little bottle
because that is just too cute so that is
the little earrings you get um let's see

to use because you don't have to like
pump the product out you just spray it

thick so that's going to be nice i'm
definitely excited to try that out and
looks like we have a little snack in
here this is almond two cherries roasted
almonds and turk cherries it's 200
calories for this whole pack and this
looks very healthy um I tend to be a big
like junk food addict so this doesn't
exactly like excite me too much but I
really am trying to figure out healthier
foods and things like that so I really
should try need these but anyway so yeah
it's just tart cherries in here and
roasted almonds bitch it does look quite
good so the cherries are like full and I
