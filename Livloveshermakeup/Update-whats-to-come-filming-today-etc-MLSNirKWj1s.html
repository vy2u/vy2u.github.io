like I'm as I literally just woke up it
has been such an incredibly long week
but I wanted to come on here and give
you guys an update and also give you
guys some information on what will be
going on the next couple of weeks on my
channel so anyway yes I know I looked
like a mess like I said I just spoke up
it was a really long week and not for
any sort of bad reasons I was not sick
I'm sorry if I worried any of you I know
sometimes I drop off the face of the
earth for a few days on my channel and
that's usually when I am sick but this
week I actually got booked for some
really really big gigs and it just
basically took up huge amounts of my
time I got very excited about music this
week and you guys know the rule on my
channel work and music always come first
and it just turned into a music week and
I was really happy about it so I didn't
want to pull in any sort of um i was
gonna say music videos I didn't want to
pull in any sort of makeup videos just
cuz I was really enjoying my time with
my gigs and practicing in just my music
in general so I hope you guys can
understand but today i will be doing
some big filming and i want you guys as
help before i start because you guys
know i don't edit my videos so
definitely let me know down in the
comments section how you guys want to
see the format for these but i'm
definitely reviewing a the new kat von d
palette for you guys today as well as
the lorac mega Pro 3 do you want those
in one video do you want me to combine
them into one video would you guys like
that would you not like that I feel like
I don't have too much to say about the
lorac mega Pro 3 because of the fact
that the formulation is identical to the
other lorac mega Pro palette or not just
mega Pro to pro palace in general so
definitely let me know down below if
that's ok if I combine the two of those
and then I still have to to face
palettes that you guys really want me to
review so what I'm thinking of doing it
basically doing a comparison video today
on all three of the Too Faced pallets
the chocolate shop the hotel cafe and
then also what's the last one think
Olivia think oh yes the macaroons
palette so again let me know do you want
separate reviews on those do you want me
to separately review everything today
that means there will probably be six or
seven videos going up or would you like
me to just combine them do a like three
way comparison that sound so weird
r you a comparison on the two-faced
products and then a double review on the
metal palette from Kat Von D and then
also the lorac mega Pro 3 or do you want
everything separate let me know down
below I'm not going to start filming
until probably about four or five in the
afternoon today because I have some
errands to run this afternoon but
definitely let me know and then I will
let you guys pick basically how I do at
my filming today and then I just wanted
to give you guys a heads up and next
week starts my declutter series which
I'm so excited about now something that
I have decided to do it with my
declutter series is go ahead and still
have my constant videos which I feel
like I haven't really been following
that schedule the past couple of weeks
it's just been so many reviews popping
up all over the place so what I will be
doing is mondays saturdays and sundays
where I have shop and swatch my stash I
have a look of the week and then also
fails in holy grails those will still be
consistent Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Friday those will be the days where I'm
doing declutter of videos so how would
you guys like me to do my teeth clatter
videos do you want me using a tripod and
facing down at my actual drawer or do
you guys mind if I do it kind of like
talk to you where I do the makeup
graveyard thing where I sit on the floor
with all of the makeup around me and
then we declutter that way there were a
few requests last year for something
like that and I would be more than happy
to do that this year I think you'd be
really cool to do like a makeup
graveyard sort of i'm not gonna call it
make up Greg Gard but you noted me do it
in that kind of sense where I'm sitting
on the floor with all the makeup around
me so I can really get to everything I
feel like my makeup drawers right now
are honestly really overflowing and it
just looks kind of ridiculous to the
point where I'm like oh like well I
even get to everything so I'm thinking
sitting on the floor might be easier but
let me know because last year I ended up
like so many people had different
requests on how they wanted me to do it
I ended up literally just sitting on
camera and showing you guys the products
which is something that a lot of people
don't do first of all for shop and SWAT
to my stash or two shop my stash videos
and also for makeup declutter videos but
I don't think I want to do it this that
way that me I don't think I want to do
it that way this year what I want to do
is sit on the floor and do it that way
so anyway let me know about that oh god
I can already feel myself getting a
runny nose like I turn on the camera and
here comes and lastly what
I want to say oh yeah so yeah makeup
declutter videos will start super super
excited about that I'm going to be
decluttering my makeup then going into
my skin care hair care all that kind of
stuff so for the whole month of October
basically it's going to be declutter
video so if you don't like those videos
I'm sorry you may want to take a break
for my channel for about a month but
other than that you can still tune in on
mondays Saturdays and Sundays because I
will have my constant videos then but
yeah that's about it that's my little
update don't worry I am a hundred
percent ok I just had a really fun
filled music week let me know down below
how you guys want me to shoot these
videos today and then let me know how
you want me to shoot my declutter videos
and let my declutter videos and I will
see you guys later literally dying oh
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
