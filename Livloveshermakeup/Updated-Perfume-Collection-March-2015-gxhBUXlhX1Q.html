I'm doing an updated perfume collection
a slash body mist collection video last
one I did it was just really dark and I
did it kind of at nighttime now I'm
doing it during the day so you guys can
really see what it looks like I haven't
moved anything my perfumes are still
right next to my bed they still have
those three little quotes above and it's
still the same table I've just moved
certain things around and added some
things in so let's just get started
so I basically back here I still have
those three body mists I have my fancy
perfume two of the Coach ones and then
this Pacifica one is new it's Tahitian
gardenia and Brazilian mango grapefruit
is also new than I have my vintage bloom
from Jessica Simpson love that bottle so
basically I put these up on a card board
kind of box that opens up it was like
stationary it was like a stationary box
and I went through all the stationery so
I thought - well put that up there
because then I can prop these pretty
bottles up I think these ones are just
so pretty the way they look and
everything so I really wanted to be able
to see those before my collection last
time I had like a mirror on the bottom
and it just got muddled around with
these taller items so I really wanted to
showcase and make sure that all the
little perfumes are propped up so that
those ones are propped up there and then
I have another little prop right here
this is from the Urban Decay eye liner
set during the holidays if you flip it
over it has like slots for it the
eyeliners are but I thought it was the
perfect height to put like my deluxe
sample sizes and smaller little perfumes
like my coche wands flower bomb mist
your stuff like that that I've gotten
from Sephora for like 250 perks I love
the way the little bottles look I think
they're so pretty and I don't want them
to again get muddled around in the
taller stuff so I put them like that and
then I still have this little container
back here that holds all these perfume
samples I'm making my way through those
slowly but surely and then here I still
have my DKNY and
very perfume I have all of these body
mess from Bath and Body Works this is
kind of funny this is a Basic Instinct
sex attractant I got this in one of my
what was it one of my boxes like my
subscription boxes one of my makeup
subscription boxes and I can't remember
it was like glossy box or beauty box
live or something but this came in at
and you can see there's like teeth marks
around there because I can't get it open
I'm not quite sure what it's supposed to
do but someone told me it's like
pheromones in there and you dab it on
your wrists and they're supposed to make
you happy or I don't know whatever I
have like a DKNY rollerball back there
and then I have my pink that I'm almost
done with I am debating whether keeping
the container and filling it up with the
big size so that I can take it when I'm
traveling or just you know recycling it
and then I have my other pink and then
over here I still have my Stila creme
bouquet and my jennifer aniston perfume
I am almost out of this also so I'm
really happy I'm using products up got
my love vanilla ah pure vanilla
fragrance I have the four of these
Victoria's Secret Oh de Parfums and then
I've got to be Paris Hilton's love the
way that smells my Clinique knockoff and
then these are all body mists from Bath
and Body Works and then two in the back
from Victoria's Secret to the makeup
temptation and endless love so anyway so
as you guys can see I really haven't
changed a lot I've just added in like
boxes to kind of pop things up and I
kind of like that everything is lined up
perfectly when I stand up it's easy for
me to look down and see exactly what I
want to get and I just really like the
way this looks so I hope you guys
enjoyed this updated perfume collection
and I'll see you guys in my next video
