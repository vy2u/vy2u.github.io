today I'm going to be reviewing for you
guys the new Urban Decay afterglow
8-hour powder blush it comes in a little
box like this and they have 12 different
shades on the support website for $26
apiece
I only picked up one because I like to
just pick up one or two of new products
just when I'm trying them out to see if
I actually like them or not
so like I said they have 12 different
shades raging shades raging from really
really neutral like light kind of peachy
and pinky colors into some really really
poppy colors like really really dark
like hot pinks reds and even violet
colors for the cheeks so that's pretty
cool um like I said they were $26 each I
will link below where you guys can pick
them up if you are interested but the
shape that I happen to pick up this time
is in in des --nt which is this
beautiful muted kind of orange color
with I would say a tan undertone now I'm
gonna tell you guys right now um it
doesn't is not a new shape to me it
doesn't is a shape that they do have in
the urban decay line already and I do
actually have one of their active glow
blind on cheek tint sinan doesn't that
packaging looks like this and this is a
cream blush so this is what the shade
looks like in this kind of packaging and
this is what the new powder packaging
looks like let me show you guys so as
you can see they're pretty much very
very similar in shade I will say that
the indistinct in the creamy formula is
definitely a little more shimmery it's
got a bit of a gold undertone whereas in
the powder formula it is completely
mapped so that is in the cream formula
and then the powder formula is just
different because it doesn't have that
Sheen so that's the powder formula and
that's the queen formula you really
can't tell the difference they are
technically the same shades like I said
it's just one of them is in a different
formula so anyway um like I said it
doesn't is not new to me and I knew that
when I was looking at the website I was
like I do have a destined to in that um
cream blush product do I want to try it
out in the powder and I just
I really do because I love that color
and I tend to go for powder blushes
there just was easier for me to apply to
my skin they're just what I prefer so I
definitely knew I wanted to get this one
so this is what the packaging actually
looks like I showed you guys the box
already really really cute it's like
this gunmetal silver color it says UD
orbit decay and then on the back it has
the shade and basically the color that
the shade is which I think is a pretty
good match that's this one so you open
it up and there's like this area right
here where they easily could have put a
mirror and I'm like why didn't they put
a mirror you know if they easily
probably could have just put a mirror on
there but they didn't so it's just kind
of like a textured little area right
here and then you get the actual color
so as you guys can see this is just
completely matched
there is absolutely no shimmer in this
and the texture is just beyond
perfection it feels like butter it feels
like they are in their Urban Decay Naked
palette you know those really really
great matte shades like I thought
they're so creamy and so beautiful
that's what this feels like
it's just glides on so beautifully um
this particular shade like I said they
have like a range of really really
neutral shades - really really bright
colors and this particular shade is
obviously very very neutral it is not a
typical Coral I'm going to show you guys
right now what a typical like bright
coral looks like to me this is
Illamasqua powder blush in lover this is
like a bright bright kind of coral color
whereas this one definitely has a like
tan undertone to it can you guys see
that I also wanted to show you really
quickly a few colors that are kind of
similar this is the ELF powder blush in
candid coral it's just got that um how
would you explain it like it just has
that kind of brownish undertone also the
Maybelline fit me in light nude is
pretty close as well but I just wanted
to show you guys so you could see it's
not like that typical bright coral color
it's more of that coral color that
orange coral color with a nude undertone
which i think is beautiful because it
gives a really understated look on the
cheeks
and sometimes you want that I am wearing
it today and you guys might be like I
can't tell I can't see it on your skin
um it really like I said just gives this
beautiful beautiful like undertone where
it's like it's so neutral that it's
really considered in my opinion and
understated blush and I just love it
it's not too bright it's not like the
Milani one that's like bright bright
coral like that it's really just neutral
it's beautiful and I really really like
it so like I said really really
understated I kind of wanted to go for
that I don't know I was just feeling it
because I really loved this in doesn't
shade in the cream formula so I thought
you know I might as well get it in the
powder and I'm really happy I got this
one I do love the formula I'm definitely
going to pick up a few more shades
probably they have this really really
great hot pink color called quickie
which is with a blue undertone and like
I need that in my life they also have a
bright red orange which is called bang
they even have a bright purple which is
called bittersweet which is one that has
also been in their line for a while like
the shade um so anyway I'm really really
happy with the formula the color the
texture everything is just really really
wonderful I will say that it does last
on the actual skin for quite a long time
like I said this a very understated
color that I picked up so you might not
be able to see but I can see that
there's color on my face so it's just
one of those things where if you're
doing like a really really big I look
and lots of color maybe you want a more
understated blush and understated
blushes can definitely have their
benefits in your collection trophy so um
anyway really really happy with that
I'm gonna read for you guys a little bit
about what it says on these before
website it says Urban Decay active glow
blush $26 each like I said there are
twelve different shades it says what it
is a blendable finally melt powder blush
that sweeps on beautifully and delivers
eight hours of streak free color and I
just want to say it is so plentiful the
fact that it's so powdery and just feels
so good um it's so easy to blend to the
skin I had no issues whatsoever putting
it on I can really build up the color it
just moves around on the face
beautifully you can really really put it
exactly where you want to I
says what it does urban decay after glow
blush leaves a sexy lit from within glow
fakey perfect flush with these eight our
formula that creates the lingering
radiant skin of a romantic rendezvous in
rendezvous infused with light diffusing
pigments to enhance and perfect the skin
at this highly blendable finely milled
formula goes on sheer and provides eight
hours of long a lightweight wearable
ultra creamy color and it is free of
parabens so anyway I really really loved
it and I think that it kind of says it
kind of explains on the packaging you
know afterglow it's one of those blushes
that like they said is supposed to give
like a really nice luminous look to the
skin even though this color doesn't is
completely matte it just does give that
really really nice light flush of color
on the cheeks and I love it so anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this review I will
link below where you can pick this
product up in the description bar below
and I'll see you guys in my next month
