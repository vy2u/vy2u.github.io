in this video I am giving you guys my
thoughts so my sub watches and also a
demo on the new Urban Decay afterglow 8
hour powder highlighters and to pick up
all three shades that were released for
the spring or summer 2016 collection and
I purchased these for $26 a piece on the
Urban Decay calm website I will link
below in the description bar where you
guys can pick them up if you are
interested these are going to be
permanent items in the Urban Decay
collection so don't worry if you don't
get your hands on them right away they
will be permanent let me read a little
bit about what it says on the back of
the boxes here it says create a glow a
strobe defected that won't quit this
super lightweight finely milled powder
highlighter feels super soft blends
easily and delivers up to eight hours of
wear so that is basically what they say
on their website and on the back of the
boxes they describe these as really
really pigmented but sheer qualities
sort of highlighters that are very
smooth and creamy to the touch and that
blends seamlessly into the skin so this
is what the actual packaging looks like
they all come in this gorgeous little
kind of like hyper glossy pink I don't
even know how to describe this so many
colors going on here this gorgeous
gorgeous sort of astro glow a little box
and they all come separately the three
shades that you can pick up our aura
which is a gorgeous kind of light pink
shade then we have sin which is a
gorgeous champagne shade and then the
last one we have is called fireball
which is a beautiful kind of peachy
shade so I will say two of these are
amazing as highlighters on my particular
skin tone I am fair skinned and I really
really love the shade aura and also the
shade of sin I will say right away at
the shade fireball is a little dark as a
highlight on my particular skin tone but
I love wearing it as a blush topper
really really gorgeous so right here we
have fireball
this one is aura which is that gorgeous
kind of light pink almost purpley shade
it's got a little bit of lavender in
there and then we have sin right here
which is that beautiful champagne shade
and this is the one I will be doing at
the demo with at the end so the actual
packaging looks like this a very similar
to the Urban Decay blushes that came
like this I think I have the shade in
decent and essence in
you resistance something like that
indecency I don't know what it was it
was something like that and it was a
beautiful kind of matte peachy shade and
it has the same exact packaging there is
no mirror here and I think a lot of
people are confused as to why so there
are thoughts on this for that because
this is such a pigmented item that just
like the blushes that come in the
packaging like this you can put your
brush in there and then this little area
right here is actually kind of like
texture and you can wipe your brush off
there so that you're kind of getting off
any sort of access on the brush instead
of just tapping it off you can actually
wipe it on the little screen right here
which I think it's really really cool so
the consistency of these are really
really nice I feel like they're not
exactly how they described them but
they're very very similar to what urban
decay has released over and over again
as far as their line is concerned I have
always found the urban decay eye shadows
urban decay blushes are very very highly
pigmented but they have a little bit of
grit to them whether it has a lot of
chunky glitter in it or even just a
little bit of shimmer I have never found
that their eyeshadows or their blushes
are super super smooth and easy to like
touch or blend now I will say I don't
really mean like blending because I feel
like they do blend nicely but I feel
like the urban decay shadows and also
just their blushes and things like that
in general can be just a little more
difficult to work with that's just my
personal opinion I would say these
highlighters are no different so I feel
like when you dip your finger in there
with all three shades you feel it and it
doesn't feel super super smooth and
creamy but you're getting extreme
extreme pigmentation right there all of
them are beautifully beautifully
pigmented they all have the same
formulation and as you guys can see I
hope you can see that you do get a
little bit of kick up with this product
but they have this sort of grip to them
so that it doesn't seem very very
powdery so even though they do pick up a
little bit of product it's not something
that's going to get like it's huge
amounts of fallout all over your cheeks
if you wanted to use these as eyeshadows
I feel like you wouldn't get huge
amounts of fallout either but this is
what the three shades look like I'm
gonna go ahead and swatch them so the
first one we have here is fireball which
is that beautiful kind of peachy shade
and it has a beautiful kind of
iridescent purple pinky shimmer running
through it and none of these actually
have glitter in them they just have
gorgeous gorgeous shimmery effect to
them and then the second one here is sin
which is that gorgeous kind of champagne
e color and then the last one we have is
aura which is a beautiful kind of light
pink color with a beautiful lavender at
your add essence running through it so
we have fireball sin and aura so they
are really really beautiful I love sin
and I love aura for highlighting my
particular skin tone like I said
fireball is a little darker when I move
my hands you can see it starts to darken
up which doesn't really make it a
highlight on my skin now when I saw the
photos online I kind of figured it
wouldn't be because it was so dark but I
still really really do like it I think
it has that beautiful pinky sort of
iridescent lavender quality running
through it which makes it really unique
and special so these really do have an
incredible wear time on them just like
the eight hour blush or the 16 hour
blush I think no the eight hour blush
that they have in the same packaging it
has this weird time that really is just
incredible they go onto the cheeks
beautifully and I feel like these do
that as well they really go on and they
stick onto your skin I'm going to say if
you have dry skin or aging skin I think
that these are gonna be a little
textured on your particular skin type I
notice that these really really cling to
dry areas on my skin I do have
combination skin so I am a lot more oily
in my t-zone rather than my cheeks
however I notice that if I don't blend
these in really really nicely on my skin
they sit on top of my skin now I don't
really like that with highlighters I
prefer something that just looks
beautiful and luminous not something
that's literally going to sit on top of
my skin and start to cake up or look a
little textured and I find that the
formulation of these because they do
have a little bit of grip to them they
just sometimes will sit unevenly on
textured areas so I feel like if you do
have dry skin you really want to make
sure you moisturize prime your face
before putting on these highlighters my
favorite way to use these is definitely
with my Sigma tapered highlighter at 35
brush this is what it looks like it is
quite densely packed but it does have a
little bit of gift to it and I really
like to put it on and really go back and
forth and blend it into my skin like I
said they are all very very pigmented
and beautiful but I feel like you really
have to buff these into your skin to get
a gorgeous gorgeous luminous effect if
you use a fan brush it's just not going
to I don't
sit on the skin in a nice way if that
makes sense it is just going to sit on
top of the skin and you really don't
want that with your highlight because
then you notice like it starts to settle
into fine lines and wrinkles and your
pores and things like that so that is
what I recommend what these highlighters
really really buffing it into the skin
using a brush that's not completely
dense but a little more dense than a fan
brush and yeah I think the quality of
them is really really nice again they're
not super super creamy to the touch but
I expect that now with urban decay
products however what you actually get
the pigmentation and how they actually
appear on your face is really really
beautiful and I think $26 for this
particular product it's a really really
nice price you do get 6.8 grams or 0.23
ounces of product in each one and I
think that is really really great so
anyway I really really do like these I
think my only concern is that they're
not really one of those highlighters
that I would go to if I were like in a
hurry or something like that because I
feel like they do take a little bit of
work you really do need to blend them
into your skin if you don't have like
that five minutes to do so then you
probably wouldn't want to pick up these
highlighters because they're just a
little more high maintenance than some
of the other highlighters that are out
there like the becca ones or you know
products like that so anyway I'm going
to go ahead and get into the demo now
and yeah let's get started so I am going
to be using the shades spin which looks
like this that beautiful champagne color
I'm gonna take my Sigma f-35 yes at 35
I'm going to tap into tea I'm going to
tap into the product and then go right
onto the little graph screen right there
wipe off the excess and I'm just going
to put that on to my chin do the same
thing and I'm really kind of buffing it
into my skin as you guys can see I'm not
just going like oh you know I'm really
kind of going back and forth making sure
that it is blended in there then I'm
going to tap back in and I'm going to go
down the bridge of my nose and a little
bit up between my brows and I'm really
kind of going back and forth you know I
keep saying that but I feel like you
really have to do that with these
products then I'm going to go back in
again tap off on the screen and then hit
my cheek
and I'm really kind of pushing there I'm
not just like I said I'm not just going
oh like this I'm really kind of pushing
in here almost bending the brush a
little bit and blending blending
blending from the apple of my cheek all
the way up to you know the top of my
cheekbone here I'm gonna go back in
there what I do like about these
highlighters is that they are very very
buildable on the skin so you can
definitely build up a sheer wash of
color you can build it from a sheer
highlight to a full-on like you know
highlight a full-on in-your-face kind of
highlight okay and then I'm going to do
it on the other side as well
just make sure everything is completely
blended and that is it so I really
really do it like these highlighters I
think they gave a beautiful beautiful
glow to the skin they don't have any
chunks but litter in them I just think
the only thing that you really need to
make sure that you do is that you really
kind of buff them into the skin and
blend them into the skin but overall
they're all very very beautiful I love
that champagne color sin which is the
one I just demoed with and that gorgeous
gorgeous color right here aura that
beautiful pink shade is just beautiful
like it just has this gorgeous kind of
lavender quality running through it
which is amazing and then of course
fireball also has that beautiful sort of
your add essence
lavender and pink quality running
through it as well I'm gonna go ahead
and swatch them one more time on the
back of my hand and I'm going to build
them up a little more so you guys can
see because I think the first time I
swatch them I didn't build them up that
much um just doesn't want you guys to
see that they are very very buildable
and Dusan as well sorry if I sound a
little stuffed up I am stuffed up so
there are the three swatched again and
these are built up so we have Ora
we have fireball and sin and then I'm
wearing stone on my face so I hope you
guys enjoyed this review on the new
afterglow eight our powder highlighters
from Urban Decay I really I'm liking
them I think it is a good price I would
say if you have really fair skin you
might not like fireball it's really
really only good as a like blush topper
I think the most flattering one on fair
skin is actually aura but the reason I
demoed with sin is because I feel like
sting is going to be a very popular
shade with everybody because I have that
gorgeous kind of golden undertone to it
so overall really nice products I just
think it's typical Urban Decay very very
pigmented but they're a little rough and
you do have to work with them and blend
them into the skin really great bear
power and yeah I don't have much else to
say I hope you guys enjoyed this review
thank you for joining me and I'll see
you tomorrow bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
