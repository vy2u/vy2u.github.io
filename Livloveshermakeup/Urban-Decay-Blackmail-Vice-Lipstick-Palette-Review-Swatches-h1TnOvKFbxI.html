video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Urban Decay black
male vise lipstick palette this is a $35
limited edition palette that I purchased
on the ulta.com website it is
exclusively sold at Ulta and Macy's and
this is one of two Urban Decay vice
lipstick palettes that will be dropping
this holiday season the other one is
called the junkie vise lipstick palettes
that is also limited edition also $35
but that one will be sold exclusively at
Sephora so I know a few people were
asking why didn't they release them at
the same time it's because they will be
sold at different stores so anyway here
is the outer packaging for the black
mail lipstick palette it says indulge
your lipstick vise we loaded this
limited-edition palette with a dozen
shades from our massive collection dark
sexy hues bold brights and insanely
versatile neutrals experiment with
shades like Firebird which is a deep
fuchsia cream 714 which is a bright red
megamat you also have nineteen ninety
three which is in medium brown matte
conspiracy which is a plum bronze
shimmer and black mail which is a deep
berry matte our proprietary pigment
infusion system delivers rich color
payoff with a super creamy feel and the
enclosed lip brush provides the perfect
application so as you can see on the
back here it shows you all the shades
that you get and the little actual lip
brush the first shade you have here is
this year and it is called sheer shame
you also get Firebird which is more of
like a cream consistency big bang
definitely has some glitter in there
you're getting disobedient which is a
matte ez is also a matte 714 is one of
their super or mega masks vanish'd is a
sheer you're also getting 1993 which is
a matte
ex-girlfriend is also shear amulet is
more of a cream conspiracy is more of a
cream as well and then blackmail is one
of those super mats again so that is the
outer packaging the actual packaging
looks like this very very beautiful but
as you guys can see it gets fingerprints
all over it it says Urban Decay vice
right there and it is gunmetal and
mirrored and then on the back also
mirrored but a soft gold you open it up
and you get a huge-ass mirror which I
love because I feel like any time I'm
using a lip palette it's usually when
I'm traveling so that is what it looks
like right here is this lipstick is my
vice and I love this this is actually a
little protective flap to help to make
sure that your lipsticks do not dry out
one of the things that I hate about
someone with the other lip palettes that
I have honestly is just the fact that
they have started to dry out so I really
enjoy that they put that little flap in
there and then here are the actual
shades that you get if I can get this
around all right there
here are the shades that you're getting
in here so this is the black male
palette so it's a little more neutral I
heard that the junky Bice lipstick
palette or the pictures that I've seen
it's definitely like a little more
bright so if you want really really
bright colors and I think it even has a
green lipstick in there I would go with
the junky vice lipstick palette but if
you want one that's a little more
neutral you're getting everyday pink
shades some reds and some neutrals down
here then I would highly recommend going
for this one I still want to pick up the
junkie because I'm loving this so much
but yeah this is what it looks like on
the inside my favorite thing about this
is the fact that there are so many
different finishes in here one of my
biggest complaints with lip palettes
that I personally own are that they are
either super super glossy or super super
matte right here I have this Sephora lip
mixology palette I almost feel like this
is a lip gloss palette because
everything is just super super glossy I
have this Bobbi Brown University lip
palette there are only two shimmer
shades in here the rest are completely
completely matte and then this one right
here from Tarte did this is the kiss and
blush cream cheek and lip palette
there's only one shimmer shade
everything else is completely matched
now I've kind of changed the way that
like I've used lip products this year I
really have noticed that I like
comfortable comfortable lip products so
they're one of the reasons why I really
enjoy this palette is because sure
they're giving you some cream shades and
some matte shades but you also are
getting those really really beautiful
sheer shades and I am wearing this one
right now which is called sheer shame
and it's just so glossy and so so
comfortable I've been wearing it for
about two and a half hours and I feel
like it has stayed on relatively well I
will say the actual staying power on all
of these is incredible obviously the
more matte shades have a longer staying
power but the glossy shades stay on
quite nicely and I did do some
practicing this morning
with my flute and I don't feel like it
wore off that back like at all anyway
let me show you guys the actual lip
brush that you get here this is the
little mini lip brush and it's adorable
because look it's retractable I think
it's so cute I love when a lip palette
has like a retractable lip pencil or lip
brush like this because first of all
they tend to get
gunky towards the top the other day I
was wearing the shade what is it
what was that grin oh this is
disobedience that's on there if you're
wondering that kind of like mid toned
pinky cool tone color but anyway I
really really like when they have the
protector like this because it just kind
of helps the lip brush like if you
didn't clean it right away like I did
obviously and then you know you just
have like some protection there so that
it doesn't get all gunky and disgusting
so I really like that I do think the lip
brush is nice it's not like the best one
I've ever used I do prefer something a
little bigger than this because this
particular one is super super small and
slender but it's really nice if you're
working with one of the heavier like
have really heavily pigmented lip colors
in here it's nice because you really can
put it precisely where you want to one
of the reasons why I really like this as
well is because I haven't noticed any
sort of feathering with any of the
shades in here which is kind of
ridiculous because I personally have a
full-size of the urban decay what was it
- the revolution lipstick I have that in
the shame shame and also let me see if I
have it here in 1993 so anyway I always
find that this feathers outside of my
lip line I do have to pull in my Urban
Decay zero lipliner and for whatever
reason the actual colors in here I feel
like they don't feather at all so they
have an incredibly long wear time even
the glossy shades or the sheer shades
and then on top of that they don't
feather outside of my lip line so this
particular formulation is thebomb.com
I do not have any full sizes of the lips
of the Vice lipstick like formulation
however like I said I do have some of
these old revolution lipsticks so I of
course wanted to compare this shade
right here which is 1993 I wanted to
compare this formulation to the one
that's inside the palette I will say
right away I don't feel like any sort of
lip palette is the same pigmentation at
it as it is when it's in actual lipstick
formulation like lipstick form does that
make sense I feel like these are a
little more here than what you get in an
actual lipstick but I still feel like
they are pretty darn similar here is
1993 from the actual palette and this
one is also matte but as you guys can
see it's just a little more sheer and
it's definitely a little more glossy it
does dry down completely it will go
completely matte on your lips but for
the most part I would say that I find
that the actual formulations in here are
a lot more sheer than what these full
sizes are I have done a lot of swatching
of the Urban Decay vice lipsticks in
Sephora so I
have seen like what they can look like
and I do feel like they do happen to be
a little more shear in this palette but
I don't mind because I like comfortable
lip products and I'm not one of those
people that needs to have like a super
super heavily pigmented lip on it I feel
like if you want to do that then you're
probably better off with going ahead and
getting the full size or using like a
liquid matte liquid matte lipstick so
anyway I just think this is a really
wonderful wonderful palette love the
finishes love that you're getting glossy
shades in here even the glittery shade
like I said Big Ben still has a lot of
pigment to it and I just love how all of
these wear on my lips so I really have
nothing bad to say I love that this is
the first holiday palette that I picked
up this year and it's amazing so anyway
let me know down below if you would like
me to also pick up that chunky lip of
ice palette and I will go ahead and I
will do a comparison for you guys but
anyway let's go ahead and get into some
swatches the first shade that we have
here is sheer shame and this is the one
that I'm wearing today like I said it's
a beautiful beautiful kind of light
purpley pinky color and there it is I
really like the sheer formulation next
we have Firebird which is another shear
and that is what it looks like they're
super super glossy and well no this
one's more of a cream I would say I'm
sorry it's hard to tell when you look at
them so this one is the cream as you can
see is still really really glossy but
very very opaque and nice and it does
seem rather glossy on the lips next we
have Big Bang which is that an
italicized color with like glitter in
there it's not as comfortable to wear
but still it's beautiful if you're
really into those metallic lips you can
actually top any of the lipsticks in
here with that particular one and then
we also have disobedient which is a
beautiful kind of matte cream color and
this one's like a mid-tone cool toned
pink I really really like this shade so
there is the pink variety that you get
in this palette again I love that it's
actually kind of sectioned off in two
different colors so you're getting like
four pinky shades then you're getting
two red shades and then you're getting
neutral shades and then like a deep
berry I think that's so so so cool
alright moving on let's go ahead and
swatch it the two red shades the first
one is easy and easy is that matte
formulation it doesn't look like it when
you first watch it but it's like that
cream matte and then 714 is their ultra
matte so I would say that 714 is
definitely like that brick red
color cool undertone whereas the other
one definitely has more of an orange
undertone so easy has more of an orange
undertone and then this one's more of
like that brick red so there is easy and
also 7:14 and then we are going to be
moving on to the next little section and
that is let's see here vanish will do
1993 will do ex-girlfriend and also we
will do the shade amulet I'm just trying
to boys off these swatches because
they're quite heavily pigmented and they
do stain I don't want you guys to be
able to see anything else alright so
moving on the first shade we have here
is vanish which is a sheer it's
beautiful it's like that perfect sort of
a new color so if you're really into
nude kind of glossy lips you would love
this
it definitely has more of a yellow
undertone so probably best for those who
do have a warm complexion I have a cool
undertone and it doesn't look that great
on me but it looks very nice when I
actually layer it on top of 1993
so 1993 is that matte brown color right
there and this one reminds me a lot of
touch of spice from Maybelline I don't
know if you guys have ever tried that
out but it reminds me a lot of that now
we have ex-girlfriend which is more of a
sheer formulation and this one's nice it
has more of a pinky undertone so this
has more of a yellowy undertone more a
pinky undertone there and then the last
kind of neutral color we have here as
amulet and amulet is probably my
favorite in the palette you guys it's
absolutely stunning it's got more of a
berry or pinky undertone and this one is
one of their creams so there are all of
these sort of neutral colors that you
get in this palette really really
beautiful and then they last you that
you get are kind of like I guess I would
just call them the dark colors and the
palettes you're getting the shade
conspiracy which is almost like game
it's got a little bit it's definitely a
cream formulation because it's got a
little bit of like nut glitter in it but
it's got a little bit of Sheen to it and
then you're also getting blackmail
blackmail is one of those ultra mattes
but I really like this shade conspiracy
because it's like this weird dirty
brownish color but it also has a little
bit of purple in it it's honestly kind
of strange but it's very pretty so there
is conspiracy and then if you are
getting blackmail and blackmail is just
straight-up
very very max
I like it because it looks super dark it
actually reminds me of shame in the
revolution lipstick formulation it looks
super dark but then when you blend it
out you can see it's actually a deep
purple color and that one is like an
ultra matte alright guys so those are
all of these swatches like I said really
really impressed with this I don't
really have anything bad to say like
what was the last time I said that in a
review I really don't have anything bad
to say I think this is an absolutely
fantastic lip palette you're getting so
many different finishes I love the way
that they stay on the lips they have a
long wear time they're very comfortable
even those really really matte shades I
would say the matte shades are the ones
I'm worried about kind of drying out
quick quicker than the others but I do
like that this has a little flap here so
overall really really nice little lip
palette highly recommend picking this up
I already know I'm going to declutter
this one and i'll so i'm gonna declutter
my Bobbi Brown lip palette so that I can
have this one and also the junkie so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and swatches thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
