my channel today I have a review and
swatches for you guys on the new Urban
Decay heavy metals palette I did
purchase this for $55 on the ulta.com
website which is quite pricey it will be
in stores on October 29th if you would
like to go ahead and scoop it up but
this is part of their holiday 2017
collection so it is a limited edition up
and this palette does contain 20 new and
exclusive metallic eyeshadow so let's go
ahead and start with the packaging
because the packaging is very very
problematic I have no idea if you guys
can see this I'm going to go ahead and
insert a little bit of a clip here but
this packaging is just incredibly
obnoxious it's very hard if you're a
beauty vlogger and trying to film it
because everything is very reflective
and when you actually pull the palette
out which yes it does slide out of this
little cover right here which has sort
of like a wavy imprint on it this is
just plastic as you guys can see this is
what it looks like on the inside I'm
gonna do my best to kind of cover up the
mirror here so I don't blind you guys
but this is probably the crummiest
packaging I think Urban Decay has ever
done I am all for brands taking a more
artistic approach when it comes to their
packaging but it also has to be somewhat
user friendly okay and I feel like this
packaging right here the fact that it
slides out is a little purple cover and
then you literally just have a mirror
sitting right there in the middle it's
just very strange you can't really prop
this up on anything because it's just
loose like this I mean it's the
strangest packaging I've ever seen I
would give the packaging 1 out of 5
stars however I have to say an overall
formula pigmentation and what this
palette actually is I would definitely
give a strong 3.5 or 4 star rating
now you may be thinking three stars
isn't that great too but I recently made
the honest Asti of Beverly Hills Prizm
palette a three star rating and I feel
like this one is a little even higher
than that I'm loving what's going on in
here I will say as you guys can see
there is more of like a warm tone side
over here and then a cool tone side over
here I will be doing live swatches for
you guys towards the end of the video a
heavy time stamp down below if you would
like to fast forward but the majority of
these are just absolutely beautiful now
today I do have on these shades dive as
well as amp paired together and I smoked
those out on my
or lashline I'm really really loving the
overall formula on these guys right here
there are a few misses in here I feel
like urban decay is kind of known for
having a little more pigment but also a
little more grit to their shadows they
will never feel super soft and buttery
I've never found that urban decay
shadows have been particularly soft and
buttery so if you are a little more of a
formula snob or if you're kind of a snob
when it comes to actual texture for your
shadows you may not love these but I
feel like they go into the eyes
beautifully they stay all day and they
don't crease on me and overall I'm just
very very impressed with the formula so
the formula across the board is
definitely that foiled metallics sort of
finish if you are not into that you're
not gonna like this palette what I like
about this palette is that they're not
advertising it as anything that it's not
supposed to be this is a true metallic
eyeshadow palette and they're marketing
it as a metallic eyeshadow palette if
you are thinking about purchasing this
palette you want to know ahead of time
that there are absolutely no finishes in
here except for metallic eye shades so I
kind of like that Urban Decay did that
and they're basically I feel like urban
decay is the king or the queen of having
really really high intensity a more
glittery but also just high-impact high
shine high color saturation eyes shadows
so I feel like this is a great fit for
it they're lying it totally screams
urban decay to me and overall I'm pretty
happy with the formula now there are a
few shades in here that I will say are
definitely working litter infused I feel
like urban decay is one of those brands
urban decay in two phases
just keep going at it with the glitter
infused shades I'm just not into it
whether it's on that and you in flues
infused glitter in there or whether it's
a metallic eye shade and you infused a
shitload of glitter in there it makes it
more gritty it makes it harder to work
with and you do have to go ahead and
really really kind of pile those on so
the shades that I feel like are missing
here are definitely this one right here
which is called Angel Fire and this one
has a little bit of a grit to it as you
guys can see it doesn't swatch
particularly well I'll just do a little
swatch right here but you guys will see
later when I do the up-close swatches
but it's just got a little grit to it it
definitely isn't beautiful but when you
first put it on you really have to
pack it up and build it on to the lid
and with this guy I would recommend a
glitter glue you can get the elf glitter
glue for about three to five dollars or
the Too Faced shadow insurance at
glitter glue which is also fantastic
there are also a few shades in here that
I'm just like hey you know that could
have been done better definitely the
Purple's it's not that these Purple's
aren't great because I feel like the
overall formula going on here in the
pigmentation level for these Purple's is
pretty good but you can see there's a
little bit of chunkiness chunkiness
Chucky Chucky this and you definitely
have to go ahead and layer these on top
of one another however I feel like
there's more hits in here than misses
and that's really really what is
boggling my mind and why I'm so excited
with this but yes this is definitely a
supplementary palette so let me go ahead
and show you some of my favorite shades
the first one is definitely this one
which is called Starfire it's just a
really really beautiful metallus eyes
kind of Auburn orange kind of color that
is a one swipe swatch you can see the
pigmentation going on here for the most
part of this palette I would say 75% of
this palette is absolutely insane and
beautiful if you want to take these and
tap them onto your later or if you want
to go ahead and smoke them out on your
lower lash line like I like to do I
think it's amazing now do you want to
warn you guys if you are a little more
like a beginner or kind of intermediate
even makeup kind of like I am and you're
not a professional and these are
extremely hard to work into the crease
and into the outer V at least for me
someone with my skills so if your skill
level is around mine or if your skill
level is less than mine and these are
not going to be something that you are
going to be able to work into the crease
into the outer V there is a lot of fall
out no matter if you use a glitter glue
or not and on top of that they're just
hard to blend I feel like I can't find a
solid brush that can really pick up as
this particular shadow formula in here
really nicely to be able to build it up
I really have to keep you know layering
it on and I just think it's kind of a
pain in the ass I like to do I'm gonna
make up pretty quickly in the morning so
that's just a no-go for me but overall
you guys I feel like if you'd know what
you're getting in here and you want
something and you you have like a matte
palette say you have a matte palette at
home it can be the Sonia Kashuk eye on
neutral palette or the Urban Decay Naked
basics palette or the new Tarte toasted
palette and you want to add in a little
bit of a high shine in
these are amazing for going ahead and
doing so these warm tone shades over
here are very very nice and you can go
ahead and add those on to the lid or
smoke them out on the lower lash line
it's just a fun way to give a little
more shine to and everyday or basic eye
look so obviously these are more
everyday friendly colors over here I
feel like there are more misses on this
side you guys will see that when I do
the swatches there are more hits as far
as formula is concerned over here or
just as far as pigmentation and things
like that is concerned the majority of
the bright colors over here and the
majority of the jewel tones are very
soft and foiled and gorgeous I mean look
at this shade right here do you guys see
that glam rock I mean this is just
amazing look at that one swipe swatch
just absolutely beautiful so I feel like
if you're gonna go ahead and take this
palette for what it is you guys are
really gonna enjoy it would highly
recommend for anybody who is like more
of a beginner or intermediate level with
makeup I feel like you're gonna love
this for adding some shine and sparkle
to your lower lash line and your lid and
if you are a professional and make up a
makeup artist I think you could actually
use this all over your eye like you
could work this into your outer V into
your crease you guys can say yeah I'm
pretty excited about this palette really
really has been impressing me and I know
a lot of people were telling me as well
it seems like Tim Talia who is a blogger
but she seems to really enjoy this
palette as well I feel like I've only
heard good things about this palette so
far and I hope you guys know I am also
giving this a pretty good rating so this
is very cool very urban decay ask and
not a huge fan of the packaging but I
think if you take the palette for what
it is you are going to enjoy it so now
let's go ahead and jump right into some
swatches
alright guys I got two zoomed in a
little closer let's go ahead and begin
with these swatches I want to start with
the cooler side of the palette and we're
gonna go ahead and swatch the first four
shades we have ground as well as
aluminum we have spandex and a dive so
let's go ahead and start with ground
ground easily really really beautiful
deep a deep kind of slate gray black
color with a little bit of a I would
call it a silver and purple shift to it
so this is what did these shaded ground
looks like up next we have aluminum
which is just a true dark silver it is
absolutely beautiful very very soft and
buttery definitely prone to fall out if
you do work it into the crease or outer
V like I said
like to do a lot of outer-v or crease
work with these guys just because they
can be a little on the chunky side but
absolutely beautiful on the lid as well
as smoke down on the lower lash line up
next we do have spandex spandex is a
really nice kind of deep purple shade it
does have a little bit of a blueshift
running through it it doesn't swatch as
well as the other shades I feel like
purples are just kind of hard to do in
general I always notice that with
palettes but there is the shade spandex
and then finally we have dive dive is
one of these shades that I do have a mix
together on my lower lash line today it
is beautiful but it does take a little
bit of building up to get to a full of
pigment level so let me go ahead and
blow off the excess there at the top we
have ground the second shade is aluminum
that we have spandex and then we have a
dive
those are the first four shades on the
cool tone side of the palette moving on
to the next four shades in the palette
we have metal head punk rock mullet as
well as amped so let's go ahead and
swatch those out metal head is a really
pretty purple color it's definitely a
little more on the bright tone side
compared to spandex and this one kind of
has a little bit of a pinky hue to it as
well as a little bit of a blueshift
running through it so there is the shade
and metal head up next we have punk rock
punk rock almost looks like it could be
long on the warm tone side of the
pallets because it's actually pretty
neutral
it's a beautiful cranberry color again a
little bit on the chunky side these
shadows just tend to be because they are
so foiled they have a little bit of
chunkiness to them but this is
absolutely beautiful really nice and
muted plumbery sort of color plum
berries little thing it's the thing now
all right up next we have a really nice
smooth one this is called mullet and
mullet just has this beautiful green
color to it it's got a little bit of
depth to it maybe a little bit of a
blueshift running through there but it's
a gorgeous shade and then finally we
have amp and ampie is one of the shades
that i also do have smoked out on my
lower lash line today it is
stunning okay and this color is just
absolutely everything it's a beautiful
beautiful bright turquoise blue shade so
at the top we have metal head underneath
that we have punk rock and then we have
mullet and then we have the shade amp
alright guys and finally we have the
last two cool tone shades of the
palettes one of them is not even cool
toned it definitely could have been on
the
the palette but it's called twisted
which is just a gorgeous kind of
greenish gold shade this one base the
glory and Starfire all paired together
beautifully so here is what this looks
like
it definitely has little more glitter
particles to it definitely is prone to
fall out would recommend tapping this on
with your finger not a brush okay this
one just doesn't do well with a brush
whatsoever and then we have a glam rock
and glam rock is just a beautiful
beautiful silver shade with a lot of
like opalescent white tones are running
through it aluminum is a little darker
this one is not it's just amazing as you
guys can see and this one is super soft
and buttery one of the best in the
palette alright guys moving on to the
warm tone side of the palette we're
gonna go ahead and swatch the top four
shades the first one we have is base I
saw a few people calling this backs when
they were swatching it out but it
spelled the same way as like string base
so I'm gonna go ahead and say it's base
and then we have this shade glory that
we have demo and Starfire so base is
just a really really beautiful a grungy
kind of dark greenish grayish grays
Brown I don't know how else to describe
it I feel like this color is very in
right now it's absolutely beautiful it
goes on so foiled and nice onto the lid
so I really like this one up next we
have Gloria Gloria is basically the same
sort of color same sort of undertones
except it's just a hair lighter and I
really like this one as well I think
it's beautiful the two of these together
would be paired beautifully I mean the
two of these would just look amazing
together I should try that up next we
have demo demos a little more cool toned
and this one definitely has a little
more cranberry kind of hues running
through it or reddish tones running
through it even though it is cool tone
you know what it's not red tones it's
plummy tones running through it now this
one can be a little problematic we would
definitely recommend packing this on
with your finger the majority of these I
recommend packing onto your lid with
your finger instead of attempting to use
a brush this one can cause a lot of
fallout it's a gorgeous shade but it's
just one of those shades that is a
little chunkier than the others just
wanted to give you a heads up and then
finally we have Starfire which is like
one of the best shades in the palette it
is so beautiful and buttery and gorgeous
I just I really really enjoy it so those
are the top four shades on the warm
tongue side of the palette at the top we
have bases that we have glory then demo
than a Starfire all right guys I'm
moving on to the last six shades on the
warm town side of the palette we have
afterparty we have angel fire rody made
in the scream and acoustic so
after-party is a beautiful beautiful red
plummy cranberry shade it really is
gorgeous and this one goes on absolutely
just stunning stunning stunning blue
okay that's after party the next up we
have angel fire Angel Fire is great for
tapping all over the lid or even wearing
as highlight but I will say this one is
definitely a little on the patchy side I
feel like I really have to build it up
and layer it up so I'm just gonna show
you what the one swatch looks like I
mean it's pretty it's pretty glittery as
you can see but if you do build it up
it's actually very very pretty and yes I
can actually wear those his face
highlighter as long as I go in after and
I take like a larger brush to sweep away
the excess eye glitter so and that is
what Angel Fire looks like up next we
have a rody
which is a beautiful kind of plummy
color and it does have a little bit of
brown running through it and this one
can be a slightly troublesome just
because I feel like the pigmentation
isn't a hundred percent but it's still
really nice next up we have mated which
is a beautiful kind of soft taupey color
with a little bit of a gold Sheen
running through it I really love this
one I think it's great for tapping all
over the lid so there it is and then the
next one we have a scream screams like a
light lavender shade I really love this
it's a beautiful kind of light lavender
shade and it definitely has a little bit
of a silver sparkle to it that is what
Maiden I'm sorry scream looks like and
then finally we have acoustic which is
just a beautiful beautiful silvery gray
color so those are the last six shades
on at the warm tone side of the palette
like I said in my review I definitely
preferred the other side of the palette
big cool tones side I just feel like
overall the quality is better on that
side but not to say that these aren't
good so we have after party than we have
angel fire that we have rody that we
have Maiden than we have scream and then
acoustic so that is it for the swatches
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for joining me guys and I
will see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
