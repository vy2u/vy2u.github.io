video is going to be a review and
swatches on the new Urban Decay junkie
vise lipstick palette I did purchases
for $35 on the Sephora calm website this
is a limited edition and it is exclusive
to Sephora the black male palette which
I reviewed about a week and a half ago
I'll leave a link for that video down
below in the description bar if you'd
like to watch it and that one is
exclusive to Ulta so you can get the
junkie at Sephora and then you can get
the black male at Ulta this obviously
you are getting twelve lipstick pans
with 0.02 ounces the product in them
just like the black male palette these
are the new advice lipstick formulations
and in between the two of them the only
overlap of colors who are getting our
three so they each have 12 different
lipstick shades in them and the three
overlapping shades that you are getting
are 714 big bang and Firebirds so this
is not going to be a comparison video
between the two I will be doing one of
those probably later this week or next
week a few of you were asking if I would
go ahead and do separate reviews on them
first and then do a comparison with
side-by-side swatches so this is just
the review and swatches on the junkie
that's what we're concentrating on in
this video here is the outer packaging
it is identical to the black nail it
shows you all the shades at the bottom
as well as the little retractable lip I
want to say pencil every single time
they retractable lip brush so here is
what the retractable lip brush looks
like it's super super cute and very very
nice my only problem with this is that
it is hard to get the product out of it
now the outer packaging looks like this
it is a nice mirror effect it obviously
does get fingerprints identical to the
black male palettes you do have a large
size mirror here and again you have the
lipstick is my vise with the little
cover right here which protects your
lipsticks from drying out so here are
the twelve shades that you are getting
in the junkie palette very very pretty
and basically what they were going for
here is that the junkie palette was
supposed to be really kind of in your
face and like wham-bam and the black
male palette is a little more neutral I
have to say I honestly think that the
only two shades in this particular
palette that are like really out there
are really studded and junky studded is
kind of a gray color junkie is a green
color I was wearing that on my lips
yesterday
and trust me the color is beautiful but
it does not stay on the lips at all so
formulation wise I think there are a few
misses in this one I absolutely adore
the black male palate I do prefer the
formulation in there
I'm not going to going to return this I
still think it's beautiful and I don't
mind having overlaps of colors yes it
would have been better if they couldn't
if they didn't overlap any sort of
colors but for the most part this is
still a really really wonderful palette
so like I said you are getting 12 shades
you're getting some purpley shade some
red shades you are getting a few
neutrals just like the actual black male
palette and then you are getting those
two kind of pops of colors so here is
the first one right here that is a pop
of color and that is junkie which is
that green color and it goes on really
really nicely but then it starts to
settle into your lip line it literally
will ball up on any sort of area where
you do have any texture and it starts
wearing off and you can tell immediately
so it has a really really bad staying
power in my opinion if you wanted to get
this palette just for that green shade I
would highly recommend just checking out
the black male palettes because you're
still getting pops of color in there but
I just I think it's better so here is
the junky shade and then this is studded
which is that grayish shade these are
probably the two weakest colors in the
actual pilot which is funny considering
most people would buy this one instead
of the black meal because of those two
colors so overall I would just say you
know if you are really really trying to
buy this because of those two colors
just go ahead and get the black male
palette I think that the black male
palette has the most consistent
formulation they have a few more of the
hydrating and sheer formulations in
there which I do prefer but if you are
someone who likes a lot of cream
finishes and a lot of masks and this is
a good one for you so overall besides
those two shades right there every other
one is really really good you are
getting a nice amount it finishes in
here you're getting on some of their
creams their mega mattes regular mattes
and then you are getting I think one or
two sheer shades you're also getting
those glittery shades which BIGBANG is
one of those that we had it in the last
palette as well and these are actually
very pigmented there are a lot more
pigmented than the sheer shades if you
were curious so yeah anyway let's go
ahead and start so watching this baby I
know this is going to be a really quick
review but since they are did or do the
other one there's not much to say so the
first shade we have here is called
disturbed it kind of reminds me of shame
it is definitely more of a cream
formulation very very pigmented and the
reason why it reminds me of shame is
because it looks a lot darker in the pan
then when you swatch it out when you
swatch it out you can see it really is a
true berry color the in actually that we
have is 714 which is the duplicate when
you actually the duplicate from the
blackmail palette when you put your
finger in here it feels very very drying
but when you actually put it on your
skin or on to your lips it actually is a
lot more satiny but this is one of their
mega mattes
so there is 714 the next day that we
have here is a beautiful beautiful nude
color I really like this a lot it's a
really nice creamy finish you guys this
is called carnal there is carnal kind of
like a your lips but better but
seriously it's got a little bit of mauve
in there it's absolutely stunning I do
think that both palettes have a really
nice amount of neutrals in them so there
is carnal and then we also have these
shade I'm safeword and Sam I love that
name I'm safe where it is kind of like a
grayish undertone but it's a nudie color
as well and this one is kind of similar
to a carnal and there it is so there's
carnal and then there is safeword so
we're all just looking at those right
there I think you have some beautiful
beautiful colors in here again I like
what they did with the color selection
you're still getting reds and you're
still getting like neutral colors in
there it's not just like a palette
filled with pops of color and then the
last two shades that we have towards the
top are that grey shade which is studded
and studded is more of like a sheer
creamy formulation they call it a creme
but in my opinion has a little more of a
sheer formulation and then you have whip
and whip is one of those glittery kind
of shades and it's a nude so there is
studded and then there is whip and
studied like I said is that kind of
pretty greyish color you really have to
pack this one on for it to show up but
it has a beautiful you're a dustin's to
it and then whip is basically like a
gloss with just love it's a shimmer in
it so there it is it's like a peachy
nude color I don't really love that
color because I feel like okay well I
could get that literally with my $2.00
you know elf lip gloss or something like
that but it's still quite nice and then
we have the bottom row here so here is
the bottom row and we are going to start
with wrath I really like wrath this is a
beautiful creamy formulation the shade
is like a nice orange --red but it has
like a little bit of shine to it I think
it's beautiful it's like I'm italicize
finish
so here it yeah I was gonna say here it
looks like here it is this is what it
looks like so it's very beautiful can
you see that shine on it I really like
that and then we have that Big Bang
shade which again is a duplicate from
the black male palette really really
nice kind of hot pink color with a
little bit of glitter in there you could
top this on any sort of color in this
palette and get a nice metallo sized
finish but the reason why I like this
one over whip is because it has you know
some color to the actual base on like
whip then we have Firebird which again
is another duplicate from the other
palette and this is kind of like a
bright fuchsia pinky color and this is a
crab so there is a fire bird I love that
oh that's swatch that's a big one but I
love Firebird I think it's gorgeous and
then we have this nice vanity kill shade
now this is the same formulation as that
714 shade really really like when you
put your finger in there you're like I'm
gonna hate this on my lips but it
actually goes on quite satiny so there
is a vanity kills really nice kind of
lilac color if you are someone who loves
those really iridescent kind of light
pink cool tone pink kind of colors you
would like that a lot alright and then
the last two shades we have our
speedboat which is a really really nice
creme formulation of a dark purple a
true dark purple I really like this a
lot I think it's a beautiful shade let
me show you guys I'm just watching on
the other hand and then we also have
junkie which like I said chunky is
beautiful and I feel like it swatches
really nicely but on the lips it's
really crappy and I don't know if it's
because of the actual color while I like
the formulation is not as good but it's
just not as good so it does have little
bits of a ho - we didn't squash that
great either this is our I feel like it
goes on the lips so it basically is a
darker green color and you do have tons
and tons of like goldish shimmer in
there it's beautiful to look at and when
you first put it on it looks so good and
yesterday in a video someone even
commented they were like girl that lip
shade like no I know like when you first
put it on it looks amazing but then like
I start swearing off and then it looks
like like really bad like you have
hypothermia on your lips amazingly what
she said in that guy was laughing so
hard
but anyway so there like I said is the
junkie shade and then here is that
purpley color which is called speed ball
fast ball speed ball yeah speed ball I
love
Abell nice creamy finish and then this
one I just you know kind of a bummer so
when I did the side-by-side comparison I
will have swatches but overall I
recommend the black male palette I feel
like you're still getting pops of color
in there if you wanted this particular
palette for that junky shade well let me
tell ya it's a shitty formula so don't
go with that again I don't know what
happened here would be like the tube
pops of color with studded and also
junkie I don't feel like they look as
good on the lips I don't feel like
studded is like super creamy I don't
feel like a super pigmented so I don't
really know what happened with those two
shades that's the only reason why I
would pick this over the black male I am
going to still keep it because I love
having palettes like this for travel so
I do like it but if you were just eyeing
those two particular shades you should
just go with the black no palette so
anyway I hope you enjoyed this little
review and swatches and I will see you
guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
