my channel this video is going to be
part two of my first impressions on the
Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation I've
been wearing this for almost eight hours
now it is currently at 9:20 p.m. as you
guys can see and I did apply this for
the first time earlier today around 1:45
with you guys so I've been wearing it
for almost eight hours I did apply a
primer on both sides of my face and then
on this side of my face I applied it
with a brush and on this side a sponge
so let me give me guidance you can see
what it is looking like on my skin I got
to say I am so incredibly impressed this
is definitely worth the hype no like no
question about it
seriously this is something I probably
will repurchase if you didn't know urban
decay is a cruelty free brand they are
owned by care and company that does
tests on animals but they themselves do
not test their products on animals so
this shade 0.5 ended up be really nice
on my skin throughout the day so here is
the side with the brush you can
definitely see there is a little more
dryness going on here but decide what
the sponge still looks absolutely
incredible and smooth and beautiful so I
think this is held up really really well
I did not have to powder at all today
when I parted with you guys this morning
around my t-zone my eye area and my
cheeks that was it I did not powder my
forehead and I still feel like
everything stayed on relatively well I
have been a little dry around my
forehead lately you guys could probably
notice in the past couple first
impressions videos it's just been very
very dry and kind of flaky so I didn't
also any powder there I still feel like
the foundation held up really really
nicely
it looks beautiful too the gorgeous
gorgeous color on my skin 20.5 she does
lean a little more in the yellow town
side but it really did not oxidize
whatsoever kind of like the Urban Decay
all nighter foundation and I just feel
like overall it looks incredible after
eight hours of wear so I am very very
impressed you guys I think this is a
beautiful foundation would HIGHLY highly
recommend it this is probably the most
impressed I have been since I tried out
the giorgio armani luminous silk
foundation so very very happy with this
we'll continue to use it and if you are
looking into it I would highly recommend
it especially if you do have more normal
I feel like combo skin dry skin
everybody's going to like this I feel
like it's at beautifully on my dry
patches but yet it didn't make me a lead
throughout the day it's kind of just
like the perfect foundation so yeah
really rave review coming up here I will
give you guys my final thoughts after
using this a few more times
definitely looks for that video in the
next couple of weeks but yes super
impressed I would get this 5 out of 5
stars so far so that is it thank you so
much for joining me guys and I'll see
you smile bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
