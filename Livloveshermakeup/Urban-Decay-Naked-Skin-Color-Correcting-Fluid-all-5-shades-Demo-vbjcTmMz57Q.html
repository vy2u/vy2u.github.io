video is going to be a demo on all five
of the new naked skin color correcting
fluids I'm going to be showing you guys
how I apply these on my face if you are
interested in seeing a review on these
products I did review them yesterday I
went into depth on how long they wear
you know where I purchased them all that
kind of stuff so I will link that video
down below in the description bar if you
are interested in seeing that but if you
want to see them applied to my face and
see how I apply them to my face then you
guys can just keep watching
so the shades that we have here are
yellow which is just a yellow shade we
have pink we have green / mint we have
lavender and then we have peach and I'm
going to go ahead and be using all of
these so the first one I want to start
with is actually going to be I think
lavender I think we'll start with
lavender actually now let's start with
yellow I want to start with correcting
under the eye area so I'm going to take
yellow and I am going to put this
underneath my eye area I really like
this for brightening underneath it's
really really nice
so I am just basically painting that on
to my face right underneath the eye area
I like the way this brightness and I do
want to say really quickly I am not
wearing anything on my face right now if
you are curious I am wearing nothing I
just cleaned my face with some micellar
water I actually did a demo right before
this so I removed all my makeup with my
seller water and now I'm just showing
you guys how I use these products all
right so the way that I like to use the
yellow one is just to contract any blues
that I have underneath my eyes these are
really nice they are kind of like a
pastel II sort of color but I really
like the way that this particular one
covers up my dark circles so the next
one I'm going to go in is with the next
one I'm going to go in with is mint /
green and I'm going to use this to
counteract any redness in my skin I
really like to use it on active
breakouts and I like the way that it
corrects so I'm gonna put that right
here along my chin where I have some
hormonal breakouts
I'm also going to put it anywhere else
where I have some more model break guys
I just got it in my hair I don't know
how some of these girls on YouTube do it
where they like literally do a full face
of makeup without a head
I normally wear those really really ugly
like six thick headbands but I just
thought I don't look cute when I read
that was on camera so I try and wear
this cute one and then of course it gets
in my hair anyway the next one I'm gonna
go in with it's called pink and this is
just a pastel pinky color and I'm going
to put this on areas that I want to
brighten so I'm gonna put this around my
eyelids that's where I want to pull
right in and kind of lift I'm gonna put
this all over my eyelids my friend Amy
made a really good point in her review
and demo yesterday on these products she
was saying that these actually work
really nicely as an eye base as well and
I have to agree with her they're really
really nice so we're just kind of put it
on sloppily
don't worry it's okay we're gonna blend
everything out and then I'm gonna go in
with lavender and I like to use this on
areas where I have like fine lines and
things like that just because it kind of
lifts any sort of deep sets areas that
that makes sense so it will contract any
solidness in the skin so I'm gonna put
that around my mouth and then I like to
put it right here and right here a
little bit right above my eyebrows to
kind of lift and then I look like a
kitty okay whiskers and then the last
one we're going in with is peach and I
like to use this for hyperpigmentation
it is a peachy color you can use this
underneath your eyes as well but I
prefer the way that the yellow one works
you can combine both of them I just
thought today I would show you like one
of each on certain parts of my face so
I'm doing this on hyperpigmentation that
I have along my jawline and I am just
plating that right on I love these
little applicators so easy to just plop
it all over your face alright now we are
going to blend it in my preferred method
is with eating a beauty blender or Real
Techniques sponge so I'm going to be
taking at my Beauty Blender and I'm just
going to go ahead and blend all of this
in and what I love about these creatures
is that they correct without leaving
huge amounts of like color without
depositing huge amounts of color on your
face they're very nice and opaque and I
feel like they do give a little bit of
coverage not like a concealer because
they're not a concealer
they are a color corrector however
they're so nice because you can actually
put them on you could put you could put
them on underneath your foundation and
then you can put them on again after you
have applied your foundation which is
what I'm going to do so you guys can see
how I do that as well but like look at
the way that that green one is even
blending in like that is so nice these
are my favorite ones so far that I have
tried out the past couple of weeks I
will be doing a collab video with my
friend Amy we have been picking up all
of the new color correctors like all the
new kits and we're gonna pick up the
Tarte ones and everything like that and
we thought it would be fun to do a
collab on how to find the right like
color corrector like if you want to get
the singles or the palettes like which
one is best for you and your skin type /
tone so I really really excited about
that we're gonna do that in March but
anyway you guys can see that completely
basically color corrected my face it's
not concealing certain areas but it's
doing a better job of concealing than
the product that I've demoed earlier
today which is the Stila correct and
perfect palette so I really love it I
love the blend ability it's so easy to
use they do set rather quickly so you
don't want you do want to kind of blend
right away but you guys can see it's
still blunted nicely even though I had
like a little time in between each
because I wanted to show you all of them
on my face at once but anyway now we are
just gonna go in with our foundation
that the foundation that I have been
using this week is the Laura Mercier
Kamla Glo soft luminous foundation my
shade is shell and I am just going to
apply a few pumps of if it's course not
the smallest amount I'm just gonna buy a
apply a few pumps of this onto my face
just like an even layer all over
and then we are gonna go back in with
the color correctors and I don't feel
like I need any extra color correcting
but I just want to show you guys that
you can go on top of your foundation as
well and even on top of your concealer
if you want and it won't show up because
these are so nice they have that pastel
quality to them so they're not super
super dark and opaque they have that
beautiful like I don't know just that
beautiful kind of pastel color to them
so they're really nice color correctors
without being harsh I feel like they do
the job without being harsh alright so
what I'm thinking is that we will let me
check out my face and see I think we'll
go in with the green again right here
where I have some hormonal breakouts so
that we can color correct that area one
more time so I'm going back in with the
green or mint shade and I'm just kind of
dabbing that on there hmm I guess we'll
do this little guy up here as well just
so I can show you guys to how well it
sits on top of the foundation it's
amazing it's up and then I think I'm
gonna go in with the pink one as well
and I want to go in the like little V
area of my eye I want to show you guys
how I do that so I basically do what I
did with the yellow one I'm just kind of
going down and bringing it up so that I
get a little bit of a lift I really want
to kind of bite in that area and this is
basically going to act as my under-eye
concealer I'm not even gonna go in with
my concealer that I have been wearing
this week which is the Tarte rainforest
of the sea aqua sealer and I'm going to
go in with concealer I just want you
guys to be able to see how nicely these
color correct the face to the point
where you almost don't even need a
concealer so then I'm going to go back
in with my Beauty Blender and I'm just
going to blend
I think it's the most noticeable was
probably the green like when you do want
to put it on top of your foundation you
can tell a little bit but there's a
little bit of a green tint and
especially when you use the peach one as
well because that one is the darkest
shade you can tell like on top of the
foundation but once you put your powder
on everything will even back out and
it's just amazing I don't know these
color correctors are awesome I mean they
kind of almost do the job at concealing
your face as well which is awesome you
know what just for kicks we'll go in
with concealer so that I show you guys
the full face of what I normally would
do so I am going to go in with my Tarte
aqua sealer my shade is fair and I'm
going to go underneath the eyes and I
feel like I have a lot of product
underneath the eyes but that's okay
underneath the eyes and then I'm gonna
go on any areas where I have active
breakouts and then on my eyelids as well
not applying too much just a little bit
because we did do two layers but the
correctors go back in with my Beauty
Blender and blend that out and I think
because these correctors do give a lot
of coverage you really don't need a
super super heavy heavy heavy concealer
this one does build up nicely this part
one you can definitely build a few
layers and get really really nice
coverage out of it however one layer is
really really nice very brave skin like
in my opinion alright guys so there we
did our foundation we did our color
correctors and we concealed and I feel
like it just looks like a blank slate
like I need to put some color back into
my face but you guys can see it really
did cancel out some redness I feel like
you can't see my under-eye circles as
much and I got about five hours of sleep
last night so that says a lot and I
definitely am having some hormonal
breakouts so I think it does a really
really nice job again that foundation
that I used is not very heavy coverage
so it didn't like really cover anything
that much it
it's nice to see that these correctors
have a little bit of concealing
properties to them as well and I like
that they have that pastel color to them
because they're not so noticeable when
you blend them out so let's go ahead and
set this stuff in I'm going to be taking
my Rimmel stay matte long-lasting
pressed powder in 0:01 transparent and
my it cosmetics Buki buffing brush and
just swirling into the product and I'm
going to set in everything that we just
did all the work we just did so this
doesn't have any color to it it's just
completely transparent so I didn't want
it to interfere with the color
correcting work we had just done I just
want you guys to see how everything
looks when it's nice and matte as well
so overall I love these color correctors
I feel like they really do have some
nice creamy concealing benefits to them
you don't need to like go in with
concealer almost and I obviously did for
this video because I was thinking oh
well you know what I might as well do
the whole the whole shebang but for the
most part you really don't need to and I
think that's so awesome so anyway that
is the demo on all side of the new Urban
Decay color correcting fluids I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I should
probably go put some blush on and put
some color back into my face but thank
you so much for joining me and I'll see
you guys in my next video
