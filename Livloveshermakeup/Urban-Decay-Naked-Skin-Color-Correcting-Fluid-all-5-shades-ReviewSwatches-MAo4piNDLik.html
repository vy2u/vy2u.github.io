thank you so much for joining me in this
video I am giving you guys my review and
swatches on all five of the new Urban
Decay Naked skin color correcting fluids
I think all five of these at my local
Sephora calm
Sephora calm my local Sephora store you
can also get them on these sephora.com
website as of right now which is
February 17th 2016 it is they're only
available for VIP exclusive members and
also VIP Rouge so I'm sure that will
change in about a week but you can go
ahead even if you're not VIP or VIP
Bruce you can go I didn't call your
support and see if they have them in
store I mean and I'm sure that they
probably have them in the back like they
did for mine so you can go ahead and
pick them up there but anyway let me
read a little bit about what it says all
these sephora.com website so you guys
can get a better understanding of what
these products are supposed to be like
so these are the Urban Decay Naked skin
color correcting fluids there are five
different shades the first one is called
mint which is supposed to reduce redness
you also have yellow which corrects
dullness you have pinch which masks dark
circles and spots lavender which
balances sullenness
and then you have pink which brightens
dark areas these are a collection of
high-end color correcting formulas that
blur the look of imperfections correct
imperfections and play up your best
features all without having to lug
around a whole contour kit with five
color neutralizing shades to target
every skin concern Urban Decay's naked
skin color correcting fluid features an
innovative lightweight formula that
instantly color corrects and blurs flaws
leaving skin illuminated and bright it
says subtle pearlescent pigments diffuse
light on the skin while antioxidant rich
vitamin C and E condition and protect
unlike a lot of cream base color
correctors this liquid formula is easy
to use and always blends flawlessly for
a smooth even application they are all
formulated without parabens sulfates and
fatal aids and it says you can see the
shade through the clear bottle so it's
easy to find the right one in your bag
no need to carry a brush either the
modern flocked applicator picks up and
lays down just the right amount of
product and it's often us to use on the
delicate under-eye area choose the shade
that targets your skin concerns
green reduces redness lavender balances
Salamis
Brighton's dark areas yellow corrects
dullness and peach a massive dark
circles and dark spots so anyway let me
show you guys what the packaging looks
like for all of these they all come in
these adorable little silver boxes that
look like this and they have a little
sticker of the color on whichever one
you're getting they have a sticker on
the back so this one says peach and it
tells you what it does in math dark
circles and dark spots so the actual
packaging looks like this which i think
is really really cute you can see the
product right through there and I think
it's beautiful I really like this fill
for packaging I think it's nice and I
really do like that you can see the
product right through there it is
acrylic not glass or anything like that
and I believe these are the same size as
the Urban Decay Naked concealers I do
have a little bit of experience with the
Urban Decay Naked concealers I
personally never fell in love with a
formula I had about two samples and I
just thought it really really settled
into the fine lines underneath my eyes
so I was never really into it and never
ended up purchasing a full-size I know
that was a lot of people's Holy Grail
concealer it just personally did not
work out for me and when I was watching
these in store I didn't notice that the
Urban Decay concealer like The Naked
skin concealer nothing much more thick
like consistency to it whereas these
have a lot more of a sting consistency
and that would make sense because these
are color correctors they're not
concealers so what I really like about
these compared to other color correctors
is the fact that they are basically like
pastel my friend Amy said they kind of
look like Easter eggs and they really
kind of do they have this beautiful
pastel quality to them so I think if you
are a beginner when it comes to color
correcting you are going to love these
because the color is not super super
dark and opaque I recently did a review
on all of these Becca concealers are the
back of correctors I really really
adored these products but check out that
color like these are very very opaque
and even though they do blend really
nicely underneath foundation I feel like
these Urban Decay ones are so nice
because you can wear them on top of your
foundation so I am wearing all five
shades today you probably can't tell
where I'm wearing them so I'm gonna go
ahead and walk you guys through each one
tell you what I like about them and what
I use them for so quickly I want to show
you guys what the applicator looks like
on all of them they call this a flock to
doe foot applicator and basically it's a
very very skinny when you look at it
like this
and when you turn it it's a very very
flat so it's very easy to get anywhere
that you want underneath the eye area
your chin wherever you want it's a very
very easy to put that little applicator
in and it's very very soft and flexible
so you can get it underneath your eye
area so this is the first one this one
is called mint and this basically or
it's called green I don't know why it's
called mint on the website green on the
actual packaging but this is supposed to
color correct redness so what I like to
use this for is on any sort of active
breakouts any sort of redness they may
have around my nose or even if I have a
little bit of like rashes going on like
rosacea or something like that
this is what I like to use the products
for what I love about these is that they
are so creamy and blendable and you can
see they have that really really light
kind of color to them they're very very
much like pastel II they're not super
super opaque so you can actually wear
this on top of your foundation like I
said today I am wearing underneath I
have it underneath my foundation and
then I put all my products on and then I
put it on again and then I put my
concealer on so I feel like you can't
really tell that it's on my skin even
though I put it over my foundation as
well so I think that's really really
nice and that's why it beginners as far
as color correcting goes I think a lot
of beginners would really really enjoy
using that because they're so easy to
blend they have such a fantastic formula
and I love that they dried down to not
like a matte finish but like a Demi
matte finish so that it's like the
product isn't moving around on your face
I want to say really quickly I will be
doing a demo on these tomorrow if you
guys are interested so right now like I
said it's February 17th right yeah
February 17th 2016 so if you come back
in a few days or even tomorrow I will
have the link right below in this video
I just didn't want to make this too long
I don't edit my video so I didn't want
this video to be too long with a demo in
there but the demo will be up on all of
these products tomorrow and I will show
you guys how I use them underneath
foundation and also on top of foundation
so anyway that is the first one it is
called mint our green and I love that
all of them just blend so seamlessly you
can barely tell it's on my skin but it
really really does neutralize any sort
of redness that you might have on your
skin the next day they want to talk
about is peach and this one it looks
like this this is actually the darkest
color out of the bunch and what I like
to use this for is hyperpigmentation
along my jaw line from hormonal
be and also I like to put it on any sort
of age spots I may have so there it is
swatched out and I will blend it out so
you guys can see as well they all have
the same formulation they all dry down
to that beautiful kind of Demi matte
semi matte finish it's really really
lovely nothing feels greasy or super
super like humectant on the skin that
was one of the things about the Becca
correctors is that they stay very very
moist on the skin you really have to set
them whereas with these I feel like you
could get away with not having to set in
your foundation and set in these color
correctors so there is the shade peach
the next one is called pink and it looks
like this it's basically like a baby
doll kind of pink it'd be a really
pretty lip gloss shade actually and this
one is really really nice just for
brightening off any sort of areas I
actually like to put it underneath my
eye in like the little triangle shape
this is what it looks like and then
blend it out it looks like this really
really nice especially if you have a
fair-skinned and then the next one is
lavender and what I like to use this for
is to kind of brighten up any areas
where they have fine lines it really
just kind of makes the skin not look as
dull so I like to put it around on my
smile lines I also like to put it here
and over here where I have a few fine
lines and it's just a beautiful kind of
pearlescent lavender shade go ahead and
swatch it for you guys and like I said
the formulation on all of these is it
like identical so that is the lavender
shade right there please excuse my dry
wrist and then the last one that we have
is this one right here which is yellow
and this corrects any kind of like blue
tones that you may have in your skin I
really like it on the inner corner of
the eye and right down here though that
little area right there I don't go in
the whole triangle I just put it right
here where I get really really blue and
it's wonderful so it's just a beautiful
it looks like a little Easter your
beautiful yellow shade and there it is
I'm gonna go ahead and blend it out
sorry I put it kind of close to the
peach one but there is you guys get the
peak at the point so overall I would say
my favorite ones are at the yellow one I
really really enjoy pink and I love
lavender just because I feel like um on
a day to day basis I would really use
the green one or the peach one I do like
the peach one there's just something
about it
necessarily it kind of darkens up a
little bit and I prefer using color
correcting products that are really
going to blend into my skin so I don't
have to sit there for hours and hours
and hours I'm just saying that hours but
you know what I mean so I don't have to
sit there for more than 10 minutes
blending something in on my skin one of
the things that I liked about the Becca
ones where the fact that they blend
really really easily because they do
have that really nice humectant formula
but the thing about the urban decay ones
is that they do set and they dry kind of
quickly so you want to make sure you put
it on and then you blend right away my
favorite way to use it is definitely
with a damp and Beauty Blender you just
can't go wrong and that is what I will
be demonstrating with tomorrow when I do
the demo but overall guys I think these
are absolutely fantastic fantastic color
correcting fluids like I said $28 a
piece is quite pricey you do get let's
see here point 21 ounces in here but I
think the application the method
everything about it is really really
fantastic again if you are a beginner
with color correcting products and you
don't want to just take something that's
completely opaque and slap it on your
face I think you're absolutely going to
love leaves the blend ability the way
that they set on the skin everything is
fantastic
I will say these we're a very long time
I have been wearing them now for about
nine plus hours and I feel like they
look great
underneath makeup they look great on top
of makeup they don't settle into my fine
lines or crevasse kind of like the Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer did it
actually really slick settled into my
fine lines and I didn't like that at all
I just didn't like that the formulation
of these is a lot lighter it's a lot
easier to work with and it's easier to
blend and I feel like they don't settle
into my fine lines whatsoever around my
mouth either on my forehead everything
is just really really good they wear a
very long time especially if you are
wearing a primer with them and I think
that they really really do color correct
I'm not gonna stay here and say oh my
gosh they conceal you know they conceal
things on your face because they don't
conceal they're not meant for that
they're meant to color correct so if you
are combating you know if you want to
combat redness on your face you would go
ahead and use the green one for the
beach one if you have hyperpigmentation
you know these are just going to help
kind of camouflage your skin and they're
not necessarily going to cover your skin
so that's just something to be aware of
but overall I think these are
absolutely fantastic I think they're
adorable I think they're very much worth
the money and yeah they're just a really
really fantastic products I hope you
guys enjoyed this video the demo will be
up tomorrow and I will link it at the in
the description bar of this video and
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video
