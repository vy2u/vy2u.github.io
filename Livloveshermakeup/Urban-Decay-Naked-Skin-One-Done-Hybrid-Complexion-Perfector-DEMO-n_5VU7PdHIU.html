thank you so much for joining me I hope
you're all having a fantastic day I just
woke up and I am here to do a demo for
you guys on the new Urban Decay Naked
Skin one and done hybrid complexion
Perfector so I just put on my morning
skincare and I did review this product
yesterday so if you would like you
review where I picked it up how much it
was all that kind of stuff
I'll go ahead and link that video down
below in the description bar it will be
the first thing that you see and yeah in
that video a few of you were asking for
a demo on this product and to see how I
like to apply it and that's what I'm
doing so let's just get right into it
I am going to put my headband in so I
don't get any product in my hair and we
shall just get right into it so today
I'm just going to use this as is if you
guys watched the review video you know
that I like to wear this underneath
foundation but for the sake of this
video I am just going to be wearing this
today and then I'm going to set it in
with my essence all about Matt 16
compact powder so what I like to do is
go ahead and take four pumps of this and
just use it with my fingers it really is
like you one-and-done sort of product I
really like the way it dries on my skin
at least kind of like a demi matte
finish and I almost don't need to go in
with powder but because I have a long
day today I'm gonna go set it with
powder so I'm gonna take four pumps on
the back of my hand just like that I'm
gonna rub it together and then I'm going
to apply this all over my face with my
fingers I have tried this with a Beauty
Blender I also tried with like a damp or
Real Techniques sponge how I just
scratch myself it looks really really
good either way like whichever way you
want to apply it but I find that it's
really really nice when you apply it
with your fingers because you just blend
in all of the product really really
quickly and easily I think I'm wearing
an oil today
um as my moisturizer so yeah just so you
guys know if you're seeing a little bit
of a sheen before I even started putting
the product on it is from that alright
so I'm just gonna let it sit there for a
second and kind of seekin quickly so
that you guys can see what it looks like
how it leaves that kind of getting that
sort of appearance on the skin
let me check in
with my mirror to make sure that I
blended it completely so that is for
pumped and as you guys can see I feel
like my skin looks a little more evened
out it doesn't have amazing coverage by
any means and that is why I normally
like to go back in with my foundation
and go over on top of it because I feel
like it is kind of just like a starter
product if that makes sense like it's a
really really nice kind of primer base
but I feel like it does give pretty
light coverage and you guys will start
to see in a minute here that it just
starts to dry down to this really
beautiful kind of Demi matte finish and
I love that for my combination skin I'm
just surprised that um a BB cream
especially one that has SPF 20 in it can
dry down that kind of way so this is
what it looks like on my skin and now
I'm just gonna go ahead and set it in
with my cousin's all about matte powder
I'm going to be using it this Tarte
foundation err buffer brush I'm gonna
tap into the product and then just start
stippling this onto my face completely
setting again know if you watch my
channel I've been sick this week so
making sure that I'm paying extra close
attention around my t-zone that is where
I get oily
and that is good so a really really fast
product it really is kind of one of
those like one-and-done sort of thing
like it says on the actual packaging so
I really like it I think it's very very
nice they know this was just a really
really quick little demo but a few
people did ask if I would come onto
camera and show you guys how I'd like to
use it so this is what it looks like on
my skin and yeah I really really like it
so thank you for joining me for this
quick little demo and I will see you
guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
