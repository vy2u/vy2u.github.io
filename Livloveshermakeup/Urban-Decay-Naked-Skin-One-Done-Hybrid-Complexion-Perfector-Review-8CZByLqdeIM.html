channel in this video I am giving you
guys a review and also gonna swatch on
the back of my hand the new Urban Decay
Naked skin a one-and-done hybrid
complexion Perfector with broad-spectrum
SPF 20 I purchased this on the Urban
Decay calm website for $34 there are six
different shades that you can choose
from and the shade that I have is called
light which is a pretty darn good skin
tone match for me so like I said they
have six different shades and this is
kind of marketed as a complexion
Perfector and at first I was a little
confused because I was like does that
mean it's gonna be similar to like the
L'Oreal what was it called uhm revita
blur or you know do you guys know what
I'm talking about they held like a
miracle blurring product or is it going
to be similar to a CC cream or a BB
cream and I have found personally that
this is very similar to a BB cream
except it does dry really really nicely
and kind of matte on the skin I am
loving it so far and let me read a
little bit about what it says on the
back at the box for you guys by the way
this is going to be a permanent addition
in the Urban Decay collection so if you
want to get your hands on it you don't
need to get your hands on it right away
it will be permanent it will be around
forever so anyway it says on the back of
the box
um get the best of both worlds with this
hybrid complexion cream that combines
the benefits of a sheer foundation with
the coverage of a tinted moisturizer it
has high tech waitlist formula that
feels amazing on the skin it says
one-and-done covers a wide range of skin
tones and the best part is is how it
transforms the look of your skin it has
light diffusing spheres that immediately
help make flaws seem to disappear and
over time the pores appear smaller on
your skin and your skin will appear
noticeably firmer and more radiant I
can't really talk about that because I
have only used this product about four
to five times however I do notice that
it really does have a nice amount of
coverage and it really does blurred the
look of fine lines and pores on your
skin without looking too greasy I love
that it has that SPF in there this is
what the actual packaging that looks
like of the product as you can see the
outside box just looks like typical
Urban Decay packaging kind of with that
gunmetal sort of color to it and then
actual packaging it's really nice
because it looks like this and it
actually has a pump which I love this is
a very similar to the packaging of the
what does it call it cosmetics CC cream
so you have the nice little pump and it
kind of this in like this squeezy tube I
will say something that I noticed right
away was that my tube kind of came not
completely full and for $34 I just
wasn't really expecting that if you had
picked up this product please let me
know down below if yours came like that
as well because I feel like after four
uses I already have used a lot of this
product I feel like a lot of it was like
air at the top and then when I started
pumping it it just started shrinking and
I was like that's really strange so I
don't know if maybe I got like a defect
or had like a defective product or if it
just is supposed to be like that let me
know down below if you guys picked it up
but anyway this is what the packaging
looks like so you have a nice little
pump here it does pump out really really
beautifully I am wearing this today and
the way that I like to personally wear
this because it is like a BB cream is I
personally like to wear it underneath a
foundation the foundation that I have on
top of this right now is the vibrancy
fluid foundation from josie maran my
shade is dynamic and i'm wearing that
five pumps of that over this product i
do like this product on its own don't
get me wrong but i have combination skin
that has some issues with texture and
also breakouts and i just feel like it
doesn't give me perfect coverage now I
will wear CC creams on their own but for
the most part I like to wear BB creams
paired with a foundation that's just
personally how I like to do it you can
do whatever you want if you want like a
nice lightweight product with basically
light to medium coverage this is
actually a really really nice one I feel
like it does blur the look of pores and
I have a little bit of a silicon texture
to it
I would say I'm wearing four pumps of it
today and it does pump out pretty evenly
when you first get it you have to pump
for a while to actually get the product
out but this is what it looks like this
is the shade light as you guys can see
so it looks a tad dark and honestly when
I rub it in it does look a lot darker
than my skin and I was worried at first
however when I blend this in on my face
this completely sinks in and looks
really really beautiful on my skin so
the shave range is actually really
really
good in my opinion I feel like because
it doesn't have super super full
coverage it does blend into the skin
nicely so don't worry if you are super
fair like I am I think the shade light
will work for you so it has a beautiful
really really creamy sort of consistency
to it like I said I feel like there is a
little bit of slip and silicone in here
and I feel like the coverage is really
really darn good it's not that similar
to a BB cream I know that I sense it
kind of is similar to a BB cream I would
say the coverage is similar to a BB
cream but the consistency is way
different because in my opinion when I
get a beauty bomb or a BB cream that has
SPF in it which most of them do I get
really really greasy on my skin my
combination skin I just can't handle it
like I have to set it in with a you know
powder what I love about this product is
that it completely dries down to like a
demi matte finish I'm not even kidding
it's amazing I don't know what kind of
SPF is in here if it's a physical
sunblock or a chemical one but it tries
down so beautifully on the skin I almost
don't have to go in and set it with a
powder which is like unheard of for me
when it comes to a BB cream so overall I
think it's fantastic I would say the
wear time on here is pretty darn good if
you are wearing it underneath a
foundation like I am today it will
definitely last all day and I feel like
the SPF in there kind of makes it like a
built in sort of primer for when you do
put foundation on topic if you wear it
alone I will say if you have oily to
combo skin I would still go ahead and
set it in with a powder if you don't I
think it will wear pretty well on you
know dry or like aging skin I think it
will wear pretty darn well but if you
have oily or combo and you want to wear
it alone I would set it in with a powder
for to get like the full benefits of
like 10 to 12 hour you know where time
so really really good wear time I love
the consistency this has quickly become
my new favorite like perfecting sort of
product it's kind of like a BB cream and
CC cream and Perfector all in one and I
really feel like I don't need a primer
with this product whatsoever so overall
I'm really really loving this I think
it's a fantastic little product if
or someone who is looking for a product
that will give you more coverage to pair
with your foundation this is a great one
if you are looking for something that
will give you just an overall really
smoothed out complexion and a little bit
of coverage this can also do the trick
and I think it's pretty relatively well
priced for what it is I think that
L'Oreal product is it L'Oreal I think
like them what does they call miracle
blur I think that product is almost
around twenty dollars at the drugstore
so for thirty four you technically are
getting a pretty good deal with a high
end product here this does have 1.3
fluid ounces in it so you did get a
decent amount of product I just don't
like the fact that like I've only used
it four times and it's already starting
to kind of like look like it's almost
empty so let me know down below like I
said if you also got a little bottle
like this but overall I think this is a
great little product for a pairing with
foundations for wearing alone it's gonna
definitely be a favorite of mine during
the summer especially because it has SPF
in there and it doesn't make me greasy
so I hope you guys enjoyed it this
little review and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
