reviewing in this video the new Urban
Decay revolution high color lip gloss
it's a packaging from my particular
shade I picked up looks like this please
go for $22 apiece on the sephora.com
website I will link below where you guys
can get them the particular shade I
picked up is called fail bait which is
this beautiful in my opinion my lips but
better kind of color it looks like this
it comes in this adorable packaging like
can we talk about how beautiful that is
I just love the way it looks it is
plastic but it almost looks like it's
glass
and it does stand up it does stand up
like straight on the table and it's
really really thin this way so I really
really like it I love the packaging I'm
just all over it and I absolutely love
the shade I picked up so like I said I
picked up fail bait and I feel like it
is a my lips but better kind of color
it's like it really neutral maybe kind
of dark pink with a little bit of mauve
I'm gonna put a little more on my lips
so you guys can see but as you can see
it's just gorgeous it does give a nice
sheen it does it's not too glossy it's
not sticky the formulation is really
smooth I want to say smooth and I do
notice if I get a little hair like stop
like you can see it stays there so it's
like yes it is a tiny bit sticky but
it's not one of those losses that like
the minute you have your hair down it
you know
it's not one of those things where it's
like it's gonna be it's not like it's
going to hold your hair hostage that
sounds weird but you can like take it
off without it like going back there
right away if that makes sense no I'm
just going off on a rant about a lot of
lip glosses because a lot of lip glosses
do they get stuck in your hair but I
notice that this one just kind of like
it's easy to just be like oh no no I
don't want that there you know it's not
like it goes back and it's like just
sticks there it's not like cement on the
lips that's what I'm trying to say so
the formula is really nice it does not
feel sticky in between the lips at all
when you go it feels smooth and it feels
creamy and I like it so anyway
like I said love the packaging I'm not
there's color I just think this fail
baked color is really really awesome the
wand is interesting so it's kind of flat
on this side and then you turn it and
then it gets a little thicker so it's
almost like it points upward in this
direction if that makes sense and it
really just kind of lays nicely like it
really can fill in the lip line well you
can use like the pointer edge to get
your Cupid's bow you can use the flat
edge to get the middle of your lip it
just really really works well this is a
swatch of the color that I have fail
bait and I don't think that these are
the most highly pigmented lip glosses
I've ever used however I think it's more
about the formula and I'm not expecting
especially the color that I got I'm not
expecting for it to like make a dramatic
difference in my lip color however I am
going to show you guys right now hold on
let me take this off quickly because um
if you guys watched my Sephora haul I
just did a few videos before this you
would have seen that um I actually did
get a nice little deluxe size of the
same gloss the same formula but in a
different color
and I just want to show you guys quickly
you know I've got a really natural kind
of color fail beige but this color right
here the purple one bittersweet is kind
of more dark and obviously purple and I
just wanted to show you what the actual
pigmentation can be so I'm just gonna
swatch that on my hand because I noticed
that the pigmentation is just a little
more there if that makes sense I think
it's I think the part of the
pigmentation is that I got a shade
that's really neutral and it's supposed
to look natural because that's what I
wanted however I think that if you get
the darker shades they have a nice red
color or even this bittersweet color
you're gonna get a lot more color payoff
so let me put this on
so that's one layer and I feel like
that's pretty good you know if I were to
pop on a second layer I feel like you
can build a nice amount of coverage so I
think it really depends on the shape you
get um it's not one of those where if
you get like the nude kind of pinky
shades it's going to be completely like
BAM in your face however if you get the
bittersweet shade or even if you get the
red shape they have one called bright
orange they have one called savage which
is like an electric pink I think those
ones are gonna be really really bold and
my family lives formulas exactly the
same between the two of these this one's
deluxe size and this one is a full size
and I just I love the formula I think it
feels great it feels like I'm almost
wearing a lip butter on my lips like
when I if I close my eyes and I go and
I'm like wow am I wearing like a lip
balm like an actual lip butter or
something or am i Ranga lip gloss
doesn't feel like a lip gloss until a
little tiny piece of hair gets stuck in
then you're like oh it's a look like but
um other than that I just really love
the formula I think it's great I think
the color they have a wonderful color
range if you guys have tried the
revolution lipsticks I feel like these
would top those beautifully so highly
recommend that um
but yeah they have a really nice range I
want to take say maybe 10 to 15
different shades and $22 piece I think
it is worth it because you get a really
really big big big size so um I'm going
to read you guys a little bit about what
it says on these for our website it says
the Urban Decay revolution high color
lip gloss $22 what it is a high coverage
ultra pigmented lip gloss it says get
audacious bit audacious lip looks and
lay down all the color you crave in one
swipe of this highly pigmented formula
just want to cut in there right away
I don't know if I completely agree with
that I have used glosses that have
better more full like pigmented coverage
but this one's pretty darn good I will
say it says this range of must have
cream and sparkle textures comes in
show-stopping both brights nudes and
deep dark shades so I will say I also
love I love that you can get like you
know this deep
color you can get you know shimmers you
can get just plain kind of no shimmery
colors you know it's great I love that
they have a very nice wide range of
finishes that you can get also um it
says show-stopping bullet bright smooth
and deep dark shades Urban Decay's papen
infusion system gives each a super
creamy texture for an irresistible
finish enriched with ABS hero lip hero
lip here a lip okay here a lip these
glasses defined in hydrate lips making
them appear fuller and plumper they
really are hydrating I don't know if
they appear fuller and plumper but they
do feel hydrating on the lips
each gloss is encased in a clear barrel
to make the shade visible and features
an applicator that provides full
coverage in one quick swipe I will say I
do absolutely love you know what I mean
like I feel like when you hold it up
like that does match what you're gonna
be getting I don't agree with one swipe
of it being like oh yeah they're full
coverage but I will say that it doesn't
matter the tube I want to mention
because this just happens when I opened
it watch okay you see a little extra
comes out like that I guess you can't
really stop that with lip glosses but I
don't like that I'll show you guys if a
little one too so I hate that it's like
yeah what if that gets like all over
myself like yeah I want it you know
evenly applied all over the brush but
this was kind of a thing that happens
with lip products in general especially
lip glosses um it says what else you
need to know
Urban Decay molded the flat
pocket-friendly profile of the
revolution lip gloss case after its
vintage called favorite lip gloss um
then they gave it a gorgeous facets and
a metallic gunmetal cap designed that's
reminiscent of the revolution lipstick
case so yes the revolution lipstick case
is like all it encased in that kind of
look right there like this pretty shiny
material but I just love the way they
look and I love that they stand up
straight and they're kind of thin on the
sides love the packaging so anyway I'm
pretty happy with these I would say
eh I definitely definitely like the
shade this fail bait shade is gorgeous
it really is for me personally a my lips
but better kind of shade I think that
both of them no matter what the color it
really gives off a nice sheen on the
lips but it's not too glossy it's not
too sticky your hair will get stuck in
the gloss however it's not like I said
cement like it's not like you can't like
get it off it's nice it's creamy when I
close my eyes and I rub my lips together
I don't know what I'm wearing I don't
know if I'm wearing a lipstick I don't
know if I'm wearing a glass I don't know
if I'm wearing a lip butter so that's
pretty awesome
so do love the formula do love the
texture I think that they could be a
little more high coverage I know that's
crazy because some people can really
they're so full coverage but I think it
depends on what shade you have so anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this review I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
