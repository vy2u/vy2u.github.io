thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
today i will be doing a review and
swatches for you guys on the new urban
decay of ice for palette it looks like
this i purchased mine on the support
calm website for sixty dollars um you
can also get it on the altar calm
website for sixty dollars and i believe
they are in store correct me if i'm
wrong but I believe you can get them in
store now but this is what the box looks
like they're going after that oil slick
sort of look and oil slick is actually a
shade that they used to have and I don't
know if it was discontinued I don't know
if they still have it but I remember
having it in an eyeshadow palette a long
time ago and i think i read somewhere
that they were actually going after that
kind of oil slick look which is one of
the shades they used to have so this is
what the box looks like and then you can
see on the back you can see all the
different shades that are in the palette
you also get this little sleeve that
holds the palette I'm super super cute I
was really hoping I could use this to
like carry makeup in and things like
that it says beauty with an edge urban
decay but honestly you guys um i'm going
to show you in a second but the palette
does not close very well like it closes
but it has one of those magnetic
closures and i am worried that it is
going to open up and just like explode
everywhere whether i'm traveling with
this palette or if I am just you know
whether it's just sitting in storage so
i think i'm gonna have to keep it in the
sleeve so this is what the actual
palette looks like really really
gorgeous you can see the oil slick sort
of look to it it really looks like a
spiderweb to me and it says Urban Decay
advice on the back inside you get a
gigantic mirror thank you so much yes
Urban Decay there's my camera and these
are the shades you get inside so you get
20 limited edition shades really really
gorgeous these are very much jewel toned
sorry I'm like tilting and trying to
figure out these are very much jewel
toned really really gorgeous you get on
the very far left in the very far right
you can see that you get some neutral
neutral shades with Matt you know
finishes but a lot of these are jewel
tones definitely a palette for the color
lover
um and you get a lot of different
finishes in here you get metallics you
get matts you get um you know more like
glitter infused shades so really really
cool I'm going to read a very quickly
for you guys on the support website what
it says about the palette oh and i do
want to mention you do get a dual ended
little brush here so one side has a
little like blending side stippling
brush and the other side has a flat
shader brush I do not like this side
personally it's just a very very thin
and it doesn't really blend things out
very well it is nice if you want to put
it on the outer V of your eye but I
prefer the other side of the brush which
is like this little flat shader this
really picks up color very very well and
you can put it right underneath your
lower lash line I will tell you guys
right away what I am wearing I am
wearing three shades today very very
quick simple easy look I'm wearing a wet
and wild mascara I'm wearing no eyeliner
but i do have on fastball i have that in
my crease it's a really really gorgeous
gorgeous kind of pinky color right there
and then i have this color down here
which is called flame i have that all
over my lid and then this sort of gray
color right here called discrete i have
that as my transition shade so really
really easy look that i put together
with that today um let me read you guys
a little bit about what it says so it
says Urban Decay advice for sixty
dollars it is a limited edition palette
packed with 20 gorgeous
never-before-seen shades a huge mirror
and a double ended brush with a chic bag
it says Urban Decay created by score
loaded with 20 gorgeous shades of their
iconic I shadow it features a huge
mirror a double ended brush and a
coordinating back and the palette
contains the darkly alluring dimensional
hues of an oil slick inspired by their
vintage shade named oil slick so it
seems like oil slick is still out there
you can still get it so that's pretty
cool but it is a very vintage color I
will say that it says these shades are
filled with rich deep jewel tones in a
wide range of finishes from velvety
smooth mats and shimmering metallic stew
shades infused with micro glitter each
eye shadow advice for formulated with
Urban Decay zone pigment infusion system
has a proprietary blend of ingredients
that deliver rich velvety blendable
color that lasts in sparkles all day and
it says it is formulated without care
so um I will tell you guys right away my
review is based on the fact that I have
never ever owned a vice palette they
have been releasing them obviously for
four years now and it kind of comes out
around the holidays I sort of consider
the Vice pallets to be Urban Decay's way
of releasing like a holiday palette so
they have been releasing for the past
three years and I've never gotten one
and that is because if you guys watch my
channel you know I absolutely hated my
urban decay naked palettes and it really
put a bad taste in my mouth for
eyeshadow palettes in general that are
from urban decay because I've been so
iffy about it because I really didn't
like my naked palettes I got rid of all
of them I gave them to family and
friends and I just I never liked them so
I was so iffy to go ahead and pick up
any of these because they have been I
think sixty dollars every single year
which is a lot of money to pay for an
eyeshadow palette and I finally gave in
this year and I said you know I'm gonna
get it oh sorry if you can hear that car
I have the window open it's a beautiful
fall day need some fresh air but um so
yeah so it's one of those things where
it's like oh I don't know you know it
just yeah oh yeah I get so i get like
disgusted when i talk about the naked
palettes I'm probably the only person
probably gonna go a lot of hate for that
in the comments section but I never
liked them so it was very hard for me to
pick up one of these but finally this
year I said I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go
ahead and purchase it I'm talk to Glenn
life guru here on YouTube had done a
review and swatches on this before it
even released and I was like those
sheets are really gorgeous you know if
I'm going to pick up a palette this year
that is full of color I might as well
get this one so I tried it out and I'm
glad I did you guys because I actually
really like this palette um you get like
I said 20 gorgeous um limited edition
shades you get a mixture of Matthew get
um you know metallic colors you get a
few shades in here that are kind of
gritty and they have like that micro
glitter they say in it but it really
feels like just chunks of glitter but
honestly the pigmentation is there the
blend ability is there you can just put
together these fun color looks really
really easily and honestly the where
time on these are amazing if you use
I primer I am wearing my Milani eye
primer that is the one that I have tried
with this palette so far because that is
what I've been loving this weekend using
and um that I primers just you know Finn
my favorite this week basically probably
see that in my favorites video on Sunday
but anyway so that's what i've been
using this week and i find that these
absolutely have to be paired with an
eyeshadow primer for them to have their
full like pick up a pigmentation you
know it's one thing when you swatch them
on your arm you guys will see they come
out really really pigmented and nicely
on the arm but it's a whole nother thing
when you start to work them on your eyes
they can start to look a little muddled
you have different kind of dimensions to
your eyes you know your crease are kind
of set far back in it's not like just
the regular smoothness of your arm so
you have to take that into consideration
so i highly recommend using a primer
with these with a primer they last all
day they absolutely last all day i have
no issue whatsoever that i look i have
on that i applied this morning which was
like you know five or six hours ago it
is still intact really really nicely and
I really put my makeup on very early
this morning so still really really
nicely in place I know it will last all
day and I really really appreciate that
I have tried wearing a few shades in
here like grasshopper which is a
gorgeous green color right there I have
tried wearing in without an eye primer
and honestly it's just not there you
have to wear it with an eye primer but
you don't have to go and pick up like
Urban Decay's primer you know you can
pick up whatever you want I'm wearing
the Milani one that's the one I've been
working with and it works just as well
so overall very happy they are very
blendable even the kind of glittery
chunky shades are still easy to blend
they're not as easy to blend into the
crease but you can still wear them on
the lid underneath the lash line I will
point out and you guys will be able to
see when I swatch the ones that are
talking about that have kind of that
chunkier glitter but overall I'm very
very happy I really do think it is worth
the price and especially if you are
kinda lover so yeah anyway let's get on
to the swatching you guys so I'm going
to do it vertically so I'm going to go
down like this way so i'm going to start
over here with these kind of neutral
shades so the first one is called bones
this is a really nice I'm call it kind
of like metallicy it's sort of a gray
color and I'm going to actually do these
on my hand that's the easiest for me so
the first one is bones and it's nice ok
I will say the one thing that kind of
gets me about this palette is it doesn't
really have a brow bone shade if you are
close in skin tone too and I am the
first two shades right here that I'm in
a swatch for you are supposed to I think
kind of be like the brow bone shade but
honestly they're darker than my skin
tone so it doesn't really work for me
like that I can understand if you know
it would work for other people but it
doesn't really work for me like that but
these were the first two shades this is
bones and frame so bones is a metallic
and then framed is a matte hopefully you
guys can see that so bones and framed
and I think that framed which is that
matte color is supposed to be kind of
the shade that you're like able to use
on your brow bone I don't have a brow
bone shade on today because I can't
really get one in this palette because
bones and framed are actually darker
than my skin tone so it doesn't really
work for me that is one more little
complaint i have about it but those are
the only complaint alright the next
color is discrete um I have this as my
transition color today it is this
gorgeous kind of gray matte color really
really really pretty it's kind of kind
of like a lilac II purple undertone
hopefully you guys can see these I know
it can be difficult with natural
lighting but also you know these like
light shades and then the last one you
get here is called bitter and this is a
gorgeous ready brown matte color really
really beautiful one more thing all of
these have follow every single one of
them that I look I put together today
like I said it was very very simple but
even I got a lot of fallout so I highly
recommend doing your eyes first and then
your face makeup I think that that's
just kind of a basic thing though if
you're doing smoky eyes are working with
color you just want to go ahead and do
your eyes first but all of them do have
fall out honestly even the matte shade
so that's something to be aware of but
that is bitter down there and it is just
gorgeous
so that is the first little row I I'm
going for Anna clay just so you guys
know because it's easier to swatch all
of you know four at a time then go like
what is it five at a time alright so the
next row is this one this is my favorite
row i'm so excited so the first one is
called oh my gosh there's stuff all over
it I'm grip and this is also kind of
like a metallic a buttery sort of gray
light gray shade it's got a ton of
little tiny silver shimmers in it it
looks like that very very beautiful the
next shade on which I am wearing I mean
my crease today it is called fastball
love this I love the texture of these
ones the next three shades are amazing
and texture so fastball is this gorgeous
light pink shade and it's got a lot of
that kind of as they say micro glitter
in it and this one like the next three
actually these do feel like micro
glitter they don't feel as chunky as
some of the other ones I'm going to get
to but my goodness super super gorgeous
shade can you see that it picks up a lot
of color and it's some kind sometimes
can get a little like textured on the
skins you just want to be careful and
you know you can build it up a lot on
the I today I really went kind of
lightly I mean honestly I went lightly
and it still gave a nice amount of color
to my crease but um you can build it up
go a few times you know over pick it up
a few times when I mean there and then
just go over your crease but gorgeous
gorgeous shade the next one is another
favorite this is grasshopper oh my gosh
look at that shade you guys it is
gorgeous i love this so it is that
gorgeous gorgeous green color there this
is my favorite row and then the last one
is flame and that is the color that i
have on my lid today and also my inner
corner of my lashline my inner corner
marina corners here like the lower
lashline the first half
I have this on and this is gorgeous it
is like this like reddish Goldie color
with tons of gold Sheen to it it is just
beautiful right there that was flame so
that is my all-time favorite row the
next row the next two rows I'm going to
get into you're going to be able to see
some of those micro fine they call it uh
Molly's they call them on the Salar webs
like the micro flying glitter shades or
whatever they tend to get a little
chunky so just watch for that so that is
this row so you get some nice kind of
dorky smokey colors in here so the first
one is dead beat this feels like a
little chunky and you guys can see um it
kind of picks up a little chunky too can
you guys see that like there's texture
on the finger so this is a black shade
with a ton of gorgeous tiny little
flecks of silver shimmer in it very very
pretty though I mean these are
incredibly pigmented so I can't really
complain too much about texture the next
color is called 1985 a lot of people
love this shade it is really gorgeous i
will give it that
very very pretty almost kind of matches
the I'm wearing today very very
pretty kind of light purple I would say
it's got a lot of like a pink undertone
to it which isn't very very nice the
next one is called see note and again
this feels sort of similar to like the
fastball grasshopper and flame sort of
shades so I really really like those
they're very very like creamy gorgeous
like metallicy sort of seafoam color
would you call it I was like a mermaid
you know mermaid sort of color beautiful
and then the last one is called low and
this one has a little more chunks of
glitter in it it picks up like a lot of
it gives a lot of kick up when you
swatch it and this one is like it's kind
of similar to deadbeat which is the
first 1i swatch but this one I mean I
mean it's similar in the way of the
texture but also it has tons and tons of
those tiny little silver shimmers in it
but is a different kind of more brownie
taupe gray sort of colors definitely
different than the black so again very
very pretty it's some more of this
little sanitizing wipes out hold on the
next one I'm going to swap is also
really nice um it does have a few more
like the next level line i'm going to
swatch it does have a few more of those
kind of gritty glittery chunky shades
but you know the thing is is what this
palette is that it almost doesn't matter
because they are so pigmented and they
really do stay all day so i can't just
sit here and complain about texture
because they actually really pick up on
the eyes as well as you know in swatch
so the next row is the this row right
here so you get a little more cool tones
the first one is called beat down Oh
gorgeous
this is like a purpley bluish yeah it's
got a lot of blue undertone purpley
bluish sort of color beautiful the
second shade is more of like a Bobby
kind of purple color it's called
underhand you can see there's little
more chunk chunks of like you know a
little more texture i should say
something chunks a little more texture
on there that is that shade if you love
purples you'll probably love this row
the next one is called arctic and this
is again kind of like a bluish seafoam
sort of color you guys can really see
can you guys see the texture on that
like when I picked it up that's what I
mean that's I don't really love that but
um you know you can blend it off on the
eye and this has lots and lots of little
tiny silver shimmers in it that's Arctic
and the last one is called crowbar this
one's really interesting it's kind of
like a muddy green color like an army
green sort of muddy you guys know what I
mean by that like army green is sort of
a muddy green color and it's got tons of
gold shimmer in it so don't really love
the texture of this particular row but
they really really are pigmented and
they really do show up that way on the
eye as well so can't complain can't
complain alright and then the last row
is my second favorite row if you're
looking at it vertically and that would
be this row right here it's a little
more neutrally it's got a little more
purples you get a match and then you get
a thing i would say metallica and two
other of those kind of glittery shades
but again they feel more like the
fastball grasshopper and flame shade so
they're a little more buttery so the
first one is called a pandamonium
gorgeous um kind of deep purple with
lots and lots of silver shimmer they do
a lot of silver shimmer and this palette
looks like that that is panda mon
YUM the second shade is called cartilage
this is more of a light purple and this
one is basically the same exact texture
and it has a lot of silver shimmer and
there's harlot pedini and then you get
robbery which is really nice it's like
this Toki kind of color and it does have
shimmer in it will call this more of
like a metallic in my opinion that's
robbery that third one and then the last
day that you get is delete and this is
um this is a matte right yeah this is
completely mad deep chocolate brown
almost has a little bit of a gray
undertone definitely not as warm as
bitter so there it is so anyway those
are all the swatches I did not swatch
them horizontally I am not quite sure if
they think of the color family as
horizontally they probably do they
probably want you to pair colors going
this way but I did it this way because
it's easier to swatch for colors at a
time than five but anyway really really
gorgeous shades I am very happy i think
the pigmentation is really really
awesome the staying power especially if
you wear it with a I primer is awesome
and I think it's just so fun i love
these jewel tones i think they're
gorgeous i highly highly recommend
taking this palette up if you know of
somebody in your family or whatnot that
really really loves you know pops of
color i think this would be a great one
yes it does have a few neutrals but you
know you really can pick up any palate
you know a lot of eyeshadow palettes
have neutrals and it's easy to do that
but not a lot of eyeshadow palettes
haven't these wonderful wonderful bright
colors so really really great I am
loving it and I highly highly do
recommend picking it up if you are
willing to splurge for the sixty dollars
I think you won't regret it and yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this review and
swatches of the Urban Decay voice for
palette I'll see you in my next one bye
