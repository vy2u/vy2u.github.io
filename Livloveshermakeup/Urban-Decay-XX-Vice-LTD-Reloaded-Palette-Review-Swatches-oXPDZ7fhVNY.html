this video I am giving you guys my
thoughts my opinions and swatches on the
new Urban Decay vice Ltd reloaded
palette I purchased this for $56 on the
ulta.com website I will link below where
you guys can pick it up it is not an
affiliate link and you also can get it
in stores starting on January 24th which
has been four days so anyway before I
get into swatches and my thoughts on
this palette I'm going to read a little
bit about what it says on the alto shaam
website for you guys it says this ultra
limited edition collection features 20
addictive shades of eyeshadows that span
Urban Decay's entire 20-year history
from vintage shades that go way back
like - acid rain and UVB - must-haves
from Urban Decay's current collection
it's all in here with a carefully
crafted mix of new shades and old
favorites vise Ltd be loaded it's the
perfect representation of 20 years of
urban decay experiment with color go for
a little smoke or play it neutral urban
decay included three totally new shades
5 vintage shades 5 exclusives from past
palettes and 7 bestsellers from their
collection of singles the kind of
palette anybody can use Urban Decay vice
Ltd reloaded offers something for
everyone and this is the first time
several of these shades have been
available in the new Urban Decay's
revamped shadow formula need to apply on
the run of this gorgeous jewel inlaid a
black case comes with a huge loaded
mirror and double ended brush each
eyeshadow in this limited edition
palette features Urban Decay's pigment
infusion system the proprietary blend of
ingredients that give every shade its
velvety texture rich colored serious
staying power and blend ability so I'm
basically guys right away with this
particular palette I was a little taken
aback I was experiencing probably the
most fallout that I've ever experienced
in my life with any sort of palette and
I already do kind of have I guess a bad
taste in my mouth when it comes to urban
decay palettes I did not like the Gwen
Stefani palette I hated the naked 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 palettes to the point where I actually
gave them away so in general I never
have had the best of luck with urban
decay eyeshadow palettes but I have
found a way to make this palette work
for me so let's
a little bit about the packaging first
this is what the outer box looks like I
think it's absolutely beautiful it's
like an iridescent purple color and then
on the back it shows you all twenty
shades with the names I wish they would
have made the actual palette look like
this because I think this is absolutely
stunning but they did not they made it
all like a matte black with like little
plastic jewels that say UD or Urban
Decay vice Ltd be loaded it's really
nice it's a very very sleek but I mean
fun I would have prefered the purple but
anyway this is what the palette looks
like and something that I love that they
have done is they made a little push
button down here so that you know the
palette is actually closing so you can
push that and it pops up you'd be a huge
ass mirror which is fantastic and then
you get a tool and did brush in here but
the double-ended brush is just okay I
preferred the smudger side of it let me
show you guys there's like this kind of
dense smudger side on this side which is
actually really really nice to go
underneath the lower lash line with a
little bit of color but the other side
is kind of like a stippling crease brush
and I don't think it's that great so I
don't really like that side of the brush
but this side of the brush is quite good
and anyway let me show you guys after
you push the little button and it opens
up you can see these are the 20 shades
I'm gonna hold it like this upside down
at first because I don't want to blind
you guys so anyway it kind of has this
metallic sort of finish on the back like
the mirrored kind of finished right here
and the size is definitely a bit
chunkier than some of their other advice
palettes the old Levis palette that I
have experience with is the vice four so
that's the one I am comparing it to so
the Vice four is on the top and the new
one is on the bottom it is probably not
double the size but maybe just a tad
bigger than the vice 4 palette but the
problem with the vice 4 palette was that
it came in this sleeve because this
thing opens up like I was always worried
that this was just gonna open up and all
the shadows we're gonna break it did not
have that little clicky or push button
but what I like about this one is that I
know when it is closed because it goes
so anyway that is what the packaging
looks like I think it's really really
beautiful it is a little chunky but I
like that they included a brush and I do
like that there are tons and tons of
shadows in here so like I said my first
impression on this palette
was pretty bad I was getting fallout
galore you guys and it just made me
think immediately god dammit
urban decay I just paid all their
palettes all of them suck I don't like
all the fallout that I get because it
was like me reimagining exactly what had
happened with the Urban Decay palettes I
had followed galore
they just didn't blend very well and I
was having the same sort of issues with
this palette so I was so disappointed
and I was like I'm totally giving this a
bad review but then I kind of figured
out I needed to use it with a different
primer and that's held all my issues so
any sort of normal primer that I use
whether it be my lorac behind the scenes
my el primer whatever it did not work
with this palette and what's really
weird is that Urban Decay did
reformulate their eyeshadows and they
have some new ones in here that are
being formulated and I actually think
they are so beautiful they're very
finely milled they blend very easily so
I was like why am I getting so much
fallout with what is going on I was
thinking maybe it was the brushes I was
using and then I finally figured out it
was actually the primer so the primer
that I have to use with this palette is
a glitter glue primer you can get a
glitter glue primer from elf cosmetics
for really really cheap I will leave
like two or three dollars or you can get
the one I have which is the Too Faced
one and that is called the shadow
insurance glitter glue primer and it
works really really well with these
shadows I have found I don't have any
more issues now that I am using a
glitter glue primer with this I think
that all of them really really work
nicely now I think the only issue is is
that the glitter glue primers are really
kind of sticky and tacky so I do have to
blend a little more but besides that I
would say the palette is really really a
good one so I'm not wearing these colors
today I have this shading mildew in my
crease and then I went in with the shade
misdemeanor and I also put that in my
crease on my lower lash line I have this
asphyxia and I think that was really
really pretty and then on my lid I have
this shade gold mine which is one of my
favorites in this palette and I feel
like I got a really nice kind of
colorful but subdued sort of look I went
to work this morning and nobody was like
well girl you have too much like eye
makeup on or it's too out there sort of
look it's a very very subtle and it's
pretty pretty neutral you know it's not
like boom I have color so I think that
Orban decay always does a nice job of
mixing in all sorts of
formulations whether it be matte or
glittery shades or shimmery shades but
also mixing in color with neutrals so
you do have three maps in here which are
really beautiful the formulation of
these mats are so creamy and buttery
they're amazing it has suspend you have
laced and then you have anonymous
anonymous is perfect I put that
underneath the brow bone today it really
works for anybody's skin tone in my
opinion it just kind of lightens up that
area laced I used as my transition color
again really really beautiful has a
little bit of a pink undertone just
really really helps for when you do put
on some light color in your crease
especially if it's a color like I use
like that misdemeanor one it helps so
that it doesn't look too harsh and then
suspend is really really gorgeous as
well those are the only three mats in
here and then you do get a mix of
glittery chunky shades which I feel like
Urban Decay it's just kind of known for
especially with their vice palettes you
are going to get these glittery chunky
shades and there's nothing wrong with
that they are very colorful and they are
very fun it's just that you need to know
ahead of time that that's what you're
getting yourself into you some of the
ones that I look at and I think wow
they're really chucking glittery are oil
slick Midnight Cowboy mildew a little
bit and also moonflower those definitely
have some grit and texture to them but
they are ultra ultra pigmented and at
the end of the day I think what it
matters is how it looks on the eyes and
I think that all but Urban Decay does it
right with their formulation even though
some of them do have a little bit of
Fallout well a lot of fallout with this
particular palette as long as you know
you just want to make sure you're using
the right eye primer I don't want to
rant about that too much but just you
know it just depends on you just make
sure you're using the right eye primer
but my point is you know even though
they may have a little bit of Fallout or
they may be a little gritty it's
ultimately like the color payoff and how
they come up on the eyes and I think
it's beautiful everything that I'm
wearing on my eyes today I only had to
go in once it didn't have to build up
color on my lid or on my lower lash line
it was all just like a one-and-done sort
of thing and I feel like Urban Decay
just does color right they know how to
do it so overall I think that even
though you do get some grit and some
texture in the inner most of the shades
are really really nice and finely milled
and they do feel kind of buttery
especially the mats and
the kind of shimmery shades those are
very nice as well it's just the glittery
chunky ones that are glittery and well
chunky so I do think these we're a
really really exceptionally long time
even when I just wear them with a normal
eye primer even though I do get fall out
with a normal primer I find that they do
wear definitely um up to 12 hours no
problem and I find that they are vibrant
on my eyes all day which I absolutely
love so I think the formulation is
fantastic I would say the wear power is
very very strong and it's even stronger
when I wear a glitter glue primer
because it's really really like sealing
on to there you can definitely like
spray your brush with fix+ or any sort
of setting mist and make the colors even
more vibrant on your eyes if you want to
but overall I think the pigmentation is
absolutely fabulous so if you are
someone who doesn't mind a little bit of
grit and texture but you really love a
pop of color I highly recommend checking
this palette out it definitely has some
gorgeous gorgeous spring shades I'm
definitely going to be rocking some of
the colors in here when it comes to
spring because there are some beautiful
pinks and greens and that golden color
is fabulous so I think overall it is a
really really nice product so anyway
let's just get into the swatches shall
we I'm going to go this way vertically
and just go like that so the first one
we're gonna start with is suspend and
this is kind of a gray color this is a
matte and this is what it looks like
swatch that it's just so butter you guys
even if there is a little bit of kick up
which I do notice with these shadows
there is a little bit of kick up when I
put my brush in and the one thing I
don't like is that because there are 20
shades they're kind of smushed in pretty
closely and they do start to seep into
one another but if you blow it off like
if you go then you're not gonna have an
issue alright the second shade is called
501 this is one of those really textured
kinda glittery shades and it kind of
stains your eye area I remember wearing
this the other day and it kind of
stained my eye area but it's just a
little more gritty and has a little more
texture if you guys can see up close you
see how there's little pieces that kind
of get stuck there but if you really
blend it out it's not an issue so I
think this is a beautiful shade the
grits and a little bit of glitter in
there don't really show up like they
don't really translate on to the eye but
it is a beautiful beautiful blue color
the next one is called
and this one is a little bit um I would
say it's a little bit of a glittery sort
of texture but it's really really
beautiful when you put it on - if you're
watching it putting it onto your hand or
onto your eye
it comes off more it's like a shimmery
sort of color not so much grit and
glitter but there's definitely a bit of
fallout with that one as well but it's a
beautiful shade the next one is called
moon flower again this one's a little
bit glittery and chunky can you guys see
that but it's a beautiful kind of salmon
II definitely have some pink in there
how would I describe that kind of salmon
a lighter bronze pinky shade so that is
the first row if you are looking at it
vertically we are going to move on now
to the second row and I'm wiping these
off and you guys can see those darker
shades do stain a little bit the next
one
the next row we're looking at it
vertically has oil slick oil slick
shallow misdemeanor and UVB so oil slick
is one of those shadows that they've had
in the urban decay line forever it seems
like and it definitely is a little
textured and gritty but it's beautiful
it's a black with tons and tons of
sparkle in it like a little tiny it's
got micro glitter in it but it also has
big chunks of glitter in it and they are
silver but look at this color that's
what I mean that's that that's the
difference about like Urban Decay's on
pallets will have straight-up chunks of
glitter and then the it won't be as
pigmented if that makes sense like you
put it on your eyes and it's not as
pigmented but Urban Decay even though
some of their shadows are a little
chunky I can get over it because look
how pigmented that is what that is
absolutely stunning and then the shade
shadow is really beautiful it's kind of
like a it's a beautiful kind of shimmery
grayish it has a bit of an opalescent
blue undertone but it's a really
beautiful beautiful smooth finish and
then the next one is called a
misdemeanor this is the one I have in my
crease today it's a dark greenish bluish
color does have a
then a chunkiness to it but again it
blends out on the eye really nicely
there's a misdemeanor and then the last
one is called UVB which is gorgeous it's
like a bluish purple e color
and it's super super beautiful it's
definitely got kind of like a silvery
pinky undertone to it it's a stunning
stunning color alright so that is the
second row now we're going to move on to
the third one and if we're looking at it
vertically we have what is that road
strip yes Road strip laced freak show
and gold mine and gold mine is my
favorite but this um Road strip is that
what it is yeah Road striper Road strip
it's a beautiful kind of like opalescent
white color have a lot of like it
changes like when I have it underneath
my brow bone today with a little bit of
anonymous and like if I turn my head I
can tell that it changes colors like
it's a little pink undertone a little
blue undertone but really really
beautiful um it's a little like rough
like when I dig my figure in there I
really feel like I have to dig but I
don't get tons of fallout with this one
so it's just kind of an interesting
texture I would say that was what it
looks like swatch this on my arm
there is the shade you see when I turn
my arm like it kind of changes I really
love that like I think that's beautiful
and then we have lace which is that
beautiful kind of transition color I had
talked about I'm using that today in my
crease before I put that shade
misdemeanor on and this just kind of
helped it to blend out nicely then we
have freakshow which is another kind of
glittery chunky shade but it's a
beautiful purple there is freakshow and
then we have goldmine wisp I'm sad so
it's really really silky and buttery and
it is just a beautiful greenish goldish
color it's really really study it's not
like a pure gold it definitely has a
green undertone but I absolutely love it
it is so pretty
alright and next we are moving on to
like the fourth column and we have
- hot pants a sick SIA and twice baked
so - is a beautiful beautiful red color
and it's kind of like that perfect fall
color honestly I wish that this color
was in the vice 4 palette that came out
during the fall because this is a
beautiful color look at that red isn't
that stunning and then we have hot pants
which I really love it's a beautiful
opalescent pink color with lots and lots
of shimmer in it like a silvery shimmer
really really pretty hot pants is there
how pretty would that be all over the
lid and then we have asphyxia which is a
beautiful it's kind of similar to hot
pants but it's purple undertones and
it's so beautiful there's asphyxia hot
pants - it was pretty and then we have
twice-baked which is a little more
glittery and chunky again but it's a
beautiful dark brown color and just
ultra ultra pigmented I love that ro how
pretty is that ro alright and then the
last one has Midnight Cowboy mildew acid
rain and anonymous so Midnight Cowboy is
a very pretty it kind of reminds me of
max like all-day clitoris well I really
shouldn't say that I don't have all that
glitters but every time I see pictures
online I think that that looks similar
it's kind of like a pinky peachy color
and it does have glitter in it so just
so you know but it is ultra ultra
pigmented it would look absolutely
beautiful all over the lid and then we
have mildew which is a dark kind of
green shade I have that in my crease
today I think it's beautiful it really
is like a mildewed sort of color it's
definitely got in gold undertone in
there you have that right there and then
we have acid rain which is basically
like mildew except it's a light green
really really pretty for the spring I
think there is acid rain okay you guys
can see that and then the last one is
anonymous that is that really creamy
buttery matte color that is amazing
underneath the brow bone and I like the
urban decay you know includes colors
like
because they think that's important
especially when you have a pallet that
is literally just filled with color
color color so I'm going to show you
guys really quickly what the pallet
looks like right now because you will be
able to see the kind of kick up that I'm
talking about can you see the kind of
chunks that are in there and I'm not
sitting there going like you know I'm
really just kind of trying to pick up
enough to swatch but just so you guys
are aware that is how the pallet is
looking right now so overall I think
this is a nice pallet if you like the
urban decay formulation I think their
new formulation is definitely like a
little more finely milled and easier to
work with but if you like urban decay
because you like color and you enjoy um
the like color payoff that all of their
palettes give you I think you would
enjoy this pallet especially if you like
spring colors because this has a lot of
those in there but overall I think it is
a nice palette I am happy that I
purchased it and yeah not much else to
say about it
definitely definitely invest in a nice
glitter primer if you are going to use
this one a lot of people were saying
they didn't have any issues with fallout
I don't know what was happening with me
but you can get a glitter primer or of
course you could just do your eyes first
and then your face makeups but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video
swatches and review on the new Urban
Decay palette my hands are completely
stained from those colors anyway I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
