that little hair having some weird like
hair thing going on today um I turned my
if you just watch the video right before
those I'm going to say previously before
this whatever if you watch the video
right before this it with my uh I
announce the winner of my 1000
subscribers giveaway um I had the camera
turned a little over here sometimes
people are like where I am in different
places why do you turn the camera well I
thought that this lady made me look a
little tanner and the natural a really
really brings out my paleness and dumb I
am NOT paled by choice okay like I
literally am allergic to the Sun which
brings up into the Sephora haul oops
there's a sticker on open optin same
thing but can't see my address anyway
here is these sephora box I've never
ordered from them before I'm just
kidding one of the biggest complaints I
get um is oh do all you do is halls
somebody wrote that to me once and they
were like all you do is haul I'm
unsubscribing and I was like listen I
love to buy okay I just do however
I think that giveaways now I'm going to
be doing giveaways um every thousand
subscribers up to 5,000 and I think that
can kind of make me feel a little better
like yeah i buy stuff for my cell phone
if I stover you guys do so anyway um
let's feed on this sephora addiction um
so i ordered from sephora calm and i got
mostly skincare stuff i'm really into
skin care during the summer i think it's
because i have more time and i always
get like really like into like you know
like unnecessary stuff like really
layering stuff on I don't want to say
it's unnecessary because I think
skincare is huge but stuff that I
wouldn't use really like during the
winter maybe because you know I just use
a makeup white and blood bag no I don't
do that sometimes it when i was in
school um but you know during the summer
i just have free time and i'm asking all
the time and i feel like my skin is
looking good so anyway I got a lot of
skincare stuff um I got quite a few
samples are not samples but like hundred
point whatevers of sunscreens because
I said turns you know the camera over
there so I could look a little more tan
I am NOT paled by choice I have lupus
I'm basically allergic to the Sun I
cannot tan and let me tell you me trying
to do self tanning no matter what I look
like an oompa loompa everybody likes on
me so I'm just gonna stick with the
pianist it's okay to do what I have to
do oh my gosh she keep doing that
Sephora haul let's get started this has
been two minutes and 31 seconds of me
blabbering all right so um let's just
get started one product that i have
already used i got these little smaller
size and i mentioned this in my latest
skin care routine bouffant over here um
and i got like the mini one just to try
out i'm obsessed with it I used up all
my makeup wipes and I am just going to
be using this um for as long as I'm
interested in it it's great this is the
boscia makeup breakup pool cleansing oil
it's amazing I got the little mini one
and I'm almost done with that I
literally I do two pumps on the eyes two
pumps on the forehead and two pumps on
the cheeks and all you do is you pump
the oil on to your dry hand put it all
over your dry skin and it made me
realize that when I was removing my
makeup with wipes I love makeup remover
wipes okay but when I was removing it
out with tugging and tugging and even if
i didn't think i was i was because this
has like this cool like cushioning
effect I think they actually described
it as that it's so smooth when you're
getting the actual makeup off it doesn't
feel oily it feels smooth so you know
you're not talking at the skin that is
so important nobody wants premature
wrinkles or for their wrinkles to get
worse so um been loving this it has not
made me break out I like that it kind of
has a cooling effect it's kind of like
refreshing green tea kind of it just
feels good um you just put it all over
and you just wash with water and
literally you have no residue no oily
residue whatsoever I tried that one from
Garnier that like uh it was like an oil
clean it was really really good I liked
it was like the nourishing oil cleanser
it sometimes left me a little oily and I
was also using it last summer and I
combination skin I tends to get a little
oily as you can probably see right now
because the sun's coming in I tend to
get oily my teeth own during the summer
like a lot I almost kind of go
borderline into oily skin um so yeah so
I didn't really like that but I did love
how it just broke down everything and I
could just wash it right off um this
does the same exact thing except at
least no residue I have tried with
coconut oil and olive oil and just leave
that residue and honestly I want to put
like retinol and stuff on I don't want a
layer of stuff you know because it means
it's tool toilet for me I love olive oil
love coconut oil for lots of things but
it did not work for me when it came to
my movie makeup but this baby is amazing
so I've got to be bigger size and it
says an effective gentle way too deep
cleanse this refreshing cleansing oil
dissolved impurities and make up with
without leaving an oily residue it says
applied to dry skin and gently massaged
into the face in circular motions a
unique cushioning soon coaches you said
it push amazing effect will allow your
fingers to glide without pulling our
tummy rings clean with water and follow
with balancing facial tonic I don't have
the balancing facial time you don't need
it it's so good you will have no residue
like I said you don't like that because
there's nobody knew so it's great it
just feels so refreshing like just move
Washington everything comes off all of
the eye makeup I don't have to go back
in with a white or anything no eye
makeup remover tool pumps of that
everything waterproof mascara everything
and I wear some thick foundation girl
and it's just it's great so this is my
latest obsession i'm not i'm going to
say right now it is holy grail i'm not
going to say this is like the only thing
i'll ever buy because i like to try lots
of new stuff out and maybe there will be
something better but this is really
really really good super cute adjective
um it is a little expensive I do want to
say so if you are looking for something
similar try out the Garnier well alright
moving on more skin care stuff and what
I was saying earlier um this is a part
of like a skincare routine that I would
not use in the wintertime because I just
wouldn't have time or when I was in
school things like that maybe well now
but I'm at school who knows but during
the summer and like yeah take your time
like later 25 products on face girl yeah
um you know they say that um you know my
boyfriend is asian and I was talking to
his mom and she actually layers on seven
different products every single night
and you know what asians really really
age well i know a lot of that has to do
with genetics however i think there is
something to uh you know layering
products as long as you let the products
think in before you add the other one
good to go so anyway this is one of
those things that like it just sounds
great during the summertime this is the
is your leak rosewater balancing missed
it says a refreshing mist to hydrate and
soften normally I would do something
like this as a makeup setting spray to
however I got a sample of it and I was
like oh I love the smell it was so rosy
it felt great i was using it to set my
makeup i went online and looked at the
price and this is like 35 dollars for
this little thing so no i will not be
using it to set my makeup because I
spray way too much men I no other makeup
sun's rays are like 35 dollars but this
I'll go through this too quickly if I do
it that way so I'm going to strictly use
it with skincare so after i cleanse I
maybe after I remove my makeup I'm going
to play the song and just go all over it
has a very very overpowering Rose scent
if you like rose but you don't love road
you're gonna hate this like it almost is
some people i think in the review
section like on the safari books like
we're seeing it's not evening I love
rose like I can handle a lot of it this
is like powerful um it says a hydrating
this rich in the living energy of rose
and marshmallow girls spreading
marshmellow on your face to restore tone
and hydrate leaves the skin balanced and
refresh it says shape before use and
then it says gently miss the face with
eyes closed to refresh and tone at any
time so you could use this as your toner
I use a toner I'll either use this
before my timer or after and it's gonna
be great and in the second maybe also
like the last step of my skin care just
like seal everything in oh yeah I'm all
into it now all right next I went on my
tangent about how I'm allergic to the
Sun so I picked up this little thing
Oh Paris my mowing the lawn I am so
sorry guys if you guys can hear that but
anyway I picked up being your ad number
three hydrate and protect essential CSUN
balm this is a broad spectrum SPF 30
flag PA plus plus plus and this is just
a sunscreen stick basically and it says
it shields skin from UV damage is it an
argument or the one the only one was
home anyway but its shield skin from UV
damage and glides on easy for
application this was in the sale section
i was just like sure i'm gonna try it um
it is a love of all it says they have
broccoli extract that's our friend Billy
disgusting but it says tan during butter
after that so that's great but um this
is a chemical sunscreen I normally like
the natural ones even though they do
tend to leave a white cast on my already
white body but sometimes if i blended in
you can tell um sometimes the ones that
have like a bow a bow bends wine and
like ox tell their that all those
chemical ones they sometimes make me
break out so we'll see about this one
like I said it was really cheap it
wasn't for sale hopefully you guys could
hear me that whole time I probably was
just saying you're like hey way alright
so I got that and then I also got the
cha cha Beom from benefit um I have all
of the bombs all of these little I Posie
tint been a balm the peachy one I've all
of them and I love them they smell like
rose love rose and I saw on the website
I thought I had all of them and I saw
that they have this one which is like a
orangie like tangerine color and
supposed to be like mango tinted lip
balm and act like yeah because for fair
skin you know these kind of colors are
good so anyway it's just a tinted lip
balm smells like the other ones like
Rose I actually got my little set of
three in like maybe december after some
kind of scale had gone on and it was
like twenty dollars for all three
however these are like $22 piece but i
really wanted to add this one into my
connection collection my connection i
have a connection with it and i'm adding
into my collection anyway so about the
chop
bomb sure it's going to be great let's
put some on nice i love the sense i love
the texture i just i love it so uh yeah
moving on we're just all over the place
I got another Sephora kick me bomb in
strawberry fizz I have the one in soda
pop and I'm so impressed with these not
just the fact that they're cheaper
Google eggs for today uh eos phones but
um the pigmentation and the joint
ability is amazing look at that gorgeous
super glossy on the lips stays like a
really you know good amount of time this
one smells different this smells like
strawberry the soda popcorn smells like
very good so anyway I had to pick up
another one of those had to you know I
was forced to UM moving on I think oh no
wait I picked up another another carry
grin I'll look with this one is actually
the radiant tinted one so this one has a
little more of a tint than the regular
tinted one when I was using the tinted
one it had like I would say a really
really light pink you know color to it
however this was supposed to be even
deeper and they also have a naked one
and you can pick between two different
sense they have peppermint and they have
cinnamon I like cinnamon but I picked
this one up and peppermint so it looks
like and the texture is just amazing
this reminds me of um and that's the
radiant once you can kind of see that I
have a little more color to it it smells
great um this is like up there on my
list I play flute I am constantly
worried about my lips about them being
dry and things like that so this is up
there with like at the bite beauty about
a lit match absolutely amazing they're
handmade and on the box it says buttery
soft shiny rich and thick handmade in
Seattle only tested on ourselves never
on animals eco-friendly and Audrey's
paraben-free great brands love Harry
grin alright moving on I had tons and
tons of points with Sephora they were
wrapping up so um
I ordered which i order I ordered like
some big set and then I absolutely sent
it to the address that I'm going to be
moving too soon I'm at the cabin right
now so um which i get i got the
bolshevik luminizing black masks or like
the black whatever set so I got that but
I also have a lot more point so I picked
up the first day beauty fab facial
radiance pads they exfoliate tone and
brighten alcohol-free safe for sensitive
skin and it said they are allergy tested
fragrance free hyper allergenic it says
white pad across the face neck and
décolleté once or twice daily after
cleansing I thought these would be
similar to my peter thomas roth
unwrinkle pads however with those ones
you have to wash it off but these ones
he can leave on so I thought I would try
those out um I also got this as a
hundred point purposes the living proof
nourishing styling cream it says it
stops frizz period weightless blocks
humidity or yeah I weightlessly blocks
humidity smooths and conditions no heavy
silicones or oils everybody is raving
about the living proof brand lately and
I just want to try some more stuff in
them so uh and I'm right in time for
that because I just ran out of like my
detangler and like I leavin staff up
here so that's good um I also got
another 100.4 guy got to sunscreens i
picked up the Clarins UV plus
anti-pollution broad-spectrum SPF 50
oil-free sunscreen multi protection
that's quite a mouthful um but this can
be used on the body and the face I'll
probably use it on the face clarins make
some really really great sunscreens it
looks like that and I believe this one
is hold on a sec let me look here okay
no so this is actually a chemical
sunscreen also it's not a national
sunscreen however the other one I picked
up I'll show you guys that right now I
picked up the tart tart guard they
recently came out with a sunscreen I've
been so interested in it so when I saw
that they were having it for a hundred
point per chi definitely add to get it
so on this is fef 30 however this is
natural sunscreen so this is not the
chemical and this has
as you know no parabens no mineral oil
and if a delay to know Driscoll and
whatever that is it's gluten-free
whatever it says active ingredients are
titanium dioxide and zinc oxide so um
that can tend to leave you with a bit of
a white cast so you really want to make
sure that you're blending it in but i
personally prefer um these active
ingredients compared to the chemical
ones all right I have some samples I
don't know why but i always get doubles
so i got two of the dr brandt needles no
more samples I've gone through a
actually full size of this product I
liked it it's quite expensive though so
picked up those two I already used one
of these this with a little scent
adventure from Sephora this was the Marc
Jacobs mod more perfume I already used
this little one oh my goodness i'm
buying this perfume i know that i have
too many perfumes but i am going to buy
it because it smells amazing it's like a
great mix of like it says gardenias
collide with a sensual preview musk yeah
so you get like everything in that
perfume it's great to samples of the
chloe perfume and then i got two samples
of the benefit Porefessional so anyway i
cough you guys enjoyed this hall um I
hope you guys enjoyed watching what i
got from sephora and i'll see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
