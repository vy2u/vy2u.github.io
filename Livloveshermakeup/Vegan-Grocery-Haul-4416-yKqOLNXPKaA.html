I have a whole football for you guys if
you've been watching me since the
beginning you would know that when i was
living in new york i used to do a whole
foods hall every single week on Sundays
after i volunteered at the cat shelter i
would go and do a whole foods all and i
will show you guys what I got now I want
to say right away all the foods here are
vegan except for a few things that I
picked up for Tom I'll tell you which
ones they are you'll be able to tell
because they're all meat and he's a very
carnivorous man but anyway everything
else is completely vegan I just want to
tell you guys right away this is not
like anything new to me I was actually
raised vegan and I was thinking about
doing a video with my mom on that
because we were talking about it and she
was saying um you know she was kind of
disappointed that she raised me very
very healthy completely vegan and I kind
of adapted some bad eating habits and a
lot of the foods that i'm going to show
you guys are basically like vegan junk
food because i really don't eat very
healthy so I don't want any of you to um
you know go and take my advice and think
that this is like very healthy it's
really not super healthy food I just
want to put that out out there right
away and I really don't notice the
difference in like weight or anything
like that when I go back to like a vegan
or vegetarian a life like you you know
like God diet I was going to say
lifestyle change same thing when I like
go back to veganism or vegetarianism I
really don't notice the different with
my weight I don't really do it for
weight but I do notice that I just feel
healthier overall and just lighter and
not so bloated and gross so if you guys
would like to see a video with my mom
next time I see her maybe we'll do a
video on why she raised me completely
vegan but anyway i thought i would share
with you guys and what I picked up
because I have been doing this for a
long time like I said for over 23 years
now I've been on and off again vegan so
i thought i would share with you guys
what I got and let you know some of the
yummy junk foods that you can pick up as
a vegan so the first thing i got was the
earth balance original a buttery spread
this is completely vegan it's really
really good it is a butter alternative
and i actually got introduced and
introduced to this by my mom so really
really good it is very delicious it's
Nnanji about I swear to you this
actually really does taste like butter I
like that a lot
the next thing I got is the tofurkey
Italian sausage and fire roasted veggie
pizza so you guys know my favorite food
is cheese so you would think it would be
very very difficult for me to give up
cheese but every time I go back to like
a vegetarian or vegan diet I don't
really have an issue but this has
non-dairy cheese in it it's so good and
you just get like all these vegetables
on here and the cheese actually tastes
like cheese so I really really like this
one from tofurkey I got some
vine-ripened tomatoes I do not buy
organic produce just so you guys know
because I don't eat a lot of produce I
know I what kind of vegan says that no
but I don't eat a lot of produce however
um I've never noticed a big difference
between organic and non-organic and
that's just a whole we can have a whole
different discussion on that and I guess
I'll talk about that if I ever do that
video with my mom because she raised me
like completely organic as well and I
don't eat that way at all alright the
next thing I got was this big like
container here of sliced cucumbers and
you're probably thinking what's wrong
with you why don't you just life in
yourself I like them like this because
then I could just grab him and put him
in a little baggie and then dip them in
hummus or do whatever so yes got those
pre-cuts I also got this Ezekiel bread
this is my favorite favorite favorite
vegan bread it's just made from like
sprouted grains it's a very very good
and very hearty I got two lemons to make
some lemon water i also got to some
strawberries here to make some
strawberry basil spa water I got two
peppers I got a red pepper and then in
orange pepper I got to the Boca vegan
burgers now these are not as good as
just the regular vegetarian burgers i
would recommend those more but these are
still pretty darn good i like to have
that with some Ezekiel bread and some
vegenaise yes this is mayonnaise but for
vegans and it actually tastes pretty
darn good I grew up pretty much eating
this step and it really does taste very
very similar so yes I pics on that up so
I like to have this toasted with that
some lettuce and then the vegenaise and
then I picked up sorry for the sniffly
nose guys I picked up some salsa this is
the peach and mango 365 brand that is
just part of the whole foods like you
know their little nether compared to its
like their home brand or house brand
alright I picked up some of these
Hillary's peanut butter and chocolate
cookies these are completely vegan they
are delicious I think they're made
somewhere in the Midwest so I don't know
if you can find them but they're super
soft and chewy and delicious I picked up
some coffee creamer this is the soy
delicious dairy-free almond milk french
vanilla coffee creamer I picked up some
olives because i just cannot live
without olives here is the pretzel buns
that are for Tom he really likes
anything pretzel and then I picked up
this raspberry basil vinaigrette I
thought it sounded really really good
and I don't know I love strawberry and
basil so i think i will love the
raspberry and basil and then again i
just don't like cutting all my stuff so
I by I like to buy like the pre-cut
which is such a waste of money but this
is just pre-cut grapefruit because
grapefruits take forever for me to cut
up like if I'm going to eat it I have to
cut all the little squares a little
triangles just take forever all right
let's talk about some vegan chips
bonitos these are so good these are made
from beans very very good these are the
original black bean and I'm going to dip
them in the salsa and also i got the
restaurant style ones these are just a
little thinner and crispier all of the
kettle brand has pretty much of vegan
chips i love anything sea salt and
vinegar so highly recommend those if you
love macaroni and cheese like i do this
is the best vegan mac and cheese you
will ever find this is the earth balance
vegan mac this is Beach vegan mac vegan
macaroni and cheese this is the cheddar
one and then this is the white cheddar
one seriously it tastes very very good
you mix it with a little bit of the
earth balance butter and then some water
or some almond milk and then these are
really good too these are just one of
those things you can take to work with
you they're very easy to heat up in the
microwave this is organic noodles asian
style soy ginger and it is vegan it says
has a little V on the back right they
are vegan so both of these are vegan and
this one is pad thai they're both really
really good I got some organic medjool
dates i only got organic because they
didn't have the other ones but yeah
these are expensive but so so good all
right I got Tom some pork belly he'll
probably toast these and then put that
on there and then I got some what are
these pixie tram terrines how cute is
that they're like little mini tangerines
I thought they loved or really darn good
and then I got two of my favorite teas
these are the palms super fruit teas
with pomegranate peach passion white tea
next super good and then I got this for
Tom as well this is the
fail at a cold brew coffee with almond
milk alright guys that is my little
grocery haul I hope you enjoyed this
video if you like these let me know and
maybe I'll keep filming them and yeah
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
