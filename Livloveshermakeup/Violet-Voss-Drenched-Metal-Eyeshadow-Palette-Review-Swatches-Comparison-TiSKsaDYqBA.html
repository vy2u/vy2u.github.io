today's video I am sharing with you guys
a review I just realized I'm wearing
pink nail polish and everything bread I
do not like pink and red together so
just pretend the nail polish is not
there anyway in today's video I am
giving you guys a review and swatches
and also a quick little comparison and
maybe some color dupes for you guys on
the new a violent Ross Pro drenched
metal eyeshadow palette so recently they
released at this particular palette on
their website for $52 and they had a
deal when I went onto the website they
had a deal where you could get to the
Holy Grail palette and also the drenched
metal for 84 dollars now I was not
really thinking about even getting
either of these palettes in the first
place but I had a friend who did a
review on the Holy Grail palette and it
looked amazing
I mean absolutely beautiful absolutely
amazing so when I thought that I could
get both of them for $84 I did go ahead
and purchase them I'm gonna leave a link
down below where you guys can pick up at
these eyeshadow palettes I think right
now they're both sold out but they do
like a little countdown on their website
when the products will be back in stock
so just check back but yeah you can get
either of these for $52 or you can just
get the new one the drenched metal for
$52 or the two of them together for 84
which i think is a relatively good deal
for what you aren't getting in here I
want to say really really quickly I was
going to post a video today also on the
makeup forever
festival eyes eye liner kids and I'm
sorry you guys I'm welcome a little
later today so I'm only gonna be able to
get this video up at this review for
this product will be up on Friday I just
wanted to mention that because I said in
yesterday's video that this would be up
today it's gonna have to wait til Friday
anyway so like I said at $52 a piece for
these palettes and you do get twenty
eyes shadows in there so I was really
excited to get both of them and I think
they are absolutely absolutely stunning
beautiful palettes so we're gonna do a
review and swatches and let me share
with you guys how they came packaged so
they actually came in a really cute
little box they have cute little
stickers all over it this was my first
time purchasing from the violet frosted
brand and I actually was very very
impressed
I'm very impressed with the brand if
they released another eyeshadow palette
I'm gonna go ahead and get my hands on
it because I think the Holy Grail and
the drench not our drench no they are
absolutely beautiful I'm really really
impressed so anyway this is the actual
outside packaging or the actual box that
it comes in and it says violet Voss
cosmetics is proud to present twenty
highly pigmented eyeshadows in a variety
of must-have finishes our Pro eyeshadows
are made with the highest quality
ingredients and formulated to allow for
smooth blending the perfect go-to for
any occasion to create your flawless
sexy look so this is the outer packaging
and then they did come really nicely
wrapped with tons of bubble wrap which I
love because I have never purchased from
violet boss I don't really know what I
was gonna get to be completely honest I
hope you guys don't call me out for
saying this but I think there's so many
brands that are getting like hyped up on
YouTube or hyped up on Instagram and
then you go and you purchase these items
and you're like this is such shit like
the products are just complete crap and
the only reason they got so hyped up in
the first place was because some big
youtuber said oh go buy this or I love
this or I love this palette or whatever
I'm not gonna name names on brands but I
think you guys probably know the brands
that I'm talking about
I was just pleasantly surprised to see
that these are actually really really
good quality and I do think that's a
violet Voss brand should be hyped up for
sure so anyway the other packaging looks
like this it's a very reminiscent of the
lorac Pro palette which by the way did
you guys see that they're releasing a
lorac pro 3 palettes I cannot wait for
that anyway they're very reminiscent
they're very very skinny like this and
let's just take the drenched metal first
since this is the one we're reviewing
very very small and sleek it is kind of
made out of cardboard it has that sort
of like NARS packaging on the top which
kind of leaves a little bit of
fingerprints but then this part is
cardboard so you open it up you do get a
little bit of a mirror here and it says
violet Voss Pro and here is the drenched
metal eyeshadow palette you are getting
20 shadows here ranging from maps to
kind of shimmery shades and there's
maybe one or two they have a little bit
of I don't want to say grit to them but
a little bit of glitter in there so
anyway here we have popping kisses
confession crushed it secret I'm so
fancy mermaid vixen
grunge makes squat goals frisky dark
desires slay Haitian come through livin
shade bliss huntress forbidden and
midnight trysts
how cute are those names even with the
Holy Grail palette they just have the
cutest names ever so anyway this is what
the French metal palette looks like and
I have to say I think it's absolutely
stunning it pulls a lot of like a cool
undertone and I personally have a cool
undertone in my skin even though I'm
wearing all warm tones today but I am
not wearing some of the warmer colors in
here and I just want to say if you are
looking into the Holy Grail palette
because you love those really gorgeous
kind of reddish auburn beautiful kind of
berry colors you still get a few of
those in this palette so I don't think
it's necessary to purchase both but I
will show you guys the Holy Grail
palette in a second but anyway on the
shades that I am wearing today on my
eyes are Huntress I have this color
right here in my crease I have the shade
forbidden in my outer V I also have the
two of these on my lower lashline and
then I have this shade live in all over
my lid and then I have puffin on my brow
and on the inner corner of my eyes on my
brows under my brow and on the inner
corner of my eyes so overall I think
you're getting a really cool color
variety and color selection in here
you're getting some blue colors some
cool tone like greyish sort of dusty
Brown colors you're getting some warmer
colors down here you're getting a almost
matte black this one is probably the
weakest out of the bunch it has sort of
like a little bit of grit to it it's
like a matte with very very tiny amounts
of glitter in it but it's a little more
textured than some of the other ones in
here but for the most part you're
getting a very very smooth creamy matte
you're eating very very very smooth
creamy like shimmery colors they're
absolutely beautiful these are extremely
pigmented and they wear forever on the
eyes I have tried these without eye
primer I have tried them with eye primer
they blend out like a dream if you guys
have been watching my channel for a
while you know I am NOT a huge fan of
sitting there for 25 minutes and
blending eyeshadow out it's just not who
I am I am NOT a makeup artist or
anything
that I'd like to just have a nice
blended I look really really quickly I
completed this I look in under five
minutes today it's amazing
so these blend out really really well
they're very very beautiful and they are
extremely soft and buttery so let me go
ahead and show you guys the holy grail
palette as well so here is the holy
grail palette you have the same sort of
setup here you have twenty eyeshadows
with some mats some shimmers and and
then you do have it so funny because the
shade midnight trysts the one that's
kind of like not the greatest in the
other palette is the same sort of
texture as wine and dine down here and
they happen to have the same sort of
texture to them and they're both at the
bottom of the pallets in the same exact
spot I thought that was kind of silly
but anyway this is what the cute pallets
look like next to each other so you can
see that we have the drenched metal
which has more cool tones and then the
Holy Grail definitely has more red tones
and even though it might look like on my
eyes today I'm wearing the Holy Grail
palette I created this warm sort I look
with these colors down here so I don't
think it's absolutely necessary if you
really really want the drenched metal
and you like those cool tones I don't
think it's absolutely necessary to get
the Holy Grail the Holy Grail definitely
has more transition colors it's got a
little more warm undertone but at the
same time I do think you get some nice
warm colors in here so this is the two
of them and next to each other they are
so stunning you guys I am absolutely
loving loving loving these palettes so
anyways let me know down below if you
would like a separate of you on the Holy
Grail palette I'm not going to spend too
much time talking about this one but I
will say that they do have comparable
formulas so all of the mats are very
very similar very creamy and blendable
the shimmery colors in there very very
nice they just glisten on the eyes they
just have a beautiful beautiful Sheen to
them without being chunky and glittery
and then the other kind of glittery
shades in there which are almost
non-existent glitter I feel like they
should have just been mattes like the
shades midnight tryst and also that wine
and dine shade they just have like they
look like they're mattes but then when
you put them on there's the slightest
amount of glitter which just gives them
a little more grit so anyway let's go
ahead and start so watching the drenched
metal palette I'm going to
starts I'm gonna go this way actually
because then I can swatch four at a time
for you guys
so the first shade is poppy then we have
I'm so fancy
we have frisky and then we also have
shade so there they are on my feet us
how the hell did I don't even know what
that is always good stuff all over mates
but anyway here they are so the blue
color we have here is called frisky and
then the kind of turquoise color is
called I'm so fancy we have pop it and
then we have shade so here they are up
close this is without eyeprimer and they
are so beautiful these all have a little
bit of Sheen to them a little bit I
don't even want to call them like a
satin texture because they're not they
kinda remind me of like a makeup forever
artist shadow or even like a makeup geek
foiled eyeshadow hopefully you guys know
what I mean by that and then the next
row we have kisses mermaid a vixen I
love that names we have dark desires and
bliss
so kisses is this beautiful sort of
dusty rosy pink color mermaid vixen is a
gorgeous kind of dark blue with like a
aqua base there we have dark desires
which is just a dark purple color love
it and then bliss is an olive green
color I really like this shade a lot so
there they are so this is bliss oh my
god I can't do that without moving both
my pinky is bliss and then we have dark
desires on my ring finger the middle
finger is kisses and then we have a
mermaid fixing up right here so let's go
ahead and swatch those and you guys
these just go on so beautifully I do
have a little bit I'll fall out with
them I'm not gonna lie but look at those
don't they look like they're foiled
absolutely stunning absolutely
absolutely stunning but like I said I
feel like they do have a slight amount
of Fallout but it's nothing crazy like
it's nothing that you can't deal with
really really quickly with taking a
brush like right underneath your eye
there is a little bit of fallout but I'm
actually kind of surprised that there is
fallout might I say because they seem to
have that really sort of foil texture
all right so the next row is kind of
session which is like this beautiful it
actually reminds me of the Urban Decay
vice for flame color I think
called flame beautiful color it's like a
pinky orange color and then we have
grunge which is a beautiful kind of
olive green color like bliss but I had a
little more of like a dirty color to it
like a little more like bathwater color
and then we have slate Asian which is so
cute that's like a duochrome it kind of
reminds me of the what is that max blue
brown pigment I believe and then we have
hundreds which I have in my crease today
which is a beautiful sort of warm I
don't even know how to describe it it's
like a beautiful warm brown color but it
has a little bit of like a golden
undertone so here we have confession and
then we have grunge then we have slake
ation and then we have Huntress they are
so beautiful and these are all again I
think you guys are seen when I swatch
these that they all have a little bit of
shimmer in them I will let you know when
we get to the mattes
there they are isn't that beautiful that
definitely reminds me of that definer
shade in the wet and wild comfort zone
palette and also max blue brown pigment
really really beautiful alright moving
on the next one we have is crushed it
and crushed it kind of reminds me a
little bit of living and a mixture of
living and mixed together so you get
this kind of like pretty gold color but
it has a little bit of like a pink
undertone it's very pretty and then we
have a mix and mix just have this sort
of dusty dirty ish color kind of like
grunge but it has a little more warmth
to it and then we have come through
which is a beautiful like yellow color
like pure yellow not really gold just
pure yellow and then we have forbidden
which is just so beautiful so there they
are so this one right here is crushed it
then we have a mix then we have come
through and then we have forbidden and
they are just so beautiful you guys so
here they are look at those are you a
theme like a look at these look how
beautifully they go onto the skin
there's no dustiness there's no strange
like chalkiness these just collide I'm
like a freaking dream alright and then
the
bro here we have our mat and that is
secret which is a beautiful transition
color we have squad goals how cute are
these names we got live in and then we
have midnight tryst which is my least
favorites which I've already stated but
seriously the shade right here secret oh
my god
filled like butters also so you guys
know just in general I personally do
think that midnight trysts does have a
little bit of glitter in there some
people might consider it a matte I
personally do not but out of this whole
palette I would really only say that
secret is the only man in here and if
you were curious all right so we have
secrets and we have school on goals
which is a beautiful Goldy color with a
little bit of bronze in it we have
living which is more of a true bronze
and then midnight trysts it's kind of
that black color but it's really really
black it's got the tiniest amount of
little bit of shimmers in there so here
we have a squad goals and then here we
have secret we have living and then we
have midnight tryst
so we'll do midnight wrist first you
guys will see right away to see that
give me that know like that is totally
the one in the palette but just it
doesn't cut it I mean I think you can
instantly see and yeah it's just it's
kind of obvious that this is like it's
chalky
it's got a little bit of grit there it's
not beautiful whatsoever and I feel like
this shade in the Holy Grail palette but
in the same exact spot is it did Wine
and Dine is the same exact way so those
are really the only two in these
palettes that are not that wonderful but
anyway those are all of these swatches
I'm sorry I feel like I didn't hold them
up long enough somebody was complaining
last time that I don't hold my swatches
long enough but I will go ahead and post
pictures of swatches on my Instagram if
you guys would like but yeah let's take
one more look at this beautiful palette
here is the crushed metals palette is
top what it's called wait a minute
drenched metals like crushed metals
Dhiraj de Meadows palette lots of
gorgeous cool tones in here you're
getting some pops of color and you're
also getting se warm tones and then here
is the holy grail palette again let me
know if you guys would like a full
review on this particular palette I want
to say if you're really into these
beautiful kind of like mulberry very
sort of shades
highly recommend checking out the Knicks
ultimate shadow palette in the shade
warm neutrals there is a lot of gorgeous
gorgeous sort of reddish colors in here
as well and this is like you know pretty
much half the price it's not less so if
you are interested in the Holy Grail
palette I think the next one is really
really nice these are a lot more smooth
and creamy and easier to blend but if
you are just looking for colors that are
similar definitely check out the next
ultimate palette alright guys so that
was my quick little review and this was
not quick at all about 14 minutes long
but my little review and swatches and
quick little comparison on those two of
violet vos palettes I'm so impressed
like I said I am one of those people
where I feel like there are so many
brands that are being like discovered on
Instagram or YouTube and a lot of them
are hyped up like just crazy hyped up
and I think a lot of the products are
not good but this violet Voss Brad's in
general I need to check out more of
their products but I'm very very
impressed with their eyeshadows they
stay in place they're beautiful they're
creamy they're blendable they're just
absolutely stunning
so very very impressed definitely worth
it the $84 for the two of them or $52 a
piece like I said a link below it's not
an affiliate link or any anyway shaper
for anything like that but I will go
ahead and link below where you guys can
pick them up hopefully when they're back
in stock and yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if you
want a full review on the Holy Grail
palette and I'll see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
