are up-close-and-personal today because
I have a showdown video for you guys
another one this time we are doing eyes
shadow palettes specifically from the
brand of violet Voss you guys know I've
been obsessed with the violet boss
brands I love their drenched metals
eyeshadow palettes I love the Laura Lee
palette I love the holy grail palette
and I got a few of you asking me which
one would be best for you so we're gonna
kind of do a little bit of a showdown in
comparison I'm going to do some swatches
from each palette I'm going to tell you
what I personally think would be best
but again you know these are just my
opinion so you know you can do whatever
the hell you want if you really want to
grab a certain palette go ahead and do
that I'm just gonna let you guys know
which one is my personal favorite and
also I will let you know which one I
think would be best for like you know
your skin tone and things like that so
let's go ahead and get started all of
the violet boss eyeshadow palettes are
the same price I will link down below
it's not an affiliate link but I believe
oh my phone just go off yes sorry I will
link down below where you guys can pick
them up if you are interested they all
come in this standard kind of matte
black packaging I don't like the
packaging because you do get your
fingerprints on it and like excess
makeup however I do like it because it's
so sweet
do you see that very very sleek super
super travel friendly reminds me of the
lorac Pro or just like yeah I would say
the lorac pro eyes shadow palettes for
sure you do get a mirror in here and
then you get the standard layout which
is 20 different eyeshadow palettes so I
guess we'll go ahead and start with this
one which is the drenched metals
eyeshadow palette I did do a full review
on this and I will link that down below
but this is what the drenched metal
eyeshadow palette looks like now in my
opinion viola box has three different
formulations not formulations three
different finishes that they work with I
think all of their formulations are
beautiful their mats their glitter
shades their foiled shades I think
they're really stunning but I would say
the majority of shades that you get in
this particular palette which is the
drenched metals are definitely
definitely their foiled formula which is
my all-time favorite they're shimmery
buttery foiled formula so if you are
really attracted to that super super
high pigment super like shiny look on
the eyes this is the perfect palette for
you to pick up you are only getting two
matte shades in here this one down here
which is called midnight tryst and this
one up here which is called secret
now I do want to say if you are
interested in picking up this eyeshadow
palette I do think it's beautiful if you
do have a cooler undertone in your skin
like I do you can see the majority of
the shades in here are definitely more
on the blue side the purple side you're
getting some nice green shades but they
all tend to have a little more of a cool
undertone so if you do have a cool
undertone of your skin I think you would
absolutely love this palette and again
if you really like that full-on SH -
kind of pigment look you would really
enjoy this one because like I said they
really only have two matte shades in
here now just so you guys know because
they only have a transition shade up
here called secret which is matte and
then midnight tryst which is like a
liner shade you do need to go ahead and
pull in another eyeshadow palette with
this if you do want like some more
transition shades or two buff colors out
which normally you do with a matte
shadow you do need to go ahead and grab
another palette also for your brow bone
if you don't want to use something super
super shimmery like these two shades up
here you do need to pull in another
eyeshadow palette and I think a lot of
people don't realize that with this
particular one but you do need to pull
in another eyeshadow palette so overall
I would say if you have a cool undertone
it in your skin if you love that foiled
high shine look and also if you're more
interested in having having shimmery
shades than having matte shades I would
highly highly recommend checking this
one out just be advised that you do need
to pull in another palette when you are
working with it alright the next one we
are going to talk about is the Holy
Grail eyes shadow palette and this is
what the Holy Grail eyes shadow palette
looks like and in this one you are
getting some really nice warm and cool
toned berry colors going on in here you
are getting a third of each I would say
you are getting some matte finishes you
are getting some foiled finishes and you
are also getting some glitter finishes
out of all three this is my all-time
favorite palette and this is the one
that is my ride-or-die and it's not only
because of the colors you guys like I
have a cool undertone in my skin I'm
wearing to Laura Lee on palette today
which is more on the warmer side I still
think it looks quite nice on my eyes but
I feel like with this one I can get
those beautiful berry tones smokey eyes
and I can still get like a cool toned
look or warm tones look I really like
how you have
some warm tones down here you have some
cool tones down here you're getting
matte finishes you're getting brow bone
shades you're getting transition shades
you're getting everything that you could
need in here and out of all three viola
boss eyes shadow palettes I just have to
say this one is definitely my all-time
favorite so let me go ahead and do some
swatches for you guys on these this
first shade here is the foil shade it's
called toffee and it definitely is one
of my favorites do you guys see that
look at that isn't that beautiful
this one down here is called wine and
dine which is a beautiful pure cranberry
color it has a little more grit to it
but it pretty much is a matte so there
is wine and dine and then let me go
ahead and also um swatch the shade
transition which is the perfect
transition shade it's just a buttery
buttery matte color so there is
transition I just love these kind of
colors I love that you can get some cool
tone books in here I love that you can
get some warm tone looks I like that
there are like some matte brow bone
shades I also like that there are some
nice transition shades things like that
because if there's one thing that I
really don't put a lot of time into its
blending so it's really nice to be able
to jump into a color like thanks a lot a
which is like a beautiful kind of like
cool toned gray transition shade it's
nice to be able to dip in there and kind
of blend out your smoky eye really
quickly or something like that but it's
also nice that they have these cool tone
brown colors at the bottom so this one
right here is teddy bear this one's
brownie points this one's thinks a latte
let me go ahead and swatch those for you
guys I just think that out of all three
palettes if you're really looking for a
solid one you have like a neutral
undertone or a warm undertone or a cool
undertone I think this is the one that
you want to get honestly now of course
like if you prefer the colors in here if
you want pops of color you should go for
the drenched metals if you just want
neutral everyday sort of colors I think
that the Holy Grail is beautiful yes you
are getting some more berry tones down
here but if I cover this section up you
can see that this area over here is
completely neutral so that's definitely
something to think about I would say out
of all of these palettes this one's
definitely my favorite I just like the
variety I like the cool tones I like the
warm tones and I love those berry tones
alright and finally
we have the lauralee eyeshadow palette
so here is the Laura Lee eyeshadow
palette you are getting 20 shades in
here as well and 10 of them are matched
so if you are a matte lover
this is going to be your paradise I
would say ten of them are matte about
five yeah about five of them are glitter
finishes and five of them are foiled
finishes you're getting a lot more of
those kind of textured glitter shades in
here you guys can probably see just the
grit like on the actual finger but these
blend out beautifully they are high high
high pigment so even with if they go on
and they feel slightly gritty they still
kind of blend out to a foiled finish I
think they're absolutely stunning you
guys and I really think that this
palette is beautiful if you have a warm
undertone if you love those burnt orange
colors this is going to be the palette
that you want to reach for it is like
transition city here okay these colors
up here are absolutely stunning you have
Priss pot mama-bird ragamuffin they're
just absolutely gorgeous
you have some nice matte liner shades
down here as well you have Alabama
whiskers Bub's
you just have some really really nice
colors here and then you are getting
some pops of color like smashley which
is stunning this color is like a green
it's like a dark forest green with like
a gold undertone oh my god you guys it's
so beautiful look at that look at that
swatch oh my god I'm sorry I don't even
know where my phone is but I can hear it
so look at this isn't that beautiful
almost looks like an aquamarine when you
have it actually on your eye you have
the shade Biddy you have 1988 which is
similar to Biddy again more of a glitter
finish so definitely make sure when
you're working with this one that you
are going ahead and pulling in maybe a
glitter glue primer I do have this on my
eyes today and let me tell you guys
quickly what I'm wearing I'm just
wearing the shade hissy-fit which is a
foiled shade like I said I love the
foiled formula from the viola boss
eyeshadows it's just my favorite I just
love the way it goes on it's not too
gritty it's easy to blend it's so pretty
so I do have that shade on my crease
today and on my lower lash line and then
all I did was mix the shade fleeky and
fleeky again is kind of like a yellow
gold shade and this one is also foiled
so I really like this palette because
you are getting so many different tones
you're getting warm tones you're getting
cool tones you are getting glitter
finishes
you're getting a whole lot of matte
finishes like I said if you are a matte
kind of girl if you love having nice
transition shades to blend out you also
have a nice solid white color in here
for a brow bone color which is called
basic if you like having shades like
that then you definitely want to go
ahead and get this one
don't even bother but lip butter don't
even bother with the drenched metals
eyeshadow palette here's my phone I
found it sorry guys
okay um don't even bother with the
drench metal eyeshadow palette if you
want lots of math because this isn't
going to have it
the Holy Grail eyes shadow palette in my
opinion is the best for everyone still
but if you really really want matte
shades don't go with this one either I'm
the only one that has 10 matte shades in
it is the Laura Lee so anyway beautiful
beautiful eyeshadow palette again nice
selection of warm tones some cool tones
mostly warm tones in here if you like
those burnt orange and red colors I
think you would like this one when I
hold this up next to the Holy Grail you
can actually see that the Holy Grail
done definitely has a little more cool
tones in it than warm tones I feel like
this is definitely more warm tone this
is more neutral it can go either way um
and yeah so I hope that this was helpful
I didn't want to go too much in depth
because I've already done reviews on
these particular products but in my
opinion as the one that I think would
work out for everyone because it can
either be pops of color or just like
completely neutral is the Holy Grail
eyes shadow palette you're getting some
glitter finishes and here's some foil
shades and then you're getting the matte
so you get a nice feeling for made by
Lafosse formulation in general so this
one is definitely my favorite but all
three of them are beautiful and stunning
you guys definitely do some more
research and figure out which one you
would like um for yourself and yeah I
hope this video was helpful thank you
for joining me and I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
