this video I have a review and swatches
for you guys on the new violet boss Pro
highlighting powder palette or trio and
this is what the outer packaging looks
like and if you are unfamiliar with the
violet Fawcett brand they are a cruelty
free brand that is sold at Ricky's New
York and also online on their shop by
lavash calm websites I will link below
where you guys can pick up this
particular product if you are interested
now I do want to say they still are kind
of like an up-and-coming brand so they
really sell out of products quickly
because they don't order a whole lot so
if you do want to get your hands on this
palette or like the Holy Grail eyes
shadow palette or the drench metals
eyeshadow palette you may have to wait a
little bit until they have their next
shipment and also you don't need to pay
for like expedited shipping or anything
like that because they do ship
everything out at the same time in bulk
to everyone so anyway just wanted to put
that out there but yeah I picked this up
from the online website I believe it was
twenty-five or thirty dollars which I
thought was a great deal you do get I
believe 12 grand some products in here
yeah 12 grams or 0.4 or 4 ounces of
product and you are getting three
highlighters that are different in tone
and they're different in just undertone
they're beautiful you're getting like a
really nice light a medium and then a
dark one and they just have a beautiful
variety going on I feel like this is a
really really nice highlighting palette
if you are new to highlighting you don't
really know what your undertone is or
you don't know if a warm undertone or a
cool undertone or whatever is gonna look
good on you I would highly recommend
checking this out because sometimes it
can be difficult with highlighters
especially for me like I have fair skin
sometimes you know a yellowy gold
highlight just doesn't look right on my
skin because it's too dark or you know I
pulley very strong pink undertone it
just doesn't look right so it takes a
little bit of time to kind of play
around with different highlighters to
find the sort of color that's really
really nice on your skin and I feel like
this is the first highlighting palette
that I've come across it really gives a
nice amount of variety
so anyway this is what the actual
packaging looks like it's just a really
nice sleek little pilot it reminds me of
their eyeshadow palettes and also of the
lorac Pro our shadow palettes and on the
back you have the three names of the
highlighters and they are moon gleam
which is the one I am wearing today that
we have star glow and also unicorn
luster and you open it up you have just
kind of this little like cheapy mirror
here and a little bow thing it says
viola Faust and then here is the actual
packaging it is cardboard and there is
this little emboss thing here but I
don't really mind it's you know what's
on the inside that counts so anyway here
are the three shades that you get so
this one is beautiful this is unicorn
luster I like to use this as an all-over
bronzer on my particular skin tone it
kind of reminds me of our glasses
ambient lighting powder in the shade dim
lights because it has this sort of
neutrally grayish cool tone like
undertone I don't know how to describe
it but it's really really beautiful and
as you can see compared to this one
right here which is star glow it is
significantly cooler in tone
so this one is star glow and then we
have moon gleam which is the lightest
one moogly definitely have that
champagne II sort of yellow undertone
it's sort of similar to Becca's
shimmering skin perfecter in the shade
and moonstone let me hold them next to
each other so you can see sort of
similar but Becca's a moonstone actually
has a lot more yellow undertones so
hopefully you guys can see that moon
bling definitely has more champagne E
undertones and it's really beautiful on
fair skin I do have a cool undertone and
normally I prefer like a pinky highlight
but I love the way this looks
it doesn't darken up on my skin when I
turn my head is perfect it truly is a
highlight on me and so yeah I really
like what's going on here as far as
colors are concerned a lot of the times
they feel like with highlighting palette
brands just don't like I don't know they
don't explore enough you know what I
mean they don't get dark enough or they
don't go with different undertones and
things like that so I love that you have
this really warm undertone you have
and if this this is also more like warm
but a little more neutral and then you
have this cool undertone here so I feel
like this really would be nice for all
sorts of different skin tones and also
skin types
the particular formulation on these is
really incredible I'll get to that in a
second
but I really like that you know I feel
like it's not one of those palettes
words like one size fits all I feel like
somebody with really really deep dark
chocolatey skin could definitely
highlight with this particular shade
someone who has like a nice tan
complexion could highlight with this and
then people like me can highlight with
that so I like that it just is you know
it's a palette that works for everyone
hopefully um but anyway so this is what
they look like they're so pretty you
guys they're just so beautiful so the
first thing I want to talk about as far
as formulation is concerned is I'm gonna
turn this a little bit you guys can see
there's a little bit of like texture
there and not so much texture but when
you rub your finger in there the product
starts to ball up a little bit it's
almost like a foiled eyeshadow or like a
makeup forever artists shadow it's got a
little bit of grip to it and at first I
was like oh my god no I'm not gonna like
that I do like that when I shot when I'm
using eyeshadows because I feel like it
really makes them stick onto the lid but
I thought that this formulation is gonna
stick on to you know dry patches cling
to my pores just make me look horrible
basically it's the exact opposite as
long as you're using the right kind of
brush with these highlighters it's just
beautiful you just get this really
really gorgeous like wet slick looking a
highlight and it's just absolutely
stunning they are incredibly pigmented I
would say moon gleam it's probably two
times as pigmented as the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
so if you think that the Becca
shimmering excuse me if you think that
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone or any shade really is super
super pigmented you will be amazed by
these they seriously have just such a
beautiful beautiful quality to them I
love the pigmentation I love the blend
ability and yeah I just can't say enough
about them they're absolutely stunning
so let's talk quickly about what kind of
bull rush
should probably use with these I have
tried using this product with a fan
brush it's just not very good because it
does have a little more of a chunky
formulation it doesn't pick up evenly on
the brush like the fan brush you really
have to kind of dip it in there it's
just it's too light it's too flimsy so I
like to use something like my lucky 522
tapered highlighter something that is
not super dense but I have a lot of
bristles and I'll just swirl into the
product tap off the excess and then I'll
really really kind of buff it in almost
like I'm using like a baked Jala sort of
formulation these are not baked jala
formulations by any means but it's
almost like that I feel like with like
my Dior nude air glowing Garmin's
highlights and all of like my gelato
baked swirl illuminators and things like
that the ones that have like that beit
jala formulation I really have to buff
into the skin for them to look natural
it's the same with these they will sit
on top of the skin if you don't buff
them in so I highly recommend using
something like this I mean it could even
be like the Real Techniques buffing
brush that would be great as well but
anyway I just wanted to put that out
there because if you use these the wrong
way you're not gonna like what they do
because they will sit on top of the skin
they will start to make you know your
crow's feet and your fine lines look
really emphasized and it just looks like
artificial like oh if she has highlight
on so anyway that's my one little tip
also you can wet your brush and that
kind of helps to blend things in a
little bit as well I know it does
actually make them a little more foiled
but it really helps with texture if you
deal with a lot of texture on your skin
I would just go for like a light hand
with these because they are so pigmented
anything that is light reflecting and
pigmented is going to you know distract
the eye and want to look at that area so
if you deal with lots of light breakouts
and things like that around your
cheekbone area you know these are very
very like in your face kind of
highlights so this may not be what
you're looking for but overall I think
that the quality the quality of these
aren't amazing they last with or without
a primer today I am wearing my Urban
Decay Naked skin one and done hybrid
complexion Perfector and this is
basically just like a tinted moisturizer
or BB cream
barely any coverage and I still feel
like this particular shade moon gleam I
like it just lasted all day it looks
beautiful it still looks fresh it's not
kicking up if there is one area where it
starts to take up a little bit
throughout the day it's definitely
around this area like the eye area so if
you do have an issue with kind of
getting like creases over there I would
recommend just taking it down to the
apple of the cheek and then bring me it
more towards the back of your cheekbone
but anyway I think this is an awesome
palette I cannot recommend it enough I
think there's something in here for
everyone and these other shades I still
use you know like the star glow shade I
really like as a blush topper and then a
unicorn luster I use it was a really
really fluffy brush and I will bronze
with it so yeah let's go ahead and
starts watching these babies so here is
move Lane and this is the one I'm
wearing today do you see the pigment oh
my gosh that's amazing so there is a
moon gleam really really beautiful I
like that it doesn't change in undertone
or in shade like when I twist my hand it
still stays even like the color if that
makes sense the next one we have is star
glow which is that warm sort of golden
color there it is that you can even use
these as eyeshadows if you do I would
definitely be careful because I think
that they would definitely be prone to
fall out you know when you're buffing it
into your skin as a highlight you're
really kind of like working it in there
but if you were to use these as
eyeshadows I think you would have to go
in with a fluffy brush and pick up any
sort of excess that fell down so there
is moon gleam and there is star dust and
then the last one that we have is a
unicorn luster I really love this shade
it's like this like I don't even know
like topi rose gold color awesome so
there are the three of them and they're
just beautiful they're so metallic
they're not chunky at all I think
they're absolutely stunning they stay
completely consistent no matter how you
turn your hand or what
ever the actual color doesn't change
they're not like a duochrome but they're
just beautiful they're absolutely
stunning and I still have so much
product left on my fingers so really
really highly recommend checking out
this little trio this palette really
amazing I love it as long as you know
how to use it and you really kind of
buff it into the skin I think you would
absolutely really really adore this and
yeah I feel like it really would work
for every single skin type too like I
said as long as you buff it in you
shouldn't have any issues if you are
really really dry just make sure you
really just just buff it in the story
the message of the story is buff it in
all right guys I hope you enjoyed it
this review thank you so much for
joining me I'll see you guys in my next
one this week it was driving me crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
