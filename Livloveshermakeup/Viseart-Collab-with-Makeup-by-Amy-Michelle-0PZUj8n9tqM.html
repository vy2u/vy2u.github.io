thank you so much for joining me well
yes thank you so much for joining me I
hope you're all having an absolutely
fantastic day I'm so excited for today's
video this is going to be a collab with
one of my close friends makeup IME
Michelle or also I know her as Amy here
on YouTube we have to come very very
close we discovered that we look very
very close to each other we're probably
going to be getting together in the
future sometime soon and also we just
have a lot in common
Amy is a very very motivated and I just
love her personality like I just can't
get enough of it and we of course love
to talk about makeup and I'm going to
like all of her like everything you need
to know about Amy will be in the downbar
in the description bar I'm going to link
her collab video the collab video that
we clapped on before this video which
was a couple of months ago maybe even
three or four months ago was it four
months ago no I think it was about three
months ago we climbed on our favorite
makeup brushes so I will link that video
below I'm gonna link her channel down
below and also her Instagram please go
check her out I really really encourage
you guys to do so I think she's
absolutely amazing I love her
personality and I just love how
motivated she is she is so into this
YouTube thing and I think that is so so
so cool and it's really really fun to
see someone who puts so much effort and
energy into editing and putting together
videos and I really really just respect
the hell out of her so please go over
and check out her channel tell her and
yeah let's just get into this collab
this collab is going to be all about
Levi's our pallets between Amy and I we
own two of these she has the one in zero
for dark Matt and I have the one in zero
7 cool mattes and we were talking about
this and we kind of have interesting
opinions on these pallets they are not
what everybody else thinks up these
pallets I will just put it out there
right away we are not absolutely in love
with these pellets um I know for a fact
I think that Amy dislikes hers a little
more than I just like mine I think that
she actually may want to return her as
she did get hers when there was like the
vib sale going on so she bought hers for
around $65 if you guys are not aware of
how much these pallets are these are $80
eyeshadow palettes on the support comm
website $80 so
I purchased my full price and I'm not
going to return mine I do like mine I am
wearing these shadows on my eyes today
which by the way this video is going to
be a review and swatches so if you would
like a demo on the look that I am
wearing today or a tutorial let me know
in the downbar and I could get that up
for you guys in the next couple of days
I know that ami is also posting a demo
but hers won't be up for I think a day
or two as well so if you guys do like
the eye lift that I'm wearing let me
know so that I can film a tutorial for
you guys but anyway like I said this
video is going to be more about swatches
and just a review in general because we
have both had subscribers on both of our
channels that have reached out and been
like he tell us a little bit about those
visor palettes that you own are they
good are they worth the money and we are
here to basically tell you guys a little
bit about what they're like and kind of
why they're difficult to use now a
little background right away ami is
definitely a lot more educated and
knowledgeable when it comes to putting
makeup on and I am I just want to put
that out there right away she definitely
could be a makeup artist she could do
all that kind of stuff I am NOT I am one
of those people that just plays around
at home with makeup and I think that was
kind of my mistake when purchasing this
palette I'm gonna read a little bit
about what it says on these two 4.com
lips they really quickly so you guys can
kind of get a better understanding of
what I mean by that this is supposed to
be a professional eye shadow palette
that can be used for shading
highlighting defining eyes brows and the
contours of the face it says get
professional quality eye looks with
these versatile 12 shaped palettes
visoreds coveted best-selling palettes
are reliable film tested professional
products a staple in every makeup artist
kit so just reading a little bit of that
I think that what you have to understand
before going in and purchasing one of
these very very expensive palettes is
that these are professional quality
people who are buying these are usually
already makeup artists they already know
how to do eye looks they already know
how to do other people's makeup stuff
like that which I personally like I suck
at doing other people's makeup I have
attempted it before No my god no
never again whereas I think Amy is good
at doing other people's makeup and she's
really great at doing makeup on herself
but I still struggle you know if there
is a palette that is hard to work with
I'm going to get you look that's not so
cute do you guys know what I mean I hope
you are understanding what I'm saying so
what I'm thinking is that these visor
palettes have become very very popular
amongst youtubers like Jacqueline Hale
who we have to remember is also a makeup
artist the reason she probably loves
this palette is because she is a makeup
artist and she knows how to use it she's
using the right brushes the right
techniques whereas I don't know like
Emily Noelle 83 she's pretty much like a
makeup artist in my eyes as well she
also speaks very very highly about these
eyes shadow pellets I have not heard a
lot of people say what I want to say
about these eyeshadow palettes so I'm
just gonna get right into it for $80 I
will be keeping this palette like I said
I think the colors are absolutely
beautiful everything is completely Mac
you do get a lot of product in here I
love that there are some darker blue
some dark purples I think it's a
gorgeous gorgeous palette they do have
different finishes on the palettes you
can get the matte ones or they do have a
few that have like a shimmery finish I
don't know if those are any different if
you guys know and you have one of those
palettes let us know in the downbar
below because Evie and I are both
curious we're like are the ones that
have like shimmer in them are they
buttery are they like you know are do do
they feel different then in that one so
if you have tried one of those ones let
us know in the downbar below because or
in the downbar in the comments below
because we really don't know we've only
tried the matte ones and this is how we
feel about them this is how I feel about
mine so the first thing I want to say is
that I think they are beautiful colors
they are extremely pigmented they are
beautiful like I said I have it on my
eyes today I am wearing this shade right
here this kind of plummy a shade in my
crease I have this pink one on my lid I
have this in my outer B and then I use
that as my transition color and this
my brow bone so really only about four
shades that I used for this whole look
today and I think it's beautiful don't
get me wrong one thing that I have
noticed is that anytime I'm using really
really dense brushes with this palette
my god I cannot blend these out to save
my flippin life okay they are so hard to
blend and I am one of those people I
really really quickly put my makeup on
and I want to be done blending and all
that kind of stuff in no more than ten
minutes I'm sorry I'm not a makeup
artist I don't want to have to sit there
for twenty five minutes and blend and
blend and blend I want to be done I'm a
real person or you know what I mean I
mean we're all real people but you know
what I mean I'm just like I don't have
the time of day for this I don't want to
have to sit there and blend for 15-20
minutes so it's one of those things
where it's like I'm almost not
understanding how they're so hard to
blend because they are so pigmented
they're beautiful like don't get me
wrong look at that do you see that
completely opaque absolutely stunning
really really beautiful very very
buttery and when I put it on my hands
I'm not getting a lot of kick up I'm not
getting you know tons and tons of
Fallout when I put it on my eyes I'm
just getting really really gorgeous
color that on your hand blends out like
a dream like you guys can see that just
blended out beautifully on my hand
however when it's on your eyes unless
you are using a really really fluffy
brush this does not blend out okay it's
very very difficult so if I do end up
doing a demo on it you guys will see I'm
using kind of fluffier brushes
not super super densely packed like
brushes that have densely packed hair so
if that makes sense because when I take
a little bit of this product I put it on
a densely packed brush and I put it on
my eye it's like boom there it is
you're not gonna blend that out
it's like tattooed on your eye so that
is my first complaint is that these are
not very easy to blend when they're on
your eyes I mean don't know if that's
because I already I've only tried these
with eye primer because they plunge like
a dream on my hand and that just kind of
bothers me like I said the pigmentation
is absolutely incredible completely
opaque with one little swatch of your
finger you guys can see this kind of
already stained my finger as well I mean
absolutely beautiful beautiful
formulation
when it comes to being opaque and having
a great like like opacity to it if that
makes sense they're just very very
opaque and they're what you would want
in a nice shadow now the second thing
that I want to talk about is the fact
that everybody seems to say oh god these
are so buttery and I just love putting
my finger in there I feel so good you
know these are so great I don't see it I
don't see it I don't feel it these feel
rough to me they feel rough and they
don't like I said you have to think
about it this way yes they are very very
pigmented and they're going to come out
very very pigmented on the eyes but I
mean I just don't like when I'm watching
people and they're saying these are so
smooth and creamy and buttery because
they're not in my opinion they feel
rough they feel rough they just feel
some feel more rough than others like
this one right here feels very very
rough this blue color and I mean hello
look at that beautiful pigmentation but
it just feels like a little bit like
there's like a sandpaper overlay whereas
this one down here feels really soft and
creamy and buttery so it's like a hit
and miss as far as the texture goes in
the palette as far as this one is
concerned it's just kind of a hit miss
like I will be touching them and I'm
like oh that feels so great and then
this look like whoa that feels really
crispy and weird and sandpapery and I
don't like that so that would be my
second complaint is just the fact that
they aren't super creamy and buttery
like a lot of people are saying like
they're like oh yeah it just feels like
butter I'm like only a few of them do
and it's usually these little lighter
shades down here this one feels crispy
this one feels nice this one feels nice
and this one feels kind of nice the rest
of them they all feel just rough they
have a rough texture so overall I think
that this palette is not for beginners I
don't think that it's good for all of
these people to be talking about oh boy
and kept this $80 palette when you know
we all have a lot of like younger people
like that are in high school girls like
that that are watching our channels and
you know going out and saying go buy
this
$80 palette it's so buttery and creamy
and easy to use I just don't feel like
that's the right thing to do because I
think that these are difficult to you is
I feel like maybe they're a little more
easy for people who have a little more
experience like I feel
amy has more experience of makeup than I
do I think hers is easier for her to use
she probably has created a absolutely
gorgeous look with hers but I had a hard
time even putting together the look that
I'm wearing on my eyes today so I don't
need to go on a huge tangent and rant
about this but I'm just saying in
general I don't think that this is the
easiest palette to work with and if you
are a beginner in makeup even if you're
not a beginner even if you're just
someone like me who likes to play around
with makeup but you find it easier to
play around with palettes that are
really buttery really really blendable
this is not going to be the right kind
of palette for you in my opinion I think
that what we have to remember is exactly
what it said on the Sephora website
these are professional eyeshadow
palettes
they have a reliable film tested
professional you know whatever they the
formulation is meant for you know it's
meant for Hollywood makeup artists they
even say that right here it's meant for
Hollywood makeup artists it's their
secret weapon you know these are
absolutely beautiful beautiful palettes
they're great to look at they're super
pigmented but if you don't know how to
use them I think that they are quite
difficult and I find this to be a
difficult palette to use is it beautiful
do I like the look that I created yes I
do like it but it's just one of those
palettes that I know if I'm reaching for
this I need at least an extra 30 minutes
to put together an eye look in the
morning so that's what I am going to say
about it I think it is a little
difficult um it's not it's not my
favorite palette I was a little
surprised when I first got it just
because you hear all of these big
youtubers talking about it like
Jacqueline Hale even Emily Noel 83 I
absolutely love her I trust her opinion
like crazy she really loves these as
well but then again I think that she's
just she's basically a makeup artist you
know she knows how to work with these
and I think that they are just a little
more difficult than other people let on
if that makes sense so overall I do like
the palette I just think it's hard to
work with it's a little difficult I
think amy has the same kind of issues
with hers as well definitely go check
out her channel because she has a
completely different palette than I do
hers is the dark matte which is also
really really nice it's got some dark
like
like reddish shades in it and some
beautiful like Burgundy's and things
like that and yeah I mean I think it's
just it's not what it seems you know
what I mean you watch these YouTube
videos something like oh my god that
looks amazing but I don't know it's not
what it seems with these palettes so
anyway let's just go ahead and start so
watching this baby is shall we
I'm just going to swatch the first row
they do not have names so this is what
they look like and Yun's
hopefully you guys can see that those
are that is the top row and then let's
go into the second row here is the
second row very very beautiful very
opaque gorgeous like there's me I can't
not say that you know it's just I don't
know these are hard to work with so
there is the second row I will say I
love the way that they put these pallets
together I think it was really really
genius like the dark mask palette I've
never seen anything like that and also I
tried to reach for because these were so
expensive I tried to go ahead and grab
the palette that I felt like I have
nothing in my collection like this and
this one definitely fits that situation
I don't feel like I have any palette
that is completely mad and has only cool
tones so beautiful beautiful color
selection and then those are the last
four and please remember I am NOT
swatching these with primer right now
they aren't just going on all by
themselves so absolutely beautiful very
very pigmented I think just in the long
run there they're difficult to work with
if you are a beginner in makeup you're
not gonna like this palette you're
probably gonna end up returning it if
you are like me and you like to just get
your makeup on in the morning pretty
quickly and you'd like to have a nice
blended look but not something that you
have to sit there for 25 minutes yes you
know within the morning I don't think
you're gonna like this either if you're
a professional and you work with people
that are like on camera or things like
that then I think you're gonna love it
so overall those are kind of my thoughts
on this particular palette this is the
visoreds professional preview palette in
0-7 cool Matt's definitely go check out
Amy's channel for her review on the zero
for a dark matte palette and of course
like I said tell her I say hello
definitely check out her channel
let me know what you think of her I love
her and yeah thanks so much for joining
me guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
