my channel today I am sharing with you
guys my review swatches in comparison on
the new of a Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting palette I did purchases for
$14.99 on the Wet n Wild calm website it
will be available sometime at Ulta or at
least that's what they're saying at some
point online and in stores but I don't
have any definitive dates for you guys
just yet and this is a collection of
their fan favorite mecha glow
highlighting powders in four new vegan a
limited edition shades these are infused
with shimmering pearl pigments these
highlighting powders give a glistening
glow when applied to the cheekbones brow
bones as well as cupid bow now you guys
know I own all of the permanent shades
in full size and those usually retail
for about $4.99 $5.99 a piece on the
ulta.com website so the fact that you're
getting four of them in here for $14.99
this is a great value set let's go ahead
and start with the packaging not a huge
fan of the packaging but again i feel
like this is wet and wild they're doing
the best they can and they are trying to
keep those prices low but I will say I
feel like this is quite flimsy the
cardboard is very kind of similar to the
Anastacio Beverly Hills glow kids but
about half the half the you know what I
need like half the thickness so you're
not gonna get a mirror in here and it
really does feel quite flimsy like you
could just break in half like if I went
like this really hard I feel like I
could actually break this pallet and the
actual insert here that does hold all
four pans of a highlighter is just a
piece of plastic but again because it is
a drugstore brand and because wet and
well does the best that they can and
tries to keep their prices low I am NOT
going to complain about that too much so
anyway let's go ahead and talk about the
formula the formula in here is pretty
darn good I'm gonna give this a solid 3
out of 5 star rating again because of
the packaging I'm not the biggest fan
I'm gonna take off half a star for that
and then also just the formula in
general is not identical to these
full-size highlighters I'm a huge fan of
the full-size highlighters because I
love that Baek shall a high shine impact
that these low price the drugstore
highlighters can give to my skin I love
it they have a nice color selection and
I really like what they did with this
palette as far as color selection is
concerned if you guys didn't know a very
in trend right now is a colorful
highlight so the fact that they put in a
blue as well as a green highlight is
very very cool but I
you have to say I think that these are
just a little more glitter infused than
the other permanent highlights that they
do have in their collection now the
shades that you are getting in here are
sweet peeny as well as diamonds Lily
wild cosmos and blushing Azalea blushing
Azalea is this kind of neutral nude pink
color down here and this is definitely
the worst out of the bunch I would say
that this one just lacks pigmentation
there's definitely a lot of grit there I
don't really feel like I can get into
the product once it transfers to the
skin it does look a little better but
this one is definitely definitely
glitter infused at first I thought maybe
it was just an over spray and I kind of
felt that way with all of them and I
think three out of the four of them kind
of do have a glitter overspray and once
you start to really work into the
products you can get the glitter out of
there but this guy right here is just
straight-up glitter infusion so if you
do not like glittery highlights you guys
you are not going to be a fan of this
blushing Azalea shade down here but
overall color selection wise I feel like
they hit up a lot of different shades
here and I think it's really cool I love
the blue I love the green they are quite
wearable they don't go on insanely
insanely pigmented but obviously when
you hit the light a certain way you can
see like oh hey you look like a unicorn
she's got a blue or purple highlight
okay she's got a green highlight on so
very very cool things going on with
those palettes and then the blushing
Azalea shade as well as this pinky kind
of shimmery um almost silvery color
which is called sweet peony up here this
is the one I have on today and this one
is definitely very beautiful and I think
it will be very flattering for a lot of
different skin tones so I think they did
a good job with their first highlighting
palettes as far as that is concerned I
would love to see them work maybe just a
little bit on packaging even if they
just up the price by one or two dollars
I would be okay with that a lot of
people are gonna say no Liv don't be
saying that we're not okay with that but
for me I would love a mirror in here I
would love something just a little more
sturdy so that I know when I put this
 in my actual luggage and travel
with it it's not just gonna break right
in half alright guys let me talk about
my favorite brushes to use when it comes
to this formula because I get asked all
the time I like to go in with something
that's a little more densely packed so
the first one I want to recommend is
actually from wet and wild and this is
their unicorn a brush and although this
might look like it's a very black and
kind of flimsy brush it isn't it's quite
dead sleep
and I just love the way that this picks
up that sort of big Chalet highlight
which is a little more firmly press
about it very very blinding when you get
it on to the skin so what I like to do
is kind of take the side of the brush
and I really kind of go in there I will
tap off the excess because these are
just a little more powdery and then I
just kind of a dusted on two of my skin
like this at an angle so I think this is
a fantastic the little unicorn brush
which is about 30 99 or $4.99 I think
this is a really fantastic brush another
step up is the alpha blending brush this
is a great alternative to a fan brush if
you're working with the bakelite
highlighter and this is definitely very
very densely packed and a lot of people
use this to contour or chisel out their
cheekbones I don't do that on a daily
basis so what I like to do is take this
guy I will go into the highlight again I
will tap off the excess and again I just
take it at an angle and I will go ahead
and I will blend that on two of my skin
and I think it looks absolutely
beautiful this is what I use to apply my
highlight today I feel like I am just
 the beacon of light for the
astronauts okay so I'm really happy with
that I really do enjoy this brunch and
then I also wanted to go ahead and
recommend anything that's kind of domed
shaped but still pretty densely packed
as you see it I need to clean
these brushes there's a little powder
flying everywhere but this is from the
nuit Arts treasure tools a brush set
anything that's like a little dome but
has quite a nice amount of bristles to
it is great for a pine these sort of
highlights now I know a lot of people
ask me why don't I use my Lexi 522
tapered highlighter when it comes to
bake Chalet highlighters and this is
just a little too flimsy I prefer this
for like my Becca or really really true
powdery highlights but when it comes to
something that's a little more firmly
pressed and very very like buildable and
blinding on the skin I prefer to go with
this guy right here now because there is
a little bit of glitter infused in one
of these if you really want to wear that
blushing Azalea sort of shade what do
you do well you could go in with any one
of these brushes right here and then
what I would recommend is going in with
something a little fluffier and this is
another Tarte brush or if you want a
cheaper alternative this isn't up and up
the lower brush brush with no it's not
and then
then open up brush from a target and
this is just a powder or bronzer brush
and you can actually go in and you can
put this highlight onto your skin and
kind of the same thing that I would do
with like my Anasazi of Beverly Hills
Nicole Guerrero goloka do you put it on
it's very blinding but then you can see
flecks of glitter go in with a very
fluffy brush and just kind of wipe it
off and it will completely go away so
anyway that's pretty much my thoughts I
don't have too much to say here let's go
ahead and do some side-by-side
comparison squatches like I said I would
give this a solid 3 out of 5 stars i
think the formula is great I do feel
like these wear a nice time throughout
the day I just wish that this shade
right here wasn't so glitter and fused
but once you work into these three right
here you will be able to get in there
and just know that the glitter that you
see especially when you put it in direct
light is just an overspray which shame
on you wet and wild you're better than
overspray okay but anyway let's go ahead
and get into the swatches alright guys
got two zoomed in a little closer let's
go ahead and starts watching we are
going to start with the lightest shade
in the palette which is called sweet
peony this is the highlight that I have
on today I'm gonna go ahead and do a
swatch of that and then I'm going to
compare it to other wet and wild and
mega glow highlighters so here is the
swatch of sweet peeny I'm gonna build it
up just a little bit because I feel like
the studio lights in here it definitely
can make these look a little reflective
and almost like white on my skin so
there is the shade sweet peony and the
ones that I wanted to go ahead and
swatch that next two are the two from
the permanent collection which are
called a blossom glow as well as this
one right here which is called botanic
dream so a blossom glows like a light
baby pink and then botanic dream has a
little more a deeper kind of pinky hues
to it and you guys will be able to see
when i swatched these and next to each
other I just kind of feel like in
general I should probably go ahead and
blow off the excess from the
highlighting palette but sweet peony
from the highlighting palette definitely
has a little more glitter and a little
more chunkiness to it so if there is the
sweet peony shade and then right
underneath that we have a blossom glow
and now let's go ahead and swatch a
botanic dream and this one definitely
has a little bit deeper of a pinky kind
of color to it and again in the
full-size highlighters from wet and wild
I don't personally notice any sort of
glitter so that's definitely a new thing
that is going on with the palette but
yeah there they are so pretty darn
similar to that second second shade
which is called blossom glow if you
already have blossom glow maybe you
don't need this highlighting palette
alright guys up next in the palette we
have the shade of Diamonds lily which is
kind of like a bluish purple e color and
the only wet-and-wild highlight that I
feel like from the permanent collection
is similar to this one is this one right
here which is called a royal calyx so
let's go ahead and swatch those
side-by-side and the first one is from
the highlighting palette again this is
diamonds Lily it's kind of like a baby
blue sort of color it's a very pretty
one so this is what diamonds Lily looks
like and then we'll go ahead and swatch
that next to royal calyx and royal calyx
I feel like purple highlighters in
general and blue highlighters tend to
just have a little more chunkiness
to them but I do feel like the blue in
the highlighting palette is smoother
than the singles so at the top but we
have the highlighting palette and then
at the bottom we have the permanent
alright guys next up but we want to go
ahead and swatch out wild cosmos which
is the green shade in the highlighting
palette and this is the same identical
color to the midnight mermaid collection
highlighting bars so if you do have this
one you probably don't need the
highlighting palettes they are basically
the same exact thing so let me go ahead
and swatch this one out from the palette
it's kind of like a greenish gold color
with a little bit of a silver grayish
shift to it and then as far as the
midnight mermaid bar is concerned which
is the beautiful highlight too and this
is basically just the same exact shade
so if you already have this one do you
need the highlighting palette maybe you
don't but if you love this color and you
weren't able to find in the midnight
mermaid one maybe you do want to go
ahead and pick this up so at the top we
have wild cosmos and then under here we
have the wet and wild a Midnight mermaid
bar it's called a highlighting bar
alright guys and finally the last shade
in the palette is my least favorite this
one right here is called blushing Azalea
I just really don't like this and I
don't feel like any of the full-size or
permanent highlighters really have a
shade like this it's kind of like a
muted peach color but let's go ahead and
swatch it out
it definitely is very firma to the touch
and it really doesn't swatch very well
do you guys see that it's just nothing
spectacular but that's okay go ahead and
swatch that next to the permanent
precious petals because I feel like
that's sort of in the same category this
one's definitely more of like a rose
gold so there is the wildest Aelia and
then here is a precious petals and then
finally I thought we would also swatch
it next to golden a flower crown and I'm
just doing one swipe swatches here for
you guys and golden flower crown is
definitely a lot more gold and the one
at the top as you guys can see it's just
kind of like a pasty purpley not purpley
pasty peachy kind of nudish color it's
nothing too pretty on the skin in my
opinion actually kind of makes my skin
look very mundane and I don't like that
has glitter infused into it so anyway
guys those are all these two watches and
some comparisons against other
wet-and-wild highlighters like I said I
would definitely give this a strong 3
out of 5 star rating you might be
thinking that's not a good rating but
keep in mind I did put all of the new on
a stop seeing a Beverly Hills Holiday
Collection I put that into a three star
rating so it's not that it's bad it's
actually pretty good it's just not my
all-time favorite kind of palette that
has come out for the holiday season or
for fall 2017 releases so I hope you
enjoyed this review and swatches thank
you so much for joining me guys and I'll
see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
