channel I apologize that the lighting is
a little off today we have some really
big storm clouds here in Arizona which
we don't see very often so I do
apologize that the lighting is off but
today I am finally doing part two in my
collaboration with Angelica the other
day we collaborated and we talked a
little bit about what we would like to
see beauty brands released in 2018 and
today I'm gonna tell you what I do not
want to see beauty brands released in
2018 now before we do get into that I
just wanted to let you guys know I have
not been feeling good mentally or
physically this week I have some health
stuff that I am currently dealing with
and I know that a lot of people have
been asking why I haven't been posting
as much on my channel I just really
haven't been as motivated to so I do
appreciate that all of you have been so
supportive or at least the majority of
you have been supportive I'm one of
those people were if I don't feel like
filming it's just not going to happen so
anyway without further ado like I said
let's go ahead and jump into the video
like I said this is a collaboration with
my friend Angelica I'm gonna leave all
her info down below in the description
bar or in the description box just as I
did before so you can find all her
social medias I think you guys would
absolutely love her I really really
enjoy her um but yeah let's go ahead and
jump right into it so the first thing
that I absolutely do not want to see
beauty brands release in 2018 is a huge
amount of limited edition of products
now this also just goes hand in hand
with a ton of releases all at once
I did talk about this in the last video
like I said I'll go ahead and link that
up in the cards the original up part one
collab but you know I'm so over
colour-pop releasing every single
 week I can't keep up I'm not
into it all of your products used to be
very very special like when they had a
new eyeshadow palette it was like oh my
god new eyeshadow palette from
colour-pop but now it's just overdone
and I'm really not even that drawn to
the brand right now and also when it
happens to be limited edition product
I'm not as drawn to that either it did a
video all about limited edition my ass
because we all know that a lot of these
brands claim to be limited edition or
they have a limited edition item in
their collection and guess what that
 item ends up coming back and
there are some good things some good
perks to having limited edition products
but the majority of them are not
good parts they're bad perks okay
they're cons so
for me I just would like to see a lot
less a limited edition products in
general I'm over it I know a lot of you
are over it as well all right number two
this second thing I do not want to see
any more of is warm tone eyeshadow
palettes now I know that recently I've
been kind of hauling and talking a lot
about Form tone eyeshadow palettes
that's because the Tarte toasted palette
 great okay and that's because
the dose of colors the new sassy siennas
palette I have it as well great
and there have been some really really
good warm tone eyeshadow palette
releases but I'm over it now I want to
see some cool tone stuff I want to see
some pastel kind of palettes not like
the lorac at brunch palette okay
that was a little too pastel for my
taste I want to see some beautiful
colorful palettes that are not
necessarily incredibly vibrant but still
will give you a nice a watercolor wash
of color all over the lids does that
make sense so I'm really over the warm
tone palette thing I know so many people
are into warm tone shadows I'm kind of
not I get a lot of compliments when I do
wear warm tone eyeshadows but for me I
just feel like there's so many good
palettes already like and brands need to
stop now it's okay you've already been
outdone they're already good enough warm
tone eye shadow palettes out there so
please stop okay alright moving
on to you at number three I'm gonna need
beauty brands to stop claiming that
they're cruelty-free when they're really
not I'm gonna need you to stop and
selling cruelty free and mink lashes and
claiming that they're cruelty free like
if I can sit there with a little mink in
your lap and you brush them and take it
out and put it on your goddamn eyes it's
not cruelty free it's not cool I'm gonna
need these brands to stop twisting the
words and pretending and be incredibly
sneaky about their cruelty free status
thinking oh my gosh yeah they're cruelty
free when they're actually not I'm
talking about L'Oreal I'm talking about
Mac the way that they write things down
on their website makes you think that
they're cruelty-free when they're
 not I'm done I'm gonna make a
whole goddamn video roasting you bitches
and I'm sorry but it needs to stop so
and that is the third thing I do not
want to see beauty brands do anymore if
you're cruelty free your cruelty
free if you're not bitch you're not
alright guys number four I'm kind of
done with the unicorn rainbows
theme saying okay this is the thing I'm
a big girl now 25 years old now I am not
18 anymore I still want the good
high-end makeup but I'm really really
over these super childish marketing
scheme
keep packaging I'm kind of done with it
and this is the thing you know I used to
be so into it and I'm still loved cutesy
things but I don't want it anymore in my
makeup I don't want it anymore in my
makeup like the Too Faced chocolate gold
palette that cuts it right at the level
where I want it like it's beautiful it's
kind of sleek but it still is kind of
cute and it smells like chocolate I'm
kind of over in the scented makeup in
general though and I'm really over the
cutesy Bootsy Bootsy kind of okay I
just don't want it anymore I know I know
it's definitely an age preference and
some people are like you know 80 years
old and want the foo-foo and the
rainbows and the bunnies and
guess what I still love cutesy stuff
like that but I just don't want it in my
makeup anymore I want some nice a
beautiful sleek packaging I like honest
hacia Beverly Hills sleep packaging
something that's really really good
something where you're not taking all
the money and you're inserting it into
your goddamn packaging instead of the
actual product I want it the other way
around and finally guys this is very
much personal preference which I feel
like this whole video is very
much personal preference so I want to
know what you don't want to see in 2018
for beauty brands but I'm done with
everything that I'm done with super
matte powders except for the essence all
about math fixing comeback cutter I'm
done with full coverage matte
foundations I'm done with liquid
lipsticks that are completely matte I'm
done with all the mats all of them
I got dry skin now and I look like
with a matte foundation on to be
completely honest I put it on I'm 25
years old and suddenly I look like I'm
38 years old there's just something
about it I can't get these matte
foundations to look good on my skin
again this is very much personal
preference but I feel like we've gone
through the bat trend we're done now
we're good we're good now so I
would love to see a beauty brand start
to release more medium coverage not
necessarily glossy or dewy foundations
but something that has a second satin
finish to it everybody is happy that way
people who have incredibly oily skin
will be happy with probably a satin
coverage and or a satin finish and you
know medium coverage and people who have
incredibly dry sad skin like me will
also be happy with satin finish and a
medium coverage I feel like I need to
see more of that right now it's either
that it's like sheer like a
water foundation that literally has no
coverage or it's incredibly matte and
full coverage it makes me look like I'm
85 years old so I'm
done with that okay thank you so anyway
guys those are the beauty of trends or
just the things in that beauty brands
are probably going to release in 2018
that I really wish they wouldn't I hope
you guys enjoyed this video like I said
this is very much personal preference
but I want to know your 5 down below
thanks again guys for joining me and I
will try to make it for a video tomorrow
like I said I haven't been feeling
incredibly motivated to be filming when
I'm not feeling great mentally and
physically but I'm gonna try my best so
hopefully I'll see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
