my channel Happy New Year today I am
sharing a collab video with you guys
with my friend Angelica now if you do
not know who Angelica is I think you
guys are really going to enjoy her
channel I will of course link her video
or possibly videos down below and now
Angelica actually posted her video
yesterday I was supposed to as well but
then we forgot that she's actually in
Sweden I am Pacific Standard Time here
in America we are about 7 to 8 hours
apart and we both have do work full-time
so we wanted to be able to post our
videos at a time where we're both not
sleeping and we're awake so that we can
answer comments so if you're wondering
why my video is a day later than hers
that is why we may also be posting
another collab video and that one will
go up tomorrow for me today for Angelica
but like I said I'm gonna go ahead and
leave all her channel information and
down below as well as her Instagram and
her snapchat and all that good stuff I
really really like her I recently found
her channel and one of the reasons why
I'm really into her is she is a review
based channel and she does a lot of
content that is very very similar to
mine but at the same time this girl's
 bomb and makeup you guys like
it's amazing some of the eye looks she
creates and things like that I think
it's really really cool to be able to
find someone who is just as good as like
review based kind of content as she is a
tutorial based content I feel like she's
definitely one-of-a-kind and I've really
been enjoying her so like I said I'm
gonna link her channel as well as her
video down below please go send her some
love I think you guys would really like
her but without further ado you guys
let's go ahead and jump into this video
all about what I would personally like
to see a beauty brands release in 2018
so the first thing that I would love to
see beauty brands released this year is
definitely definitely some cool toned
eyeshadow palettes and I'm not talking
about like some mochi toned eyeshadow
palettes like that kind of cool tone I'm
talking about like like pink palettes
like purple palettes I'm talking about
like blue palettes I know and this may
sound incredibly incredibly dated and
every time I wear blue eyeshadow people
are like why are you from the
seventies or some
listen I love blue eyeshadow I love
Pink's I love Purple's I love these
really really soft beautiful colors that
you can go ahead and really wear it like
a wham bam weigh on your eyes or you can
kind of wear them a little more
like diluted you know and just have like
a wash of color on your eyes I think
it's beautiful I also just love cool
tones in general so give me a good taupe
palette not like the top palette
from you know violet Bosworth like all
topes give me something that's a little
different that has Purple's mixed in
there some blues that has some
periwinkle some Purple's some pinks I'm
loving it I'm feeling it that's the
first thing I want to see up next I have
you you're a very specific thing I would
like to see it I don't care who the
comes out with it but I wanted I want to
see a mascara wand that is half natural
bristles half rubber bristles it could
even just be a natural bristle wand with
the little ball thing at the top that's
rubber bristle but I want to see a
mixture because I am one of those people
that really likes the combination of
using a natural bristle one mascara with
a rubber bristle one that's usually how
I get really really big clumpy
voluminous lashes like I personally
enjoy it I want to see a two-in-one why
has nobody released this yet or you have
the whole entire wand that is like
natural bristle and then at the top you
like the little rubber ball or something
like that I think that'd be so
cool or even intertwining the two of
them if that's possible I want to see it
happen so that's number two okay guys
the third thing that I would like to see
beauty brands attempt this year is more
sister palettes with identical formulas
so you know how the modern renaissance
palette the subculture was supposed to
be the sister palette well I'm going to
be doing a whole video dedicated to like
true sister palettes I'm talking to like
tartlet in bloom tartlet toasted
palettes palettes that really really
have a nice comparison to them that have
similar formulas I would love if a Tarte
came out with you know you have the in
bloom the toasted and then maybe like a
smoky palette so Tarte smoked palette or
something like that I think that would
be a really really nice a little add-on
to their little collection right there
or their little sister palettes right
there for me personally I would love to
see a true sister palette for the modern
renaissance I feel like modern
renaissance subculture not really
release sister palettes to me at the
Anastacio Beverly Hills person palette
which is filled with a lot of different
kind of glittery and shimmery shades or
finishes that one is more sister palette
e to these subculture a rather event
subculture and modern renaissance so I
would love to see a true Modern
Renaissance sister palette maybe
something with all shimmers that's all
warm tone because those all super super
shimmery palettes are
in right now I'm at first I wasn't in
love with that trend because I'm like oh
 you know I need a transition I need
a you know a crease color I need some
more stuff than just all shimmer
palettes but recently I've been loving
my Urban Decay heavy metals palette I've
been loving the Too Faced chocolate gold
palette so I'm kind of on board with
that trend I would like for that one to
kind of slow down a little bit I don't
want to see every single brand releasing
all shimmer palettes but who else wants
to see a true sister palette to the
modern renaissance I'm talking to you
Anasazi of Beverly Hills all right guys
the fourth thing I want to see for
beauty brands this year is true
collaborations with more review based
channels now I know that it's very
popular to do collaborations with huge
youtubers obviously because they're
gonna make it the most money and
obviously these tutorial based channels
are incredible with their makeup
but I really feel like there's a lack of
enthusiasm there and there is a lack of
diligence
when it comes to actually nailing down
these formulas I would love to see it
with Stephanie Nicole collaborate with a
brand you know I would love to see
someone who really really puts a lot of
emphasis into how a product works versus
how to get it on your eyes and how to
create a pretty look I would like to see
some good collapse come out this
year so that was the fourth bang and
finally guys the last thing that I would
like to see a beauty brands release in
2018 are products as well as collections
that they know they are good at I'm
talking about tarts rainforest of the
seed collection why not expand on that
I'm talking about you know a BH modern
renaissance kind of like when we were
talking about the sister palettes I'm so
 sick I've seen all these brands
are running around releasing new
products out the ass trying new products
out the ass hey we're gonna do this now
hey we're gonna do this now hey we're
gonna do this now color pop I'm so sick
of it if you're good at something you
should a showcase that you
should continually work on that formula
try and vamp it up without overdoing it
and without redoing it you know if
something is really really doing well
why fix it if it ain't broke
honey do not fix it so I would love to
see it like I said the modern
renaissance in a different a sort of
assortment of colors but same exact
formula I would love to see heart expand
under rainforest of the sea line and
know that that line is getting a little
crowded but it's such a good line I mean
practically love everything in the Tarte
rainforest of the sea line I would love
to see you know what brands are really
really known for and what they're really
good at I would love to see them expand
on the products that they already know
like the back of their hand now of
course some people are gonna disagree
with this and say well hey you know we
want to see new stuff but I'm actually
sick of see new stuff I feel like every
time I turn my head there's a new
 product releasing a new formula
releasing and I'm kind of over it I want
to see the good I want to see what
you got I want to see what else you can
come up with as far as colors are
concerned you know Beca talking about
the shimmering skin perfectors let's
come up with some new colors let's
release some more of those great split
pans let's do some more face palettes
that are not going to be limited-edition
they're going to be products that are
permanent to the collection they're good
quality you already know what you're
gonna get that's the kind of stuff and
that now is exciting be in 2018 so that
is it for this video you guys I hope you
enjoyed this collab with my friend
