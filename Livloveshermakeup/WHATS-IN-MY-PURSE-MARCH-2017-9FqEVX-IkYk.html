channel I'm really sorry if the lighting
is off in this particular video I am
filming this as the Sun is rising it is
very early in the morning but I am here
to share with you guys a what's in my
bag video this is my current purse that
I have been using I got it from JustFab
calm probably about a year ago by the
way not affiliated or sponsored by them
in any way shape or form I literally buy
a purse for them every single month and
the reason why I do that is because I'm
on their purse absque ripshit now I will
be cancelling my purse subscription not
because of them but just because I am
switching over to cruelty free
subscription boxes I'm going to make a
video for you guys soon describing or
talking about describing talking about
which subscriptions I cancelled and
which ones I will be starting but yeah I
thought it'd be fun to share with you
guys what is in my bag I do like to film
these videos once a year so yeah this is
for March 2017 like I said I recently
switched out my purse so it's relatively
like nice in here right now normally it
looks like a bomb exploded in my purse I
have one unravel tampons everywhere and
just like food everywhere it's
disgusting I'm a disgusting person but
this one looks nice and clean so anyway
let's go ahead and jump right into it
the first item I have here is this
little pouch this is an Ipsy pouch and I
just have a bunch of these and I carry
random things so here I have a little
hairbrush this is from forever 21 I also
have a little band-aid of friction stick
block so I like to have this when I am
going to a concert after I work so if I
do have a gig or something and I need to
put heels on I like to put this on the
back of my feet I also have let's see
here what is this a tide to go stick
just in case I have a stain on my shirt
or my pants or something
this little rollerball which is crushed
by Brianna it smells really really good
and then I do have some potpourri in
here which looks like this you spray it
onto the water of the toilet bowl before
you go and no one else will ever know
and then I also do have the fresh
sparkling snow antibacterial hand gel so
those are just kind of some random
things I carry around in that little
Etsy pouch and then I of course have a
makeup pouch and I do switch this out
probably about once a month I would say
yeah I would say about once a month so
in here currently I have a little
eyeshadow palette this is the Tarte what
is it double duty Beauty young wild and
free eyeshadow palette it says throw
kindness around like confetti this just
has a bunch of neutral colors in it so
if you want to play up more dramatic
eyes you
I can with this darker shade or if you
just want a neutral eye look you can use
this I also do always have a full
coverage foundation that I carry around
because if I am going from work to a
show and I hadn't planned on going home
I always wear a full coverage foundation
onstage though this is the Rimmel stay
matte liquid mousse foundation in
zero-one-zero porcelain very very
similar to the Tarte Amazonian clay full
coverage foundation then I do have a
little sweet peach glow kit right here
now I'm not in love with this but it is
very very compact and you do get a
highlight a blush or a blush topper and
a bronzer in here so it is quite nice to
be carrying around just in case like I
said I have a gig last minute that I
didn't know about and then I always
carry a little primer this is the Bobbie
Brown what is this vitamin enriched face
face just a little mini as you guys can
see and then of course also a mini
mascara this is the NARS audacious and
then I always carry a little eyeliner
this is literally on like its last use
it is the Sephora black eyeliner pencil
so that is what is in that little pouch
I always carry a banana with me if you
are a performer you should always have a
banana just in case you do get a little
jittery before going on stage bananas
have natural beta blockers in them which
help to kind of like soothe and help
with physical symptoms of anxiety you
might get so I do like that and then I
always have a water bottle with me I
like this one right here I think it's
from the brand Zulu yeah Zulu so it's
like a glass water bottle and then it
has like this little rubber thing on it
I try and drink like 2 or 3 liters of
water a day so I have that I have my
sunglasses in here I also have my wallet
which I got at Charlotte Russe probably
about hmm I feel like this was like 2
years ago I really like it I'm like I
said I don't spend a lot of money on
horses did I mention that like I would
never spend like a thousand or two
thousand or three thousand four thousand
dollars on a purse right now in my life
I'm just because I spend big money on
like instrument or like a music kind of
related things yes I spend money a lot
of money on it makeup but I spent a lot
more money when it comes to like music
related things so I would rather buy
like a new recorder for myself or a new
flute headjoint phone or super super
expensive bag alright another little
itse pouch here this is the one that
kind of has more like food-related items
in it I think yeah so here I have little
packets of the emergency this is a
thousand milligrams of vitamin C these
are the raspberry flavored ones you guys
know I have a shitty immune system so I
do like to have those
case I feel like I'm getting sick and
then I always carry one of my favorite
candies with me these helped to get my
salivary glands going which again sounds
disgusting I'm disgusting
these are Jolly Ranchers I love Jolly
Ranchers I also love Mike and Ikes and I
like to suck on these before I go on
stage just to get my mouth all wet I
know it sounds weird and then I also do
carry this little on hello a mouth spray
right here which also tastes really
really good
alright moving on I do have my little
period pouch here this is like a little
ah it's not so funny a little period
pouch this is what I carry all my little
pads and like tampons in this is one of
the Sephora play bags and there have
been multiple times this year where
young girls have come to me and they had
their first period at school for the
first time so I do like to also just
carry cute little pads in here so they
can feel a little better and I could
give them what if they need it but I
prefer tampons and then I have a huge
mega pad in here because um you know
we've all had one of those days so that
is my little period pouch I have a
random little what is this oh the laura
mercier limpid tea souffle tactile seat
on this is just a little body butter
wasn't really impressed with this little
set right here I got them from uh
Sephora but yeah I have one of those I
also have my Clarins instant likes lip
comfort oil in the shade zero two
raspberry I do love this let's see here
down here I have a sharpie I have all of
my agendas here so let me show you guys
let me know if you want a video on like
my planners and stuff like that but this
one is for at home kind of stuff and
then I have one of the lily Pulitzers
for youtube and then one of them for
work so I do like having my agendas I am
agenda kind of person and I usually
write in my agendas with jelly rolls I
love jelly rolls if you're a 90s child
you would understand but here is just a
little green one and then here I have my
pill pouch if you guys didn't know I
have lupus and I also do have ADHD so I
always have to have my pills with me I
don't think I need anything in there
right now and then finally I have my
keys in my purse I have my little
hufflepuffs badge because that is
apparently the house that I would be in
if I was in a hogwarts house I don't
know I kind of feel like it's like the
right match but at the same time I feel
like I'm kind of a little more
aggressive than a Hufflepuff but that's
okay and then finally I do have some
music in here I always just carry a
little bit of sheet music this is the
CPE Bach's sonatas and a minor for flute
solo and then
so have the boom on milk or up you know
me scent though so anybody have some
music in there so that is everything
that is in my purse please let me know
down below what you currently have in
your purse I am a very nosy person so I
enjoy hearing what you guys have in
yours and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed

me and I will see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
