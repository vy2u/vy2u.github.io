my channel I'm looking the viewfinder
right now and I look super yellow I
don't know why I don't know what's going
on here it's my camera but anyway
today's video as you can tell from the
title is going to be a what's new at the
drugstore video I'm very excited I did
place three large orders on the ultra
calm website so I am here to give you
guys a haul first impressions and ask
those final thoughts on some of these
items if I look a little Haggard right
now it is because I'm filming this when
I get home from work if you've been
watching me for a while you know I like
to film in the morning before I go to
work but uh today I could not do that so
yeah that is why I'm looking a little a
little to shovel but anyway let's go
ahead and jump right into it shall we
the first couple items I have here are
just samples we have the honest Beauty
everything primer as well as The Hobbit
dry oil
we also have let's see here the Hobbit
time to smooth each control brightening
anti fatigue eye cream as well as the it
cosmetics
what is this vibe I pour a sample and
also the quenching coconut curls shampoo
and conditioner from OGX
and then I also got this little guy here
from taking in a code for something that
I bought from covergirl it's basically
just a bright purple little bag and you
have a let's see here covergirl eyeliner
in here in the shade of violet ink and
it is one of those like retractable kind
of liners so that will be interesting
two dollars off a so lofty mascara and
then also we have at one of the Oh sugar
lip balms in the shade a spice so I am
excited to try that out alright let's go
ahead and jump into the products that I
actually purchased so the first two were
the Physicians Formula Muru Muru butter
blushes I was so excited to get my hands
on these because you know I love the
butter bronzer so the first one here is
called 6 8 3 3 natural glow and this is
what it looks like so the packaging is
obviously really really cute these are
about half the size of the bronzers if
you are curious they are kind of tiny
and this is what it looks like on the
inside now this is literally almost like
a highlight on my skin tone and even
though the camera is making me look a
little darker right now I'm anywhere
between NW 10 and 15 at Mac so I'm
pretty fair complected so I would say
right off the bat this is more of a
peachy highlighter or blush topper that
is what it looks like and then the other
shade is called plum Rosanna this one is
just a very strange color in my opinion
actually
I feel like they did kind of just a
strange color selection in general I
feel like I would have loved to see a
more rosy blush or maybe one that could
work for all sorts of different skin
tones but unfortunately I feel like
these are really only going to work for
you if you have a very light complexion
so here is the shade plum rose and they
do feel very silky they smell like the
more and more butter bronzers but I just
don't think the color selection was
really thought out that well so here are
the two shades for you guys to see
verily their kind of color as you can
probably tell so if you do have a deeper
complexion I do not think these will
even show up on you so that is kind of
disturbing alright moving on let's go
ahead and talk about this little guy
this is the NYX what is this flawless
finish blending sponge so this is new
and I have been using this for it the
past week and a half I really like it it
is dirty right now because I just used
it this morning but I would say this is
a pretty decent sponge it is a little
bit on the expensive side I feel like
all of these products were hella
expensive drugstore prices are getting
ridiculous absolutely ridiculous but it
has a really really nice pointed angle
right here it's a very very sharp so you
can get it right underneath the crevices
of your eye and right into your nose
crevices if you want to and I just think
it's a really good one
it does not soften up the way a beauty
blender or a Real Techniques sponge or
the uLTA Beauty sponges do it but I feel
like it still puts on foundation
breathing really nicely so this is a
pretty good product alright moving on I
did pick up two at little guys right
here and these are actually items that
you guys will be seeing a first
impressions on these are the Neutrogena
hydro boost hydrating tint and also the
Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating
concealer so this is what the actual
foundation or tint looks like I am very
very excited to go ahead and compare
this to the hourglass illusion
hyaluronic skin tint I will be doing a
first impressions for you guys on that
product tomorrow which is quite exciting
the shade that I did pick up is classic
ivory number 10 I have heard this runs
very very dark and yellow tone so I am
going to have some white mixer drops on
hand and definitely use more of like a
lightening powder when I do use this but
yeah very excited to try this out I'm a
huge fan of the hydro boost line as far
as like their moisturizers and eye
creams are concerned so very excited for
that and then here is the hydrating
concealer again I got this in the
lightest shade which is called fair and
it looks like it has the color and then
like a ring of moisture around it so we
we try that out and do a first
impressions I also did pick up the
covergirl so Lakhia mascara which is why
I got that little deal from covergirl
but and this is what it looks like I
think this is just okay it's not
something that I'm personally going to
repurchase first of all because I found
out grabber girl is not cruelty free I
thought they were for some reason but
this is what the wand looks like I do
feel like the actual formulation is very
very wet and a little on the chunky side
one of you brought up that I should just
cut off the ball on the end I feel like
the ball is way too big I poked my eye
like out every single time so that is
what the actual wand looks like I think
if you want really really nice like to
find upper lashes this is a good one but
if you are looking for something to wear
on the lower lashes this is very very
hard to use so it's okay I will use it
but not something that I would
personally repurchase I also did pick up
the covergirl true and Naked Jules
palette again this was something I just
didn't know that cover girl was not
cruelty free I don't think UTRA Jena is
either it's absolutely crazy like I am
slowly transitioning into cruelty free
makeup and it's ridiculous how many
brands actually test on animals but
anyway this is what the palette looks
like and I was very excited to get my
hands on this it looks way more
beautiful in person than it does on
camera in a photo or even like on the
ulta.com website I just wanted to put
that out there I think it's amazing so I
really like the consistency on these
they are very similar to like the true
naked roses palette and I really do like
that one I think that is a great option
from the drugstore here are a few
swatches for you guys they definitely
have a little bit of fall out so you
need to tap off your brush and also if
you want to use a little bit of a
glitter glue that would be very much
appreciated as far as I'm concerned with
this palette but you guys can see the
colors they're very very pretty than
Karina I'm sorry yeah this greenish
color right here is beautiful this gold
color and this these just very unique
shades that I usually don't see in
palettes let alone drugstore palettes
and then they did also go ahead and toss
in a transition shade right here so I
feel like this is just a really nice
little palette I love the way it goes
onto the eyes let me know if you guys
would like me to do a little bit ready
with me using that I did also go ahead
and pick up two new products here from
Maybelline as well so these are the
dream cushion liquid foundation on the
go this is a cushion foundation I got
the latest shade of porcelain and
I also picked up the dream brightening
creamy concealer in number ten fair
again I'm gonna do a first impressions
on these products right here so I'm not
gonna open those up yet but I have been
hearing really really good things about
those all right I did also pick up this
Revlon Colorstay brow pencil so many of
you have been saying my brows have been
looking good in the past couple of days
I've been using this product I kind of
 up my brow right here today
excuse my language but I feel like my
other brow looks okay so this has been
really really nice I'm the shade that I
have is 2:05 blonde and this is just
their new like retractable brow pencil
so if you were into that I would highly
recommend looking into it it reminds me
a lot of the Anastasi of Beverly Hills
brow definer I didn't think that product
was that great but this is kind of like
a dupe for it so a lot cheaper you guys
can see it does have a spoolie on one
end and then the other end is kind of
like a little triangular shaped
retractable pencil so there it is I do
feel like the formulation on this is a
little more on the wet side one of you
had told me that on snapchat Anna I
agree 100% I feel like it is a little
more moist so if you want to you if
you're worried that your brows are gonna
be slipping all over the place you can
definitely set it in with a powder but
so far so good with that really really
happy I did also pick up the NYX total
cover drop it foundation so this is
supposed to say or it's supposed to be
with just a few drops our total cover
drop Foundation deliver sheer to full
coverage and a velvety matte finish
simply adjust the number of drops you
use until you get the desired level of
coverage you want more drops equals more
coverage though I have never tried out
the what is it a cover FX custom drops
or whatever they're called the reason
why I was so intrigued by this was
because tech out this color you guys
this color is called pale and it
basically looks like a white mixer
foundation it is probably three or four
shades lighter than my particular skin
tone and I'm pretty damn tasty so I'm
very excited to try this out I Hemmer
really worn it by itself yet but I did
mix it into a darker foundation the
other day and I felt like it gave me a
little more coverage now I did watch
Emily Noel 83s review on this and she
was talking about how you really can
wear this as a foundation and then just
add more drops for more coverage so I
will definitely try it out that way and
let you guys know what I think let's see
here I also did pick up these two guys
here from covergirl so these are new a
brow products we have the easy breezy
brow this is the shape and define
brow gel this is also in the shade
blonde and then the easy breezy brow
fill shape and defining 8:15 soft blond
these are so scrappy you guys I just
could not believe it I really don't like
this brow gel I feel like it's very much
tinted but not to the point where it's
like V I don't know it's like one of
those gels that's gonna give you fibers
in your brows this is just a basic gel
but it has a very very light color to it
like insanely light and I normally have
like an ashy light kind of blonde hair
color so I could not believe how light
this actual color was it definitely
leaves a very topi whitish tint to your
brow so if you are not into that you
would not like this if you have
absolutely like platinum blonde hair and
you have been lightening your eyebrows
I'm sure that this would be nice to set
them in but it actually leaves that
white cast on my brow so I don't like
that and then this guy right here is
like really crappy the fill shape and
define this is just so hard to use you
guys I feel like this was butchering my
eyebrows last week like it looked so bad
so you can hear when I shake it it has
like a little like ball in there and
basically that's just the powder going
together with whatever the other thing
is so you put it on and it actually it
looks really really nice because it
looks like it's very very precise as you
guys can see but at the same time I
don't know guys i just have issues with
this flaking off and you can kind of see
if i go up close it starts to flake off
and then also it's very very hard to
fill in like the front part of your brow
i'm a front part of the brow kind of
girl that's usually the only area where
i really fill in my brows but i feel
like this would be kind of nice for
filling in the areas like up here so
maybe by your arch if you do have a
little bit of like shedding or if it's
not as full up there so I've been doing
that but this one is way darker than my
hair color so I don't understand how
they can release two different products
one of them is too light and then this
one's too dark so I don't really know
what to do with these I don't have to
play around with them more and finally
the last item that I did pick up is from
Maybelline and this is the dream Wonder
powder they had a new shade this is the
new porcelain shade and it's uh it's
crappy I'm so sorry if I sound like a
negative Nelly in this video but a lot
of these products were not that great so
here is the actual shade swatched I hope
you guys can see that it's way way way
too dark so it totally disrupted my
foundation I did wear it from my fails
in Holy Grails the other day and
a lot of you were saying oh my goodness
your face looks pink it's that
foundation you're wearing it definitely
was not the foundation that I was
wearing I was wearing my all time Holy
Grail Foundation which is the vibrancy
foundation fluid from josie maran it
matches me beautifully in fact maybe
even lighter than my skin tone it was
that powder right there although it is
very very creamy and buttery
unfortunately the shade is just too dark
so I'm a little scared to try out that
cushion foundation and that concealer
but we shall see so anyway guys that is
what is new at the drugstore 2017 I hope
you enjoyed it this video thank you so
much for joining me and I will see you
guys tomorrow for that first impressions
