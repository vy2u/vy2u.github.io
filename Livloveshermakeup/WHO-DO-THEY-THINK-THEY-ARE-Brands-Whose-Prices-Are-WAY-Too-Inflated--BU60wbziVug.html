my channel today we're gonna be talking
about some brands that really really
really really it's not gonna overcharge
at least this is in my opinion my
conspiracy and legislation okay now I
would like to know down below what
brands do you think overcharged because
I think we all turn a blind eye at some
point to certain brands people are like
well why don't you want to buy the $120
nataschab - no no palette and you're
okay with buying an $80 hourglass
palette which has you know pan sizes
inside of a goddamn quarter and I'm over
here just like because you know we all
have those brands that we are a little
more drawn to and I don't want to say
bias because I'm not biased okay I will
let you know if a product is even
if it is from my favorite brand in fact
I've done a video all about my least
favorite products from my favorite
brands I'll go ahead and throw that up
in the cards but I thought it would just
be fun to walk you guys through some
brands that I feel like either their
whole entire collection is overpriced in
my opinion or some of the products
within their collection are overpriced
this will happen to every single beauty
brand on the market so I want to know
what your thoughts are down below but
anyway let's go ahead and jump right
into it I want to start with vile boss
so by the boss is one of those brands
that I feel like it's kind of
instafamous Instagram is where they
basically got well-known and you guys
know morphe as taken off I mean
god they were known on Instagram and
then they said should do Beauty
influencers and now they're at Target
and possibly at Sephora what what is
that world cup - but but I feel like
vinyl boss is kind of like that as well
and the ingredients in these kind of
pallets right here although I do have
quite a few of them in my collection are
not the best the ingredients and morphe
palettes are worse in my opinion I have
allergic reactions to eyeshadow palettes
and things like that from morphe but
these are the kind of palettes where you
open them up you take a whip oh yeah and
you can smell it smells like cheap
makeup okay I feel like they really
really overcharge for these palettes I'm
no longer going to be purchasing it from
violet boss anymore I feel like I have
enough of their palettes I have the
Laura Lee I have the drenched metals I
do you have the Holy Grail and I do have
it the violet boss Pro ride-or-die
which now retails for a whopping $75 on
these sephora.com website I have this on
my eyes today I don't have
blending I think they're beautiful
there's a lot of shades in here you get
a lot of product but I have to say is
this worth $75 absolutely not if you
compare it to a really really cheap I
shadow palette of course it's better but
if you're gonna take this formula and
compared to honest Osteen Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance or even some of the
old school chocolate bar pallets or
something from Too Faced you will
quickly realize and this is not that
great of a formula it's not that they're
not good they're good but aren't they
great absolutely not and you know what a
great palette a great palette still
should not be $75 in my opinion all
right moving on
let's talk about Physicians Formula
Physicians Formula is one of those
drugstore brands that has always been
way up there in price
it reminds me a lot of pixie pixie is
one of those brands to where it's like
kind of in between some other products
are great and then some of their
products are trashed and you're just
like I don't understand the same thing
goes for a Physicians Formula some of
their products are really good and I
don't mind spending fifteen to eighteen
dollars even if I can't find one of
those little that it's like
getting a golden ticket when you find a
what is it like a coupon code I mean you
rip it off and bring it up to the
register like oh my god it's only gonna
be fifteen dollars instead of twenty you
know even with the little coupon code I
would still purchase this bronzer the
more and more butter bronzers are my
all-time favorite bronzer formula but
some of their other products in their
collection you know their eyeliners some
of their mascaras a lot of stuff just
this way to overprice its way to
overprice and it's kind of like well
what do you want to be do you want to be
drugstores you want to be high-end it's
like if this brand doesn't really
understand what it wants now to be fair
their prices have always been high these
other drugstore brands are coming out
and basically they're just raising their
prices little by little I feel like the
only you know drugstore brand
right now that I trust and that I love
that has awesome quality is wet and wild
to be completely honest so yeah I have
to go ahead and throw a physician's
formula under the bus for that yes they
have my favorite bronzer but man they
really really charge a lot for some of
their products up next if the milk of
makeup I have tried quite a few products
from them I purchased these myself this
came for PR everybody talks about the
milk makeup blur stick this thing is
like $32 and everybody says it's so
amazing this is
I don't like this I don't like this at
all it didn't do anything for my dry
skin it didn't feel my pores and it
feels very very unhygienic that's my
thing about milk makeup is a lot of the
stuff at Brees typically everything that
they have is very unhygenic so here is
the sunshine oil you roll it onto your
face is basically just like a baby oil
in my opinion it doesn't even do that
much hydrating and it have little chunks
the glitter infused in here which I
don't know what the that's supposed
to be for you have the milk of makeup
cooling water stick let me show you guys
what happened to this after two months
of being in my collection so you can see
here I haven't been using the product
and it has been wearing down but it's
not the size of the actual like the
circumference as you can see is really
small now because these dry out the
packaging is just not good and often
everybody keeps saying I love the milk
makeup blur sticks and I love the
packaging I know no way in hell I'm
gonna repurchase any of these I don't
care if this was sent for PR they can
take the off their back down here I list
I don't give two okay these are
just not good they're not packaged well
they're cheap and they're way too over
price and I don't know if you've ever
went on to the sephora.com website and
seen what milk makeup is charging for
their little hook and eyeshadow quads
they're charging almost fifty dollars
for four little pans of eyeshadow
they're back you're back alright moving
on let's talk about Beauty Blender no
but will not spend $20 on a goddamn
little pink sponge and this is the thing
I know some people are very picky with
their sponges but for me I feel like as
long as the sponge isn't too dense
it applies my foundation the same okay
and if you're really really unhappy with
every sponge that you tried you can go
ahead and get a foundation brush you
know here I do have the liquid a blender
cleanser ten fluid ounces of this was
around the 28th to possibly $32 mark I
purchased this two and a half weeks ago
which really scares me I mean I'm good
at cleaning my brushes clearly I do do
clean them once a week and then I do a
deep clean up my sponge after every
single use of but I can't believe that I
spent this much money for this
particular product because it's just not
worth it it's just not worth it just
like how you're gonna use the $20 fine
it's gonna go bad and then you have to
throw it out okay just go and purchase a
drugstore spot honestly they're just as
good in my opinion I feel like the
miracle complexion sponge for Real
Techniques is Bob that is my
all-time favorite sponge I have gone
through probably 20 or 30 beauty
blunders in the past they used to
purchase them all the time because
beauty influencers were only using the
Beauty Blender they were the first
on the market but that doesn't mean that
there's not going to be competition it's
just a goddamn sponge so yeah I really
think they overcharged all right next
let's go ahead and talk about soap &amp;amp;
Glory soap in glory is one of those
brands that really gets you sucked in
because their products smell good things
where they're kind of like they remind
me of lush like price-wise they have
some products that are up there like in
the lush price range but for me I am
more prone to purchasing from lush
because they have much better
ingredients it's a different thing when
you have a scrub here but then you also
have a scrub from lush and there's like
a four ingredient list or something like
that I know some people do say that
lunch has some bad ingredients and
they're compared to stuff like this it's
not that bad you know what I mean I
would much rather put a left face scrub
on my face then put this on my face I
wouldn't put this on my face anyway but
this is the flake away body scrub when
you can get this on sale you can get it
for about seven to eight dollars but
other than that it's gonna cost you I
feel like a target this goes for around
$19 especially if you are in like on the
East Coast where prices are a little
higher or even on the west coast in LA I
saw this for in 1999 it's just a way to
over price you can get the treat Hut
scrubs for like buy one get one 50% off
and it's a much better deal I do have
one of their face washes and I purchased
that for $18 I mean I just feel like
it's one of those brands that really
really lives off of the fact that they
smell really good like their product
smelled really good but are they better
than other drugstore price skin care
products not really and their body care
although like I said it smells really
good it's just not worth the price you
know what I'm saying you know what I'm
saying so yeah I have to put soap &amp;amp;
Glory into that category and hurry back
up next we have Bobby Brown Bobby Brown
is very very pricey definitely in the
luxury category but at the same time I
mean they're around the same prices like
hourglass products but I prefer
hourglass products over Bobby Brown
products you know what I mean it's kind
of like the difference between okay yes
the brands might have the same pricing
but who comes out with better consistent
products in my opinion hourglass / Bobby
Brown any day Bobby Brown is kind of a
boring brand in my opinion and like
their eyeshadows and stuff like that
this little crappy palette right here
was $62 these are someone like these
scratchiest weirdest eyeshadows ever I
loved it when I first got it because at
the
there weren't that many great formulas
coming out there weren't a lot of like
metallic sized foils shadows yet but and
these two guys right here now compared
to like the foil shadows that are on the
market now they can't even compare it's
called the Tala right eye palette I've
had a very hard time letting go of it
because it was so pricey and because I
didn't return it on time you know what I
need and then here I have the vitamin
enriched face base which it definitely
is worth the money in my opinion but
then you look at something like this
which is the same exact price which is
called the SPF 25 tented moisturizing
ball it's crazy crazy moisturizing but I
mean I can't I just don't understand how
this can be almost $70 it's just
absolutely ridiculous they also have an
eye cream which is $85 they have some
really really really really pricey skin
care products - and the thing about
Bobbi Brown is she's a makeup artist so
why are you charging an arm and a leg
for your skin care as well I just don't
really understand the best just me
personally maybe I haven't tried enough
with a brand but I won't be trying
enough with a brand because they do test
on animals but I wanted to bring up
Bobby Brown because I feel like the
majority of the products I tried from
them are just they just don't hit that
mark you know what I mean
the next round I want to talk about is
the skin care brand it's just a toe now
they do tests on animals the only thing
that I've ever really really truly
fallen in love with from Shiseido aren't
their cotton pads there are $9.50 for a
hundred count which again super super
pricey but they feel like a little
baby's ass you know like they're so soft
100% cotton I need to be able to find
some sort of a cruelty-free option
that's basically identical to that
because they're great for removing
makeup but like the benefits wrinkle
resistant wrinkle resistant or eye cream
I mean I've been going through this for
like six months now and every time I use
it I'm always thinking the same thing
it's way too heavy it never sinks in
properly to the skin because even if you
have the driest of eyes this is still
too much moisture and then I'll be using
you know like their essence or I've
tried their face cream so far and I'm
thinking like what makes this different
and then a product that is literally
twenty or thirty dollars cheaper I don't
see that big of a difference and when
you look at the ingredients they're not
sporting a ton of retinol and AJ's and
BJ's and stuff that can actually do
things for your skin they're not
sporting that in
gradients list is a very very popular
Asian skincare brand but I want to know
what do people see in it because for me
these are very very up charged up next I
think we should talk about drugged
elephant as well as sundae Riley because
I think that some of their products are
absolutely worth the money I'm talking
about the UFO sundae Riley clarifying
face oil to sell silic acid oil I'm
talking about the Luna oil but then you
go and you look and you see products
like they're ceramics lip clay cleanser
which is $45 for a cleanser not good
quality in my opinion not that special
not that great of an ingredients list
and then you look at like their
tranquility cleansing balm which again
around the $50 mark nothing compared to
I mean it's the same thing as other
cleansing balm on the market and it just
makes you wonder are they up charging
and making it these just as expensive
because they know people will buy them
you really have to double-check the
ingredients list and see what you want
because yes they are proving high
quality ingredients into their overnight
products and some of their oils and
things like that but when it comes to
their more basic products is it really
worth it is it really worth it you have
to make that decision for yourself and
then as far as drunk elephant is
concerned again see from a day serum
great ingredients in Europe would highly
recommend for the $90 but then I'm over
here and I'm someone who has completely
fallen in love with their god damn drunk
elephant bestie jelly cantaloupe
cleanser I love this I really really
love it but a lot of people would look
at this and say God 35 or 40 dollars for
a 5 fluid ounce cleanser that's only
gonna be on your skin for 5 to 10
seconds is it worth it is it worth it
let me know what you think down below so
that is it for this video guys like I
said please let me know what brands or
what products within a brand you think
are way too over price and I guess I
will see you guys on Friday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
