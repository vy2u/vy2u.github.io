my channel today's video is going to be
all about why I personally do not like
mac cosmetics and why I will not be
purchasing from them a further any more
whatever you know what I mean
alright so obviously I have to put a
disclaimer on this video anytime I do
something that's even slightly
controversial I like to first of all
make sure I do a disclaimer to protect
myself from any sort of brand that may
hold a grudge um and also I like to do
it so I can explain to you guys why I'm
doing this a video I don't just make
opinionated videos so that I can come on
here and be like that's my opinion let
me shove it down your throat no I want
to open up discussion in the comments
section I have never disabled my comment
section no matter how horrible it get I
let every single comment go through
sometimes obviously comments go to the
spam folder or we'll go to like in the
review folder it's very very very rare
for me to delete comments okay I have to
be very very personally offended so I do
these videos so that we can start
talking and discussing I really think
that it's important if you're gonna put
your opinion out there to the internet
that you're ready for the feedback of
others I mean you can't just put it out
there and be like okay that's it that's
how I feel no I want to hear from you
guys so I would love to have
constructive interesting conversations
down below obviously if you're just
going to be like you then it's like
okay well you but if you actually
want to have like a good discussion
let's go ahead and do it so anyway these
are obviously just my opinions you guys
these are not straight-up facts it's
just the way that I feel about mac
cosmetics um contrary to belief I feel
like a lot of people think that I have
not tried a lot of stuff for mac
cosmetics
I've tried probably over 50 products I
feel like I've tried six or seven of
their lipsticks three or five of their
lip liners I've tried probably like
twelve of their blushes I do like their
blushes I have tried about four of their
foundations their powder products their
bronzers I've tried a lot from them
actually now out of all of those
products I have only held on to three
and I have those three right here to
show you guys the first one is this Mac
pigment in the shade rose I just think
this is amazing and stunning to look at
that is literally the only reason I held
on to it I did hold on to one of the
blushes this is the Mac sheer tone blush
in the shade Sun Basques and then I do
also have the Mac face and body
foundation in white and I really should
declutter those because it makes me
break out like a mofo anyway let me give
you guys the 5 reasons as to why I'm not
a huge
of MAC Cosmetics I did go ahead and kind
of write them down on my phone so if you
see me glancing down that is what I'm
doing I'm trying to keep myself on track
so I don't go all over the place I don't
edit my videos and also I do tend to get
a little heated sometimes and it's very
hard for me to keep my attention span so
let's go ahead and jump right into it
the first one will calm is absolutely no
surprise it is the fact that MAC
Cosmetics does tests on animals they
were acquired by Estee Lauder I believe
in 1998 so they've been testing for a
very long time now they do state on
their website that they only test when
it necessary but I don't want to you
know I don't want to support a brand
that only tests when necessary I would
not support a brand that just doesn't
test at all
you know MAC Cosmetics rakes in tons
upon tons of money and still there you
know
owned by us tail otter and still they
test on animals it's been like that for
a very very long time and I just don't
want to support any brands like that the
second reason is I do find a lot of
their products are not suitable for my
personal skin type I am combination
skinned I definitely do get hormonal
acne and things like that and this is
not the first time that I have heard of
their face products especially like
their foundations breaking out those who
do have more oily acne prone skin so
like I said combination so I'm a little
more dry on the like outer part of my
face and in my t-zone super oily I have
tried the Studio Fix foundation I have
tried the Studio sculpt and I have
obviously tried this baby right here and
then after their powder foundation I
from research that I did supposedly they
do use a whole lot of talc in their
products now telc is all over the place
it's in every single makeup product but
it seems like they have a very high
concentration of talc in their product
so I would not recommend like Mac
foundations to those of you who are very
sensitive or if you have really acne
prone skin it seems like people who do
have normal skin or dry skin seem to
love their foundations which i think is
awesome but for me personally
every single one makes me break out so
that is the second reason the third
reason is too many limited edition
collections you guys I feel like we can
all agree on this I mean it's ridiculous
every time I go on to trend mood I feel
like there's a new collection that has
released you guys know how I feel about
limited edition stuff limited edition my
ass I feel like all they're doing is we
know relaunch in products that they've
already done before so colors that
they've already done they're just
putting it in new packaging I think the
packaging is beautiful on mac cosmetics
not even gonna lie the collection
they come out with a really
well-thought-out it's just it's so like
frequently it's just all the time every
single week I feel like there's a new
goddamn collection from back releasing
so I just think that that is overkill in
my opinion I know a lot of people do
love the anticipation of waiting for in
that collection to launch but if it's
just going to sell out in five minutes
I'm like what's the point I'm just not
into it all right number four there are
powder products I do not feel like
they're very comparable to some of the
products that are releasing right now in
2017 now this is a very very personal
thing like I said I have tried a lot of
their blushes out I love the color
selection of their blushes but the only
one that I have held on to is this your
tone blush right here now this is more
of a blush topper because it's a sheer
tone blush but I do find that like their
powder products their eyeshadows and
also their blushes are very firmly
pressed like I don't feel like they've
ever really kind of opened up especially
like their main collection like the one
that's not limited-edition I don't feel
like they've ever really played with
their formula and these just feel very
firmly pressed to me although they are
pigmented and you don't get a lot of
fall out it's just not what I would
expect I don't feel like they're keeping
up with the other brands out there that
are releasing these super soft buttery
eyeshadows or super soft buttery blushes
I'm just a big fan of that kind of thing
and you know here's like a one swipe
swatch here you know that's good but is
it worth the money like in my opinion no
and I know that MAC Cosmetics is made
for makeup artist I totally understand
that I am NOT personally a makeup artist
I do feel like I've seen so many makeup
artists on YouTube that make MAC
Cosmetics look so presentable and like
really want me it makes me want to buy
stuff from them and that is why I
started buying you know products from
mac cosmetics in the first place five
years ago on YouTube that's all people
ever talked about I have probably 27 of
their eyeshadow singles I have
decluttered every single one of them
they are just not that great in my
opinion now if you do like them and you
want something that is cruelty free and
also a cheaper option I do think that
makeup geek eyeshadow singles are
definitely definitely comparable I also
don't like those so it's not just me
being like I hate mac cosmetics it won't
stop me like I hate that guy's buttocks
or hate Vic of geek it's just for me
those powder eyeshadows I never got into
it like I never saw the hype never was
into it so that is the fourth reason I
just feel like they are not keeping up
with other brands that are like pushing
out like 2017 new
stuff I just feel like they are
continuously doing the same thing over
and over and the final reason number
five is I've never ever felt comfortable
in a Mac store now this has nothing to
do with the employees I think they are
impeccable they look beautiful they
obviously are told that they have to
wear like a nice amount of makeup on
their face but I feel very intimidated
when I go in there I'm just a you know
I'm a normal girl
I wear normal makeup I'm a teacher on a
day-to-day basis so I don't wear a
full-on smoky eye every single day I'm
allowed to because I work in the arts
world but I don't and that is totally
okay but I don't feel like it's good
when you go into Sephora or you go into
Mac and you feel uncomfortable that just
makes you not want to buy their products
I feel like if I go in there and I have
with a full-on smoky eye I look like a
 million bucks I get serviced
right away if I go in there and look
just very very plain and like basic
looking like I normally do on a day to
day basis which nothing wrong with that
at all I really don't get service right
away and tell him actually like piling
stuff up in my arms then they're like oh
look she wants to spend like 300 or 400
dollars I just don't think it's
appropriate that MAC Cosmetics teaches I
think teaches their employees to really
only go after people that look like they
want to spend money because you know
what I could be dressed like a freaking
hobo and I might still spend $400 whoo
you should still give me service does
that make sense so yeah I really have
never felt comfortable in Mac stores I
know a lot of you feel this way as well
I've quite a few friends that work at
mac cosmetics so it's nothing against
them I have heard that they are actually
taught to do this if someone looks like
they are not um dressed appropriately or
like they're not going to spend money
they really don't spend a lot of time on
that client and I just don't think
that's the right thing to do so anyway
guys those are the reasons why I
personally do not like mac cosmetics I
want to know your thoughts down below do
you agree with me do you disagree with
me and yep that's pretty much it I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
