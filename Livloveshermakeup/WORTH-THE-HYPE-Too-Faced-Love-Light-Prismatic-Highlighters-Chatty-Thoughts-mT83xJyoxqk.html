my channel today's video is going to be
a birthday hype video on the new
toothpaste love like prismatic
highlighters I did purchase these for
$30 a piece on the Sephora calm website
which I'm very happy about because
honestly two of them are going back to
the store there is only one that I do
like and I will tell you guys which one
that is in a second it's probably the
one that you would not think would be my
favorites but yeah I am returning two of
them thank goodness here in the US you
can return products to Sephora you
cannot return them to the Too Faced Calm
website if you have already gone ahead
and swatch them so I just wanted to give
you a little bit of a heads up I would
wait for all of the products from the
new natural love collection to go in
store at Sephora I will be going ahead
and reviewing the eyeshadow palette for
you guys tomorrow and I'm not
necessarily going to call these videos
review swatches in comparison because to
be completely honest there's probably
gonna be a little bit of graphic
language as well as just a little bit of
ranting involved and I don't feel like
it's a review if I'm really really
ranting so I'm just gonna call these
worth the hype anyway these are $30
apiece like I said on the Sephora calm
website these are from the new love
collection or the natural love
collection for 2017 I believe these are
permanent and I think the eyeshadow
palette is as well but I haven't double
checked on that so I'll leave a comment
down below I'll pin it to the top so I
can give you guys my thoughts on that
each highlighter does contain 9 grams of
products and they are gluten paraben and
cruelty free but please keep in mind
that Too Faced recently was sold to
Estee Lauder which means that they are
owned by a parent company that does
tests on animals even though these
products themselves are not so here is
what the outer packaging looks like this
is the shade ray of light which is more
of the rose gold you can see you have
the actual color on the side as well as
the ingredients listed which is great it
says cruelty free on the back and then
it just has like a little matte black
kind of boxy look and then right here we
have blinded by the light which is the
lightest out of the three this one has
more of a silver iridescent to it and
then finally we have you light up my
life which actually is of my favorite
this is the one that I am going to be
keeping so as far as outer packaging is
concerned or the actual packaging this
is what they look like and to be
completely honest I do feel like I
bought these because of the packaging
they are so incredibly beautiful and
cute to look at I love all my little
two-faced heart palettes or anything
like that honestly I really do like this
cutesy thing that Too Faced does I know
some people are not into it there have
been a handful of pallets I've been like
that's a little too cutie
me like the two-faced totally cute
eyeshadow pallete putting stickers like
on a palette is just not for me that
feels a little childish to me but if you
like to do it girl you do you but for me
I just do to really like that but these
I do think are adorable I think a lot of
people are probably purchasing for the
packaging which I know sounds kind of
silly because they are $30 a piece but
to be completely honest these really are
kind of like a collector's item it is
very hard for me not to want to keep the
two of these the blinded by the light
and the ray of light just for the
packaging but I'm not gonna do it I'm
just gonna keep this one right here so
just for a little bit of size comparison
the Becca shimmering skin perfecter is
range from 7 to 8 grams of product you
are getting 9 grams of product in each
one of these a love light highlighter so
I know a lot of people have been saying
you know what there's no a lot of
product in here that's actually not true
you are getting about like one or two
grams more than you do with the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector press the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector press
this one right here is prismatic
amethyst the new one if you're curious
this one has 7 grams of product because
of the etching on the top but the ones
that are completely smooth do have 8
grams of product so technically you're
getting 1 to 2 grams more and the Too
Faced highlighters a lot of people are
saying they're not worth the $30 I don't
think it's because of the amount of
product you get in there I think they're
not worth the $30 because of the actual
formula of the product so let's go ahead
and talk about the formula really
quickly these are a big delay a formula
now if you don't know what a big shell a
formula is it is basically a hybrid
between a cream a powder and kind of
like a liquid all in one they have a
very very smooth consistency and touch
to them they come off in a very very
smooth look as well kind of like a
foiled sort of finish and I just love
bake slave formulas in general I have a
few here from the drugstore this one is
the Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting
gold bar in the shade I believe
Goldilocks
also the Wet n Wild mega glow
highlighting powder in precious petals
this is also a baked Jala a formula if
you guys can see and then obviously like
the Dior glowing Gardens highlights
those are all like a baked Soleil as
well as their new nude era Luminizer
this is just a very popular formula that
is going around right now with the Bobbi
Brown afternoon glow highlighter this is
also a big delay formula I'm really just
into these because I just love the point
that they look on the skin I think they
give a very strong beautiful beautiful
impacted kind of glow on your cheeks but
they never emphasize
certain wrinkles and things like that
the only time that I noticed that these
start to really emphasize texture and
wrinkles is when they do have a little
bit of glitter infused in them and
unfortunately I do find that the blinded
by the light shade as well as ray of
light to do have a little bit of glitter
so that is personally why I'm gonna go
ahead and return the two of these I also
just think the pigmentation is lacking
normally when you do get a big shoelace
sort of formula you really just like one
swipe you can see it's smooth it's
beautiful you get a lot of impact and
unfortunately with these two shades
that's just not the case
now the ingredients list is slightly
different in how it like is numbered I
guess you could say with this little guy
right here and I do think that is why
this is better I find that this is
incredibly pigmented on my skin
particularly I am very very fair
complected as you guys can see but I do
think that this one is the best out of
the bunch so if you did want to pick one
up I would recommend ray of light or I'm
sorry you liked up my life ray of light
and blinded by the light I would
recommend just going ahead and skipping
on those so I didn't want to say really
quickly before I get into a little more
about these I am no longer going to be
purchasing as much two-faced products as
I normally do I have ranted about them
quite a bit lately I will throw up in my
cards my consistent versus unreliable
makeup brands video right here so you
guys can see that please do not watch if
you do not like graphic language because
there are a whole lot of
in that I'm in that video okay so please
don't watch if you do not like graphic
language but that was basically me as a
consumer talking about how I'm really
disappointed in the overall consistency
of what to face has been lately I feel
that either their products are great
hits they're really really good I'm
talking about like 9 pan pallets
chocolate bar pallets or then you know
you also get these kind of products that
are just really really shitty in my
opinion and they literally feel like a
drugstore products or not even the
quality of drugstore products I mean
there are so many drugstore products
that have released recently that are
awesome and even better quality than
some of the products that you can buy
from Too Faced so I know a lot of you
have been and noticed these
inconsistencies with the brand and I
just wanted to say unless it's a really
large collection that you guys want me
to review I probably will be slowing
down my purchasing on Too Faced products
they are my favorite brands but they are
really getting lower on the list they
are like at the top of my list
right now not my hit list so anyway I
just wanted to give you at the heads-up
on that my you know review on the
eyeshadow palette is pretty
disappointing tomorrow so I do apologize
if I seem a little negative in these
videos but I can't help it I'm a
consumer I bought these with my own
money and I think that if a product is a
piece of I should be able to say
it's a piece of I know a lot of you
don't like when I say that a lot of you
do like when I say that it is my right
as a consumer especially when I'm buying
these products and not getting them for
PR it is my right to tell you guys if I
like them or not so anyway um like I
said the formula wise it's definitely a
facial a formula so here is the shade
blinded by the light this is the one
that has the really really kind of
silvery iridescent to it I was hoping
this was going to be my favorite you
guys because it would be a true
highlight on my skin it does pull these
slightest amount of a champagne
undertone to it
and if you guys would like me to do
side-by-side swatches comparisons and
dupes on these products please let me
know I know I'm very behind on videos
right now but I will make sure to get
that up in the next couple of months for
you guys but let me zoom in really
quickly here so you guys can kind of see
there is definitely hard pan on this
product already now if you don't know
what hard pan is and that is where your
a finger or whatever you're picking the
product up with has a little bit of
wetness or dampness on it whether it's
the oils from your finger or a little
bit of leftover brush cleanser on your
actual brush and it will go into this
kind of base gel a formula and it will
start to create a little layer of
product where you're not able to
actually scoop the product up now it
makes it incredibly difficult when it's
a product like this that doesn't
actually have that much pigmentation to
begin with so you guys really can see I
have hit hard pan on this one I have hit
hard pan on ray of light which is my
least favorite out of the three I feel
like the pigmentation on here is just
really really poor and if you guys
didn't know this is an exact color dupe
before the sweet peach glow palette the
highlighting shade in there this is just
the same exact color repackaged and then
I do also have hard pan on the one that
I really liked but I feel like I can
kind of pull this off is more of like a
blush topper or a bronzer topper that's
how I've been wearing it so I use it
more with a fluffy brush but this will
happen on any sort of baked chalet
products that you have a lot of people
are complaining about this right now but
let me just show you up close my other
baked Soleil products that I do have
here here's the Bobbi Brown afternoon
glow have already hit hard pan even the
ones from the drugstore you guys will be
able to see a little bit of hard pan so
this is normal with this kind of formula
because they are
so firmly but you just have to use the
right kind of brushes with this kind of
formula so if you really want to pick
this up I would highly recommend going
in with like the elf blending brush or
something that is really really firmly
pressed you want to pick that product up
tap off the excess and then really kind
of buff it into your skin if you are
just taking a super super fluffy brush
you are only going to get a little bit
of a glow going on today I did apply
this little guy as my blush topper or my
bronzer topper with one of the Luxy
tapered highlighter brushes I really
kind of fluffed in there and then
fluffed it onto my cheeks just for a
little bit of a glow this is obviously
darker than my complexion so I can't
actually pull it off as a highlight but
I like the way it went onto my skin so
these are very very light in
pigmentation as far as like a big delay
a formula is concerned I'm gonna swatch
a few of like my favorite big Chalet
formulas on the left hand side and then
I'm gonna swatch the Too Faced
highlighters on the right hand side this
is like a one swipe swatch of the Bobbi
Brown afternoon glow highlight we will
also do the wet and wild atmega globe
gold bar in the shade Goldilocks I just
want you guys to people to see how weak
these are in pigmentation and you really
have to make that up for you you have to
make your mind up like is that worth it
for the $30 for me personally also I'll
do the makeup forever this is the new
profusion profusion profusion light
illuminizer Zoar loominator 's this is
in at the lightest shade this is also a
baked chalet a formula so those are the
three swatches like kind of like one
swipe swatches as you guys can see it
now I'm going to do the two-faced ones
on the other side we will start with ray
of light so here is the shade array of
light which is that kind of like peachy
pinky color like I said this is an exact
dupe for the what is a two-faced sweet
peach blow kit the highlighting shade
and there here is the shade blinded by
the light go ahead and swatch that for
you guys and then finally my favorite
out of the bunch
lunch brunch which is called you light
up my life yes sorry guys it's already
been a long morning so there is you
light up my life so you guys will be
able to see probably instantly that this
one is just the strongest out of the
three so here are some baked chalet a
products that I have over here and then
here are the new two-faced ones I feel
like the top one in this one right here
just really aren't great as far as
pigmentation is concerned and that's
very very abnormal when you do have like
a base gel a kind of forming
so I would say the weakest thing about
these is definitely just the
pigmentation and the fact that the two
of these ray of light and also the shade
right here do have glitter particles in
them you will not see them until you
actually apply them onto your skin with
a brush but when you swatch them you
really can't see it but yeah this shade
right here as well I'm blinded by the
light is a little on the chunky side I
find it looks pretty if I'm wearing very
very minimal makeup but if I'm wearing
like a full face of makeup like I am
today it really just starts to emphasize
texture fine lines wrinkles things like
that so overall guys I would really
advise against purchasing these in the
first place like I said if you would
like me to go ahead and do a comparison
video as well as dupes with these
particular shades definitely let me know
but overall I'm just not super impressed
and I'm just not super impressed with
Too Faced lately I feel like they really
have been I don't know cutting strings
where things need to be tied together
does that even make sense I feel like
they just haven't been releasing good
products lately if you're not using
these with the right brush if you're not
using them you know with the right kind
of like technique you're going to just
not have a lot of pigment you're gonna
have glitter on your cheeks and I think
that's horrible two-faced is one of
those brands that is really catering
lately towards someone like the younger
people with these cutesy kind of
packaging and things like that and I
just think it's kind of sad that you
have to work so hard for a product to
work do you know what I mean so overall
guys not super impressed with these like
I said here are the swatches again here
is ray of light which is more of a
peachy color here is blinded by the
light which has more of a silver
iridescent and then my favorite which is
I always forget what the team of this is
you light up my life so I do like this
one I feel like it's a typical facial a
formula is it worth you know $20 or $30
not really in my opinion I think you can
definitely go and pick up the Laura
Geller baked gelato swirl illuminator
for cheaper and it's just as pretty in
my opinion it does have a little bit of
a color difference but you know there
are better products out there on the
market don't go and purchase something
just cause of the packaging I am
somebody that falls into that all the
freaking time okay I purchased thanks
for packaging all the time but I just
don't think it's worth it with these
particular products so I hope you
enjoyed this quick little review and
thank you so much for joining me and I
will see you guys tomorrow for the
eyeshadow palette review bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
