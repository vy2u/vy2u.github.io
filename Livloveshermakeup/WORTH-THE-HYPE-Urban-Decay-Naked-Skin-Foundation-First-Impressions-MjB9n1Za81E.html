to my channel today I am testing out a
very popular foundation for you guys it
is the Urban Decay Naked Skin Foundation
I have heard so many so many good things
about this particular foundation if you
already own the all nighter foundation
which I do really like I just don't like
the fact that it oxidizes like crazy and
then as you own a few items from the
Urban Decay Naked skin line I actually
own all faculty color correcting fluids
in green lavender peach yellow and also
pink so I do like the naked skin line in
general but I have never actually tried
the foundation or the concealer so I
don't have a concealer here to try out
today but if you have the foundation so
let's go ahead and just jump right into
it a little bit of background
information on this particular
foundation I did pick up beeshees 0.5
which is the lightest out of I believe
24 do you think they have a really nice
shade collection and 0.5 is described as
very fair porcelain shade with subtle
pink undertones now it does say here
this is the perfect base so it's
supposed to be like the perfect ultra
light based on the skin it's supposed to
give a demi massive finish and it
supposed to make the skin look
illuminated and also very bright it is
infused with Matrixyl 3000 which is a
powerful anti-wrinkle peptide and I do
have a few skincare products that
actually have that particular
ingredients in them it also has liqueur
which is an antioxidant green tea and
vitamins that make your skin look
nourished and low speaker it says pick
from a range of meticulously calibrated
shades for your most perfected
complexion they do recommend to shake it
well and then buff on the naked skin in
a circular motion so anyway this is what
the outer packaging looks like if you
get quite cute and then on the inside
you can see they actually have a little
purple thing going on here which is
adorable so here is the actual packaging
for the foundation very very similar to
the Urban Decay all nighter same kind of
like plastic packaging I'm not a huge
fan of that but it's not really that big
of a deal I just really really do prefer
a nice glass bottle so anyway they're
about the same size and did you get one
fluid ounce of products in here which is
the standard amount so anyway this is
what it looks like like I said I got the
shade 0.5 which is the lightest out of I
believe 18 and now let's see what this
one looks like so that you have a pump
just like the all-nighter and I
let's go ahead and start applying this
so I am going to go ahead and let me put
these guys in I am going to go ahead and
apply primer first because I need a
primer for my face this is the
vitamin-enriched base base from Bobbi
Brown I have been really really in love
with this lately let me zoom out just a
little I've been really really in love
with this lately so I'm going to take a
nice sized amount of that and I am just
going to apply it all over my skin I
also will apply it around my eye area
because if you like to see how from
nations where when the eye area and see
if they can double as a concealer so I'm
going to do that as well
I love the way this primer smells I know
I feel like every single day but it
really smells amazing it has been my
favorite lately alright and then we will
just let that sink in for a second and I
will tell you guys how you can apply
this so honey left side of my face I
will apply it with EDM miracle
complexion sponge from Real Techniques
and then on the right side I also will
be applying it with the Real Techniques
product this is the expert face brush
and they do say to buff this and
circular motions I'm not a huge fan of
doing that but I will try that out on
the right side of my face normally with
a brush if you like to just do like
downwards stroking motion so that like
I'm not like pulling out the hair on my
face or making it look even more
textured because if you notice with
brushes especially I tend to get a lot
of brush strokes on my actual face so
anyway just kind of tapping that in and
yeah that's about it let's go ahead and
jump right into it so I'm going to start
pumping this out they said to shake well
house like a little shaker in there as
you guys can hear and I guess I will
just start to apply this let's go ahead
and see what it looks like okay it's
like super super liquid you can see that
crazy crazy crazy liquidy so I'm going
to start with the right side of my face
and hopefully this particular shade
doesn't oxidize the way that did the 0.5
shade from the all-nighter foundation
did so I'm just start with about that
much that was like about a pump I would
say there's a little bit of air into so
I kind of had to
there for a second but let's go ahead
and apply that in circular motions like
they recommend with the brush see I
already can see like little dry patches
I don't like circular motions so I'm
just going to do the downward stroke
emotions with my brush I just have to
because it's just the way it looks the
best on my skin
personally I have already put my skin
care on I did already moisturize my skin
I put my serum on my toner everything
okay so that shade actually looks really
really nice on my particular skin tone
it seems to be a really good color match
it does look a little dry in this area
and I have heard that people who have
dry skin can kind of cling to dry
patches a little bit so I'm guessing I'm
probably going to prefer the sponge side
but I am going to go ahead and try and
build that up a little bit I'll take
another little like pump of this and I
am going to put that underneath my eye
area I want to see how it will go
underneath the eyes as well as on the
eye lid just kind of tapping that in it
definitely has like Adam a pecan sort of
flip to it I can immediately kind of
feel that but really nice light pretty
coverage it does say it's supposed to
like blur out wrinkles and things like
that I don't know about that but it does
have a really nice almost like water
like consistency to it and I think for
the most part it actually looks really
pretty on the skin so there is a side
without the foundation in here as a side
with the foundation actually look what
it did underneath my eye a lot it
actually looks really pretty under there
and as long as the shade doesn't oxidize
I think we are good as far as that is
concerned so I'm going to build that up
just a little more because I want to see
if I can build I have heard that this
one is quite buildable in coverage so
kind of concentrating it in the area
where I need the most coverage which is
around this area in my geez all lines
and we will see if we can build that a
little more I like the way that it's
going on like this I immediately saw
when I started buffing in circular
motions that it looks
super super um it just looked very very
dry on the skin and that is something
that I noticed when I'm like pushing all
the hairs up on my face and doing
circular motions it doesn't look as good
so there is I do notice a little bit of
dry patches in this area but for the
most part I think that gave a nice even
amount of coverage it feels so
lightweight yeah it just feels like
nothing on the skin which is awesome so
let's go ahead and apply to the other
side now I'm going to take another like
pump with that this was half a pump I
should say and we will see how it does
with the damp sponge and very very
curious I usually like and prefer
foundation applied with the damp langsam
let's see how it does yes see I can
immediately see that I like the way that
looks with the sponge the sponge just
apply foundation beautifully it always
does in my opinion alright so there's
about half a pump snow like dryness
whatsoever
creeping up you can see here got a
little dry on this side I don't see that
whatsoever I do think this is a nice
shade match and maybe leaning a little
more on the warm tone side but it looks
pretty darn good when we build that
around here again one more time
little around my nose area as well and
then also around my eye see how that did
I feel like you did really nicely on the
right hand side with my eye area so that
is awesome yeah definitely preferring at
the sponge side I don't know if you guys
can see a difference but I clearly can
it looks very very pretty and smooth on
this side when you turn the sponge
around and get underneath my eye area
getting into my nose pores quite nicely
as well okay so I definitely prefer a V
side with these sponge so I'm just going
to finish off the side of my face with
the sponge really quickly just because I
can tell right away that I definitely
prefer it with the sponge just gives a
really nice even application
and make sure that nothing is looking
too dry so that is about one of the half
pumps on each side of my face I'm
getting the feeling that this is
buildable but not crazy crazy buildable
like everyone says so um just wipe down
my lips quickly this is what it is
looking like let me zoom you guys in a
little further so this is what it is
looking like I think it looks really
really nice on the skin over here got a
little dry my forehead has been very
very dry lately but that is what it is
looking like I am going to set it in
with a powder I'm going to use my
Catrice cosmetics Primus line mattifying
powder mostly going to concentrate
around my cheese zone and my eye area to
make sure that is completely set in and
I am just stippling this powder on with
my target air buffer foundation brush so
like I said mostly my t-zone going to
kind of leave my forehead area alone so
that I'm not drawing out excess dryness
if that makes sense but I'm going to set
in my cheek area and we will see how
this way throughout the day so I will be
back in about 8 hours let me show you
guys what time it is currently it is the
afternoon here I actually don't go into
work until 2:00 p.m. so I show you guys
what time it is and I'll leave here
probably in about 15 minutes I don't
technically teach my next class until
2:30 but I like to leave early if I am
really bad at driving but anyway here is
what the foundation is looking like so
here's the side with the sponge I
definitely prefer that and then here is
the side with the brush I think it looks
really pretty very natural because if
you like anything on the skin if you
like a water foundation so it is
currently one of 40 I will be back in
two eight hours to check in with you
guys and show you how everything is
wearing but so far so good I like the
way it looks on my skin might think it
looks really really beautiful color
matches good so far so yeah that is
pretty much it thank you so much for
joining me guys and I will see you in
eight hours bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
