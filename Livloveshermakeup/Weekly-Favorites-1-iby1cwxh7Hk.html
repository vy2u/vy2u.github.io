for this video I've been asking well no
I wasn't actually asking people were
commenting that they would like to see
me do monthly or weekly favorites videos
what most people were just saying can
you start doing favorites videos and I
thought okay do you want to see monthly
or weekly and you guys said weakly so
that is what I'm doing this is my first
weekly favorite the video I'm not going
to have a set a certain like day of the
week that i'll be posting these it
probably would go up on you know
Saturday's or Sundays whatever you guys
know that the day that I film is the day
that my videos go up usually I'm
depending on you know if I'm on vacation
if I'm you know whatever sometimes they
do pre film stuff and sometimes I just
post like six at a time so anyway um
this you know most of them I don't want
to say oh they'll be up every single
Friday or like I don't want to call them
like Sunday favorites or something like
that because I'm who know you know life
happens so but i do want to consistently
do this or hopefully so we'll see how it
goes and like i said if i miss a week or
something like that please forgive me um
you know maybe because i was on vacation
or something or whatever um so anyway
let's just get started so this is um
this week's favorites yes this week's
weekly favorites so let's get started
and I have a lot of makeup stuff I have
one hair care a few miscellaneous things
an edible items um a book just stuff
like that and yeah let's just get
started up first I want to say my
favorite youtuber of the week because I
tend to like get hooked on people's
videos I'll be watching then I tend to
get hooked and I have been loving David
so comedy um this week on YouTube he is
so hilarious like just to subscribe to
him he is an asian and he's comedian
he's a comedian and he's just hilarious
he is just so funny so i'll post his
channel below he's got like a million
subscribers he doesn't need me telling
people to go watch his videos but he is
hilarious my boyfriend and i have been
watching him and we love him so that is
my favorite youtuber of the week
and let's move into I guess we'll start
with makeup so I have been loving um
recently this whole week I have been
back on my ELF tone correcting powder
and cool i love this for setting my
foundation you guys I've tried so much
stuff I like translucent powders and
whatnot today I always come back to this
it has this like four little quadrants
of quadrants of color you get like a
green a blue a yellow and a pink and
it's just color correcting and it's so
beautiful it's so finely milled I just
love the way it looks I am wearing it
today and I just think it sets my
foundation so beautifully no matter what
foundation I wear and it's only three
dollars so i'm back on that bandwagon i
picked this up from target about a week
ago was it yeah it was last week so i've
been using it all this week love it just
it's so good umm al acabo that i have
been loving this week and I am brain
right now I don't know if you guys can
tell it might have come off but um I've
been loving wearing the benefit Posie
tint on my lips which is this cute
little bright pink color right here it's
a tin so it you know tints my lips and
then once it dries I've been loving at
topping it with this Victoria's Secret
um lip balm in pink sugar i recently
picked this up again it was last week so
i've been using a lot of those products
that I've gotten the past couple videos
from you know last week or the week
before using those a lot this week and I
just love this one so it smells like
mint and it is gorgeous I just love that
color so the combination of these two
the tint and then this on top just
leaves my lips looking so nice it just
feels so good it smells good and I just
love the combination of kind of the
warmer pink with the cooler pink it is
so good you guys I love it okay my
favorite foundation and foundation brush
this week something that I've just been
wearing over and over I usually like to
switch up normally during the week I
switch up my foundation a lot so when i
saw that i was using these two products
a lot this week i knew i had to include
it i have been using a lot a lot a lot
of my mac studio sculpt SPF 50
foundation even though it looks like i
haven't used any of it i am in NC 15 and
i have just been really really liking
this and I have
only been applying it with this crown
brush from crown brushes it is the C 453
brush it's like a tapered kabuki
basically I normally love like my Beauty
Blender and sponges for applying
foundation but you guys this combination
has been great i am writing it today um
i apply like a squeeze of this on the
back of my hand take it Pat it all over
my face and then i blend it in and it's
so easy so quick and i just love um but
look that it gives my skin so that has
definitely been a favorite have been
wearing that every single time i put on
makeup this week so yeah um the one hair
products that i'm talking about this
week i am using it today um it does
leave a little bit of a white cast in
the hair but you just have to really
make sure that you like rub it in it
this is the Pantene pro-v root reboot
dry shampoo this is very similar to what
is it bumbling bumbles planta powder
which is like a powder that you put in
it gives a lot of texture and a lot of
hold to the hair this is like not like
the batiste formula or anything like
that it's not soft it will make your
hair it like sticky like a little bit of
grip so it's like a hairspray and a dry
shampoo mixed into one it gives a lot of
volume I just love it it smells great
and i love it for second day hair which
i have today i wash my hair every other
day so when I have second day hair and
always wearing it up and that is what I
like to use this for I do not like to
use it when my hair is down just because
it just leaves like a sticky feeling and
I don't like that but when my hair is up
I have been using this so I've been
loving that this week a best product
that i've been loving that i got last
week and i've already used quite a lot
you can see this is the philosophy pink
frosted animal cracker shampoo shower
gel and bubble bath i have used it as
the shower gel so far and a bubble bath
and this week specifically i've only
been using it as they bubble back every
other day i've been using this as a
bubble bath I know that's crazy but
literally I've done it with three or
four times this week already so this has
been a favorite bubble bath for sure it
smells so good um it does make really
nice bubbles that like they're very like
soft and fluffy and it's not like the
bathroom
works bubbles where they sit in there
forever like these ones eventually kind
of go down so you can get out and you
don't feel like you have like excess
bubbles all over your body so I really
really like it um you know as a shower
gel it's just ok it doesn't lather
amazingly but as a bubble bath it is
awesome so been lovin that another
skincare item this is called semaine G
this is a bio silver pearl cream with
Chinese herbs um my boyfriend is Chinese
and his mom I've got both me and him him
and I um a little tub of this cream so
what you do is you can see like there's
a little like pearls in it so um you
take this little spatula which is so
cute and you pull out um one of the
pearls like one of the little white
bubbles in there and the surrounding gel
so there's like the little white bubbles
and then you have the jela rounded you
mix them together with your hands really
really well or on the back of your hands
till they are completely like absorbed
into each other um are not absorbed into
each other but tell me are completely
mixed together and then you apply it to
your face and it really really is nice
it has a really interesting kind of
herbal scent if you're not into early
since you will not like this but I've
been loving this during the day i'm not
as a nighttime moisturizer for
definitely during the day i find that it
kind of mattifies my skin a little bit
and it's been helping with like
breakouts and things like that so really
really loving that samin g bio silver
pearl cream another skincare item that i
have been loving again purchased this
last week this is the formula 1006 deep
down detox ultra cleansing mud mask with
orange and bergamot this is amazing this
mask this whole thing was like under ten
dollars and I just love this it's one of
those um smells really good and it's one
of those mud mask that really draws out
like impurities and it's just so nice
because it's not too drying you know
there are certain mud masks that are
like so drawing it's like I can't feel
my face like it starts to feel itchy and
even if you smile Oh starts like
cracking off that's not this like this
stays pretty if you put like a really
thick layer on it will actually stay
pretty moist on your skin
um but if you just put a thin layer on
it will like hard enough but not too
much so I've been loving it I love the
scent I love the way my skin looks after
and I just love the way it makes my skin
feel it says this super cleansing detox
max cleanses impurities for a clearer
brighter complexion the energy of orange
recharges while sea salt cleanses and
bergamot balances your face will notice
the difference so definitely go check
out these um formula 1006 masks um I
also picked up another one last week
that I haven't really been using I use
this I think three times this week so
this has been my go to Mass this whole
week but the other one I picked up I
only have tried once so I can't really
say if it's like a favorite yet but it
was quite nice but definitely go and
check these out at ulta this is some
really nice line so been likened that a
lot the next thing is oh and I forgot to
make up items over here this is all over
the place so we got some makeup and all
that stuff sorry I'm not grooving it
together very well but next I'm going to
talk about a toothpaste this was
actually my boyfriend's toothpaste and I
do not know if he knows i'm using this
but um this is the Thera pref dentist
recommended fresh fresh breath
toothpaste it says it works instantly on
bad breath controls dry mouth symptoms
with soothing aloe vera and no
detergents 24-hour confidence guaranteed
and it's naturally oxygenating and I
have been loving that I'm the only thing
I look for in a toothpaste is that it
tastes good and I have noticed that I
just love this one tastes really good
it's um in fresh mint flavor this one
tastes great but I really really like
the oxygen oxygen ating like formula
like it just like disappears in your
mouth almost but it like least your
teeth clean so I'm really really liking
this it doesn't have any whitening
effects or anything like that I don't
actually use like you know I'm not into
using toothpaste or mouthwash that white
and I don't really think they do that
great of a job so this doesn't whitener
anything but i highly recommend if you
do suffer from like dry mouth sometimes
a little when lighting just went crazy
if you do suffer from dry mouth
sometimes i personally do i take
medications that give me dry mouth but I
loving this so ya gonna have to order
another one because my boyfriend is
going to be like what is happening
where's all my toothpaste going um next
another makeup product um it is what I
learned today on my eyelashes this is
the laura mercier extra lash sculpting
mascara in black onyx and I've just been
loving it this has been my go-to mascara
this week it's got a really big wand but
sometimes they poke myself in the eye
with but it's just got this awesome like
sculpting kind of wand it's a you know
rubber bristle brush or applicator which
is my favorite and um you know two coats
gives me really really nice sculpted
lashes I really think they look sculpted
like they look very like refined and
just really really nice so then loving
at that mascara that has been a favorite
all week that is the only one i've been
using the blush i've been going to this
week is from wet and wild fergie the wet
and wild fergie collection this is the
center stage collection around the clock
blush in a 158 rush with destiny it's a
really gorgeous kind of neutral a peachy
color and it does have a little flecks
of gold shimmer in it I am wearing it
today you probably can't really tell
because I really like to dust it on
lightly whether it be able today i have
it on lightly you can really build it up
but today I put it on with a stippling
brush and I think it just gives like
it's like a barely-there a kind of color
um it does kick up a lot of product when
you brush you know your brush in it when
you brush your brush in it when you
swipe your brush in it it kicks up a lot
of product however I just really like
the color and it does stay on the cheeks
for a long time so that has been my
go-to blush this week and my go-to
highlighter I'm a product I've been re
loving over and over again is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in
ethereal light just been loving this
it's a cool toned white powder i am
writing it today you can barely tell
like it's such a barely-there highlight
but it's just absolutely amazing so I've
been loving that this week that's what
I've been doing is my highlight and
let's move on to my favorite book this
we
I just started it this is delirium I
started this like four months ago and
then I stopped and so I had to restart
because I didn't remember what page I
was on I just wanted to like we put it
in my head of what was going on so
delirium really really good i've been
loving it um it's just it's a really
good story i highly recommend going to
the bookstore or going online kindle
whatever you read off of and checking
out the back and see if we're interested
in that kind of story and the last thing
i have is food-related it just comes in
this big bag like this this is the easy
to carry level um one two three four
five five different like on the go
potato chip things there's 20 single
bags in here and this is the bold mix so
you get four bags of onions for big the
blaze salt and vinegar four bags of
Doritos spicy sweet chili four bags of
cheetos flaming hot and four bags of
spicy nacho I have been really really
liking these I use these I mean it's
crazy right like you know I feel like
I'm so crazy but yes I ate all of these
in a week so 20 bags significa I know
it's a lot but these were so good I
really really like bold flavor like salt
and vinegar Lainey hi you know all that
kind of stuff so you think these of it
like Walmart or Target and you even have
this little thing here because it's so
heavy you can carry it like a little
first so that has been a food favorite
for me and this weekend so yeah those
are my favorites for the week I hope you
