thank you so much for joining me I'm
looking down and I have so much stuff to
show you guys um this is going to be my
weekly favorite videos I've to show you
guys what kind of products and makeup
I've been loving and whatnot so I'm
actually going to start with some bath
products I'm going to do it a different
way this time I normally start with
makeup but um I have a lot of like baths
and skincare stuff so I thought I stare
at them this time so the first thing
I've been loving is this Freeman facial
clay mask in mint and lemon it clears
breakups and minimizes the appearance of
pores I really really love this has been
so nice i can breaking out this week and
it just smells so good and it gives like
this really like mint and lemon have
this wonderful like scent and it's just
very like invigorating I don't know it
feels really great on the skin it does
dry completely and it hardens up but it
really really pulls impurities out of
the pores and helps clear break out so
I've been loving that product the next
one I've been loving is a moisturizer
this is the clinic dramatically
different moisturizing lotion I use this
in the morning after my serum really
been liking this it does have a bit of
like a weird medicinal not decimal guys
look like a doctor's office I don't know
I don't know if it's gone bad or
something but it felt a little funky but
I really really like this that has a
wonderful texture and if you are
experiencing like breakouts or something
like that this will not like clog your
pores or irritated even more it's just
the right amount of moisture not too
heavy and not um you know like to shear
or like it's not that it's not
moisturizing enough it's not that it's
not it's the perfect moisturizer not too
greasy not too heavy but it has some not
too sheer did you get that I hope you
got that mess so yeah that's what this
is I really really love that I've been
using that in the morning next is the
victoria's secret pink warm and cozy
body mist I have this on today it is
very warm and cozy it's a wonderful
scent I love the packaging I think it's
so pretty it's like this nice light baby
pink kind of coral color and it smells
so good it really smells a lot like
coconuts and vanilla and just like very
very nice warm scent so then loving that
this week another product from
victoria's secret that i've been using
in the shower
the mango temptation smoothing body
scrub I absolutely love this I use body
scrubs once a week but this one smells
so good if you really really love like
sweet smelling things you will love the
mango temptation sent from Victoria's
Secret it is awesome I really need to
pick up like the body wash in this I
have the bot like the body spray and of
course they have this body scrub but I
need to pick up like something else so
that I can have it in the shower like
one of their oops my hair is let's stick
it up so I can have one of their body
washes to which I've never tried it are
there really good though but um the
scent is just fabulous if you love
really really sweet smelling things you
will love this make mango temptation
sent it is mango nectar and hibiscus and
I really really like the texture of the
scrub it does not leave me oil II actor
I do not like scrubs that leave me oily
in the shower after or like oily ones
that get out of the shower that makes
sense like they leave like that layer of
oil a lot of people like that from
moisturizing properties but I don't I
like to just have the scrub and rinse it
off and be done with it and not have any
like oily residue um but this is really
nice because it doesn't do that at but
the only thing I don't like is that it's
kind of small little tube like I've only
used this twice and the next time i use
it is like the third time i'll probably
be out so that kind of sucks but if you
get them on sale it is worth it so it
smells really good highly recommend the
next product is from true blue spa this
is part of like a this is the line that
you can get at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and
this is the shade cashmere hair
conditioner with cashmere extract I
actually don't notice anything
remarkable with this um I I don't know
my hair is very dirty today so I can't
really say I have a lot of dry shampoo
in there like there's a lot more texture
in there than normal because I wash my
hair what like a day and a half ago or
yeah not last night with the day before
and my hair is always more textured the
day um after washing my hair but this is
an ok conditioner it doesn't make my
hair super silky or anything like that
but I do notice it detangles well so it
is thick it's like a nice thick
consistency in a dusty tank oh well I do
like that
but the one thing I love about this is
he sent it smells like amaretto or
amaretti cookies I don't know if you've
ever had those but it's like a mix of
almond and vanilla oh my gosh and it
just smells so good so I've been loving
using it because of the sex so that is
really the only thing I love about it
but um I don't know I don't know if that
can be considered like a weekly favorite
because I just love the scent but that
is what I love about it and the last
grab product i've been using as a bubble
bath it is the bath and body works
aromatherapy stress relief body wash and
foam bath in sandalwood Rose like i said
i've been using it as a bubble bath and
it sends relax and unwind Santa wit
essential oil relaxes and soothes the
mind while Rose essential oil comes to
bring balance and harmony and it smells
so good this is one of the best smelling
aromatherapy products that they had from
their line I got this like a year a half
ago I think this is discontinued um
about the body which is good at like
bringing back sense sometimes they bring
them back even though like uh people are
like oh I just continued them or like
they don't sell them anymore but they
are going to bring them back I think
this is one of those old school ones
that they did bring back like a year and
a half ago and I should have picked up
more because this is a wonderful
wonderful aroma therapies bag it is so
good it really smells like the rose and
the Santa would like mixed together is
just such an intoxicating scent and it's
very like mature it's a very mature sent
like I feel like that the body works
used to be um I don't know I it used to
be for everyone even like what we've no
women in their 30 s and 40 that it still
is like I don't mean it like that but
what I mean is it seems like it's gotten
so much more like I don't want to say
childish but everything is sweet
smelling now you know what I mean I feel
like there's not enough of these kind of
old-school sense that they still have
like Santa woodrows I feel like they
just come out with sweet smelling stuff
and the packaging is always really like
bright and out there and I like that a
lot but this is more like something that
I could see anybody shower versus like
someone's bubble bath i have from them
to have like adorable little designs on
them and things like that i really love
it but i could see how
people might not like that and I don't
know this is just a more mature
packaging and more of a mature sent and
it's not too sweet and it's just I feel
like a lot of people would like this so
I do hope that they bring this back and
I can pick up some more of these I did
get them when they were on when they do
like their big blowout sale twice a year
that's when I got this I can do with ya
two years a year and a half ago or two
years ago during the springtime so
definitely if you see this definitely
pick up the sandalwood Rose scent it is
absolutely wonderful you can see a lot
of people licking that um the next thing
I want to talk about is an oil and this
is actually what I've been mixing with
my foundation this week I might as well
just show you guys so I have been
wearing the Loreal infallible Pro matte
this week which I love and I am in shade
101 classic ivory this is like a
rediscovered favorite this is a little
bit of like a thicker formula and it has
really really great coverage but I
notice if i mix one drop of the josie
maran one hundred percent pure argan oil
light with it it just gives the most
flawless or just like finish to the skin
it's like a demi maps sort of finished
so I absolutely love those two together
um and let's see here at night I have
been wearing the luggage water sleeping
mask basically all week I sometimes pop
to underneath the clinic um typically
get out and if the equity solutions 1%
sounds cilic acne gel and then I apply
this on top I really love this it smells
so good and it's just like an overnight
gel sleeping mask and it delivers like a
lot of moisture to the skin and my skin
just feels really really supple and nice
when I wake up in the morning so that is
what I've been wearing to bed and then
I'm two products over here and i have
been using the estee lauder enlighten a
dark spot correcting night serum I
really like this it smells really good i
actually only use it during the day it's
okay it doesn't have any ingredients
that are like going to make you son
sensitive but it's really really nice
and um cute little packages like a
little deluxe I CFO but it smells really
good I do tend to like like a lot of
serums I guess you could say but I
haven't found like my holy grail but
this one is really really good so I may
actually pick up a full size of this
have really been loving that this week
and I do notice that it is helping with
hyper pigmentation that i have here like
below my cheekbones and then for
cleansing my face in the morning I've
been loving the glam glow super cleanse
this is the daily clearing cleanser I
have been breaking out this week so this
has been amazing this is just like a
hundred point perk that i got from
sephora but it's really really good it
smells a little bit like black licorice
and like mint so if you don't like the
smell of mint or black licorice you
probably won't like this I don't love
black licorice what I do like mint but
I'm really really nice at clearing the
skin and it just kind of foams up and
it's really great so been loving that
all right those are all like the
skincare sort of items um baths all that
stuff I'm going to get into makeup now
so I can show you guys out of the way so
the first thing I've been loving has
been my to face the little black book of
bronzers I have just been playing with
this all week I've been using a lot of
milk chocolate Soleil and chocolate
Soleil which are right there but all of
these are fantastic you get a big
variety they have beach bunny Endless
Summer Sun buddy milk chocolate Soleil
chocolate slip so they son pony dark
chocolate Soleil and pink leopard so you
get a mix of maps and shimmers and it's
just so easy to use and fun and I don't
know I'm just really loving it and I
love those chocolate Soleil bronzers men
do they smell good they really do smell
good alright on my eyes I was getting a
lot of questions towards the beginning
of the week about what I was wearing on
my eyes for eyeshadow it was the to face
the return of sexy palette and I was
pairing it with certain eyeliners and
things like that but this is what the
palette looks like these are so so
buttery and like smooth they're almost
so buttery that you have to be like
careful because you do get a lot of like
fallout with them but really nice kind
of like smokey colors and I was seeing a
lot of questions about the eyeshadow
that I was wearing and I promised to
start doing some tutorials once my baby
rumors all together but um that is the
palette that I have been wearing the
whole week if you've seen any eyeshadow
looks from this week it is from the
two-faced return of sexy palette it is
just absolutely gorgeous just be careful
for fallout with these guys because they
are so plentiful and smooth and creamy
and buttery soft I the past two days
have not been wearing any eyeshadow
actually I was basically through the
whole week you know Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday yeah really just
friday saturday on my cat passed away
and i just want to say thank you so much
to everybody who sent me a really really
sweet message I really really appreciate
that you know it was very hard for me
with lily and but the past couple days I
haven't been wearing as much eye makeup
honestly I've been crying a lot and it's
just one of those things like I just
don't like having tons of eyeshadow on
it all that kind of stuff the day that I
had to go in and put her down I was
actually wearing one of the smoky eyes
are like smokey quadrants of this
palette this one right here all over my
eyes and I looked like such a mess when
I got home and which is totally
understandable but at the same time I
think that and it all towards the end of
the week I just I could wearing just
mascara because you know I've been
crying and things like that so I just
don't want to look like you know I got
punched in the face or something like
that because they just give everywhere
you know and these are not waterproof so
but anyway if you saw any video towards
the beginning of the week I was getting
asked can you do it tutorial on this
look and things like that all of the
eyeshadows were from this palette yeah
love that palette for primer I've been
loving my stila aqua glow perfecting
primer this is amazing it's so pretty
such a nice little sleek packaging and
it's just so cooling and so nice it's
like a stiff formula it is so quick to
put on you just apply it all over you
can put it underneath your eyes on your
eyelids everywhere and it's just
wonderful like I am just obsessed or
shipping it is just it's so good so I
absolutely love that I do have a review
for that so you can look under my review
playlist if you want to find that and
then phillipps I've been wearing
different combinations so right now i am
wearing the elf pout Perfector and it
looks like this it's really really nice
it's just got this like ma be sparkly
purple e a like glitter thing going on I
don't know if you guys can even tell
it's right there so it doesn't really
have like color to it but it really just
makes your lips look like poo like
really really big and nice so I have
been loving that I've been wearing that
mostly when I've been wearing
like the little gold quadrant of the
return of sexy palette it looks really
nice with the goals and things like that
is very neutral and then I've been
living the elf conditioning lip balm in
blissful Barry it looks like that it's
really really gorgeous and i have been
carrying it if you've seen me with a
dark lip this week i've been wearing the
knicks intense butter gloss in toasted
marshmallow on top of that so really
really pretty kind of deep berry colors
right there and then the last little lip
product i've been using and i can't even
find it where'd it go oh my gosh maybe I
didn't get it out of my purse but um it
is like this beautiful beautiful it's
the revlon colorburst lip lacquer bomb
in whimsical it's like this beautiful
berry color and it's just perfect for
fall I love it for mascara this week
I've really just been combining two I've
been wearing my voluminous miss manga
rock and then I've been going on top of
it with the Too Faced size queen mascara
which has like a huge brush and I hate
using this alone I only like it for
topping other mascaras because the wand
is so freaking huge um kids my language
but seriously a huge so um yeah but I
like the combination of the two of those
it really does kind of give it a little
extra volume after you applied another
mascara so been wearing those two this
week and then for eyeliners I've been
loving my stila smudge stick waterproof
eyeliner and guilted which is kind of
like a Goldie brownish sort of color
right there really really pretty I've
been popping that in my waterline and
also on my tight line and then I've also
been loving my physicians formula custom
I enhancing eyeliner trio or this is the
office for blue eyes it comes in the
little blue eyes eyeliner trio and that
is right there so this one's a little
more cool town this one's a little more
warm toned a little more gold there
really really beautiful than popping
both of these in my waterline on
different days to set my lorry oh I'm
infallible Pro matte I've been using
this Revlon age-defying powder in 05
light
she really liked this it is a very very
powdery like it kicks up all over the
place but it's actually remarkably like
finely milled even though like it picks
up so much product like it really really
does affect on your face with a nicely
so do like that and then for highlights
I've been loving my blush beam from Pat
beauty and I don't use this as a blush
because it is so like it's so sparkly
but this is in bloom beam and it looks
like that and I just mix my brush
together and I did a gorgeous gorgeous
color that looks something like that so
really really shiny and pretty and I
just think it's gorgeous super super
pretty love that and let's see here Oh
an eye cream I guess this should have
gone in my skin care but I'm eye cream
that I've been using in the morning is
the olay total effects 7 in 1 CC eye
brightening cream it looks like this and
I like it because it's got this like um
tint to it oh my god I can't open it I
can't open it but it's got this kind of
like pinky yellow a tint to it and in
fact this like color correcting thing
going on in there so it's great during
the day you don't need to wear it at
night unless you want to look remarkably
good while going to bed at night but I
just like to wear it during the day
because it's got like the color
correcting thing going on so it's really
nice at covering any kind of dark
circles things like that and then the
last thing I have been loving this week
has been my tart blush palette from last
year and I did recently pick up the new
one for this year so i will be reviewing
it sometime this coming week so
definitely stay tuned for that but this
was from last year and i've just been
playing with this and loving it I mean
you just get so many colors in here I've
been playing with all sorts of different
ones they're just beautiful you get like
a nice light nude bright pink coral
deeper colors I've been especially
loving this one right here and this one
right here very like perfect sort of
fall colors they're so gorgeous you guys
and they just go on so nicely and I love
that Amazonian clay formula they're just
so good that's what the
to look like and they're perfect for
fall and I love travelling about this
palette like one of my favorites to
travel with so definitely stay tuned if
you want to see the one from this year
because I did pick that up and playing
with that as well but anyway those were
my favorites for this week makeup
skincare beauty shower all that kind of
stuff I hope you guys enjoyed this oh my
