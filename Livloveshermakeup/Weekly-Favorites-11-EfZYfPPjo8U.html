sunday thank you so much for joining me
i really appreciate it i will be sharing
my weekly favorites with you guys today
since it is sunday so let's just get
right into it i'm gonna start with
makeup and i will start with primers so
the first timer i've been loving this
week is of the eye primer and this is
the Milani eye primer so this is the
Milani eyeshadow primer it says it's
lightweight invisible finish and works
on all skin tones I love this it is
amazing it really really makes your
shadows stay like all day and it's just
awesome I think it really is a dupe for
the original Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer so if you are looking for a dupe
at the drugstore this one is really
really good alright next i have been
loving for my face these primers right
here this is the Korres or coors Greek
yogurt nourishing primer this one is
really really nice and I have also been
loving the cover FX calming primer
really really liking both of these they
both smell a little funky honestly which
is kind of weird they both just don't
smell very good but they're very very
nourishing they're very um I don't know
that I feel like it gives something to
my skin like this one really really does
calm down any kind of inflammation and
this one is very nourishing they have
very like voice rising properties they
don't have any kind of silicones or
anything in them they're just one of
those primers that just kind of put like
moisture back into your skin so I have
been loving those two for my face
primers this week next I have been
loving at this Too Faced lip insurance
original Demi matte anti feathering lip
primer one of my subscribers recommended
I get this and I picked it up and I got
it last weekend so I have been using it
this whole week and I love it I use it
on basically what I do is I put this on
first let me share this with you guys
the fun to lip smacker this isn't the
orange one this is just something that I
put on before I'm going to be putting
this on and then eventually I put on
like my other lip products like the
color i'll be wearing on my lips that
day but what I do is I start with this
because the two-faced lip insurance can
be a little it's like a demi mad so it
kind of came
a little drawing so I'd like to start
out with a lip balm so I've been loving
the fon 21 from lip smackers and then I
put on the lip insurance and then I put
on whatever you know lip products I've
been wearing this week or whatever week
and I just love it it really really
makes um whatever lip color I'm wearing
stay on that much longer and it really
really helps it to just last all day so
really really love that um let's see
here now I'll just go into the lip
products that i have been wearing this
week and loving I've been loving this
wet and wild mega last what is this
these are those liquid lip colors and
this one is in 928 a pocket full of
roses it is a gorgeous gorgeous sort of
neutrally dusty rosy color not even
dusty it's really is more rosy but it
has tons and tons of silver shimmer and
these last all day long especially with
that lip primer underneath they last all
day long so I really love that when I've
been wanting a more natural kind of
neutral lip I've been wearing the bare
minerals marvelous Moxie I mean spark
plug mmm it looks like this really
really pretty again this is more like a
neutrally kind of dusty rose color and
it's really gorgeous it's got a lot a
lot Abe a lot of silver shimmer in it as
well so I've been loving that and then
the last lip product i've been loving
this week i got this in my glossybox
last week i unboxed for you guys this is
these sticks cosmetics lipstick in mauve
and it's so cool it's got this really
interesting packaging you're supposed to
be able to pop this open with one hand
and then just kind of put it up and put
it on but this is a gorgeous gorgeous
like raspberry sort of plum color and
it's just it's beautiful on the you know
on the lips it really looks more like
raspberry and I love raspberry colors on
my lips so really really been loving
that alright for highlighter I've been
loving my Too Faced candlelight glow
this is a highlighting powder duo it
looks like this really really cute outer
packaging and the packaging inside is
really cute to you get two colors you
get a pink color and a kind of goldish
color on the other side I actually swirl
them both together which is why they
look kind of mixed
and I just apply them I'm wearing that
today and it's so beautiful um it just
gives this gorgeous gorgeous all over
sort of I don't even know how to sorry
guys haha do you ever do that where
you're like showing a product and then
you see there's a mirror and you're like
ooh oh that lip color looks a little
weird right now but anyway I swirled
them together and it just gives this
beautiful pinky golden sort of glow to
the skin so love that for highlighting
okay blush wise I've been loving this
one this is also from my glossybox this
is the meat and meat a makeup artist
color powder blush in 108 it is this
gorgeous gorgeous like terracotta sort
of color it is really really pigmented
so I use this with a stippling brush and
it just gives that really really
terracotta kind of deep deep fall pretty
pretty look on the cheeks another one
I've been loving for more pinky um
cheeks is the true match from l'oreal
l'oreal true match super blendable blush
this is in rosy outlook this is more of
your pinky sort of color and it's got a
lot of silver shimmer in it that's also
really beautiful loving that this week
and then for a more like peachy apricot
II sort of look on the cheeks I've been
loving the blush subtil palette from
Lancome and this one is in 126 nectar
lace and I have not been using the
bronzer or the highlighter just that
middle shade right there but it is a
gorgeous gorgeous like a nectar apricot
shade with tons and tons of gold shimmer
in it so loving those blushes this week
let's see here to set my makeup I've
been loving the NYX matte finish long
lasting setting spray i showed the dewy
finish one last week that i really loved
this week i've been going for this one
it really does kind of mattify you and
just keeps your makeup on all day
concealer the Maybelline master
concealed by face studio in 10 fair this
is amazing under the eyes I take it
under the eyes all the way down to my
nostrils and then up in the triangle and
it's just gorgeous it really lightens
everything up it covers any dark circles
it's
and then foundation wise I've been
loving this cover girl what is the CG
smoothers hydrating makeup my shade is
705 ivory it looks like this is like
their old school this has been out
forever but I've been loving this this
week you know I it's one of those
products that you wear on your skin and
it's your natural skin doesn't really
show through it actually has a very good
coverage but it looks like skin like it
doesn't look like you're wearing
foundation and um I think that that's
really nice my boyfriend one night was
like hugging me and I normally get like
foundation all over like his black
shirts and stuff so I'm like oh no watch
out cuz like I went like that and he was
like what you're not wearing face makeup
and i said no i actually am so that was
kind of impressive that it really really
does look like skin it just kind of
evens out your complexion really nicely
so I've been loving that this week um
mascara I have been loving this wet and
wild max volume plus mascara this gives
the very very this gives a very very
natural look to your lashes so if you're
into that you'd probably like that I've
been just doing one coat every single
day this week and I've really been
enjoying it I'm one of those girls who
goes back and forth between loving
really clumpy lashes and liking really
natural lashes and this week it has just
been a natural lash kind of week this is
what the wand looks like it's a rubber
bristle wand and it's kind of shaped
like an hourglass or like a pair and I
just love it it's great it really really
is a nice formula and it does last all
day it doesn't smudge alright for
eyeshadow this week I have been using my
little tart palette here this is the
golden days and sultry nights Amazonian
clay collectors shadow palette and this
is what it looks like on the inside and
the shades that I've been using in here
mostly are those two matte colors over
here I've been using that white collar
all over my lid and my brow bone and
then using that kind of cooler toned
it's kind of like a transition color are
just putting that into my crease and
then today I did follow up by putting
that in my crease as well but mostly
I've just been using those two shades
and the deep one here I haven't used too
much of those colored shades except
today I am where
um the blue one on my lower lashline
this kind of gorgeous blue color that
has tons and tons of gold shimmer in it
and I'm wearing that on top of the Stila
Sparkle waterproof liquid eyeliner in
Bora Bora in case you guys are wondering
so I just like this palette because you
can go really really neutral with it
really natural or you can do like a pop
of color so it loving that and that is
it for makeup alright moving on let's
get into skincare on favorite face wash
this week has been my cleaning clear
morning burst facial cleanser you guys
have heard me talk about this before I
go back and forth between wearing
different are wearing different using
different cleansers like every single
week but this has been my favorite in
the morning I've just been loving that
it has bursting beads it wakes you up it
rinses clean with vitamin C and ginseng
and it really is refreshing love that at
night I have been using my clean and
clear advantage three-in-one exfoliating
cleanser this has five percent benzoyl
peroxide acne medication in it it
exfoliates the skin it treats pimples
and it helps prevent breakouts this is
really really nice i use this with my
clarisonic at night and it really helps
get like the little bumps and pimples
that you can get underneath the skin
I've been having a lot of those this
week just the kind that you get like
underneath the skin that are not you
know treatable with like salicylic acid
or something stuff that you can't pop so
it's been under the skin and it's just
really bugging me and that benzoyl
peroxide exfoliating cleanser has been
helping a lot let's see here for face
mask I've been loving my peter thomas
roth pumpkin enzyme mask this is an
enzymatic dermal resurfacer it's a
three-on-one intensive skin resurfacer
treatment it's got pumpkin enzyme it
peels with alpha hydroxy acid it's just
it's great it looks like this I probably
use this I would say two or three times
this week and it smells amazing it
smells like pumpkin so if you love the
scent of pumpkin you will love this but
it looks like that and basically what
you do is you put it on your skin and
then you kind of dampen your fingers
with water and start really kind of
scrubbing it into the skin if you have
sensitive skin this is not for you this
is for basically i would say every
single kind of skin except for us
sensitive because that enzyme with the
exfoliating particles in
here this has a double exfoliating
treatment in it so you have the enzymes
which eat off the top layer of the skin
and then you actually have a physical
exfoliator in there as well so you just
want to make sure that you're not you
know if you have sensitive skin you
definitely don't want to use this it
will burn it kind of starts tingling on
your face and those are the enzymes kind
of eating off the top layer of the skin
are not the top layer but you know what
i mean like they're eating off yeah
basically the top layer getting out that
dead skin cell off dead skin cells off
but um overall really really good I love
this it makes my skin so smooth and nice
and just pretty I think that has helped
a lot too with the little bumps that
I've had under the skin all right um for
moisturizer I've been using this
Neutrogena hydroboost water gel with
hyaluronic acid in the morning i love
this packaging and so pretty but this is
what it looks like it's really really
nice i do mix this with the i'll show
you guys in a second it smells so good
and it literally is like a water formula
like it moves around really easily and
it just feels really good it's really
nice and cooling if you just want a
light moisturizer or if you have like
oily skin a combination skin you'd
probably like this a lot I do mix this I
mention this like every week but just
because I literally mix this with every
single moisturizer I use in the morning
this is the polished choice resist
moisture renewal oil booster for dry and
very dry skin with ceramides and argan
oil and I mix two drops of this in with
my moisturizer in the morning I do that
every single week I just like to
sometimes throw it in there are weekly
favorites to remind you guys that I mix
it in um another product i've been
loving i've been loving to like Asian
skin care um agents can care brand I
found them on a whole look and they were
all under like the same page but this
one is I believe called creme more lab
from Marla see re mor la be this is an
aqua essence water fluid and you put
this on it's supposed to help with
anti-wrinkle whitening highly effective
hydrating I don't know I think it's a
korean brand but it looks like this and
what you're supposed to do is put this
on before you put on your serum and it's
just
like an extra step that you put in but
it really really can help like lighten
that hyperpigmentation it helps give
some extra hydration and I've really
really been loving it so I've been using
that before putting on my serum and then
another Asian skin care product that i
found that was also on that hautelook
page was the aromatica aromatica orange
cleansing sherbert I've been using this
at night to remove my makeup it is so
awesome you open it up and has like a
little spatula oh I can open it there we
go it's got this little spatula so you
can spoon out the products because it is
very thick and then has this little lid
thing and this is what the product looks
like and you guys it really smells like
orange sherbert and it smells so good
but this is what it looks like it's like
a I don't know it's like a solid but
then when you spoon it out and start
mixing it on your skin it turns into an
oil and then when you rinse off there is
no residue whatsoever no oily residue so
I absolutely love that this is going to
be I'm going to use this up completely
so you guys you know if you're wondering
what i'm using for the next couple of
weeks to remove my makeup it's probably
this um but it's so awesome it really
really removes all of my makeup I have
no issue with getting my makeup remover
off um you know waterproof um mascara is
a little trickier again this week I've
been wearing this wet and wild one so
it's been really easy to get off but um
when I have been wearing the past couple
weeks when I have been wearing um
waterproof I'm like I makeup waterproof
mascara waterproof mascara I've been
liking the physicians formula I makeup
remover lotion this is just one of those
nice little things that's easy to go
over on top of this after you've
cleansed your face if you still have
residue it's nice to go in with a little
squirt of this rub it into your eyes
it's really really nice it's like a
lotion it doesn't sting or burn it all
and then take it off with a cotton ball
so those two are really nice together
for removing makeup all right what have
I been wearing on my nails this week I
love this color I got this in my
glossybox last week this is the nail
Inc London in the shade uptown it is
just gorgeous it is a dusty rose
neutrally out kind of like a mob
undertone sort of shade absolutely love
that um I've been loving my paris hilton
perfume i love this perfume you guys it
smells so like legally blonde ask like I
feel really like preppy and girly when I
wear this but it smells so darn good
whom I just love it it smells so good if
you guys have never liked smelled it
smelled amazing I know it's like Paris
Hilton whatever but it really really
smells good all right uh-oh I have more
skin care products aight guys i spoke
too soon i went back into other things
too quickly and i've been loving the
benefit puff off I gel at this has been
in many favors before but I've been
loving this four in the morning as my
eye cream lovely lovely lovely at night
for a lip balm I've been loving my boots
extracts coconuts lip balm it says it
intensively moisturizes it has coconut
oil in it and it's just a really really
thin easy easy product to put on the
lips like the texture is so thin and
easy and it does have contains coconut
oil derived from the cocos nucifera on
that it just means it's coconut oil so
yeah really been loving that to treat my
lips another product from boots this is
the boots extracts mango body butter it
says it moisturizes and hydrates leaving
skin feeling soft and smooth I've been
loving this a lot it smells like mango
yogurt like really really good this is
what it looks like it's just a really
really thick product this is one of
these smaller sizes and the reason I've
been reaching for this this week is
because um I have combination skin that
during the summer I actually don't have
to moisturize my whole entire body I can
if I want to but there's no need for it
like I don't get super super dry but it
is the time of year now where it is
getting cooler it's about 50 degrees
here now in Wisconsin so it's gotten
pretty chilly pretty quickly I'm gonna
drop from like 8250 in like a week so
we're in the 50s now
and this has been great for those areas
where i start to get dry so by the time
winter is here like i would say by
November definitely by December I need
to wear a all over moisturizer on my
body at night time just to treat my skin
from being super dry but during it the
fall kind of funds like October you know
this kind of time of year I only start
to have like dry areas so like my elbows
right around my wrists start to get
really really dry where else like my
upper arms so this has been great
because it's this small little tub that
wouldn't last forever if I used it all
over my body but it's been great for
just kind of treating the spots that are
starting to get dry so really really
been loving that and then the final yes
this is the final skincare item I know
if I weren't doing a lot of skin care
stuff this week um this is the cuddly
resveratrol yes resveratrol that is what
it's called this is a night cream and
the reason i picked this up kind of long
story i know this video is already 18
minutes but i want to share it with you
guys anyway my boyfriend when he was in
medical school he had a teacher or a
professor that basically did like
research on this ingredient which is
arrest veux être risk for a try keep
want to say reverse at all but no its
resveratrol and he did like he's done
research on this he takes like
internally he takes it in like capsule
form and my boyfriend does too and my
boyfriend is going to be 32 soon and he
looks like he's in his like he looks
like he's 25 years old and this guy that
i had met who was his teacher when he
was in medical school i met him and he's
i believe in his 50s and he looks like
he's in his 30s so they take this
internally and i guess it's like a big
thing in the medical world and so when
we were in sephora the other day we saw
this and it had that ingredient in it
and we were like oh my gosh and he was
like i need to try that so i was like
let me buy it i will use it with you and
we have been loving it it's amazing so
um it's not just that ingredient that's
in there it's just it's supposed to be
anti-aging it's supposed to just help
with I don't know it's just supposed to
be really really good and like
anti-aging all over anti age
sort of cream and all over anti-aging
sort of product which is the resveratrol
that's what it's supposed to be so
anyway this is what it looks like you
guys can see we really done in here and
it's just this really really kind of
bouncy formula can you guys see that and
it's so thick and moisturizing but not
oily it's amazing the texture is
absolutely incredible it smells kind of
nice kind of like totally products a
little like spicy um that's spicy but
you know I mean a little like natural if
that makes sense and it's just it's
wonderful like I've been loving it so I
kind of wanted to share that little
story if you see anything with that
arrest for all ingredients in it you
should definitely try it out because it
is very good for anti-aging purposes and
it just come with this little spatula to
which I love alright guys we are almost
done let's show you the one bubble bath
product i've been using this week
because you guys know if you watched my
weekly favorites i literally take baths
like every other day i'm just a bath
person i just like bubble baths and i
have tons of bath products so this week
for a bubble bath i've been loving the
stress relief from Bethel body works
aromatherapy line this is the eucalyptus
T luxury bath it says keep your calm
soothing a eucalyptus essential oil and
tea helped calm feelings of stress and
uncertainty this is what it looks like
if you've never tried these um luxury
bath products from the aromatherapy liya
bath and body works they are amazing it
smells so good and I mean it just smells
so good but it's like this really creamy
liquid e product that you pour into your
bath and it makes beautiful soft soft
moisturizing bubbles so loving that
especially this scent really really good
that has been my favorite this week from
my bubble baths alright guys hair
products let's do it these are the last
products um I have just been having a
hard time with my hair lately last night
I did braid it I was so upset so I
wanted to wear it down I put it in a
braid and I naturally have very very
fine kind of thin hair and sometimes the
braids just like doesn't take and it
didn't really take I wanted to wear down
so just popped it up in a ponytail today
because it didn't really take sometimes
it goes really really well and I put
like a lots of here
in it and it just looks really wavy but
sometimes it just doesn't work at all so
it did not work last night which was
upsetting but overall my ends have just
gotten kind of crunchy and gross and I
am going in for a hair appointment let's
see it's next yeah I think next
Wednesday so I am getting a full foil of
highlights again so that will take care
of my roots but also I'm gonna have her
take off I think a whole inch at the
bottom just because it's just starting
to get a little like rugged you know
like the ends are starting to get a
little rugged and I've been having a lot
of breakage like right here near my
hairline if you guys have any sort of
like recommendation like a product for
that like in this area please let me
know because that is where it's been
breaking off and I don't know if it's
because I'm constantly pulling my hair
back in a ponytail but it's just been
driving me crazy so another really big a
thing that I've been dealing with is um
tangles literally in my hair just
tangles all time it's so hard to brush
out I've been having the hardest time so
I decided I'm gonna i was going to start
doing some oil treatments and i usually
do these like once a week things like
that and I decided you know what forget
it I have a good 20 minutes before I get
in the shower you know I'm one of those
people it takes my makeup off I kind of
fuss around in the kitchen and then I go
and shower so I have like this 20
minutes in between I thought every
single time before I'm going to wash my
hair I am going to heat up a little bowl
of this coconut oil and put it through
the length of my hair not so much the
roots because I don't want it to get
greasy but the length of my hair so that
I can get some good um you know like I I
want it to help detangle I want it to be
a little more manageable and this has
really really worked for me this week so
I've been loving a coconut oil I just
put it in a microwave-safe dish and make
sure that it kind of heats up because
that way it kind of sinks into the hair
follicle a little better but the one I
use is from nutiva this is the coconut
oil it is organic unrefined cold-pressed
virgin coconut oil you want to make sure
it's a virgin and then it is
cold-pressed if you are going to be
working with coconut oil especially if
you are ingesting it but this is what
I've been using this week it has really
really been helping to detangle
my hair and honestly my ends feel a lot
more like fluffy they don't feel as
damaged and like rugged so basically
what I do is I just mix that up I put it
in my hair I just put it on my ends not
my roots probably like ear down I have
been putting a little here where I've
been breaking off but um overall that's
what I've been doing and then I go into
the shower ashampoo I condition as
normal and it just has been really
really good for my hair so I am giving
myself basically a preconditioned like
pre oiling before each shampoo every
single time I'm going to use coconut
copra coconut oil with this week's oil
I'm going to be using avocado oil for
next week so I'm excited to do that and
see if I get good results from that too
but this has been great so you know I
have it externally 20 minutes might as
well do it you know what I mean alright
another product i've been loving from my
hair is the Pantene pro-v overnight
miracle this is a repair serum you put
it in your hair not the night that you
shower but the night after you shower
I'm so like second day hair like tonight
I showered last night and i braided my
hair didn't really work like i said but
tonight i won't be washing my hair again
so what I do is I pump two pumps of this
into the hair and I just kind of
distributed throughout my ends you leave
it in overnight and it completely sinks
in overnight and it just helps to repair
your hair without going into the shower
and washing it and putting in a deep
conditioner so I've been loving that for
the actual shower when I've been
actually showering I've been loving the
suave professionals Moroccan infusions
color care shampoo you guys oh my gosh
this is an amazing shampoo this is one
of the best shampoos I've ever tried in
my life and I'm not just talking about
drug store I'm talking about high-end
everything this is one of the best you
have to try the swap professionals line
you guys these are amazing especially
this color fair one it smells amazing it
lathers really really well it just makes
my hair so much more manageable I just
absolutely love that and for a deep
conditioner this week I've been loving
the it's a 10 miracle hair mask it looks
this it smells exactly like that um what
is the macadamia here one that's like in
that green and brown tub it smells
exactly like that so if you like the
smell of that you'll like this one it
says it detangles restores moisture
balance instantly restores elasticity it
softens it smooths it imparts luminous
shine it enhances natural body nourishes
d frizzes and improves color vibrancy so
really really awesome love that and
let's see here oh my god I still have so
much more you guys I'm sorry it's gonna
be like a 30 minute video I really
apologize but um there's just a lot of

professional line you guys it's amazing
this dry shampoo is awesome i love this
it leaves absolutely no like texture in
the hair so it's really good for those
days where you washed your hair on the
night before it's amazing i love it it's
just it's so good it's just it's so good
you guys thank you I can't even for the
days where I have been wearing my hair
up and I've really wanted lots of
texture and feel like body and like just
I don't know I want it to be like a
hairspray and dry shampoo like two and
one I've been loving the bumble and
bumble prenta powder it's equal parts
dry shampoo style extender and volume
and it pinched the stuff is awesome it
smells good yeah it sounds good yeah it
smells really good and it really just
gives lots of hold and volume to the
hair and then I've been loving the swab
kids Apple detangler spray this stuff is
awesome if you don't want a detangler
that has like extra moisture in it
because if you have fine hair like I do
sometimes that can be an issue because
you're literally spraying on basically
your roots and things like that and it
can make your hair look even more way
down this is really nice doesn't have
anything else in it it just detangles
the hair it's got a great sent this the
Apple sent oh it smells so good I love
this highly recommend and then it'll
it'll last two things yes you guys I
literally stumbling over my words it has
been a long video this is the progear
pro lap probe
pro kennex pro kennex volume soy protein
plus caffeine root boost finish +
bodybuilder I like to put this on my
roots for more volume it's awesome it
doesn't put a lot of like crunch in the
hair I love it and then for putting on
my ends when I get out of the shower the
cheese silk infusion silk reconstructing
complex is awesome a lot of people i
know a lot of people that have like dry
hair don't like this I don't think it's
moisturizing enough for them but if you
have fine kind of oily hair like I do
you probably will really like this only
put it on your ends don't put it on your
roots because you don't want to weigh
down the hair but really really good
alright guys literally that took forever
i hope you guys enjoyed this weekly
