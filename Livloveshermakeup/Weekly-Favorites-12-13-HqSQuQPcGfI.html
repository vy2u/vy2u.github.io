thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day
today i will be sharing with you guys my
weekly favorites for the past two weeks
so last weekend I had a really bad head
cold and I wasn't able to film my weekly
favorites but I kind of worked out well
because like this past week basically I
haven't been feeling that great so I
just ended up using the same products
that i had the week before so they were
actually the same i've been using the
same products for the past two weeks and
kind of eager to change them out now
that i'm feeling better but it was just
really nice to have like products that I
knew would be working while I didn't
feel well you know what I mean like you
use products the week before and then
you just use them again because it's
like they're comfortable and no work so
anyway everything is basically they've
been the same for the past two weeks so
um yeah I'm just combining these two
weeks and let's just get started the
first thing I want to show you guys that
I love and has been a favorite is this
little um it is a little like bouquet
that I put together from target I'm
gonna go back a little bit so you guys
can see so target has like that dollar
section or like I don't know one to five
dollar section at the front of their
stores and they had three little
bouquets that I thought were really cute
they come and are not bookcase but like
little bundles so one bundle had like
those orange flowers one had the red
flowers and then another had like leaves
and like these little berry things and I
bought all three bundles for six or nine
dollars so together they were nine
dollars and then I found these little
acorns um I don't know why I guess these
ones were like a little more beat up or
something but the whole set was only 50
cents whereas other ones were like three
dollars I don't really know but these
ones are fifty cents and then I've got
this little glass for one dollar so
basically I put together this really
really pretty little fall bouquet of
course it is fake flowers but I still
love it ah I don't feel like they look
super super fake if that makes sense but
I put together this little fall bouquet
for basically under ten dollars from
target and I feel like this will go
through all the way until December like
we can have it for thanksgiving we have
it out right now for like Halloween and
yeah and I'm thinking about in December
basically just switching out keeping
this little glass jar putting in white
flowers red flowers and green flowers
yeah white red and green yeah and then
instead of filling it with acorns I will
fill it with like ornaments so I'm
basically just having a nice little
piece that we keep on the windowsill
that can go for each season i'll just
keep changing them out and i'll keep the
flowers and I'll keep the acorns and
everything and just keep changing it out
throughout the seasons and then I can
reuse it next year so anyway that was my
first little favorite I put this
together and I just think it's super
super cute and I love it so really
really fun and it's a little DIY project
that really doesn't take a lot of effort
you can put it together very quickly for
like under ten dollars so nice to have
something that's really fall related and
something that won't die you know I mean
I love real flowers don't get me wrong
I'm a girl who always pick real flowers
or fake ones but this is just like
perfect because it lasts forever huh so
anyway um that is my first favorite my
second favorite I'm going to talk about
perfumes really quickly this is actually
a perfume that I don't remember loving
like I got it and I like the set when I
got it and then last year the whole year
like I didn't like it at all and I was
really hard for me to wear it because I
just didn't like it it's a very very
strong kind of overpowering scent um
excuse me it is the Jessica Simpson
fancy perfume and I've actually been
wearing this for the past two weeks and
I love this it is like a very very
strong smelling it sticks with you
absolutely all day long um but I don't
know i'm liking the scent now i feel
like you know you change and you grow
and you like certain things or you don't
like certain things and I have so many
perfumes and this was just one that i
picked back out like of my little
perfume collection i guess you could say
and i have been loving it so I just yeah
it smells really good it's kind of got
like a baby powder like under sent hmm
undertone under sentence undertone has
kind of got like a baby powder undertone
and normally I don't really like those
powdery sort of like undertones in any
kind of fragrance but I've been liking
it a lot this week and honestly it lasts
all day long so been loving that as my
perfume
for the past two weeks and also the body
mist I've been using is the battle body
works aromatherapy energy orange ginger
body mess it looks like this comes in a
beautiful little glass bottle I love
this scent it's amazing oh it's such a
pick me up so the orange ginger accent
it's said to boost your energy orange
and ginger essential oils are uplifting
to release tension and sharpen the
senses and it just smells so good it's
very uplifting I love it this time of
year so i have been using that as my
body spray so those are the first two
things and then i'm going to go and
start with makeup so the first thing I'm
going to talk about is the lip products
I've been wearing for the past two weeks
I've been wearing my little eternal love
liquid lipstick set I did a review on
these about what like a week and a half
ago or two weeks now this is from stila
they have this $20 little kit on the
altar com website and i love these last
week i wore a lot of bossy which is like
this beautiful neutral color it's got a
lot of like gray and pink undertones in
it it's really really gorgeous and then
this week I've been wearing a lot of
beso which is that gorgeous gorgeous red
color and then today I am wearing Rico
this is a very very dark like black
cherry sort of color and I keep thinking
like it's all over my teeth it's so I
don't know I was going to grab a mirror
and look um it's been on for like three
hours now but I'm just so impressed with
how long these stay and where and I
think the colors are gorgeous so that is
those are the only three products I've
been wearing on my lips for the past two
weeks to moisturize my lips in the
morning I've been using the lasting
smiles organic lip balm in passion fruit
mango I definitely like to moisturize my
lips before putting on any kind of lip
product but especially with these liquid
lipsticks because they can be slightly
drying just slightly more drying than
your average lipstick or lip butter
things like that so in loving that for
primer I've been wearing the l'oreal
magic perfecting base ah as my face
primer it looks like this this is a very
very silicone II product and you don't
get a lot in here but a little goes a
long way but it's very very silicone II
however i do recommend if you have dry
skin to really moisturize ahead of time
because
it really can cling to dry patches but I
really really love it makes your makeup
go on very smoothly and has that really
nice silicone II like pore filling
effect for eye primer I've been using my
benefit Air Patrol I was going to do a
whole review on this and I never ended
up getting to it but I really love this
it's like a BB eyelid primer it doesn't
feel like any sort of normal eye primer
it's not greasy it's not thick it's not
tacky and it's not like silicone e it
really really is different it feels like
you're putting like a BB cream over your
eyelid so it's really really easy to
blend it does have a little bit of like
a yellow undertone to it which actually
isn't too yellow even on my a skin tone
so it really is kind of brightening and
it has the coolest little like silicone
applicator tip it's like so squishy yes
I love that so really really been loving
that really helps with creasing and just
making your eye makeup lasts all day
long for my brows I've been using my Too
Faced brow and the brow shaping and
defining kit it looks like this and I
basically been using I really want to
try out the stencils in here I just
didn't get to them the past couple of
weeks but um I've been using the tools
that come in here they have the tweezers
the spoolie and then the little angled
brush and I've been using the setting
wax and the blonde powder for my brows I
haven't been feeling them in super super
crazily just kind of you know putting
like the powder like the blonde powder
in the areas that are kind of like I
don't know I've been having like patchy
eyebrows past couple weeks like I lost a
little bit of hair right here so I've
been filling it in there and then
towards the front and I haven't really
used the highlighter that much I don't
really like it because it's cream um I
wish it was a powder but and then the
brunette color I haven't really tried
yet but I'm sure that I could use that
in the arch and it wouldn't be too dark
all right I have been using the Sony
incisa or Wayne Goss buffing technique
and this is basically the last thing I
do after applying my highlighter my
contour all that kind of stuff I buff it
in with a kabuki brush or any kind of
buffing brush this is the NARS
translucent crystal light reflect light
reflecting setting powder and I think it
just gives a gorgeous gorgeous finish to
the skin so I've been using the NARS one
this week you can use absolutely any
powder you want the reason I've been you
thing like a silica or slow yeah a
silica powder is because I feel like
when you buff that and it really really
airbrushes the skin and looks gorgeous
so I've been using the NARS one you can
use the one from ELF it's just as good
um let's see here Nick's makes an
excellent one and what other one do I
have besides those three the gave a
small one of the tart one they all work
this is just one that I've been using
this week all right as far as blushes go
I've been wearing my milani rose powder
blushes in the shade 08 tiros which is
this one this is the one I'm wearing
today it's a beautiful really really
neutral kind of rosy undertone color
really really gorgeous and i have been
pairing that with this highlighter it is
the makeup revolution vivid baked
highlighter in pink light that's also
what i'm wearing today this has like a
violet sort of undertone and i really
really like the way those 20 oh my gosh
I almost just drop this scared me it's
okay and lend it on my lap but um tea
rose and this one look really really
beautiful together and then I also like
the Milani powder Rose blush in 05 coral
cove it's just a lot brighter it's
definitely a coral color and I've been
pairing that with my makeup revolution
that they baked highlighter in golden
lights so these two look really gorgeous
together as well so really really loving
those two highlighters in those two
blushes the past two weeks to set my
under eye makeup I've been using my ELF
high definition under ice setting powder
I really like this it's very like light
reflecting just have a little bit of
like chunks of sparkle in it but you can
kind of like brush those off but overall
really really good it does have like a
little bit of a pink undertone so it
does have some brightening effects as
well all right the only eyeliner I've
been wearing the past two weeks is the
Laura Geller I tear waterproof eyeliner
in I brightener and this is kind of like
a yellow toned not completely like stark
white but I've been wearing it I am
wearing it today to in my waterline and
it's kind of like a banana color and it
just really really has looked nice with
the eye makeup that I've been pairing
for the past two weeks which by the way
the eye makeup I've been wearing a lot
of people have been asking um like
eyeshadows and things like that I've
been wearing the past two weeks it is
all the two-faced natural matte palette
and this is what the colors look like
and yeah so any time you saw me in the
past two weeks wearing an eyeshadow look
that you liked it all came from this
palette today I am wearing new tea in my
as my transition color I have strapless
in my crease I have lace Teddy on my lid
and then I have risked a which is that
darker color in my outer V so that is
what I have been wearing for the past
two weeks really really love those
colors are super super easy to blend and
I think I'm Matt I is just gorgeous oh
also I have strapless underneath my
lower lashes all right and my mascara
for the past two weeks a lot of people
have been asking about this too i've
been wearing one layer of the sephora
outrageous curl dramatic volume and
curved mascara in black this is one of
my all-time favorite mascaras and i have
also been wearing on top of that one
layer of the Lancome Hypnose drama and
excessive black so I wear one layer of
that on top of the other one all right
as far as contouring goes this week I've
been back to my wet and wild I'm 750 a
caramel toffee contouring palette it
looks like this you get a light shade
they're both Matt and then you get to
the darker shade I haven't been using
this one I've only been using that as a
contour and just hitting you know around
the outer perimeter of my face basically
and I absolutely love it i think it's
gorgeous all right foundation and
concealer this week i keep wanting to
say this week but the past two weeks the
past two weeks i have been wearing the
covergirl outlast stay luminous natural
glow foundation I really love this this
has a beautiful beautiful like Demi like
I don't even know like luminous it's
still luminous and gorgeous on the skin
and I just love it so it's got I don't
even know how to quite describe the
finish of it it's not super super
luminous but it's also like kind of Demi
Matt it's very interesting and really
really luxurious so really really love
this one and I've been carrying that
with the Maybelline better super-state
better skin concealer and I really
really like this as well those two
really really honestly pair well
together if you are looking
good drugstore match and then I have
been using this after i put on my
primers i spray this and after I have
finished my makeup I spray this on my
face it is the pixi by Petra make up
fixing missed with rose water and green
tea I like it a lot I make sure to spray
it really really far away because um I
don't know the applicator sometimes like
squirts out too much I hate when that
happens then it's like a blob and then
it's like even everywhere else but um I
really really squared it super high and
just let it kind of fall down on my face
and this was definitely helped with the
longevity of my makeup and also um just
like priming and making it stay really
like nice all over the skin all day long
so then loving that and yeah let's move
on to some skincare and haircare I've
been wearing this lip balm at night it
has definitely saved my lips I love this
it's not cute and this is the tony moly
i think it's called bobo I'm like kiss
kiss lip balm in blueberry and I have
both of them there's one in honey and
one in blueberry looks like this you
guys can see I've really really used a
lot of it I basically have almost hit
pan on this but it smells amazing smells
like blueberry and it has this kind of
like um vaseline sort of texture to it
and it really has just been moisturizing
my lips at night so absolutely love that
and using that for the past two weeks
I've also been using this Neutrogena
ageless intensives anti-wrinkle deep
wrinkle night moisturizer and I have
been pairing this with the face cream i
talked about two weeks ago the Codel
eros over at all so i put this on first
and then I top it with the resveratrol
but this is nice I've been using this on
an offer I'd say probably three or four
years now and honestly this is a really
really nice dose of retinol in here if
you are sensitive to retinol which a lot
of people are or if you are just getting
started with retinol and you want to do
it for like you know anti-aging you know
just kind of getting into it this is a
great one to try from the drugstore it
really does have a nice amount of
retinol in there it's not like one
percent or anything like that but it is
a nice way to start out I noticed that
my skin is very even and the texture
changes immediately within a week of
using this so i love that Neutrogena
ageless intensives it is not
moisturizing enough for my
skin at night tho IM combination skin so
i like to put that on and then top it
with another moisturizer after it is
completely sunken so i've been using the
resveratrol which is really really nice
and very hydrating all right in the
morning um i have been using this serum
this is the first aid beauty triple
brightening complex facial radiance
serum i hate the way this mouths i just
want to say it right away all the first
aid beauty products to me smell really
bad they kind of smell like musky are
weird i'm not quite sure what it is but
this is nice it has like a little
dropper form and it's kind of it has a
really luxurious texture it's very thick
not very thin and like I don't know I'm
not like oily feeling or anything like
that it's just very very thick and
luxurious and I have noticed that it has
started to brighten some of the dark
spots i have on my skin so that is what
i'm using it for and that's what i like
so i used that in the morning another
product i've been using in the morning
is the Clinique all about eyes eye cream
this reduces circles and puppies and I
find that it does help to reduce
puffiness under my eyes if I store it in
the refrigerator I don't think it's
actually the eye cream that does it I
think it's actually just putting a cold
product on that area as far as dark
circles go not really sure about that I
do think it has a little bit of a like
luminosity to it so it does kind of help
to conceal any sort of darkness but
overall I really really love the texture
of this it really makes my makeup glide
on smoothly and yeah so really been
liking that the eye cream I've been
wearing at night is the fresh black th
delay I concentrate I absolutely love
this it smells amazing has a really
buttery texture I've actually used all
of it up and I did not use all of this
in two weeks this was actually a
100-point perk that I got maybe three
months ago from Sephora literally if you
ever see any of the like 100 200 300 400
500 point perks that is an eye cream on
the Sephora website get it because these
will last you forever this is like this
was such a good size literally lasted me
three months so i really really love
this he smells like black tea it was so
luxurious i'm definitely considering
getting a full size of this for sure
alright my nails have been a wreck okay
they've been very very dry and falling
off
disgusting and like I feel like they're
crumbling so I've been using this ncla
treatment so rich vitamin E infused
cuticle oil at night I love it it really
really is moisturizing I put this on top
of like I put my hand cream on and then
I put this on and it smells so good you
guys are smells like candy to smell it
now yeah it smells like candy it's like
so good and it's just very very very
moisturizing and has been helping I just
haven't been wearing nail polish because
my nails have been such a mess so um
definitely definitely love this um let's
see here let me talk about the hand
cream since I just talked about that
I've been using the Mario Badescu
hydrating hand cream I love the way this
smells it smells absolutely amazing it's
like nostalgia in a bottle for me I used
to use this like two years ago also so
there was a time where I was just
obsessed with Mario Badescu products I
will still love their products I'm just
not using only their products now I was
about two years ago though but I love
this hydrating hand cream it's beautiful
it has hyaluronic acid in it which
really locks in the moisture and it
smells amazing and it sinks in so
quickly so you don't have to worry about
having greasy hands and it has this cute
little applicator so you just you know
pour it out so love that what else ok
for moisturizing my body we are getting
into that time of year where um my
combination skin is starting to turn dry
so I've been using the tree hochesh a
body butter in almond and honey it is
certified organic shea butter with
almond extract and honey looks like this
I love the tree hut brand they make
amazing scrubs amazing body butters oh
this smells so good it smells like
amaretto or like amaretti cookies if you
know what that smells like super super
good very luxurious it is a little
greasy but it really really moisturized
as well so i highly recommend checking
that out they're also very affordable
brand as far as hair care goes i don't
remember if I mention this two weeks ago
in my favorites but this dry shampoo
from the suave professionals keratin
infusion line is incredible I think two
weeks ago I mentioned the shampoo from
the keratin line which I absolutely love
it is one of my favorite all-time
shampoos one of my favorite shampoos of
all time
this is the dry shampoo and it is just
as good it's amazing if you have fine
hair like I do it really really just
makes it look like I haven't washed my
hair in three days now and I put it in
today and it looks like it's like nice
and dry and not oily discussing so
really really really love this it leaves
absolutely no residue and it has a nice
scent and then for my roots I have been
using every single time I shower I've
been spraying on just the roots this
john frieda sheer blonde go blonder
controlled lightning spray a lot of
people hate this and I don't actually I
used to use it once a week and spray it
all over my hair and then use heat on it
and blow dry it to activate it but you
can use it without heat and I've just
been using it on my roots because um I
just want them to blend as I go blonder
and blonder so just using that on my
roof I just spray it on out of the
shower and I haven't had any damage or
anything so I've been liking that in the
morning I have been using this scrub
this is the st. eyes black head clearing
green tea scrub it clear slack heads and
calms redness I really really like this
it says that the exfoliation factor is
that moderate they have like a gentle
moderate and deep scale and this one's
moderate but this really feels deep it
feels like microdermabrasion the
particles are really really small and
nice and it smells great it's got one
percent of salicylic acid in it so if
you really want to clear out your
blackhead salicylic acid is great for
that and yeah I love it really really
good um I am declaring war on my upper
arms haha I am very much I don't know if
it's like apple shaped um I carry
basically all of my weight in my boobs
and my upper arms so um and I don't
think it's apple shape because I don't
really care a lot of weight in my
stomach area but I literally I just my
upper arms are so gross like I just feel
like they're so like they don't go with
my body like they're so flabby and gross
and I just want to start toning them up
and you know I even use this on my
breast area as well they kind of tone
everything up but this is the quest
anti-cellulite booster and it's supposed
to also have our
this lotion has a local effect on
reducing fat tissue like in the area so
it's not just for celula I don't
necessarily have cellulite like on my
arms but I really just want to help firm
them up I'm going to start doing
exercises for my upper arms that's
really like the one area of my body that
needs to be super toned everything else
looks okay but that and you know like I
said I just really carry a lot of weight
in my upper chest area and my upper arms
and I'm just declaring war on it I want
to tone that area up and this has
actually been very very helpful so it
does have that local effect on kind of
firming and toning the area and reducing
fat tissue and I actually have seen a
difference so I'm really really happy
with that something I've been using on
my neck at nighttime I am one of those
people that really believes in taking
all of the skin care products down your
neck like that is a very good thing to
do however I noticed at night I'm like
if I'm using something like that
resveratrol like face cream or something
like that it's oily and my hair gets
stuck to my neck if I put it like on and
just gets all like weird feeling so i
have been using the polished choice
resist retinol skin smoothing body
treatment on my neck and this has a
small amount of retinol in it and it
helps hydrate and repair a create
smoother younger-looking skin and build
collagen for firmer skin I just don't
want to be one of those people I feel
like one of the biggest dead giveaways
of age is like the neck area when you
can kind of look at someone you can
always tell when someone has taken
really good care of the skin on their
face but the neck is the dead giveaway
for age in my opinion so I really want
to be one of those people that takes
care of my neck and this is nice because
it's not too greasy it's a treatment not
a moisturizer and um I just you know I
want to make sure that I keep my neck
nice and firm and talked and yeah so
I've been loving that this week it sinks
in so quickly masking you guys know I'm
a big masquerade mask every week i used
the glam glow this week this is the
flash mod brightening treatment i keep
saying this week you guys know i mean
the past two weeks and this is the flash
mud brightening treatment i probably use
this about eight times in the past two
weeks so really really love this it's
got um brightening up properties to it
especially if you use it
I consecutively like every other day it
really really can help to brighten the
skin I'm trying to open it and i can get
it open but anyway it smells really good
it's really really a nice product i find
that it really does lighten my
hyperpigmentation last week i was very
tired i think it was because i was
getting into my sickness you know how
you always get tired before you get sick
I was just starting to get tired and I
could tell my skin looked kind of ruddy
and gross and this really helps to
brighten it up so I love that let me
grab two products back here these your
leak rosewater balancing miss I finish
my skincare routine at night and in the
morning with three sprays of it here in
the middle on the side and three sprays
on my neck I know super high maintenance
I'm one of those people that really
enjoys my time especially in the morning
doing my skin care it's like a ritual
for me I enjoy skincare I enjoy doing it
it's like my time where I get to pamper
myself and this is absolutely not a
necessity you don't need to have like a
balancing missed or any kind of missed
in your skin care regimen but if you are
fond of skincare and if you like things
like that you might want to try this out
it is a hydrating mist rich in the
living energy of rose and marshmallow to
restore tone and hydrate leaves the skin
balanced and refreshed it smells amazing
very strongly rose so if you do not like
rose you won't like this but it just
gives that extra moisture to the skin at
the like final end of your you know
skincare routine basically and I love it
so yes very high maintenance this is a
splurge item and does like $35 don't
recommend if you're not really
interested it's not something that you
need in your skin care routine but I
really like doing it alright i have been
using the l'oreal age perfect glow
renewal facial oil as my moisturizer in
the morning i really love this product
it smells really really good and it's
got this great like blend I think argan
oil not coconut argon mahoba and
something else so you're going basically
three oils in here it's got the drop or
form and this really really makes my
makeup glide on smoothly in the morning
so this is what I have been using to
moisturize my skin if you have very very
dry parched skin you would probably like
this as well you could probably even add
this into your regular moisturizer if
you don't want to just use this straight
up on your face but like
said I am combination skin and my skin
is trying to get a lot drier um right
now so I have been liking using that as
a moisturizer alright for shampoo this
week the chlorine shampoo with mango
butter this is amazing it smells amazing
it's really really great for damaged
raipur care this is the smaller size
like eight dollars on those of our
website you guys it smells so good but
it really really makes my hair feel soft
and nice and I've just been dealing with
like dry nails dry hair lately so this
has been really really wonderful the
smell is everything um and let's see
here is this the last day look at my
little pile this is the last thing sorry
guys I know this is like a 30 minute
video but um I talked about two weeks
ago how like I said I've been having dry
hair and also just tangling my hair has
been very tangley so I decided that I
wanted to start doing pre oil treatments
before each um like shampoo so basically
two weeks ago i was using coconut oil I
just mix a small amount into a bowl I
heat it in the microwave for about 10 to
15 seconds and then I saturate the ends
of my hair in it and this week and last
week I decided to try a different oil so
i have been using the avocado oil this
is really nice this one is a very very
thick that's a very thick moisturizing
oil on you could even use this on your
face you know if you're very very dry
skin and the overall i really really
like this it's rich in fatty acids and
just good stuff for your hair and your
skin and it has been great for my hair i
find i don't need to use quite as much
as it this as i do with like coconut oil
or like Cahawba because it is so thick
um but I really just saturate my ends
and it has been helping my hair has been
feeling better so anyway that is it guys
thank you so much for tuning into my
favorites video for the past two weeks I
hope you guys enjoyed this and i'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
