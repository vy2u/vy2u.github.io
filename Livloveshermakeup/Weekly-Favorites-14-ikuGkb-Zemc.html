thank you so much for joining me i am
sharing my weekly favorites with you
guys so let's just get started and i'll
show you guys what i've been loving this
week so the first thing i've been loving
is this shea moisture african black soap
problem skin facial wash and scrub it
has tamarind extract and tea tree oil in
it and helps clear imbalance blemished
oily skin I've been using this in the
morning you guys know I like to use a
scrub in the morning and I really really
like this it has a really nice like um
formula to it it's very very like
buttery and I feel like the exfoliating
particles really like get off the dry
skin without being too like gritty if
that makes sense like it really is nice
as you're massaging it and it feels like
it's not ripping away at your skin so
I've really really been liking that it
is like leaking right now because I just
wash my face this morning with it but I
really really been loving that and I've
really got me back into an african black
soap lately um i also picked up a body
wash last week that has african black
soap in it and then i have a facial
cleanser that i am going to start using
tonight to that i am excited to try so
you maybe you guys will be seeing those
and favorites next week we'll see how
those go but overall and really really
happy with this scrub all right moving
on foundation wise this week i've been
loving my revlon colorstay whipped creme
makeup my shade is in 110 ivory and this
just has such a luxurious like high-end
formula to it it does not feel like it
is a drugstore product whatsoever it
really glides on beautifully I feel like
it looks beautiful with the Beauty
Blender it looks beautiful applied with
a brush you can even apply it with your
fingertips and it's like just so good
and it really does stay on for 24 hours
like all day seriously so really really
love that product i also have been
loving this L'Oreal a visible lift blur
concealer it's got optic ler technology
and the Shea diamond is 301 fair and it
looks like this and I love the
consistency of this it is a beautiful
beautiful formula the one thing I do
want to stay with this product is that
you definitely want to set your
under-eye if you're using this um you
know around your eye area which is what
I have been doing this week you
definitely want to set it with powder
because this one
round but overall really really
beautiful formula as they highlight this
week I've been loving my hard candy
baked bronzer in 129 Tiki it looks like
this this is absolutely gorgeous and it
is a bronzer but everybody uses it as I
highlight and even on my fair skin it
just gives a beautiful golden glow to
the skin and it never sits on top of
your product like or your you know what
I mean like it doesnt sit on top of
other products like your foundation and
get cakey or sit on top of your skin in
a weird way it really just looks like
it's like coming out of your skin like
it's just a beautiful beautiful natural
glow so really really love this I think
um it's a little more sheer than like a
typical I don't know what am I thinking
of right now like the Laura Geller
highlighter or like the mary-lou manizer
something like that this doesn't really
have as much pigment to it when you
first apply it it just kind of goes on a
little more sheer but it honestly is so
beautiful just because a gorgeous
gorgeous glow to the skin so I
absolutely absolutely love that and
don't worry if you are fair-skinned you
can still use this as I highlight like I
said I have pretty fair skin and this
still shows up like a beautiful luminous
glow golden below on my skin so love
that from moisturizer this week in the
morning I've been using my Olay
henriksen empower featherweight
moisturizer this is just one of those
like hundred point perks from sephora i
really really like this it has a really
nice smell to it and the consistency is
very very light and it sinks in very
very quickly so if you are someone who
doesn't like to be bothered with like a
heavy moisturizer or things like that
you would probably really really like
this highly recommend checking out out
as far as I creams go in the morning
I've been using my Neutrogena hydroboost
gel cream eye cream with hyaluronic acid
in it I really really like this um I
feel like it just has a really nice like
cooling effect because it just have like
that gel cream consistency to it and the
gel just feels really really cooling on
the eye area I would say if you have dry
skin or mature skin this probably isn't
going to give you enough moisture but if
you are just getting started in skin
care if you're in your you know late
teens early 20s this is a really really
nice one to start
so I highly recommend that I've been
using this john frieda frizz-ease a
hundred percent shine glossing missed in
my hair one of my favorites this week
has been wearing my hair up i have been
wearing my hair up a lot usually in a
high ponytail kind of like a high sleek
ponytail and once I put it up I like to
just kind of um spray a pump of this or
like one spray into my hand I work it
together and then I run it through my
ponytail ax and it really makes it look
shiny and glossy and beautiful so I've
been loving that you guys know I have
been loving probably for the past two or
three weeks i would say doing the
buffing technique which is like Sonja
and FISA and also the was it Wayne Goss
yes they kind of like me this a popular
thing I believe Sonja advice has started
it and Wayne Goss kind of made it into a
popular trend but it is basically where
after you have set your powder after you
put on your bronzer your blushes
everything you go over your makeup with
a buffing brush and another loose powder
whatever kind of setting powder you want
and you buff it into your skin and I
think it is especially like effective if
you use a finishing powder that has
silica in it like those HD powders and
last week I was using the NARS one the
light-reflecting one that is nice but I
prefer this one this is the NYX HD
studio finishing powder this one is just
even more finely milled and it's
absolutely gorgeous so I've been using
that as far as blush goes this week I've
been using my little two-faced love
flush blushes I have two shades here the
first one is just to find my love which
is a beautiful cool toned pink color and
has a lot a lot of golden shimmer in
here I can never tell if it's silver
shimmer or golden shimmer but it is
definitely golden shimmer and it is
absolutely beautiful i'm going to swatch
it for you guys you can see that is what
it looks like and it's just a really
pretty cool toned pink and these are so
easy to blend and work with i just love
them and the second one is um the love
hangover one it's more of a peachy warm
like just I don't know a warm toned pink
with tons and tons of silver shimmer and
the shimmer is not super noticeable it's
really really meld
they're nicely but I just love the way
these look on the skin they really just
look absolutely stunning so I am wearing
love hangover today which is the warmer
one these are just so easy to blend and
use and I just absolutely adore them so
those have definitely been favorites
this week those little blushes um what
else okay next the next honey do me app
this is a what do they call this a skin
serum and Prime are built into one so
you get honey in here which is a natural
antiseptic you get gold flakes which is
supposed to help increase the skins
radiance and collagen for smoother skin
I really love the packaging I think it
looks so so beautiful and you can see
there are tiny little flecks of like
gold flakes in there basically they're
not noticeable once you put it on the
skin and yes this does have honey in it
so when you first apply it does feel a
little sticky and tacky but overall it
gives extra moisture to your skin and
it's just been a nice break i've been
using a lot of silicone primers lately
and sometimes i like to go back and
forth between silicon and a primer that
gives a little more to the skin a little
more nourishment so i've been loving
that as far as I primers go I've been
loving my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion I feel like I have not used this
in a very long time and I feel like the
longer it sits in the tube the better it
gets it gets a lot more tacky and I just
feel like it really has been keeping the
eyeshadows I've been wearing this week
on all day so I really love that I've
been wearing to like no fuss lip colors
this week I either been wearing my Becca
beach tint lip shimmer souffle in litchi
/ topaz it is a beautiful unpick pink
color that's the lychee color mixed in
with the Topaz highlighter color which
is more of a golden and when you mix it
together on the lips it just looks
absolutely stunning that's the color
that you get I am wearing it on my lips
today and these are so like no fuss sort
of products um they just like I don't
even have to put them on with a mirror I
haven't wanted to be filling in my lips
with a lip liner this week or anything
like that I've just wanted really really
quick little products so the second one
is the Stila lip plays and this has been
hibiscus this is gorgeous
like a multi like tonal effect to it
it's amazing so it's kind of like a
mauve color but it's got tons and tons
of like golden iridescent to it can you
guys see that is that beautiful so both
of those are absolutely gorgeous I've
been loving them so easy to apply the
Becca has like a little like silicone
applicator and then the lip glaze is
have the little brush so super easy
those are the only things i've been
wearing on my lips um this week like i
said i'm wearing the becca one today if
you are wondering oh I can't get it off
my hand now alright um at night um after
i put on my retinol face cream which is
the one I talked about last week the
ageless intensives from Neutrogena I
have been putting on this pharmacy sleep
tight firming night bulb it's got
echinacea in it and it just it's so cool
it is a gel to oil finish so this was
actually a hundred point um perk from
Sephora and I love this because it
really really goes like a long way this
is an amazing like hundred point perk
but anyway if you guys can see the sort
of texture in there it is like a gel oil
so you take it out and it feels more
like a gel and then you kind of rub it
in and it kind of turns into an oil but
it still doesn't like go completely oily
like it stays a little bit like a gel it
is just the coolest texture and it
really kind of opens my sinuses up
because it doesn't have that echinacea
in there and it just smells really good
and I have noticed that my skin has been
very very moisturized since I've had
been using that this week so I really
really love that and I love that that
was like a hundred point park like you
get such a nice amount of product in
there all right I have been wearing the
maybelline master drama by I studio
eyeliner in Midnight master all week it
is what I'm wearing today I've been
wearing it on my waterline and also on
my tie time and it's just amazing it
lasts all day it stays in the water line
it doesn't get all crazy I will say
towards the front of your eye like right
here--like the tear duct you do have to
sometimes go in with a q-tip just so
that it doesn't get like smudgy but
overall it's amazing it wears really
well and it is a very very soft like
creamy kind of cajal sort of feel so
really awesome I've been wearing two
different mascaras this week layering
them as I usually do the first one is
the organic wear mascara this is just
the normal regular version this is from
physicians formula and it's called black
organics that is the shade really cute
packaging I got this because tati or
glam light grunt glass kalama wise guru
you're on youtube recommended it this is
what the brush looks like it's like this
a very very jumbo sized brush and it
kinda reminds me of lash blast from
covergirl um but it really really just
um gives a very very natural volume to
the lashes so I've been wearing that and
then on top I've been wearing one layer
of the Maybelline the falsies push-up
drama which I do have a review on you
just want to make sure that you really
really set your eye area if you're going
to be wearing this mascara because it
can transfer a little bit but this is
what the brush looks like and this is
really nice for lengthening so the two
of those combined made really nice
lashes for this week so I like those a
lot um I've been wearing this Mario
Badescu dermo nechtan eye cream at
nighttime it's wonderful it's got a lot
of emollients in it and antioxidants and
you get so much product in here so its
like this blue creamy formula and I mean
you literally look it on the lid to like
there's so much product in here and I've
had this forever and it just glides on
so easily almost feels like silicone
like there's silicone in here which I
know there isn't because Mario Badescu
does not use that kind of crap in his
skin care but um it feels like it just
glides on so easily it's amazing i will
say i don't like to use it um in the
morning because it does kind of give a
little bit of a blue tint to the eye
area which I feel like really emphasizes
my dark circles in the morning so I only
use it at night I've really really been
loving that all right as far as I
shadows go this week and what I'm
wearing today obviously I've been
wearing my makeup geek eyeshadows I only
have eight of them I know I'm crazy um
that is crazy everybody raised about
these I really should have more but I
have them here in my Z palette and I
have four on top that are just the
regular the regular eyeshadow format and
then four of the foiled ones on the
them so the ones I have on the top are
unexpected which is a beautiful kind of
like plummy dusty pinky color really
really gorgeous and then I have a
pretentious which is like a all of the
kind of light brown shade with tons of
gold shimmer in it and then I have
corrupt which is the only one in here
that I have not played with this week it
is just a really really dark black and
then peaches or beaches and cream I love
this this is an amazing transition color
I'm wearing this today as my transition
shade and then the foil of eyeshadows I
have our flamethrower this is definitely
my favorite out of all the ones i have i
am wearing it in my crease today
gorgeous gorgeous these foiled ones are
absolutely stunning and then I have
Houdini I wore this one on my lid I
think earlier this week maybe on monday
or something like that I wore this on my
lid with flamethrower in the crease
those two are absolutely stunning
together um the like I don't even know
like those two together like that blue
and that kind of coppery like orange
color are absolutely gorgeous together
and then I have grandstand and this one
is what I'm wearing on my lids today and
then I have what's this one called
mesmerised which is kind of like a
plummy color and I have been wearing a
lot of memorized mesmerised and grand
stand together as well as grandstand and
Flynn throw together so yeah I would say
out of all of them flame thrower is
definitely my favorite but it's been
really fun to play with these and kind
of work with these it's fun that you can
kind of build your own Z palette and I
have been loving those this week all
right as far as hair products go I have
been loving this dove nutritive therapy
nourishing oil care leaf in smoothing
cream so you put this in as a leave-in
conditioner it is absolutely amazing if
you have never tried this dove um
nourishing oil care line from the
drugstore it's amazing they have
wonderful shampoos wonderful
conditioners and all of their leave in
serums and smoothing creams are amazing
highly recommend and they smell really
really good and then I've been putting
this organic soro TX renewing argan oil
of Morocco penetrating oil on my
probably from like my earlobe
down i would say on my hair and this
really really sinks in it's amazing it
really does penetrate the hair shaft and
I just absolutely love it so I've been
wearing that and it really really makes
my ends feel super silky and nice so I
love that as far as masking goes this
week you guys know I am an avid facemask
er I love putting base mass on I do it
every single week I've been loving this
boots number 7 beautiful skin hydration
mask for dry or very dry skin you guys
know I have combination skin but when it
comes to masks I like to pick up all
sorts of different ones and this one has
been really lovely this week um
fragrances this week I have been peering
my burberry this is just 0 de perfume it
doesn't say which one this is but this
one is so beautiful it's a gorgeous
scent I feel very professional and
womanly when I wear this and I've been
wearing that all week absolutely love it
and you guys know I like to also pair my
perfumes with a body spray so I've been
pairing that one with the body fantasies
signature sweet sunrise fantasy these
two go together really really nicely I
feel like they have like some of the
same undertones in them I think that's
why so loving that and then the last
thing I've been loving this week is the
Stila hair refresher in Jade blossom
like I said I've been wearing my hair up
a lot this week um in a ponytail instead
of doing like the spray on dry shampoo
sorry you guys can see my tank top strap
instead of doing like spray on dry
shampoos this is just fun because it
kind of text Rises the hair a little bit
but it doesn't put too much texture in
it like the Preta powder from Bumble and
Bumble this one is just nice it's a
little more silky and have a great scent
to it so I like that a lot and then I
actually have two products i want to
share with you guys that did not work
out for me this week so um the first one
is this derma silk one minute college
and lift collagen booster i actually
found this in my boyfriend's like
cabinet or something i can't really
remember but i found this somewhere this
is actually his and i thought you know
what i'll try it out because when is he
gonna try this out who knows so i did
try it out I really did not feel like I
did anything it does kind of tighten the
skin a little bit but overall I didn't
feel like it gave a huge amount of
moisture back to my skin it wasn't
really a serum it wasn't really a
treatment you're supposed to leave it on
its kind of weird
it has a really really horrible set do
it so I did not like this we will of
course still use it it's not completely
offensive it does have a tiny bit of
moisture to it so you can use it as a
serum but I don't know I wasn't a huge
fan maybe he will be who knows and then
the other product that I have not been
liking is the tart miraculous maracuja
makeup setting spray and it's funny
because i love the formula i actually
like what's in the bottle it's the
bottle that's driving me nuts you guys
this spray thing just is driving me nuts
and this is a relatively new product to
me and it just sprays out like in a line
like one little line like I just kick it
drives me crazy i hate that with makeup
setting sprays like if you are going to
have a makeup setting spray please let
it come out in like a beautiful missed
so that you can just miss your face when
you're done with your makeup or when
you're putting your primer on like i
don't like that this just darts out in
one little like line i tried running the
nozzle underneath warm water i tried
like picking it out with a q-tip i don't
know what is going on so what i'm going
to do is actually if i can hopefully i
can I don't even know if this lid comes
off I'm going to pour this into a
separate bottle and just like missed it
on my face with a spray bottle because
honestly this product is good and like
what's in there is really really nice
and it does make my makeup last longer
and makes it my face feel a little more
hydrated and set it's just the bottle is
horrible and it's so sad because the
packaging is adorable so anyway um those
were my favorites for the week and of
course a few or two little things that
didn't really work out for me I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
