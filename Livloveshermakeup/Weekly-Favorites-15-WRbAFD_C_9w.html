thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic sunday
it is sunday so we are going to be
filming a my weekly favorites i'm going
to show you guys what products I have
been loving this week so the first thing
I want to share with you guys is my
favorite little fragrance duo for this
week I always liked pair a perfume with
a body spray and the ones that I've been
loving this week are the LA vanilla pure
vanilla scent sorry the labels kind of
rubbed off and then the i Kona Yali I
Connolly body fragrance in sexy vanilla
and I've been pairing those two together
and this is the body spray and that's
the perfume and I just smell like
vanilla all day long so I really been
liking that I like that warm fragrance I
think it's really nice this time of year
and that is my best favorite my second
favorite I want to talk about two
different shaving creams yes to the
first one is from trader joes this is
the moisturizing cream shape in honey
mango and also the EOS shape cream in
lavender jasmine I really love both of
these I heard about this one from Ella's
for living here on YouTube i will link
her channel right below in the
description bar but she's amazing and
she recommended this i think one of her
subscribers actually was talking about
it and recommended it to her and then
she recommended it to everybody um in a
video and i tried it out and i love it
it's really cheap and cheerful and it
smells amazing and it kind of like a gel
cream sort of formula so it's more like
a gel than an actual cream whereas the
eos juan also smells amazing the jasmine
um lavender scent is really really good
it really smells strongly of jasmine
this one is more like an actual thick
cream whereas this once more like a gel
cream they both work really really well
and give you a closer shave so I've been
loving both of those this week as far as
hair goes I think you guys can probably
tell i've been loving wearing my hair
wavy this week i braid it overnight and
then um yeah basically just put it in
two braids and i am left with nice
pretty soft waves today it's a little
more texture this is my second day hair
and I haven't up in a ponytail and I
actually used this hairspray I've been
loving this this week it's the Oscar
blondie pronto texture and volume spray
and this is what I'm using to hold my
hair up in like this like pony that's
kind of wavy and a lot of people might
think this looks kind of messy whatnot
but I love it it feels really volume
eyes and looks really big and my hair
naturally is not like that at all I very
straight and flat hair so i have been
loving this hairspray when i've been
wearing my hair up and also on the
second day like second day hair it helps
keep um like the wave in as far as
holding in the wave and like what
products i've been using what before i
put my hair in braids so basically i
shower and everything and i've been
using this shampoo this week this is the
oh gx thick and full biotin and collagen
shampoo and loving that this has really
helped to keep the texture in my hair
and then when I get out I spray this
garnier fructis curl shaping spray gel
in and this is the strong one and this
is awesome the stuff just sprays out and
it is just a gel it doesn't make it
really really crispy it does make it a
little crispy but it really does hold in
the wave so I like that and then I put
my hair in the braids and then on my
roots I've been using the nexus salon
haircare Hydra lightweight list moisture
root lift missed it says it targets
roots to lift here for admin added
fullness and body and this does have
like some sea salt in it so it does give
a little texture to your hair but again
I don't mind I naturally have very fine
straight hair so anytime I can get
texture I really do like that and yeah
I've just been loving big full hair this
week um I do put in a leaving
conditioner always even if I am trying
to get like texture and curl in my hair
this week I've been loving the Pantene
pro-v ultimate 10 BB cream this is a
beauty balm for hair and it's really
nice it helps with like um tons of stuff
it helps make your hair soft brilliant
shine it just kind of repairs it makes
it feel smooth and make sure that it's
not frizzy so I've been loving that and
then I also wanted to add this little
thing it's completely used up I got this
for my hairstylist it was the Moroccan
oil light and I put this on my ends just
to kind of seal in and make sure I don't
get any split ends when I get out of the
shower and it is lovely I really need to
get a full size of this obviously I used
it up but I really liked it alright
moving on
you guys know I'm obsessive taking
bubble baths I basically take a bath
every other day so this week I've been
loving this Bethan body works
aromatherapy energy lemon zest body wash
and foam bath again I haven't really
used it as a body wash i use it more of
a well actually only as a foam bath or a
bubble bath it smells really good it's
definitely got that lemony sort of scent
to it and it's really like an ice pick
me up and very fresh I think I've
mentioned this before I really like
citrus scents during the fall I think
they can be very like uplifting and nice
and this one is an invigorating blend of
lemon essential oil and ginseng that
provides a pick me up so I have been
loving that for my bubble bath this week
um let's see here as far as face masks
oh oh my gosh this Freeman one is
amazing it is the feeling beautiful
charcoal and black sugar polishing mask
I have been using this every other day
like when I'm in the bathtub and it is a
dual action purifying mask it comes out
and it comes out as like a black like
charcoal formula with tons and tons of
like brown sugar in it and you put it on
your face and it instantly starts to
heat up and warm up from the charcoal
it's like activated it feels so nice you
massage it in and you would think that
like the little pieces of sugar would
start falling off your face but they
don't they're really really like
attached to the charcoal so it actually
doesn't start following them off your
face at all but it goes on and then you
leave it on for about five to seven
minutes then you rub it in and it starts
to exfoliate really really nicely and
then you wash your face off oh my gosh
this one is awesome really really good
and it's so cheap and cheerful all right
I have been using these this rituals
pinko secret ginseng ankle ginseng and
ginseng and ginkgo biloba caring hand
balm this week I told you guys I get
like kind of Raschi and a little bit of
like eczema on my wrists because I wash
my hands a lot so this has been really
really nice I like the scent neverminds
do something else I can't quite put my
finger on it I'm having like a deja vu
moment but it smells really good and it
is like a bomb so it's a little oily um
it doesn't sink in right away but I
notice a difference immediately after
putting this on all right I have been
using the royal apothic t-bone firming
eye treatment
at night I really love this I have
mentioned this before any favorites it
just has a lovely lovely kind of fluffy
formulation to it and it feels really
really nice going on I really like the
texture and I do see a difference when I
wear it so that's the eye cream I've
been wearing at night in the morning
I've been using this eye cream it's
actually a hydrating under eye primer
but it basically is just a I cream with
like a pink tint to it it's the Smashbox
photo finish hydrating under eye primer
and I have just been using that as an
eye cream like I said it really just
gives moisture it doesn't necessarily
help anything to stay on longer anything
like that I don't really see any priming
benefits to it but it is basically just
an eye cream that has like a tint of
like pink and brightening like purposes
to it so I really really like that been
enjoying that a lot I've been wearing
this nail polish all week it is the wet
and wild mega last long nail color in 3
4 5 20 stream of consciousness it is
just a very very light milky pink color
and I've only had to put on one coat all
week and you guys know I've been having
a hard time with my hair and nails
lately um my actually my hair has been
changing a lot since I've been taking
like hair vitamins these are the phyto
ones I really like those um but my nails
have just been looking kind of crappy
and I do like to wear nail polish and
going in with like deep dark colors it's
like my nails are not ready for that yet
it just doesn't look good because
they're kind of like flaking and being
gross but it does look nice when I put
like a nice pretty like pinky color on
top so I've been loving that this week
as far as eyeshadow goes this week I've
been using this little palette this is a
four dollar 99 cent palette from Ulta
yes 499 it is from the brand profusion
and it is called the runway eyeshadow
glamour Barry bloom palette and it opens
up like this you get a tiny little
mirror and then you get six kind of rosy
tone inspired shades and I really really
love these like I said I've been wearing
it all week and today I have this white
color all over my lid I have this
Matt berry undertone shade I have that
as my transition I have this color right
here on my crease this on my eyelid and
the mist in the outer V and I just love
to look at that it puts together it's
really fast these are really really
pigmented and they're actually very very
creamy and easy to blend so I've been
loving that a lot if you like those
kinds of like naked 3 sort of colors
like those pinky pretty I don't know
pinky and ready sort of colors you would
really like this I pallid and like I
said it's only 499 at all towns all
right as far as highlights goes this
week I have been loving my Laura Geller
bakes gelato swirl illuminator and
guilted honey this is what it looks like
and I did a review on this ages ago but
um it's really really beautiful it's
like a gold highlight I've been wearing
it mostly this week as um like with my
elf fan brush which puts it on kind of
lightly but today I really wanted to
glow and I put it on with my t-bird
highlighting brush from Sigma so it
really just depends on what brush you
use to kind of build it up but today you
can see it's really kind of glowing and
I put it from my apple of my teak up and
I think it's beautiful it just gives a
beautiful golden Sheen to the skin and
um I think like gold actually looks
pretty on every single skin tone no
matter if you're really fair like me or
if you have really deep skin tone gold
is like a universal beautiful color all
right from my brows this week I have
been loving the bhcosmetics HD brow
pencil it looks like this it has like e
dual ended things you get a really
really fine point a little like
mechanical pencil on one side and then
on the other side you actually get a
little spooley so really really easy and
lovely to use and then to set that in
place i've been using my great lash
clear mascara this is awesome for just
putting your brows in place and it works
really really well laughs all day as far
as a foundation and concealer go this
week I've been loving my covergirl
advanced radiance age-defying foundation
+ sunscreen SPF 10 in 105 ivory I love
this because you can build it up it has
I would say sheer medium coverage so
it's not light coverage is just kind of
like a sheer medium coverage earlier in
the week I was wearing one pump of this
all over my face and a lot of people
commented on
all your face looks very fresh and not
like cakey or anything like that but
today I actually have two layers of it
on or two squirts of it so you really
can do one pump of it and get like a
nice sheer sort of look to the skin
you'll still be able to see freckles and
things like that through it or you can
do two pumps and really kind of build it
up into a perfected look it really
builds beautifully and I absolutely love
the smell of it so I highly recommend
checking out that cover girl advanced
radiance foundation I've been pairing it
with my amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer in ivory this is a very very
thick heavy duty concealer I probably
will not repurchase because this is um
there is a dupe for this at the
drugstore the gamma glamma flage
concealer from hard candy is a dupe for
this it is very very thick I've been
wearing it under my eyes and also on any
areas that i have like hyperpigmentation
or things like that and i love it it is
kind of hard to blend you definitely
want to blend it with like a damp sponge
or something with that it can be hard
with your fingers or even a brush it
really kind of sets to your skin and
locks on like cement but it has amazing
coverage but again uh you know I'm just
trying to use this up I have probably
only a little bit left it's taking me
forever to go through this probably like
a year but the glamour flash one is or
the hard candy one thing camouflaged
concealer is a dupe so definitely look
into that if you like really heavy duty
coverage um my eyeliner this week I've
been wearing one every single day it's
the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil
in glitter rock this goes really nicely
with that eye palette that I just showed
you guys it's kind of a pretty kinky mob
sort of shade and it has tons and tons
of chunks of glitter in it but the
chunks of glitter don't irritate your
eye and they don't really like pick up
on the waterline but that is how I've
been wearing it on my waterline and also
on my tight line if i want to but it's
really pretty kind of rosy pink color
and it went really well with that eye
palette this week and then from mascara
I've been layering too as always and I
have been going through like smaller
sizes of products lately I really really
like that because I get a lot of these
like deluxe sized samples and things
like that and I've been trying to go
through them and actually sometimes it's
easier to control dwande when you have
like smaller mascaras like this but
they're the same exact thing is the full
size so you might as well use them up
but this is the benefit benefit roller
lash
and I have been wearing one layer of
this on the bottom this is kind of nice
it kind of just lengthens and kind of
fans them out nicely and then on top I
have been wearing one layer of the G
vonshay noir couture and i love the
brush for this it's got like three
little like bulbs that is what it looks
like really really cool and I love the
way that this kind of thickens up my
lashes so I think they look relatively
natural this week they're not clumpy
neither of these mascaras makes clumpy
lashes but I think that it's nice it's
buildable and it looks like I have
pretty long lashes so I've been liking
those two this week combined as far as
lip balm goes before I've been plying my
lip color in the morning I've been using
my soft licks soft lips cube in I think
this one is called brown sugar it has
sunscreen in it and I like it a lot it
tastes really good and then at nighttime
I have been wearing my Christian do you
are creme de rose lip balm this is like
a splurge product but it is as good as
they say smells like rose and it really
really moisturizes your lips a lot and
I'm a flute player I want to have really
moisturize lips and this is definitely
in my top five like favorite lip balms
it's up there with the bite beauty by
beauty and agave lip mask so love that I
have been setting my foundation with my
Holy Grail elf tone correcting powder
this is my favorite um setting powder of
all times I love it and I have liked it
like using it with this particular
covergirl foundation something I forgot
to mention about this is that it does
oxidize a little bit and it turns a
little darker this is the lightest shade
105 and it does kind of get a little
dark throughout the day and this tone
correcting powder can kind of lighten up
any kind of dark foundation if you apply
it heavily enough but this is what it
looks like it's got four different
colors you got pink blue green and
yellow it tone corrects it's amazing i
love the way it sits on top of the skin
it looks like skin it doesn't look like
you have heavy powder on top it is my
holy grail love it um for my cheeks this
week I've been loving my lorac unzipped
cheek palette this is Newt
me and I'm absolutely adoring it it is
twenty-five dollars on the altar com
website and these are the shades you get
these two shades right here are very
fall-like I love those I am wearing that
shade unapologetic today on my cheeks
but I played with every single one of
these this week the to top our math and
then the bottom have shimmer in them
gorgeous super pigmented you just don't
want to over blend because you will
blend the color right off your cheeks
because they are so soft and pigment in
all right lip colors this week I today I
am wearing cookie from colour-pop both
of them are lippie Stix from colour-pop
that's the only thing I've been wearing
on my lips this week so today i'm
wearing cookie this is just a nice
peachy nude sort of shade let me swatch
it for you guys you can see really
really beautiful easy formulation really
really comfortable on the lips I love
that and then the other one i've been
wearing this week is also from
colour-pop it's also a matte it is
called westie and this is like a more
pinky mob sort of color swatch that too
for you guys and I really really like
that one as well so those are the two
lip colors I've been wearing this week I
thought they paired really nicely with
that eye palette and the kind of pinky
naked three ish sort of colors that i
have been using on my face all right um
for priming the lorac behind the scenes
I primer I really love this I love this
primary it has a beautiful consistency
and it's just so easy to blend out on
the eyelid for my face I've been loving
at the Smashbox photo finish light
foundation this is probably a Holy Grail
um foundation or ugh foundation a primer
for my face like this is up there with
some of my favorites it is amazing or
something like my holy grails it is a
favorite i think it is a Holy Grail
uh-huh but it is really awesome i just
love the way it blends out it's not to
Silicon II but it's not too sticky it's
like the perfect combination love this
um and then for moisturizing my face in
the morning this week I've been using
the Jew a daily clarifying treatment oil
this is the balancing complex tiny tiny
little bottle but it lasted me at the
whole week and I still have extra in
here this is lovely because it is an oil
but it is it does not leave your skin
oily so um it's kind of got I don't know
it has the most interesting like
formulation to
if you have combination or oily skin and
you are scared to try oil i would
definitely recommend trying out this
jewel a one because you get all the
benefits of using oil on your face
without it being greasy it's awesome so
I've been using that in the morning I've
also been using in the morning the
Lancome advanced genifique this is a
serum I have gone to her to full sizes
of this before probably one or two years
ago this was like my go-to serum and it
just kind of reminded me of how great it
is I instantly within a week see a
difference in the clarity of my skin
when I use this so this is a really
really awesome serum been using that in
the morning and the other thing I've
been using in the morning is the Mario
Badescu strawberry face scrub and I love
this this is so nice this is great if
you have sensitive skin it has like
literally the most luxurious softest
creamiest hydrating formula and then
mixed in there you can see there are
actually little tiny strawberry seeds so
it's not super abrasive if you have
sensitive skin I think that you could
really use this and like it and yeah so
those are my favorites for the week I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did please give it a thumbs up and I'll
see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
