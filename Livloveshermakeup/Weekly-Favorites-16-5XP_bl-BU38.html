thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day i'm
filming my weekly favorites for you guys
i wasn't able to get it up yesterday
unfortunately my grandmother passed away
yesterday which was kind of difficult
and i just didn't feel like filming i'm
sure you guys understand but i did want
to get this video up so that i could
share with you guys what i had been
wearing and loving i guess last week and
then i'm going to change out my products
tonight so that I can try some different
stuff but anyway let's just get started
I'm going to start with makeup the first
two things I've been loving are these
two primers they are the time bomb face
primer it looks like this this is for
your face has a really really nice
wonderful texture to it a little bit
silicone II but it really really makes
your foundation go on flawlessly and
then for my eyes I've been loving the
elf eyelid primer in sheer this is like
a one or three dollar product and it's
awesome it's so so good really really
helps you shadows to stick all day I
haven't been wearing a ton of eyeshadow
the only ones that I've really been
wearing this week is from this little
quad this is the physicians formula um
Matt's collection quad I shadow in
Canyon classics and this is kind of like
a dupe for The Naked basics to it has
cool tones and then they also have a
different one that has warm tones in it
which reminds me of the first naked
basics so if you guys are looking for
kind of a dupe at the drugstore um you
know for the Naked basics palette these
are really really close so I've been
loving that I've just been popping one
color into my like transition you know
basically like right here into my just
basically as a transition I believe in
wearing a transition shade really all
week and today i'm wearing that lighter
one right there but i've been playing
around with you know all of them and
that like nice white creamy color is
really nice all over the lid so i've
been loving at something else I've been
doing this week um is wearing a gel
eyeliner on my lower lash line and I've
been using the tart what is this um
limited edition Amazonian clay a dual
liner it looks like this and I just take
any sort of small little brush and go
underneath my lower lash line and I
either go thin like I did today or I can
go thicker I think this just gives a
really really like open I'd sort of look
and you can see you get a bronzy shade
here
has a little bit of a sheen and then a
black shade which is like basically like
a black lacquer like not mad but you
know it still has a little bit of shine
I'm wearing the black one today really
really been liking that as well and then
on my waterline all week I've been
wearing my NYX slide on eyeliner and SL
0 for pure white I just feel like that
gives a really big difference between
the black eyeliner and the white on the
waterline just really really makes your
eyes look big and dull like I really
like that for mascaras I have been um
layering these two from covergirl the
first one is the full lash bloom and I
really really do like this it has a
really interesting little blonde um and
it looks like that starting to get a
little clumpy this one may have to go
soon the formula unfortunately starting
to get a little clumpy and then I've
been topping it with my covergirl the
super sizer which is one of my favorite
drugstore mascaras actually one of my
favorite mascaras in general of all time
so I love those two together on my lips
this week I've only been wearing one
shade and either I put it on really
really lightly like I did today and I
just kind of like tap it on or I can put
it on fully and get like full-blown
color but it is the Stila um color bomb
lipstick in the shade Alyssa and it's
got beautiful beautiful level silver and
gold packaging and as you can see in the
tube it looks really really dark and it
can come out that dark it has like a
brownish sort of undertone not so much
of berry undertone but it is so
comfortable to wear on the lips and you
can really really pack it on there or
you can just kind of dab it on and get
the look that I am wearing today alright
moving on as far as lip balms go um I
have been loving this one please don't
have the other one here I know I just
have this one this is the lip smackers
strawberry and cream I've been wearing
this all week I love this my lips have
been very trapped and that works like
miracles lovely it's great um foundation
Estee Lauder Double Wear up and loving
this this week love the full coverage it
gets and I really love it paired with
the Maybelline instant age rewind eraser
dark circle these make a really really
nice duo especially this brightening
shade as like a little pink base really
really opens up the under eye area makes
your eyes look very bright and pretty
absolutely love it as far as browse go
I've been loving my Revlon browse
to see this is probably the smoothest
creamiest pencil you will find you can
get it at the drugstore too but it's
just so easy to put on you get the
pencil side here and then you can flip
it over and get a tinted brow gel on the
other side which will help to keep
everything in place and also fill in any
areas that may have small gaps so I
really really love that my shade is dark
blonde um for my cheeks today I am
wearing the illamasqua powder blusher
dirt pile of a powder blusher in naked
rose and I've also been wearing my
palladium at blush this week and this
one is called bayberry so this is the
palladium at blush really really
gorgeous sort of berry color and these
are like four dollars really really
great deal and I love those completely
matte and then this is the naked row
shade from Illamasqua and that is the
one I'm wearing today it's a little more
natural but it does get it does give
like a little bit of a flush to the
Keeks I have been let's see here I'm
going to talk about this one first I
have been setting my foundation with the
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder this does give me a little bit of
a white cast so I go over it with the to
face no filters selfie powders I really
love these and I go in to this totally
toasted shade which has a little bit of
a sheen which is why I haven't been
wearing a highlight this week and I put
that basically all over my face to just
kind of warm it up after putting a Z
powder on so that is all the makeup step
I've been loving this week as far as um
let's see here Shampoo goes I've been
loving my shea moisture raw shea butter
moisture retention shampoo with seek
help and argan oil oh my gosh this
moisturizes your hair like no other if
you have dry hair curly course here you
will love this I have to be careful i
sometimes mix this with a different
shampoo so that i actually am not
putting too much moisture into my hair
because they do have fine hair that
tends to get way down quite easily but
this is an awesome awesome awesome
shampoo is natural it really doesn't
lather very well and i do recommend once
a week if you are using this go ahead
and use a like the Neutrogena anti
residue or a clarifying shampoo any kind
of clarifying shampoo because this can't
kind of build up in your hair and leave
a little bit of a film but overall it's
amazing it really does moisturize your
hair
I have been using the shea Tara rosehips
black soap facial wash it is the ancient
african beauty wisdom the stuff is
awesome i've been using this at night to
wash my face and you can either leave it
on for about two minutes or even like
five to ten minutes you could just leave
it on and you can feel it tinkling and
taking off the top layer of the skin or
like the dry skin on your face basically
you just kind of rub it in leave it
doesn't necessarily have a good smell it
smells very very natural which Shea Tara
is like a natural brand but you just
kind of let it sit there and it sits on
your face it starts to tingle and then
it will like literally clean your face
like an exfoliator it will take off that
top layer so you can do it that way or
the way that I've been doing it is just
using it with my clarisonic at night in
the shower and I love it it really
really does help to like moisturize my
skin and also take care of blemishes and
fight any breakouts that I have without
over-drying if that makes sense so if
you are interested in a good facial
cleanser that will not dry you out and
it can also help with anti-aging
properties definitely check out the rose
hips black soap from shakyra alright i
have been using at this i'm sure you
guys can tell this is the shampoo shower
gel and bubble bath from philosophy this
is the pumpkin icing flavor sent
whatever um and this is really really
nice I did use this a little bit as a
shampoo mixed in with the Shea Moisture
this week I used it as a shower gel and
I also used it as they bubble bath days
as you guys can probably tell i
basically almost have used it up it
smells so good it works so well for
everything you can use it to shampoo
it's not the greatest shampoo but it
will work as a shampoo especially if
you're mixing it with another one um it
is amazing as a shower gel it really
really lathers up nicely and it makes
really nice luxurious soft bubbles as a
bubble bath so I love that alright um
this time bomb skincare white tea I
perfection gel with Brazil nut from the
bomb is awesome this is an awesome
awesome awesome I cream or eye gel it
has the most interesting kind of
silicone II texture and it really really
really hydrates well sometimes I'll take
it underneath my eyes and even on the
sides like right here and even anywhere
where I have like fine lines from
like this and it is awesome I just can't
believe how well this works it is really
really good i highly recommend i'm
really glad that I checked this out I
had never really tried any skincare
stuff from the bomb but wow really
really good um this is the mask I've
been wearing this week it is the peter
thomas roth 24 karat gold mask pure
luxury lift and firm mask I really
didn't think this would go a very long
way but oh my gosh it's a very very
thick luxurious texture I think I got
some all my toes but it really really
lasted me basically all week and I used
this every other day I basically use a
face mask every other day which some
people may think is too much but I use
it every time I take a bath which is
every other day so um I really really
liked it I felt like it did have some
nice of brightening and firming
properties to my skin and I don't know
if I would purchase a full size of it
but it really was luxurious and fun to
use that this week all right I have also
been loving and using my trap tree hat I
was going to say Trey hat no tree hat
tree hut Shea sugar scrub in passion
fruit and guava I like to use a body
scrub once a week and go everywhere over
my body and this was the one this week
it really really smelled good let me
open it up take a whiff oh my gosh it's
so fresh and like it smells like fresh
guava like it smells so good i never am
scared Ron when it comes to tree hot
body scrubs all of them fell amazing and
they just do such a great job they don't
leave a filmy residue on your skin
they're awesome they rinse off clean and
I love them so that has been a favorite
this week for fragrances I have been um
doing my DKNY fresh blossom or pairing
my d key DKNY be delicious fresh blossom
it looks like this um it's like one of
the little apple perfume kind of things
and I am almost out of this I have used
a lot of this I love it it's a very very
fresh smelling and smells like fresh
flowers and normally I would wear this
sent during like the spring or summer
but there was something about it that
just I don't know I just wanted to wear
it this week and I've been loving it so
loving that I'm almost done with it like
I said and it pairs beautifully
the bath and Bodyworks pleasures pear
berry body splash this is like a mix of
pear and berries and it is ah it's like
a roma therapy if you love like the
smell of fruits it's like fruit
aromatherapy okay it smells so good
highly recommend all right I'm for
cleansers in the morning I've been using
my be fine food skincare exfoliating
cleanser with brown sugar sweet almond
and Oates it deeply cleanse to gently
slop slop slop away and moisturize I
don't know to say that word SLO ugh slop
slop like cole slaw um island is
naturally high in minerals and removes
impurities brown sugar and oats calm and
heal the skin this non-irritating light
buffing cleanser clears away dull and
damaged skin it is allergen free
fragrance free paraben free and
vegetarian proteins in there and this
stuff is awesome you take a little bit
out and it is so darn gritty okay like
if you cannot handle a really deep deep
scrub you cannot handle this this is
really really really deep it's got like
literally pieces of almond in it and you
just um take it and you kind of wet your
face start you know massaging it in and
it turns from a gritty scrub into a foam
on your face it is the coolest thing
ever I absolutely love it all right as
far as serums go in the morning I've
been loving my cuddly resveratrol lift
firming serum the smells really good it
pairs beautifully with the night cream
that i purchased my boyfriend also likes
this thank you to the subscriber who
told me that these were a little um what
is it like those weekly specials from
sephora i really we have the night cream
and i really wanted to try the serum but
this is like literally like 108 dollars
for a serum so thank you to my
subscriber who told me that it was on
air as a weekly special and that you
could get like nice level deluxe I
samples all right and then um i have
been loving my revitalizing
black hydration gel as my morning facial
moisturizer this is really really cool
it really kind of refines your pores and
kind of tingles as you put it on i
really really like it i got it in like a
500-point kit from sephora when i had
the little i picked a little bow shock
it and it is a cooling gel moisturizer
that provides ultra
hydration as it refines the skin texture
brighten skin clarity and minimizes the
look of pores instantly in overtime I
had a feeling that this might have had
some kind of acid in it or something
like that because I did feel like I was
a little sensitive to the sun this week
so I think maybe this is better to wear
at night but i really liked wearing it
in the morning because it just had that
really nice cooling sensation and then
Oh last thing I've been loving this week
this yes to grapefruit correct and
repaired dark circle correcting eye
cream oh my gosh you guys I swear to you
my eye creams this week this was such a
relief or like winna winna chicken
dinner okay those were so good but this
one is amazing i used this in the
morning it has kind of a yellow
undertone so it really counteracts any
sort of dark circles you may have but
the most amazing thing about this has an
amazing smell the texture is great if
you have really really dry skin this
probably won't be for you it smells so
good you guys just like grapefruit um
but if you have really really dry skin
around your eyes this is not going to be
enough for you it's a little more
lightweight but I absolutely loved it I
felt like it gave the perfect amount of
hydration my concealer went on
beautifully over this these two go so
well together the instant age rewind and
this won't be beautifully on top of that
I can't even tell you guys like just so
smoothly absolutely love that um but it
just smells so good it goes on so nicely
it gives the perfect amount of moisture
without being too greasy this was
probably like I mean I know these are
all fright favorites but this and like
the time bomb these were like the best
favorites of the week they were so good
those were awesome awesome products and
I think that really good luck with the
yes to grapefruit line I don't have good
luck with the yes to cucumber or the yes
to what's the other one carrots i don't
think i have good luck with those two i
haven't tried the blueberry one yet but
the yes to grapefruit I've really good
luck with this particular like line from
that brand if that makes sense I really
like their cleansing wipes as well
really luxurious a nice so highly
recommend that minute all right that is
it those are my favorites I will be
