happy sunday i hope you guys are having
a wonderful weekend i am here with my
weekly favorites for you guys so let's
just get right into it i'm going to
start with hair care because i have had
really good luck this week with hair
products so the first one I want to talk
about is from the otx brand or the
organics brand this is the ever straight
brazilian keratin therapy anti-breakage
serum it has an exclusive blend of
antioxidant rich coconut oil along with
lush keratin proteins to strengthen and
soften the hair while avocado oil and
coconut butter smooth the cuticle four
straight strong tresses adding a
brilliant glow and luminescent shine I
put this in my hair when it is damp out
of the shower and I absolutely love it
it smells amazing it smells like Kukui
nut or something like oh I don't even
know like cocoa butter or something like
that smells really really awesome I
absolutely love it and I love how silky
this makes my hair it does have keratin
in it so if you already use a shampoo
and things like that that have carrots
in it you might want to be careful too
much keratin can actually cause your
hair to break off and make it really
really dry but this is awesome I really
really love that really really smooths
down my hair I put it from about my
earlobe down and I just love the way it
makes my hair feel the other product
that I put in as like a leave-in
conditioner is the it's a ten silk
express miracle silk leavin I've been
using this this week I think I showed
the keratin one a few weeks ago in my
favorites I love these it's a 10 sprays
and this one really really makes your
hair silky so I've been absolutely
adoring that I spray that all over my
head as my leave in conditioner before I
put that serum in and then as a
detangler I've been loving the Shea
Moisture raw shea butter extra moisture
detangler this has argan oil and seek
help in it i believe ya seek help and
argan oil and it's fantastic actually
comes out like a thick like jelly if you
guys can see can you guys see that you
rub it between your hands and it kind of
turns into an oil and you put it through
damp hair and it's awesome I don't
recommend using this on dry hair it will
actually make your hair like a little
crunchy and weird but it's awesome on
damp care for a shampoo this week my
redken frizz dismissed sulfate free
shampoo this stuff is incredible
I have very naturally fine hair that is
naturally straight like it is today this
is how my hair naturally air dries and
it gets really really sort of frizzy
sometimes especially during the winter
and this really has been helping this
week with frizz so I've been absolutely
loving that alright and the last two
things for hair actually the last three
things are you guys like I said I've
been having a lot of good luck with hair
stuff this week I'm this Sebastian style
bird 9 multi benefit hairspray love this
I'm wearing it today I've been wearing
my hair up a lot this week and my hair
like i said is fine and it tends to slip
out ponytails and funds really easily so
this has been great it actually kind of
moisturizes the hair it feels like
you're spraying like water onto your
hair it's really really nice so I enjoy
that as far as shine goes you guys know
I've been really into this oh gx
sunkissed blonde lemon highlights
highlight activating citrus oil mist I
don't think it does anything for my
blonde hair I think you could use this
no matter what hair color you have but
what I use it for is just a shine spray
I'll spray a little bit into my hair and
then run it through my ponytail or if
I'm wearing my hair down I'll run it on
my ends and it really just gives a lot
of iridescent sand shine to your hair
and it makes it look really really silky
and beautiful so I've been loving that
and I'm going to switch that out for I
think I have like a frizz what's it
called frizz ease or whatever I think I
have some sort of shine spray that I'm
going to try this week instead of this
one but um I will be coming back to this
in my stash Oh be making the rounds
because that stuff is fantastic and then
for dry shampoo you guys know even when
I like the day that I have washed my
hair I put dry shampoo in just for some
lift and volume I've been loving my
batiste or batiste dry shampoo in the
wild sense this is sassy and during the
wild sent it smells so good and it just
makes it that much more fun to use so
love that next thing abreva yes this has
been a must-have for me this week I
don't know if you guys even notice
because I feel like I'm kind of turning
my head like this so that you can
completely see but I had the worst cold
store or fever blister of my life right
here on the side of my mouth
ah I can't tell you how hard it is as a
flute player to be dealing with fever
blisters and cold sores it is absolutely
horrible but it has been there it is now
finally starting to crust over after
using this for like five days in a row
but this has helped a lot it's been open
and like sore and just a horrible so
anyway abreva work I've been loving that
um as far as fragrance goes this weeks I
have been pairing these two fragrances
from Victoria's Secret the first one is
passion struck and this is kind of
fruity um let's see if I can describe it
yeah it's a little more fruity but I
definitely has some warm undertone kind
of like coconut or maybe vanilla in it I
really really like that and then the
body mist I've been pairing it with is
the pink warm and cozy which definitely
has a little more um it smells like
coconut and vanilla so I feel like these
two pair nicely together because they
have some sort of similar undertone but
I really like it I mean I like the mix
of fruity with something a little more
cozy smelling because I don't know I
just like the way they bounce off each
other it's kind of like you can mix and
match for whatever season it is and for
fall like normally I would wear this in
the summer but these two mix together
make a perfect scent for the Fall all
right these Shane waste your african
black soap body washed with oats aloe
and vitamin E this stuff is awesome I
have been using this as a body wash and
oh my gosh okay let me just tell you
right away it really smells horrible
haha look really really bad oh my god no
it really really smells bad you guys I
can't even describe it kind of smells
like dirt yeah kind of look like dirt to
you can see there's small little
exfoliating particles in there but you
guys this will clear up any sort of body
breakouts you have any sort of like
razor burn things like that this clears
it up it says it calms clears and heels
african black soap a time-honored beauty
secrets made from palm ash tamarind
extract and plantain peel helps to calm
and clear but blemishes and troubled
skin oats help soothe while absorbing
excess oil this all-purpose naturally
balancing wash combines african black
soap with the healing and hydrating
properties of shea butter
applied to wash cloth or hands or entire
body or add a capful to warm water to
create a spa bath so you can also use
this as a spa bath I haven't really been
doing that since i've been using
something else for my bath but overall
i've been loving this it really really
does clear up i get tiny little
blemishes like right here yeah usually
like right where i spray perfume i get
them like right here on my chest and a
little bit on my back so this has really
helped to clear those little didn't even
blemish the others just like those
little bumps it just helps clear up any
sort of bumps you may have and razor
burn so really really awesome been
loving that as far as bubble bath go
this week but this isn't actually a
bubbly product but this is the bath and
body works aromatherapy stress relief
eucalyptus spearmint bath soak it's just
those little bath crystals and I put
about a capsule or two into warm running
water oh and this sent to you guys I
love this eucalyptus spearmint scent
from bath and body works I have a lot of
these and the luxury bath products from
the aromatherapy line I love these so
this has definitely been a favorite and
it kind of makes the bath water like a
little milky it doesn't make bubbles by
any means but it is still a little milky
and its really really wonderful at
nighttime i have been using my kerry
grin whip whip this seems to not be
interfering with the abreva that i've
been putting on my lips this one is the
peppermint one and it is the radiant
formula so it's got a little bit of a
tint to it but these are awesome you can
pick between cinnamon and peppermint and
the other one that i have is cinnamon I
prefer cinnamon / peppermint but I
wanted to try this one out and this
one's pretty much brand new the other
one I have almost used up I love at this
product it's super super thick and
luxurious and moisturizing very
comparable to the bite beauty agave lip
mask in my opinion so I love that um
body scrub they treat hush a sugar scrub
last week I mentioned uh the same exact
thing except it's not the scent i
mentioned the passion fruit and guapa
one i believe it was but i have this one
I decided to use it this week this is
the Hawaiian Kukui sent you guys oh my
gosh I like this one way more than the
passion fruit and guava sent it is so
wonderful oh my gosh see if I can open
it oh oh my gosh it just smells so warm
and luxurious I really really like the
color it's like read it like a ready
brown color oh my gosh but it smells so
good it kind of smells like um Hawaiian
tropics sunscreen I know that sounds
weird but Hawaiian Tropic makes the
yummiest Falleen sunscreen it kind of
smells similar to that it is just so
good i love this hawaiian Kakui one
highly highly recommend the passion
fruit in guava one is really great as
well but this week I switched it out for
the scent and I was like wow it's
perfect for fall alright on my face at
night after i put on my retinol cream i
have been topping it with the revlon
eternit when t7 moisture cream with
progenitus alright this is old school
baby like old school this is what your
grandma used to slather on her face okay
it is a thick thick white cream that
smells like grandma's perfume not
necessarily a bad thing just doesn't
smell very fresh and young if that makes
sense it smells a little just a little
different I actually really like it but
it is this really really thick white
cream as you guys can see and you rub it
in and it turns into basically like an
oil on the skin after rubbing it in you
only need a small amount descent it can
be a little overpowering if you have
sensitive skin you are not going to like
this you will probably have a reaction
from it it is that strong but this stuff
my gosh when I wake up in the morning my
skin looks like a eight-year-old skin
huh like an eight-year-old skin like
literally like a little baby but like it
is looks so smooth and the fine lines
look really nice and plumped up and I'm
just very very impressed so they
recommend putting it um they recommend
putting up fourth to a half a teaspoon
of cream onto your neck and face massage
with firm upward strokes until cream
disappears and it says leave on
overnight
so that's kind of cool but this is like
old school you can find this in the
Revlon makeup aisle except it took way
at the bottom and it's just it's so
funny I guess that there's been a lot of
like controversy about this ingredient
progenitus I don't even know if it's
like estrogen or what helped me what it
is I was reading up a little bit last
night and I could not get like a clear
definitive answer but um I like it I I
like the way my skin looks in the
morning so I've been using that in
liking that a lot this week and let's
get into makeup shall we so I'm for
makeup this week the it cosmetics feel
the moment anti-aging ultra hydrating
sensory awaking primers serum I promised
you guys i did a halt last week and I
told you guys I would do a follow-up how
I have not used all the products that I
got yet so there will not be a follow-up
hall until I use all the products but i
have used this primer and i absolutely
love it i have the little dropper thing
here and i just take whatever is on the
dropper that little thing fell off um
but whatever is on the dropper i run my
hands over it and put it on it is so
thick and so hydrating you guys and it
really really does smell good but you
only need the smallest amount which is
great because this is very expensive
it's like a fifty-dollar primer but it
is everything that you know except it is
basically another it cosmetics little
product again these were in my hall the
only products that i haven't used from
the hall yet are the bye bye pores and
the was it the it girl red lipstick and
liner and i obviously i'm not going to
do a follow up all three guys until I
use those but these are awesome these
are the lip vitality the vitality lip
flush indigenous a quoi which looks like
this it is what I've been wearing on my
lips all week um it basically just takes
on the ph of your lips not really the ph
i would just say depending on the warmth
of your lips it takes on a really pretty
pinky fleshy color so i've been wearing
that um flush and then I top on top of
it I top on top of it a top on top of it
on top of it I posed to the vitality
gloss stain in jenison quoi and this
gives a little more color a little more
color punch
definitely a little more pinky and it
definitely looks a little more like a
gloss but I have the two of them
combined on my lips today love it
beautiful really looks like fresh
beautiful pink lips so I like that a lot
as far as blushes go I've been loving my
hard candy um are these the bakes
blushes yeah blush crush baked blushes
in honeymoon and living doll this is
honeymoon it is a gorgeous peachy color
absolutely gorgeous you can see the
iridescent in there that iridescent get
your vessels does show up on the skin
this is living doll this is the one I'm
wearing today absolutely keep beautiful
they both have a silver undertone and
you can see that they kind of show up on
the cheek however i have put another
highlight on and the highlight i'm
wearing is my NARS Copacabana
illuminator this is a liquid illuminator
this is beautiful i've been taking the
smallest amount maybe like that much
rubbing it between my fingers and then
patting it on my cheekbone area i
haven't been putting it down my notes or
anything else like that just on my
cheekbone area but this is beautiful i
thought it would pair nicely with the
blushes because again it has a silvery
undertone can you guys see oh gosh that
illuminator is so beautiful it is so
beautiful but anyway those care really
nicely those blushes with the NARS
Copacabana because again they have that
gorgeous silvery undertone you don't
necessarily even need a highlight with
those blushes because they really do put
on quite a bit of Sheen to the skin not
necessarily shimmer but she they don't
have chunks of glitter glitter or
anything like that but definitely a
sheen and they're not the most pigmented
um but you can build up the color and
sometimes I feel like this silvery
undertone builds up a little quicker
than the color does but it'll get there
just keep working at it all right as far
as I primers I've been loving my benefit
Air Patrol this is such an easy
wonderful little eye primer to use it
really really feels thin and easy to put
on the eyelid area it just is it's like
it literally feels like you're putting
BB cream on your eyelids so I really
really love that as far as mascara I've
been using my Urban Decay subversion
lash primer so it's my favorite lash
primer and I've been topping it with my
a two-faced better than sex mascara
another favorite of mine as far as
eyeshadow goes this week this little
bare minerals I love this packaging look
at that rose gold this very minerals um
ready eyeshadow this is the eighth point
Oh formula it's in the posh neutrals you
get the names on the back this is a
beautiful little palette really love the
color scheme going on in here I think
it's just gorgeous you get a lot of
interesting colors that you normally
wouldn't see and a lot of different
palettes lots of cool undertones I'm
wearing this pretty kind of topi gold
color today in my crease and then on my
eyelid I'm wearing that kind of purply
color really pretty they all really are
flattering um like paired with each
other they're really really pretty but
um absolutely love that little pellets a
lot really enjoying that alright
eyeliner I've been just wearing my Laura
Geller icare waterproof eyeliner eye
brightener and this is in the shade i
think banana or something like that
that's what i've been wearing as
eyeliner all week in my you know
waterline was this a lower lash line
nope on my waterline that's what i've
been wearing really just gives a nice
brightening powers to it you don't have
to retouch because it's not like a black
eyeliner where you have to go back in
and swats around with it really really
easy um and let's see here as far as
coverage for my face I've actually been
wearing a CC cream all week and it's
funny because I have actually been
having some issues I've been breaking
out this week and I was very surprised
that I've been reaching for CC cream
because this doesn't have nearly as good
at coverage as a lot of my foundations
but this is the Stila CC color
correcting cream with broad-spectrum SPF
20 it is a color correcting cream
provides sheer buildable coverage with a
lightweight satin finish revolutionary
green base and micro encapsulated
pigments color correct upon application
and adapt to skin tone and it really
does do that it comes out and it is
literally like green as you guys can see
and you blend it into your skin and it
just kind of takes on the color of your
skin
it is very very moisturizing if you have
dry skin or aging skin you would really
really like this but just keep in mind
not a lot of coverage in this product um
but I don't know I've been okay with
that and I feel like it does cover what
needs to be covered yes you can still
see you know my acne scars and a little
bits of pimples sticking out but it
covers what needs to be covered and I've
been pairing that with my Maybelline
master conceal by face studio camouflage
and concealer in 10 fair and I've been
loving this I feel like it's just so
easy to blend and it's so um moisturized
I find it very moisturizing on my skin
so I really hoping to join that and then
to set everything together I've been
setting yes does that everything
together yes revlon colorstay this
powder this is ben translucent it's
amazing it's so good it just sets
everything it's beautiful really keeps
me Matt and I absolutely love it so I
yeah those were all of my favorites for
this week I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you're having a fantastic
weekend and I'll see you my next one bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
