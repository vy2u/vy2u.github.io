thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a really really
fantastic weekend I'm actually looking
out my window right now and we are
literally having a blizzard here if you
live in Wisconsin you know what I'm
talking about and yeah it's actually
really really cool the first snow of the
year but anyway I am filming this today
which is a saturday i normally filmed
these videos on sundays however tomorrow
i'm actually doing a collaboration with
my friend Kristen or mama loves mascara
here on youtube so i thought i would
just fill in this today so i have a lot
of stuff like a lot a lot a lot of stuff
to share with you guys so let's just get
right into it the first thing i've been
loving this week is the cleaning clear
morning burst facial cleansers whose oil
free it's got bursting beads it smells
like oranges it really kind of rinses
clean on the skin it's wonderful i use
this in the morning it really wakes me
up i love the scent and i just love the
like tingling sensation i get on my face
when i use it but i have mentioned this
before it is like a consistent favorite
basically but i've been using that this
week and loving it the second thing i've
been loving is actually a shave cream i
picked up a pack of three of these at
sam's club for seven dollars so i will
have a bees around for a while this is
the skintimate raspberry rain and this
is just like their signature one
everybody has used this um I don't know
lately i've been using really really
heavy moisturizing thick sort of shaving
creams and when i switch back to this I
realized like this is so nice like
you're really really it foams up on the
skin and you can see exactly like where
you need shave and it's just so nice so
I love that the next thing I have been
loving is from Oscar blondie this is the
dry conditioner spray it says it renews
shine and detangles I spray this on my
ends and I really like the way that they
look it is just really nice it's like
different to have a dry conditioner um
it's kind of like a dry shampoo it just
kind of sprays out but it adds shine and
it detangles and it makes your hair
really nice and silky so I've been
loving that the next thing is actually a
toothpaste I know that's kind of odd but
if you guys saw my Sephora haul I did a
few weeks ago I did a bunch of like gift
sets and things like that it was
basically just a gift set Sephora haul
you would have seen that I got like a
set of six of these Marvis
little tiny toothpastes and I love this
one oh I just dropped it this one is the
Jasmine mint um sent or taste and it
tastes so good if you love Jasmine you
will absolutely love this so I have been
loving that toothpaste um for masking
this week I've been loving my Fremen
feeling beautiful golden grain
brightening mass this is actually for
dry skin it hydrates and it brightens
it's really lovely it has tiny little
like flecks of gold in it and it really
really smells good has a very very fresh
scent to it and it feels very nice and
cooling you could probably pop this in
the refrigerator and put it on your skin
and get a really really refreshing nice
cooling sensation but I really liked it
I feel like it does brighten my skin
quite a bit and I use that basically
every other day this week the next thing
I've been loving is my simple cleansing
micellar water i love this for removing
swatches when i'm doing videos i love
this for removing excess i make up like
in the morning when i wake up it's
amazing love this product i also been
loving i think I've mentioned this
before but my sheer blonde go blonder
controlled lightning spray this is for
your hair I've been spraying this on my
roots and I really think it helps like
between touch-ups you guys know I do a
full foil on my hair I'm gradually going
basically platinum blonde so this has
actually been very very helpful to help
any kind of root or new growth that kind
of pops through also the Garnier Fructis
sleek and shine intensely smooth for
frizzy dry unmanageable hair this is a
leave-in conditioner this whole tub
which is like 10.2 fluid ounces or 300
ml this is like three or four dollars at
the drugstore you can't beat the price
you get such a large amount of product
and it smells really good it just smells
like typical garnier fructis products
like kiwi and tropical fruits and um I
wouldn't say that it's necessarily
really like moisturizing for the hair
but it does make it very sleek and I
don't have as many like frizzies like
all over my hair when I use this so I
really really do like that and lovin it
this week another product i've been
loving is actually a foot lotion not a
foot cream a foot lotion this is also
from Freeman Beauty it is the barefoot
dragon fruit foot lotion it has tea tree
oil and it helps soothe tired
I've been loving this I put it on it's
really nice because it's not too thick
it literally is like a lotion so it
sinks in really quickly but I do put on
socks right away after putting this on
and it just sinks in very quickly it
smells really good and I think it does
help um my feet when they're sore if you
walk around a lot or if you have a job
where you're constantly on your feet you
would probably like this I think tea
tree oil really is a very very soothing
and kind of cooling all right I have
been loving these two products from OGX
these are the nourishing coconut milk
shampoo and the nourishing coconut milk
anti-breakage serum these in combination
with each other are wonderful if the
shampoo smells amazing and it lathers
beautifully it has a wonderful
consistency to it and the anti-breakage
serum just adds a lot of shine to the
hair I put it basically from like my ear
down and I just feel like it adds a lot
of shine without weighing my hair down I
would say two pumps of this is
definitely enough on the ends of my hair
and it smells amazing and I wouldn't say
that this is necessarily moisturizing it
just kind of helps like keep your hair
buried like resilient um and just I
don't know I feel like it helps
strengthen the hair so i really really
love that as well really nice if you
have dry hair you'd probably really like
that a lot i've been loving the tony
moly tangerine brightening hand cream
comes in this adorable little packaging
like a tangerine it smells amazing it
smells very similar to the Satsuma sent
from the body shop so if you like that
sent you would probably really like this
it smells very very similar and this one
actually has little tiny like
brightening particles in it I don't even
know if you can tell but it's got these
tiny tiny little sparkles in it so I
think that kind of helps brighten up the
look of your hands but i really really
love that i've been enjoying it a lot um
the next thing i've been loving for
moisturizing my body I've really only
been using it on like my knees and my
elbows areas that are super dry right
now but the trader joes coconut body
butter is amazing you guys this
literally is the consistency and smells
like coconut frosting it has the
consistency of frosting and literally it
smells like coconut frosting it's not
like an artificial coconut smell it
really smells like a coconut cupcake or
something really really nice and really
does smell like coconut oil if you guys
have like extra virgin um excuse me if
you have like extra virgin olive oil or
like the real stuff you know like the
real kind of unprocessed coconut oil I
have a little container of nutiva back
there which is a coconut oil that's
really really good it smells like that
so this is definitely good and I feel
like it's very very natural and very
nice I have been loving these two little
perfumes or sprays together first is the
coach poppy blossom perfume how cute is
that packaging I have like three or four
of these not the same fragrance but in
the same kind of fragrance family and
this one is the poppy blossom but I just
love that packaging but this smells
great it really has a strong floral
scent to it and I have really been
enjoying pairing it with this bath and
bodyworks holiday traditions cranberry
twinkle fragrance mist I didn't really
think that something fruity like this
would pair well with a very floral scent
but these actually go together really
really nicely and I enjoy them a lot
alright moving on I've been loving this
coat alee Beauty elixir this is
basically just a facial mist I use it in
the morning after i finished my skincare
ritual and also at night after i finish
my skincare ritual unfortunately i kind
of got a bad batch this little spray
thing does not come out evenly it's
driving me crazy but i love the product
inside it has it really really kind of
herbally scent to it and it kind of
tingles your face when it's on so really
really beautiful product I absolutely
love that um what else let's see here I
have been loving this moisturizer in the
morning this is the Estee Lauder
revitalizing supreme global anti-aging
creme it's got a wonderful fragrance to
it and I really like the consistency it
is not too oily and it also isn't like
you know it's not like it's not
moisturizing enough it's the perfect
perfect balance and i think i will pick
up a full size of this I've been mixing
it with three drops of my polished
choice resist moisture renewal oil
booster this is for dry or very dry skin
highly recommend this product if you
have dry skin you just add this into
your moisturizer or your serum and it
gives a little extra boost of hydration
it's got argan oil and ceramides and
it's awesome highly highly recommend
that and I like the way those two go
together I've been using this visine
multi-action eye allergy relief every
time I go outside nowadays my eyes start
to run and water and that makes that you
know that makes my eye makeup basically
run down my face it's really gross this
has been helping a lot this week
especially if I'm doing kind of a smoky
or look like I have today on my eyes
this has been helping a lot so I highly
recommend that I know that's kind of
random but I love it um my nails this
week I've been loving this Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure nail polish in
835 golden rust the reason i love this
is because it has that brown undertone
in it already so you don't have to apply
like a dark color and then put the
sparkles on top literally it's like
built into one so it's really really
quick and easy do you guys know what i
mean when i say that like sometimes you
put on the base color and then you put
the sparkles on top it's just like an
extra step that kind of takes a while so
I've been loving that this is just kind
of built into one and I love the color I
love that gold color with the brown I
think it's beautiful alright um as far
as I creams go this week in the morning
I've been loving my la 7 CC 7 effects in
1 CC eye brightening cream I really love
the consistency of this and the color is
like color correcting it's got that kind
of peachy salmon e color to it which
really really helps reduce any sort of
blue or like undertones you may have in
your skin so if you have dark circles
you would probably like that a lot I've
been loving my Lancome advanced
genifique youth activating concentrate
this is a serum this is beautiful i
absolutely love it i would definitely
purchase a full size of that i actually
have gone through i think 3 or 4 full
sizes of that in the past as far as lips
go my lips have been very dry i've been
loving my bite beauty agave lip mask
this is amazing it really does feel like
a mask it is very very thick and sticky
but it is absolutely incredible highly
highly highly recommend and I've also
been loving my glam glow this is the
pout mud this one says the wet lip balm
treatment this is actually the scrub the
labeling was wrong on here but um I love
that it's got like a pop-rock sort of
thing going on so you put this on your
lips and then when you mix water on top
of it
starts to like fizzle on your lips
basically and sizzle it's really cool
it's got a nice pepperminty smell to it
and it does exploit my lips very well
alright moving on into makeup actually
no not yet sorry I have two more
products that are not makeup related the
chlorine floral I makeup remover I
really like this I got this in my allure
sample society box for this month it's
really nice it does kind of tingle a
little bit but it never burns your eyes
but it has a wonderful scent and it
really does remove my makeup well I've
been wearing a waterproof mascara this
week that i'm going to show you guys and
that has removed everything off of my
eyes at night and then as far as bubble
baths go this week i've been loving my
beauty smoothie from Ulta this is the
buttercream cupcake three in one shower
gel shampoo and bubble bath this is
amazing it smells so good these are
comparable to the philosophy
three-in-one products you know the
philosophy like shampoo bubble bath
shower gel sort of things these are very
comparable and a lot cheaper so highly
recommend I need to get a big size of
these because especially in that scent
because they are like a really good deal
also all right now we're moving into
makeup the first thing I have been
loving is this primer from Yves Saint
Laurent or YSL this is the tushy clot
blur primer beautiful packaging and I
just love the consistency of this it
just feels really really nice on the
skin it has a very like silicone II feel
to it however it's not so silicon II
that it like balls up on your skin or
dries your skin out it really just
glides on beautifully and it smells
amazing so I've been wearing that all
over my face and for my eyes I've been
loving my Too Faced shadow insurance
glitter glue glitter glitter bonding
eyeshadow primer I've not been wearing
glitter this week but let me tell you
this makes your like it just helps with
any sort of creasing it makes your
eyeshadow stay on all day it's just a
very very tacky but I actually really
love it this is probably one of my
favorite eye primers before i put on my
lipstick this week i've been using my
Maybelline Baby Lips this is the
quenched one this is just one of the
clear lip balms and this one has SPF 20
it smells really good and it moisturizes
my lips nicely
and then as far as lip products go today
I am wearing um well yeah this week I've
been loving these two faced la creme
lipsticks the one I'm wearing today is
the shade wham and it's a beautiful
beautiful kind of metallic berry color
it's got tons and tons of little tiny
shimmers in it but it still has a
beautiful consistency that is what I'm
ring on my lips today and then I have
been tapping it with the Stila what are
these called um the Stila metal lip
glosses and so I have been peering the
wam shade with this one right here this
is called garnet you guys can see that
these go really really nicely together I
have that on top it gives us really
beautiful kind of iridescent stew the
lips and also makes them look bigger
because it has that wonderful wonderful
kind of Sheen to it so I've been pairing
those two and then the other pairing
that I've been using is the Too Faced la
creme lipstick in nude beach which is a
pinky nude shade and I have been pairing
that with the Stila metals lip gloss in
rose quartz so those go together really
beautifully too so I either have been
doing kind of a colored lip like this or
a completely nude lip this week loving
those I think they pair beautifully
together as far as eyeliners go on my
waterline this week I have been using
the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye
pencils in mug shot and smoke out mug
shot is kind of like a topi color really
really pretty and then smoked out is the
one I'm wearing today it's a very very
deep dark almost black chocolatey brown
color and the eyeshadow palette I've
been using this week is the Ciotti
London Olivia Palermo collaboration I
actually and giving one of these away
for my three thousand subscriber
giveaway so that was the video right
before this definitely go and let me
know what your favorite holiday food is
if you would like to be entered into
that but this is the smoldering eye
palette and it's absolutely stunning
I've been using this all week I today
have on a lot of like those smoky kind
of blue shades like on the upper part of
my eye and them on the lower lash line
and wearing that really pretty kind of
cranberry shade but really really
beautiful I love um I love the look of
this palette and I'm actually wearing
this kind of cranberry shade in my outer
be today too
really like the way it turned out
normally for my outer V I put like a
darker color in but because i had this
dark gray kind of smoky color in my
crease I kind of put a warmer color on
the outer V it's very very subtle you
can barely tell but I kind of like it
it's like an inside-out the sort of
thing going on because normally you put
a darker color there but anyway this is
a beautiful palette and it pairs
beautifully with those eyeliners as far
as highlighters go this week I've been
loving my becca jaclyn hill or what is
this called champagne glow palette and i
have been using the shades pearl and
champagne pops so those two right there
i am wearing pearl today I think it's
beautiful i absolutely love it um
foundation and concealer actually come
from the same line same brand this is
the super-state better skin skin
transforming foundation in 10 porcelain
a great shade if you have fair skin I
love this foundation it is very very
buildable it's got medium to buildable
like you can go full-on coverage it's
beautiful I love the way it applies with
a Beauty Blender a buffing brush
anything like that and um I've been
pairing that with the super-state better
skin camouflage correcting concealer
love this under my eyes I love it on any
spots I might have little pimples or
breakouts it's wonderful it really
really matches my skin tone really well
also all right um I have been loving
this product this is the it cosmetics by
jamie kern this is the bye bye pores
poreless finish HD micro powder I
thought all of these were similar like
the silica sorta powders the one from
owl the one from NARS things like that
this is the best one I have ever tried
so when I do my makeup declutter I may
have to get rid of the other ones that I
have because honestly I can't imagine
not reaching for this one now I use this
as the buffing technique after I have
finished my whole face and I buff
everything in on top like with this and
it's just absolutely stunning and
gorgeous and it just makes your skin
look so smooth and beautiful so I'm
obsessed with that I will have my
follow-up hall on my a cosmetic stuff
coming up next week I still have one
more product that I need to try out but
then i will give you guys my opinion and
then i actually use this up completely
this week i'm definitely going to
repurchase this is the Smashbox photo
finish primer water I like to spray this
on after i put my primers
and I don't like to spray it after
because I feel like when I'm using a
silica powder if I use like a makeup
setting spray it kind of melted away if
i have it on top so i actually like to
spray this after using my primers before
i put on my foundation and stuff really
love that awesome product as far as
blushes go this week i have been
reaching for this Z palette right here
that is actually filled with makeup geek
blushes and I was inspired because a few
weeks ago I was using the eyeshadow
while I was going to say eyeshadow
palette my Z palette that has my makeup
geek eyeshadows in it and I thought you
know what I need to take out that little
blush palette that I had put together so
this is my Z palette and in here are the
blushes that I have I love every single
shade in here today I'm wearing this one
right here it's called rendezvous
rendezvous it is a beautiful sort of
plummy color it is Matt it's gorgeous
that is what I have on my cheeks today I
also have this really nice light pink
color here this is called first love
this really only shows up if you have
very very fair skin so if you're deeper
you probably won't like that you could
probably use it as a highlight though
this one is called secret admirer it is
like a cool-toned pink I also love that
and then the last one is my other
favorite and this is spellbound this is
beautiful it's kind of like a peachy
sort of color so I absolutely love these
they are so easy to blend and use and
they're very very like ultra pigmented
so I've really been enjoying that little
palette I need to get more of them so
love that and let's see here you guys I
think that was everything I'm looking
over the whole little batch going on
here actually it wasn't everything what
do you know here we go we have three
more products I have been loving the NYC
smooth skin bronzing face powder a lot
of people don't like to use this for
contouring I guess it wasn't really
contouring what I was doing but I was
lightly bronzing or contouring I go over
you know my forehead area down here and
then underneath my jaw but I like this I
have very very fair skin tone and I
guess for some people this does look a
little orange on me it doesn't I just
like the way it bronzes up my skin so
i've been using that for contouring or
bronzing up my face and then the last
two products are masks
eras this is what I have been combining
this week the first one can we just take
a look at that packaging this is like a
velvet and it's got like a little
stiletto they're adorable this is from
physicians formula this is beautiful at
building volume on your lashes so I
start with this one and this is the sexy
booster cat I collection mascara in
ultra black it's got a really really big
kind of thick fat wand it looks like
that it is a rubber bristle brush which
I love so that builds up volume and then
I top it with my L'Oreal telescopic
shopping shocking extensions mascara
this is the waterproof formula and this
is amazing at lengthening it's a really
tiny little skinny brush it's wonderful
so anyway that was everything you guys
I'm sorry everything is kind of spread
out back here behind me but um I hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
