hope you guys are having a fantastic
weekend this video is going to be my
weekly favorites so let's just get right
into it the first two things i have been
loving our teas and my friendly or and i
have really been into tease this week I
don't know why we've just been obsessed
and it's just I don't know he's really
delicious so she recommended I tried
this one from Lipton it is the green tea
superfruit Jasmine passion fruit with
citrus decaffeinated tea so it's
basically just a green tea with a
Jasmine passion fruit and citrus sort of
flavoring to it it is decaffeinated
which is good for me I've been drinking
about two cups of this ice to every
single day and its really really good so
thank you for that recommendation leora
the other tea I've been loving this
tastes like an absolute treat this is
the teavana white chocolate peppermint
flavored rubios live loose leaf tea
that's what it looks like as you guys
can see it is loose and its just oh my
god it just smells so good I have a hard
time like understanding how this can be
zero calories without any kind of sugar
or like milk in it but it is so so good
I do put about 2 teaspoons of teavana
rock sugar in here and it just tastes
amazing it tastes like such a treat so
I've been loving that as well as far as
fragrances go this week I've been loving
pairing my flower bomb perfume from
Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf with my Victoria's Secret
strawberries and champagne fragrance
mist I don't know what it is these two
just smell really really awesome
together this one is a lot more
sweet-smelling whereas the flower bomb
one smells very very floral e but um
they pair really beautifully and I
really really enjoy it for mascaras this
week I've been carrying my Urban Decay
perversion mascara with my um this is
L'Oreal right yeah l'oreal voluminous
miss manga rock mascara the amalgam rock
has a very very interesting rubber
bristle like wand to it it looks like
this you guys can see it's got little
tiny spikes all over it and I really
really love it I feel like it really
gives a lot of volume to my lashes I
will say that the Urban Decay perversion
one is a very very wet formula so you
want to work with it and make sure not
to kind of smudge anything right away
just because like you don't want to put
it on to quicklys when I'm trying to say
if you do that it will start to smudge
and it's just hard to get off I don't
know even after it dries I have a hard
time getting this off um all right as
far as I shadows blushes and highlights
go this week I have been using my NYX
butt naked underneath it all pilot it
looks like this it is super dirty um but
you get 15 shadows on the top this is
what they look like low this is what
they look like they are absolutely
beautiful I feel like they're very very
like fall-related and just absolutely
gorgeous and then on the bottom you get
for blushes and three highlights and
highlights in here are fantastic just
really really awesome so I've been
loving that I am wearing it today well
I'm wearing it all week and it's just
fantastic and so easy to like travel
with its self compact um I'd loving and
hating my guys know loving hating I
don't really know this tacha this is the
touch of luminous dewy skin miss this is
difficult for me I do not like it when I
spray it like with my primers if i put
on my primers and then i spray this and
i put makeup on top of it my makeup will
start to move around and it disturbs the
makeup however if you set your makeup
with this it looks absolutely stunning
so it really does give a nice glow to
the skin you want to shake it up really
well before because it does have oils in
it and that's what's giving the kind of
luminous effect to the skin but i will
say using it as like a skin missed like
with your skin care and then putting
makeup on doesn't really work very well
it really does kind of disturb the
makeup but if you just lightly mist it
like this right on top of your face and
let it kind of fall down it really is
beautiful and I like that a lot so um
yeah I guess I don't like it as far as
like a skin skincare sort of missed if
that makes sense but I do love it to set
my makeup so absolutely beautiful highly
recommend but don't recommend for
skincare wise alright I've been wearing
three different color lip products this
week the first one I've been wearing is
from Maybelline this is the color
whisper in very ready it looks like this
say beautiful beautiful just very color
and it's very very glossy it has a nice
I'm kind of satiny texture on the lips
and I don't know it looks very pretty
really easy to wear our very very
buttery and creamy very similar to the
Revlon lip butters another lip combo
that I've been wearing this week is my
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on lip pencil in
Naked 2 which is a beautiful kind of I
don't know like your lips but better
sort of shade kinds of probably kylie
jenner asked sort of thing going on and
i've been pairing that with my
maybelline touch of spice which I love
as well this is a matte and it's kind of
got a little more of a pinky tone than
the actual lip pencil but the two of
them pair beautifully together so really
been enjoying that and then what's on my
lips today and what I've also been
loving this week is this little it
cosmetics it girl combo this is the
blurred lines it girl lipstick it looks
like this it's a beautiful blue toned
red and I have been pairing that with
the waterproof your lips but better lip
liner staying in cherry slush so really
really like that combo as well very
comfortable to wear on the lips I like
that it's kind of um glossy and it just
scored two I love it alright um
for browsing at my face and doing like a
light contour this week I've been loving
my too faced chocolate soleil medium /
deep matte bronzer this is quite dark
however it really does work for me so I
like it I have to use it with a fluffy
brush because if I go in with a really
dense kind of thick brush or something
like that you know something a little
too dense that has like heavily packed
bristles in there it just goes on like
too much it's just too much I like
contour or bronze I don't know it's just
too deep it looks too dark but with a
fluffy brush I think that I can get away
with it and I do like it all right as
far as concealer and foundation go this
week I've been loving by marc jacobs
foundation this is the genius gel
supercharged foundation i forgot to
mention this in my foundation declutter
video because i did have it separately
in a different little storage
compartment where I was reaching for it
all week but my shade is 10 ivory light
and I love this this is a light to
medium coverage foundation you probably
can build it up to medium but it mostly
is pretty light the color it goes on
like looking like it's going to be a
little too fair for my skin tone this is
the lightest one in there
range however when I blend it into my
skin and matches perfectly so I really
really enjoy that and because that is
such light coverage I've been going in
with a heavy duty um or full coverage
basically concealer this is from hard
candy it's the glamour flower oops
glamour flage concealer in ultra light
and it looks like that and this just
really covers any kind of acne scarring
freckles your under-eye you know it does
everything beautifully all right as far
as I pencils go this week I've only been
wearing one it's from Sephora it is the
eye pencil in number one black or noir
it looks like this and I've just been
wearing that on my waterline and also
tight lining with this and I love it
primers I've been loving my elf oh my
gosh this is like completely worn off I
believe this is just the mineral one
dollar primer in sheer i love this i
really like the consistency of it i like
that it feels like there's nothing on my
lids it doesn't feel tacky or sticky
it's just very very lightweight and I've
been enjoying that this week so that's
definitely a favorite and for my face
I've been loving my L'Oreal youth code
texture Perfector poor Vanisher this is
an awesome product it does have a little
bit of that silicone II sort of texture
to it but it's really beautiful um for
my hair like today one of the things
I've been loving for my hair is actually
these kind of like mid length ponytails
basically just a ponytail that's like
right on the back of your head instead
of putting it way up high my hair is
dirty today so what I have been using to
kind of give it volume and suck up any
oils things like that is the bumble and
bumble pret a powder it's equal parts
dry shampoo style extender and volume in
a pinch so I like this when I wear my
hair up when its dirty and for
shampooing this week I've been loving
this redken diamond oil shampoo it has
oil enriched care for dull and damaged
hair I don't like the scent the scent is
not that fantastic but it really really
makes my hair very manageable and my
hair tangles the minute that it hits the
water so this is our nice little product
to have and when I get out of the shower
and I put in leave in products what I've
been using this week for like leaving
conditioner things like that is the
caviar anti-aging replenishing moisture
milk this is a leave-in conditioner
really really nice it has like a little
spray bottle however the spray bottle
kind of broke
me as usual that always happens to me so
I just open it up put a little on my
hand and put that all over even on my
roots and I don't have any issues with
it weighing down my hair and then from
my earlobe down I put on this dry bar
original formula 100 proof treatment oil
it helps eliminate frizz flyaways and
creates lasting shine so I'm in liking
that as well this week um in the bath or
I guess in the shower I've been using
this shower gel I got this in my allure
sample society box or allure beauty box
for this month it is the crabtree &amp;amp;
evelyn verbena and lavender do povo body
wash two pop-ups it looks like this it
is really really nice it smells amazing
and very strongly of like mmm smells
like a spa it's got a lot of lavender in
there and that for bein ascent is kind
of citrusy it just really really kind of
I don't know it hits it out of the park
this is a beautiful beautiful
combination highly recommend checking
that out I've been using this lip scrub
this week this is from a Victoria's
Secret it is the flavored lip scrub in
strawberry fizz it looks like this I
always use a lip scrub just because I
play flute and instruments and I always
want to have very very hydrated lips and
also very very nice like I don't know
lips that don't have a bunch of bread
like dry grimy cracks in them and stuff
like that uh-huh so anyway this is what
the scrub looks like smells really good
and tastes really good and as far as lip
balms go this week before I've been
putting on my lip colors in the morning
I've been using my chapstick gingerbread
kiss I just like this because it's kind
of holiday themed and it really really
has a great formula chapstick makes a
really really good um you know lip
products and they're really really great
before you put on like lipstick and
things like that really kind of makes it
go on smoothly and then at nighttime
I've been loving my Korres or coors from
Athens this is the Jasmine lip butter
and these are tinted a lot of people
wear these during the day actually they
come in multiple multiple colors they
have kind of like pink ones Chuck Berry
ones this is the Jasmine one the reason
I got it was because of course it smells
like jasmine you guys know I love the
scent of
and the taste but anyway smells really
really good that is what it looks like
it has a really nice kind of bomb feel
to it a lot of people like I said where
these during the day and you definitely
could because it does give your lips
that kind of color but I've been wearing
it at night it is nice it's a very very
lightweight it's not too heavy or thick
and yeah I've been loving that for hand
creams this week I've been using this
almond milk hands cream from la cita
love it it came in a little pack of four
it's really beautiful it has a lovely
lovely scent to it yeah really really
good scent and it just really really
leaves my hands and kind of wrist area
very nice and moisturized um as far as I
guess I'll start with this on first the
and like I makeup removal goes and
things like that I've been loving the
fresh soy conditioning eye makeup
remover it has soothing mellow extract
and removes waterproof mascara it really
does this does not sting or irritate my
eyes at all if you have sensitive eyes
definitely try that out after i put on
my retinol at night i've been topping it
with the beach eid alia skin sleep this
is a basically gel cream sort of thing
it's got a beautiful beautiful scent and
color to it it's a baby pink color as
you guys can see and it really feels
like a gel but then when you start
rubbing it in it feels like a cream so
really really awesome moisturizes my
skin very nicely at night and I think it
pairs really nicely with my retinol um
I've been loving to products from code
early in the morning I've been loving
their resveratrol firming serum and also
the rest of our trial I lifting bomb
this I have talked about before I really
enjoy that I really enjoy the rest of
our 12 line in general but I have talked
about that serum before this I have not
talked about it is new to me this week
it is for sensitive eyes and it really
doesn't feel like a bomb it's not sticky
or tacky or greasy it really actually
feels like a gel so it really really is
nice underneath makeup it makes things
glide on beautifully I don't know I just
really really enjoy it so been loving
that product as far as moisturizing my
face in the morning I've been loving the
tata indigo soothing triple recovery
cream comes in this little purple tub
like this
the actual product is kind of an indigo
color like bluish purple color it helps
to soothe the skin it feels very very
calming doesn't irritate the skin
whatsoever I just don't like the scent
that's the only thing I don't like it's
not completely noticeable it's a very
very subtle but it just kind of smells
weird but I do like that also the blue
color in their kind of counteracts
redness on the skin so really really
beautiful and I of course have been
adding in my polished choice resist
moisture renewal oil booster drops to
that I add three drops of that in there
like I do with every moisturizer um I
actually used up this mask I'm so happy
this is the Mario Badescu whitening mask
I've been using this all week this is
great if you have hyperpigmentation or
acne scars fantastic product like i said
i did use it up i've actually had this
forever probably since I was like a
sophomore in college which I know is
really really horrible but it never
dried out or anything and it kept
working from my skin so yeah I use that
up I'm very happy that I can kind of
recycle that into my empties for the
month of December um and then I've been
using these Noxzema ultimate clear anti
blemish pads these have to two percent
right yeah two percent salicylic acid in
them they look like this they're just
these tiny little pads that basically
you rub over your whole entire face or
you can rub just right on and kind of
spot treatment I basically put on my
retinol and then I was putting on the
vici stuff and then anywhere where I had
like a bump or a pimple I would just
take one of these pads and rub it over
there and really helps clear up any kind
of breakouts salicylic acid is nice for
kind of decongesting the pores and doing
spot treatments but I like benzoyl
peroxide to really really clear up my
skin but these are very nice I will
continue to use them and just kind of
spot treat any areas that I might need
to UM I get hormonal acne um so you know
in the jaw area right here and just kind
of like in this area the cheek area so I
do like it a lot they do smell very
strongly of like mint nut menthol but um
you know what they sent smell like the
Vics what is that yeah the vicks vapor
rub that's exactly what they smell like
so if you don't like that smile you're
not going to like
any kind of the nug Zima products in
general but I really do like that and
then I have two cleansers to share with
you guys at night I've been enjoying my
clear pore cleanser from Neutrogena this
is benzyl peroxide in here and it has
three point five percent I love benzoyl
peroxide it really really helps keep my
skin clear I seem to react better to
benzoyl peroxide themselves to look acid
but like I said salicylic acid is nice
for spot treating for my skin personally
um but I've been loving that one and
then in the morning I've been loving my
be fine food skincare exfoliating
cleanser with brown sugar sweet almond
and Oates this really really exfoliates
the crap out of my skin and I really
enjoy it so anyway you guys that were
those that that was my favorites video
for the week those are my favorites I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
