welcome to weekly favorites it is Sunday
and that means i am going to be sharing
my weekly favorites with you guys so
that can be anything from skin care body
hair makeup really anything books food
you know whatever youtubers everything
that i am liking this week so um this
week i was actually traveling i did not
wear tons and tons of makeup however the
days that i was wearing makeup i want to
show you guys the few makeup products
that i was using every single day
technically which i am also wearing
right now in my face so anything that
you see me show i am wearing on my face
right now so the first thing i want to
talk about that has been a favorite an
absolute favorite have been the wet and
wild color icon contouring palette it
has a matte highlights and a back
contour and it's in 750 a caramel toffee
it looks like this and its really big
it's like bigger than the size of my
palm and it opens up and this is the
product that I'm talking about so what I
like to do is take the contour and hit
um you know my temples my cheekbones and
underneath my chin um and the highlight
is beautiful too because it's matt and
you can just go down your nose you can
brighten any areas that you want to and
you can also you also have the ability
to go over it with a shimmery highlight
as well if you would like so I've
absolutely been loving this duo it's
really cheap and cheerful at the
drugstore you can get this for under
five dollars and you get a lot of
products so I highly recommend checking
this out I want to say right away I'm
sorry if the lighting is a little off in
this video I am filming later in the day
we actually literally just flew in
tonight um so but I really wanted to get
up um you know my weekly favorites and
also there's a lighting storm going on
outside right now so it is like pitch
black out normally I film during the day
so I'm sorry if the lighting is not very
good in this video but anyway so yes my
first favorite has definitely been the
wet and wild color icon contouring
palette and my favorite brush to use
that particular product with has been
this really nice fluffy soft brush from
the up-and-up collection which is the
compareto brand at um target I love it I
heard emilynoel83 raving about these
brushes and I went and picked up a few
and I find it so easy just to dust you
know color all over you know really
really without
I think sharp edges I just think it
looks so nice and its really really
great with bronzing too so I'm really
really been loving this little duo or I
guess trio right here at least this duo
and this trio of using the brush and I
just really love the contour because
it's a lot more cool toned it's more of
like a topi color than a warm color so
really really chisels out the cheekbones
nicely so that is my first favorite my
second makeup favorite has been my
hourglass ambient lighting blush and
diffused heat this is one of those
blushes that I've always really liked
however i have been loving it this time
of year right now because it has this
gorgeous gorgeous highlight mixed
together with this beautiful almost red
color and normally I like to pull pink
colors for my I pull a lot of pink in my
face naturally so I like to use pink
blushes um I think this really be
beautiful when you use like a cool tone
to pick pink blush but um I just thought
that this looked amazing you know when I
picked it up and also I'd really really
like the way it looks on my cheeks it
really gives a really nice warm um you
know appearance to the cheeks without
being to read if that makes sense I
don't really like the look of straight
up read on my cheeks I just feel like it
looks like it's too much so I've been
very very happy with this product so
then loving that this week as my blush
um another product i've been using um
that i've been loving when i have been
wearing makeup this past week has been
the you've st. Laurent touché éclat
blur primer this stuff is great I use it
all over my face I'll take it even under
my eyes and it's wonderful the only
place I don't put it is around my
eyelids um however it can be used around
the islands it just won't give you as
much as like say I don't know the
product i'm going to show you next like
an eyeshadow primer so really really
love this for the face and but the
product i'm talking about four eyes that
I've been loving is the elf glitter
primer this is for your eyes this is
just a couple of dollars on the F dot
com website and it is definitely a dupe
for the UM is it the two-faced glitter
glue yeah i think it's called to face
glitter glue i have both and honestly
they are the same exact
in my opinion so really really been
liking this I think it really really
sticks um and holds my eyeshadows in
place this past week it's just been
keeping everything on all day like I
said I was on a plane this afternoon at
the end of the day and all I used today
in my crease was this toffee color from
the contouring palette which by the way
you know just because it's a contouring
palette does not mean that you can't use
it anywhere else so I used it in my
crease and it lasted all day and I just
find that the glitter primers are really
really nice during the summer because
they have that extra little bit of
tackiness hold on to the product so yeah
the next product i'm going to talk about
i'm going to reapply right now also this
is the revlon super lustrous what is
this lip gloss yes in 255 kiss me coral
this is like the only thing i've been
wearing on my lips it's beautiful let me
show you guys since it heads come off on
the plane
I love it it's like a glassy Coralie red
color and it just stays so glossy on the
lips you do have to reapply however what
I love is that when you do have to
reapply you don't get like areas that
have like blood off or areas that are a
little more darker and then you know
there are certain areas where you can
see your lip coming through it just it
it gradually fades off throughout the
day even land i really really love that
so I'm definitely have been loving this
Revlon super lustrous and lip gloss and
kiss me coral love it there's not a
pretty color it's so shiny any of it the
next makeup product that i have been
loving is the hard candy glamma flage
heavy duty concealer this is a very
heavy duty concealer my shade is ultra
light and what I've been liking to do is
just taking this on my eyelids
underneath my eyes anywhere where I may
be breaking down and need level blemish
spots things like that hyperpigmentation
and you can use this before or after
foundation just depending on what kind
of technique you like but it really
really gives amazing coverage and I have
been loving it this week so those are
all the makeup products I have been
absolutely loving this week the only
other things I have and you know I've
been using a lot of stuff this week but
um a lot of them just didn't impress me
I like to swap out products and I like
to try new things because I have so much
makeup I like to try a lot of stuff out
and just bath care body care all that
kind of stuff and sometimes they're just
not that great for me or maybe they'll
be great for me at a different time so
for this week I only have one skincare
item and one here item so let's get
started on that I have been loving these
ponds exfoliating renewal wet cleansing
towelettes with citrus and cucumber
these are just like I use ponds
basically i use those you know what are
these yeah what cleansing towelettes to
remove makeup they're a little harsher
because they do have a little more of
like a quilted um cloth I guess you
could say they have like some texture to
them and I brought this in a duo with
the nighttime soothing one which I
absolutely love I think it's a beautiful
scent but I didn't realize that this one
was the exfoliating one which is one I
have never tried before
I'll show you guys what one of the
sheets looks like and I tried using this
by removing my makeup and I just
couldn't do it was too harsh it wasn't
game to makeup off enough but it smells
really good but one side you get just
plain like what a normal ponds cloth
looks like and on the other side you can
see these little bubbles and these
little bubbles that you see are actually
exfoliating beads that are inside the
product and you just rub it on your face
and you can either rinse with water in
the morning after or you can just leave
it and I have found that I love it both
ways i think that the citrus and
cucumber scent is such a pick me up in
the morning it just smells so good and i
do find that it really really leaves my
skin nice and soft and ready for makeup
or sunscreen or whatever i'm putting on
it just leaves my skin feeling great
ready for skin care and whatnot the
reason i said sunscreen was because
that's a product i missed talking about
next I guess I do have to technically
skincare product um like I said I was
out of town and what I was doing in the
morning was using a ponds exfoliating
tablet and going in right away with a
sunscreen because i was spending a lot
of time outside and i wasn't pulling my
normal skin care routine just because
when i'm on vacation sometimes it's
easier to just pack things that are like
a two and one or three and one so um I
didn't go through the whole like Oh
toner and you know um I don't know you
see room all that kind of stuff I didn't
really follow that morning what i would
do was use these and either wash my face
or just leave them and then i would
apply my sunscreen because a lot of the
days from this past week i haven't been
wearing makeup so anyway like I said I'm
the one I have been absolutely loving
and i highly recommend this is somewhat
new to me this is the Neutrogena clear
phrase clear face break out free liquid
lotion sunscreen it has broad spectrum
SPF 55 with Helio Plex and it says it
won't cause breakouts ultra light oil
free water resistant for 80 minutes and
this is amazing you guys I find that any
time I use a sunscreen it leaves me just
super oily on my face I feel
uncomfortable I don't like it um and
it's just it doesn't work well for me I
have found that this particular
sunscreen works well under makeup which
is a huge thing and also I just like it
on its own it does not leave a white
castle
and it really really once you put it on
it comes out in like very very liquidy
I'll show you guys very very liquidy as
you guys can see like it will move down
my hand it's not like a thick cream and
it just rubs in beautifully like you can
see it will start to get a little shiny
but the more you rub it really turns
kind of like Matt on the skin so almost
as if like you haven't put anything on
there which is amazing for a sunscreen
because the Marines are so greasy and
gross so I'm really really happy with
this product I will definitely continue
to use and yes i must say i have not had
any breakouts with this so that is
completely awesome and i have been
loving this product this week and the
last product for this week that i wanted
to share with you guys that have been a
favorite is the hair care product this
is the only one that has really stood
out to me this week this is the clairol
herbal essences color me happy color
safe conditioner this is the Rose one it
smells amazing it really really makes my
hair shiny it helps with any tangles I
might have and it has that lasting sent
like it will last throughout the day
it's not just in the shower will last
throughout the day and the scent is so
good if you don't like the scent of
roses you probably won't like it but it
is wonderful it's cheap and cheerful and
it definitely gets the job done so yeah
anyway those were on my weekly favorites
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did please give it a thumbs up and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
