hope you guys are having a fantastic day
as always I am here to share my weekly
favorites with you guys um this video
will be up on sunday so you'll be
watching it on Sunday however actually
this is pre filmed so I'm pre filming
this right now on friday and i do feel
like i got to you know really really
like the products i'm going to talk
about and it's kind of more like a
friday favorites video because i
actually am right now as you watch this
in california for my grandmother's
funeral felt that is why it is pre
filmed so anyway let's go ahead and just
get into what i have been loving the
first thing i want to talk about is this
peter thomas roth rose stem cell bio
repair gel mask i mentioned this in my
top five series for masks it's amazing
it's been doing beautiful things for my
skin this week um i just love it I feel
like it's so uh huh oh my gosh I'm sorry
guys I really have had something going
on this weekend like my throat just like
closes act like no moisture anyway I
should put this like drink this or
something but this is wonderful I was
going to say it's very moisturizing it's
got a beautiful beautiful bill beautiful
um texture to it you can put in the
refrigerator and put it on and it just
feels like luxurious and cooling I love
it I highly recommend alright the next
thing I want to talk about sorry I just
like threw that on the ground not good
that's some expensive mask I shouldn't
do that but the next thing I want to
talk about is the bath and body works
aromatherapy stress relief eucalyptus
tangerine body wash and foam bath I've
been using this both as a body wash and
a bubble bath this week and no surprise
there you guys know I love my bubble
bath oh my god my nose it's such an
interesting blood I feel like you need
to smell this in person because the
eucalyptus is very very strong and the
tangerine is not is you know a lot more
sweet so you may not like this but it
really is interesting I do like it it
says eucalyptus and
essential oils help clear your mind to
support focus and I notice um if I take
a bath at nighttime and I use that like
a kind of energized after so if you are
a morning bath person you could use that
and get your day started alright the
next thing I want to talk about is from
l'oreal this is the new power moisture
10 seconds hydra detangler now i have
hair that tangles the second it hits the
water the second it is dry the second in
whatever I very very fine straight hair
and it just like knots up like literally
not sup so I don't personally believe
that there are detanglers outfit that
were completely wow that was weird the
way I just said that I don't believe
there are detanglers out there that will
completely take the knots out of your
hair you're gonna have to brush and just
be gentle work from the bottom up but
this one really does help a lot and I
don't feel like it leaves like a oily or
thick residue in my hair so I do like it
another hair products I've been loving
this week is from oh gx this is a little
shampoo here it is called the weightless
hydration coconut water shampoo like I
said I am traveling right now so I
thought this would be perfect to take
with me and it smells great and it
really really lathers up nicely but it
doesn't feel thick and it doesn't weigh
your hair down so it says drench you're
dehydrated strands in this ultra light
blend of weightless hydrating coconut
water supercharged with nutrient-rich
electrolytes and combined with coconut
oil to transform dry parched hair into
silky shiny perfection I don't
necessarily think it makes my hair silky
or super super-shiny it just cleans it
really really well without weighing it
down so I like it a lot um as far as
conditioners go I've been loving this
deep conditioner and what I've been
doing this this week is I'm putting this
in basically as like okay so i'll put my
detanglers brand and kind of comb out my
hair but that doesn't get rid of all the
tangles so then i go in with this and i
put it all over my head about 15 minutes
before getting the shower and this
really loosens up the tangles nicely
this is the Aussie three minute miracle
moist this is just the original coconut
sort of smelling formula this was like
the first one they came out with its
dripping all over me right now
disgusting um but it's you know they
have like 10 different formulas now
they're like the strong one shine one
this one's the best the moist one is the
best and it smells the best but I love
this has got a really thick great
texture and I feel like this little
squeezy bottle will be great for travel
so yeah another hair product this
frizz-ease 100% shine glossing missed I
like this it really doesn't make your
hair look oily you can even spray it on
your hand and then run it through the
ends of your hair today with this little
messy bun I just did one and two and it
just kind of looks like I don't know
this is like three-day-old hair so for
it to look shiny is amazing because I
put a lot of dry shampoo in there all
right two more hair care products um i
have been using this it's a 10 miracle
leave-in um what if it's just like the
lyrical miracle miracle miracle even
spray and I really didn't like this when
I first tried it I bought a full size of
this when I still had virgin hair about
a year ago when I wasn't bleaching in
and literally just bleaching the crap
out of my hair um and it was too much it
was too much for my hair really weighted
down it looked oily but now that i have
over processed blonde hair this seems to
really work well and this little size is
perfect for travel and i spray that all
over and then i go in with the Mara cash
I think that's how you say it yeah mark
eshe ends argan and hemp oil therapy is
they split and meander and preventer I
take that from about my earlobe down and
I love this stuff really really nice
little size for travel but um I left the
scent and I really think that it does
have with the oils in there it really
kind of you know makes my hair silky all
right fragrances this week oh my gosh
this Pacifica fragrance this perfume
it's called Indian coconut nectar
everybody asks me what I'm wearing when
I'm wearing this perfume this is like a
$22 perfume from Ulta and it's like one
hundred percent natural and like
recycled you know packaging and all that
kind of stuff and it just smells so darn
good it smells really really warm a lot
of like coconut and vanilla in there and
I have been pairing it with my warm
vanilla sugar fragrance mist from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works this is the
the one I got it maybe a year or two
years ago and it still is good yeah this
one is a so oh gosh that's on my lip
again I've done that like three times
today um this one is also like a very
very warm sort of scent but it's got
more vanilla in it than the Indian
coconut nectar but they pair beautifully
together so loving that all right eye
drops this week I have been under the
weather as you guys can tell in my past
videos I'm like I'm sick and coughing
all over the place I'm not going sure
what I have I think it's a head cold may
mr. soon I don't know it's just
disgusting I just don't like it but
these roto cool I drops have an amazing
these are and oestrogen estrela
astringent so they do burn the hell out
of your eyes like you put them in and
it's like whoa-ho it really really wakes
you up it has a cooling effect but it
also is a redness for labor which has
been great for me this week I feel like
I don't know when you're sick you know
your eyes just look kind of crummy I
don't know my eyeballs just look very
red and yellow in the morning and I'm
like that's gross so this has been
awesome loving it all right um let's see
what else have I been loving um this
toner right here this is the nude purify
toning water um it doesn't have like a
great scent or anything like that but is
helping with my pimples and kind of
acting active pimples I have on my face
this is great for it's got cinnamon in
it and I think cardamom or something
which is really really good for um like
calming down inflammation which is
basically like pimples and things like
that kind of nice little like spray
thing yeah I like that you don't have to
pour it out you just kind of put it onto
your cotton pad and then you rub it all
over and yeah I got this in the sale
section on the safaricom website I don't
know if maybe they got rid of it or
whatnot but it's really good all right
at night I have been wearing the lineage
water sleeping mask on top of my retinol
love it it's got a beautiful consistency
to it I feel like it was very hydrating
it's more like a gel and a small really
good all right in the morning for
hydrating my face as a moisturizer I've
been using my tarte maracuja oil this is
the little small size nice to have a
huge full size of this I use this every
single day like religiously but um now I
just use it once in a while it is a
really nice thick oil I don't find that
me particularly like oily oily it's got
kind of like a thicker consistency to it
and if you want something that's a
little thicker a little more I don't
want to say moisturizing because I think
argan oil is really really moisturizing
I think this one has more like repairing
properties to it it's going to plump
your skin if you have um you know issues
with like aging you know aging skin and
things like that you should reach for
the tarte maracuja instead of the argan
oil alright um argan oil is really good
for people who just have like dry
parched skin and I do like it once in a
while alright for concealer I've been
using my Kat Von D lock it tattoo
concealer my shade is like 16 this is a
little dark for me so I have been
applying it before my foundation and I'd
really like it it just has a wonderful
consistency to it and it really really
glides on like I literally couldn't just
blend it with like two taps of my finger
I don't even have to go in with like a
brush or my Beauty Blender and the
foundation I've been wearing this week
and loving ah this is a wonderful
wonderful foundation from the drugstore
this is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin
liquid makeup it's got titanium dioxide
sunscreen and it has broad spectrum SPF
20 it's got an antioxidant blend who
knows if that's actually true but it's
beautiful on the skin I'm I've heard it
is a dupe for NARS sheer glow I've never
tried narshall should avail sheer glow
but I love the way this looks on my skin
I have combination skin and the way that
this like settles on my favorite just I
shouldn't say settle because it doesn't
settle it just like tops your skin and
it's like it has a glow to it but it
still keeps you Matt it's very very
interesting the consistency and I'm one
of those people that really packs on the
powder because i want to set that
foundation but sometimes they don't feel
like I need to with this so absolutely
amazing I am in the lightest shade um
it's called classic ivory number 10 it
is a little dark for me so I have been
using a power this week that just kind
of lightens things up I'm not showing it
in this video because I mention it so
often it is the elf cool correcting tone
powder no that's not it Olivia it is the
elf tonga retching powder in cool all
right as far as primer goes for my face
this week I've been loving my growing a
five-second blow
this is great so you can use this a
skincare or as a primer it's basically
just a silicone primer really really
fills in the pores and any sort of fine
lines the philosophy no reason to hide
this is a multi imperfection
transforming theorem really like the
texture of this I enjoy the salon not
much to say I just have been liking it
it hasn't caused any irritation to my
skin so it's been good for me in the
morning the lorac behind the scenes i
prime are loving this this week I will
be taking my smaller size when I'm
traveling even though I'm filming this
on Friday when you guys are watching it
I'll have a smaller size with me but
yeah I don't know where the cap went for
this I have no idea but this is
wonderful it's kind of beautiful
consistency to it it's not too tacky but
it's also not to like share if that
makes sense alright this is baby I
picked out purposely because I knew I
would be traveling and I thought you
know what I should try out and make it
on the run palette this has a mascara
it's got an eyeliner it's got a lip
gloss it's got five eyeshadows a bronzer
a blush and a highlight in here you get
tons of stuff in here I can't tip it all
the way down for you guys i will show
you everything separately I'm or else
stuff will start falling out but the
first thing that you get in here is the
perversion mascara this is a really
really nice deluxe I sample I do like
this mascara it was actually in my
favorites last week it is a very wet
formula and it will smudge if you put it
on kind of nestle so be really really
careful i've been wearing about one
layer of that this week and then it
comes with one of the Urban Decay 24-7
glide on eye pencils in the color stag
this is a beautiful matte dark chocolaty
cool tone brown color it's beautiful
that's what I've been wearing on my
waterline and my tight line all week and
then um I have been wearing the gloss
and it is in the shade see so this is
the naked Urban Decay lip gloss and I
have actually been carrying this today
I'm just wearing lip gloss but for most
of the week I've actually been pairing
it with this tiny little tart um
lipsurgence lip creme I thought these
two would go well together and this is
really easy to pack also when I'm
traveling and this is more of like a ma
vie I don't know
kind of house like your ad essence to it
it's interesting because say so also has
that kind of your lips but better but
more mob a little bit of purple in there
really really interesting and I do like
the way it looks on lips so I like those
two pair together and then um the
shadows in here are nice I do like them
I think they're very very basic and
there's something that you get bored
with by the end of the week I'm someone
who switches out my makeup weekly so I
don't just grab random things every day
I pick out a palette and that's what I
use for the week so here are what the
shadows look like you can see there's
two mats and then there are three I
guess well to kind of shimmer shades or
they're not like metallics they're more
like satin shades i guess and then there
is one shade in there that has a little
more chunky glitter in it and it is that
kind of darker brown color and I feel
like Urban Decay always does that with
their palates and you guys know I'm not
a huge fan of Urban Decay eyeshadow
palettes in general i got this when it
was on sale from sephora and I do like
it I think that the best part about it
is that you get a full-size lipgloss you
get one of the 24 7 glide on eye pencils
and also the perversion mascara and a
really really nice deluxe I sample but
the shadows are just there okay um
they're pretty don't get me wrong I'm
wearing um that rosy color today i'm
wearing that on my lower lash line i
have that kind of eyes it yeah i'll look
similar you know to me it's hard to
describe them i have this color in my
crease and then I put again that rosy
color kind of on my outer be really
really pretty very basic definitely
doable but I think for travel and things
like that the ease of this and the fact
that it has a huge ass mirror is really
really nice bronzer and blush in there
are just ok the blush is very very cool
toned kind of pretty cool toned pink
color bronzers a little more on the
orange side and the highlighter is
nothing special but I like the stuff
that's on the top of the palette and I
think for the price that i purchased it
for it was worth it so um great for
travel like I said that big mirror right
there that's awesome if you don't have
like a nice mirror at your hotel or
wherever you're staying that is good
alright one last thing for my lips in
the morning before I apply
the tarte lipsurgence or the naked lip
gloss or both of them I put on the
Maybelline Baby Lips sunscreen SPF 20
this is the clear one and this one's
like the peppermint smelly one if you
don't like peppermint my friend leora is
probably watching at you like you know
she doesn't like peppermint but this is
really really nice it really is
moisturizing and it goes on I kind of
gives a little bit of a sheen and I just
forgot how fantastic this was I mean I
love my baby lips but the clear ones are
really really good too and they have SPL
so wear them during the day anyway that
was a my favorites video for the week I
feel like I was like tripping over my
words I just have a lot to say and I did
film another video today and I feel like
when I do back-to-back videos like the
second one is always a little bit like
that there's a lot of fat so anyway I do
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
