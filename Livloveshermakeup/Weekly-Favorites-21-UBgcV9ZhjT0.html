thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day as
always before I start this video I want
to say one thing thank you to everybody
who patiently waited for my chocolate
bon bons palette review to go up it
finally went up this morning yes this
morning it looks 6am it finally
processed I have to tell you guys I
filmed that yesterday and I uploaded at
about one o'clock in the afternoon it
took 12 hours to process it was stuck at
ninety-five percent processed for 12
hours i was going to just cancel the
upload and reupload again and i actually
did that once and it did the same thing
again i was literally just not gonna
even post it if it didn't go through but
I finally did this morning so if you
guys are wondering why I have a change
of outfit and my hair looks different
it's because that was actually filmed
and posted technically yesterday it
didn't go live until this morning at
like 6am um but today is Sunday so I
just you guys know I know some I'm gonna
get one of those comments people are
like oh you're filming two videos in a
day but your hair looks different and
you have different outfit on and whatnot
so anyway that is why that video was
filmed yesterday and today like i said
is sunday so i'm sharing my weekly
favorites with you guys so let's just
get right into it shall we I had a very
minimalistic sort of week I have not
been wearing heavy make-up I've not been
doing a lot of stuff with like products
like hair care anything really and that
was because I wasn't feeling very well I
had like this weird little tickle thing
and my throat I kind of lost my voice at
one point I'm just runny nose head cold
sort of things and i am very prone to
those but i know that this one is kind
of bad and it's been going around and so
I don't have tons of products to share
with you guys this week but the products
that I do have are really great so the
first thing i want to share was my
fragrance duo for the week i have been
pairing my versace bright crystal
perfume with the be joyful fine
fragrance mist from Bath and Body Works
this is a very sweet smelling product
yeah a very very sweet smelling scent
like spray while the versace bright
crystal they vary perfumey
kind of girl little girly girly sort of
fragrance it's very very um I don't know
I would describe it as very like posh
smelling I reminds me of like legally
blonde or something I don't know why it
just smells very very girly and very
bright and very like pink like but
anyway so these two do pair really
really nicely together i will be doing a
video on how i pair my fragrances um how
i pair my body mess with my perfumes so
i will be posting that soon if you guys
are interested in seeing that just
because they have gotten a lot of
questions about it and also people
telling me that they've paired certain
fragrances together that i've shown in
my weekly favors and that they really
liked it so um i'm so glad you liked it
and yeah that video will be coming soon
the next guy like i want to talk about
that i've been loving this week is the
elf studio makeup remover cleansing
cloths I got two packs of these and I'm
already down to one I already completely
used one of them up I really really like
these a lot of people don't like these
for removing makeup they think they're
very oily and I guess they sting their
eyes I have no issue whatsoever with
these stinging my eyes or being too oily
on my skin I think they're really nice
because they stay very very moist in the
pack you don't even have to store them
upside down they just stay very very
moist and I feel like a lot of makeup
remover wipes do not do that they start
to get dried out and really gross after
a while but these are fantastic and I
just absolutely love them so i highly
recommend trying them out for yourself
they are like three dollars i believe
three dollars a pack which is amazing um
so you can get like two packs for the
price of what you know like a Neutrogena
one of my costs at Target or something
so um anyway I highly recommend checking
them out and seeing if they work with
your skin again I have heard that they
don't work with certain people's skin so
just try them out for yourselves the
next thing I want to talk about is my
bubble bath I've been using this is the
body shops glazed Apple bath jelly it
looks like this and this is literally
like a jelly formula um I don't even
know if you guys can see that but you
can like poke at it and it's like
literally it it's jelly and what you do
is you take a little handful of this you
put it under warm one rule a little ass
warm running
warm running water there we go warm
running water and it's just really
really nice it smells amazing it really
smells like apples and I just feel like
this is a very seasonal sort of scent so
i really like it right now i used this a
lot during the summer as well just
because those have that Apple sent I
feel like Apple can kind of travel
through all the seasons but I really
really like it right now and it makes
really really nice luxurious bubbles
they don't last a super long time but I
like that because I am one of those
people it takes really quick fast like
I'm done in 15 minutes so sometimes i
don't like when there's a lego residual
inside a word when there's lots of
residue left like of bubbles and i get
out of the bath and then i have to wipe
that off i just don't really like that
so anyway the next thing i want to talk
about i'm obsessed to it i love this
product this is the peter thomas roth
rose stem cell bio repair cleansing gel
if you guys watched in my top of five
series favorite to face masks video i
will link it below if you guys want to
watch it if you haven't already but I um
was talking about the gel mask that goes
like it's basically the sister product
to this cleansing gel I was talking
about that at how much I love it and my
boyfriend and I are going through about
three of these right now not this
particular scent or formula we really
like the peter thomas roth cleansers in
general you do get eight point five
fluid ounces which is a lot and all of
these are gel sol-gel products last a
very long time so even though these are
around thirty forty dollars it really is
worth it we are working through a
glycolic acid one right now an
anti-aging cleansing gel which we're
almost done with i really like that one
too and then this is the newest one to a
little face wash collection and it is
amazing if you have dehydrated skin if
you have aging skin you would really
really love this even sensitive skin you
would really liked us it says it repairs
it renews it illuminates the skin it has
five perfect reparative rose stem cells
Desert Rose damas Rose pale rose white
rose it's also has like rose hip seed
rosewater glycolic acid which does help
like repair the skin
and it's just awesome it says it is for
all skin types and I really do feel like
all skin types could use this um my
boyfriend has more dry skin I have
combination skin but he really really
loves this he is 32 so he's older than
me he doesn't really have any like aging
issues yet with his skin but he really
finds this to be very nice and gentle
I've been using it at night however i'm
going to probably use this this coming
week in the morning and maybe add in
some sugar and see if i can make a nice
little scrub out of it but i love this
it's got a beautiful fragrance beautiful
a bottle with like pink fluid in it and
it really just is luxurious it's a very
very thick texture and i feel like it
just feels amazing on the skin so i
highly recommend oh excuse me i felt
like a fly just like threw it to my
throat for into my throat um but anyway
i highly recommend i really really like
this a lot and um like I said it just
has a really luxurious texture and it
just really makes your skin feel good
really moisturized and beautiful alright
moving on another skincare product that
i've been loving is this shay Tara
Moroccan rosewater ester-c facial spritz
and this is for collagen of regeneration
it looks like this and um I may do a
dupe video on this this actually pretty
much I think if they do for one of my
favorite favorite facial mist so if you
guys are interested in that let me know
below and I can do a dupe on it um but
this is amazing it smells like rose it
really really is hydrating it feels
beautiful on the skin I like to use this
after I finish my skincare routine in
the morning and also at night it's just
like the last step I just use three
spritzes like on the side the middle and
then the other side and then three on my
neck super high maintenance but I really
really love it it just feels really good
and I feel like it does work it really
does kind of seal in all the products
that I have on my skin all right as far
as like nighttime creams going things
like that I'm usually really good with
where am I retinol all that kind of
stuff but like I said I've had a very
minimalistic week and the only thing I
really
been putting on my face at night are
these sleeping masks from Sephora these
are awesome because as you guys can see
these will last you about three to four
nights and I probably have one more
night that I can use this on my face and
neck and it has lasted me almost the
whole week this is the honey sleeping
mask it is nourishing and balancing it
smells really good really really nice on
the skin you can get a little kit of
these they have all different sorts of
what types that you can get you can get
ones for brightening they have a rose
one they have a ginseng one that I
really really like as well but the honey
one is also just a nose than my favorite
this week and I love these because you
just put them on and they've really
really helped to repair your skin at
night while you're sleeping and like I
said you get like three to four uses out
of like each little pod which i think is
awesome so I highly recommend checking
those out and loving that this week's
super easy to throw on my face and as
far as masking goes this week I've been
loving the peter thomas roth irish more
mud purifying black mask love this this
is one of those little mini ones that
came in the little trio that i got over
the holidays um doesn't smell
particularly amazing it's basically like
you're putting mud on your face but this
is everything that the bow show
luminizing black mask should be like it
is just lovely it goes on and it keeps
this kind of like it's very very shiny
like black kind of looks like you're
wearing like leather on your face almost
it's kind of weird but it doesn't
tighten up it really stays moist on the
skin I'm telling you when I wash this
off I have the softest skin ever I don't
know what it is about this but it's just
awesome it says it's purifying refining
and hydrating decongest it has mineral
rich Irish more mud that helps purify
and refine the look of the skin it's got
his jockey seaweed the hydrates volcanic
ash that revitalizes and activated
charcoal that draws out toxins and
impurities so I really really love this
mask and a little goes a very long way
this is a very small little tub it only
has point five fluid ounces in it but
you guys can see I've only used really a
small amount is because it's so thick
and it
we just spreads easily and last a very
long time so been loving that and then
the last little kind of bath shower item
i wanna show is from anivia this is the
in shower body lotion it is hydrating
has 24 hours of moisturization and it's
basically it moisturizes instantly for a
non-sticky feel for normal to dry skin
with sea minerals they have plenty of
different versions that you can pick up
I have tried the one in the dark blue
bottle that was a little too hydrating
for me um I do have combination skin I
really really like this one maybe I'll
try the blue one again when we are in
like I don't know the dead cold of
winter or something like that but this
is so nice um it just is kind of that
product where I use it in the morning
and you just don't have to moisturize
after you do this so basically you
shower you use your body wash you do
whatever and then I turn off the water
in my shower I put this all over my body
let it kind of just sink in or sit on my
skin for a few minutes and then you just
wash it och and when you get out you
notice that your skin and it's not even
like a residue on your skin because i
don't like a residue at all it really
just feels like you have put a
moisturizer on in the shower and you
don't have to do it when you get out so
i really like this very very easy and
time friendly i guess and yeah all right
now let's get on to makeup I've
literally been wearing such minimal
make-up this week so the first thing
that I've been wearing the only thing
I've really been wearing as my base is
the Stila illuminating tinted
moisturizer with broad-spectrum SPF 20
my shade is 0-1 it looks like this and
this has a very very very illuminating
effect to the skin you put it on and it
just has like this iridescent sort of I
know opalescent iridescent like silvery
Sheen to it it is a very very very
illuminating so it's very nice it is
water resistant for 80 minutes it's
oil-free I don't really notice that it
lasts all day it does not cover things
like you can see I visit there I wasn't
there it doesn't really cover anything
which is strange for me I'm one of those
people that loves um I really love heavy
coverage foundation to things like that
so the fact
this has been the only base I've been
wearing on my skin this week has been
very very interesting but I've been just
liking that really natural sort of look
on my face they don't mind that it
doesn't cover everything it just has
been really really nice for me this week
so that is my first favorite I've been
setting that with my essence all about
Mac fix that all about Matt fixing
compact powder it looks like this I love
this powder oh my gosh it's all over oh
but that is what it looks like you can
see I hit some major pan it's just
really wonderful I feel like it does
mattify my pace but not like too much
it's not like super super like wool like
you know it feels like it's drying out
my skin but it does a matte appliance
mattify it no that's a word anyway I
really really like it a lot and then I
have been putting on top the it
cosmetics bye bye pores airbrush silk
pressed finishing powder so everybody
was telling me I had to get this in the
press diversion I do like it however I
like the loose version better I know how
dare I you guys can see I've already
started to hit a little bit of pan I
basically put the bye bye pores on top
of anything that i am wearing for the
past my three weeks I've been doing that
so um I really do like this one I just
think I like the loose one a little
better honestly I know that the loose
one is messy it goes up in the air and
it's like everywhere um and it's just
yeah it's very very messy but this one
it just doesn't sit on my skin the way
the like loose one does if that makes
sense the loose one just really really
looks amazing I buff it into my skin it
looks amazing I don't know I I like this
one I just don't like it as much but it
had been a favorite this week because I
think with the minimal makeup that I've
been wearing on my face it does top it
beautifully and then I have been setting
my makeup with the elf illuminating mist
and set or really really like this I
like the original version and I like
this one a lot too I just feel like it
gives a little bit of luminosity to my
skin and I don't know I've just been
wearing very natural makeup and liking
that luminous kind of glow this week so
I have been enjoying that a lot in
does prolong the makeup like as much as
they can like I said that tinted
moisturizer doesn't last forever on my
skin but it really does help for my
powders to kind of stay on longer I've
been wearing two different lip products
this week um they are the elf tinted lip
balms these are two dollars apiece I've
been wearing either X 0 red which is
this one it's a beautiful really really
bright red color it almost has a bit of
a pink undertone and then I've also been
wearing very sweet which is the one I
have on my lips today these are just
very very natural um but very very
pigmented and they have a nice amount of
color to them they do have like a minty
sorry there's something on there they
have been minty scent to them but this
is what the very sweet one looks like
very very pretty on this one again has a
little bit of a pink undertone as well
they're just very very comfortable to
wear on the lips they remind me a lot of
baby lifts and they're just like a
no-fuss sort of lip product so those
have definitely been a favourite this
week as far as mascara goes I'm
embarrassed to tell you guys I haven't
even been curling my eyelashes the only
make up eye makeup I've been wearing
this week is the Laura Geller glam lash
dramatic volumizing mascara in black it
looks like this I really love this
formula it's very very dry but it really
coats the lashes and it has a really
awesome little brush it's nothing
special um but I think that's why it
works so well it you know and nowadays I
feel like all these mascaras are getting
really complicated and trying to go all
out when it comes to like the bristles
of the brush or whatnot but this is just
very basic and simple and I think it
coats the lashes and it really kind of
tugs on them and makes you know the
lashes stand up and pull up the product
on them so i really really love that
product and like i said i have been
wearing any eyeliner or eyeshadow the
only thing and I embarrassed to say I
have been curling my lashes and anyway
the last product I want to talk about is
the hourglass ambient lighting edit
palette been using this this this little
egg it's been an interesting day you
guys i have been using this product for
basically everything highlight
blush bronzer not so much bronzer I
don't love the bronzer in here it's a
little orange e but it has two gorgeous
blushes as you guys can see right there
guys can see me and then it has three
highlighters on the top the ambient
lighting powders on the top of the
bronzer the blush is on the bottom
really really awesome products I do like
it a lot um it's just very very natural
I feel like you can't overdo it with our
glass products like their face products
it's very very hard to overdo and I've
just been going for a very minimalistic
approach this week and just fast simple
pretty glowing skin and i get that with
that ambient light and edit palette so
anyway you guys those were my favorites
for the week i hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you my next one
