thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day as
always i am here to share my weekly
favorites with you guys can also do a
quick little announcement um it is
saturday while I'm filming this right
now um it will go up on Sunday tomorrow
however I'm just not able to film
tomorrow we are going out of town my
boyfriend I are going back to my
family's house in Minnesota so um anyway
but what I wanted to talk about quickly
was a sample week I am starting it's
just going to be a week long so don't
worry it's not going to be a continuous
series um but I thought it would still
be fun to film every day while I'm gone
on my trip back home like I said we are
going back to visit my family for
Christmas and I just thought I really
really enjoy filming every single day
and I just thought this would make it
fun for me because I can still film for
you guys every single day so I am one of
those people that has and i'm sure you
guys do too if you are beauty lovers I
have a bin that literally probably has
200 samples in it and these are samples
that range from perfume to skincare to
hair care to make up just everything and
I've just accumulated so much and I
really want to find a way to kind of use
some of them and go through some of them
because honestly a lot of samples um a
lot of products that i have full sizes
of actually i tried them out first from
trying samples if that makes sense so i
tried the sample and i liked it so much
that i got the full size so i think it's
a great way to try products out and you
know it's basically a way for me to show
you guys to what i would purchase a full
size of so starting monday i'm through
sundays i will be basically showing you
guys empties of samples every single day
will probably be a very very short video
about five minutes long but i will show
you guys what i use did the day before
so technically starting tomorrow sunday
i will start using products and then i
will show you guys starting monday and
um I will be filming in a different
location obviously it will be at my
parents house but I'm going to try my
best to get good lighting and things
like that I'll just film right in front
of a window you can never go wrong with
natural lighting but anyway I just kind
of wanted to give you guys an update of
what i will be doing with my channel for
next week it will just be a week long so
if you are not interested you of course
can just come back next monday cuz i
will be back to filming regular videos
then and i'll be back in my beauty room
but i just wanted AI thought that this
would be fun it's a good way for me to
use up samples it's a great way for me
to see if there's any new products I
want to try and it's basically like a
mini empties video every single day and
by the way I will not be including any
of the samples that I used up in my
monthly empties at the end of the month
because I'll basically be doing little
mini empties reviews every day so i will
just toss them after i'm done with them
and I will be filming my regular empties
video when i get home from my trip but i
just wanted to give you guys a heads up
that's kind of what i'll be doing next
week I just thought it would be fun for
me to be able to film every single day
really enjoy doing that for you guys and
um I just didn't have time this week to
really a film multiple multiple videos
every single day today I'm filming three
videos but I didn't have time to do it
every single day and I really like
posting daily for you guys so I wasn't
able to kind of schedule videos for next
week so I'm sorry if the sample week
thing is not something that you are
interested in um but I hope that some of
you will tune in and I think it's just
kind of a fun way to like I said try new
products out and see what works and what
doesn't so anyway sorry I've been
talking for like four minutes now let's
just get into my weekly favorites so the
first thing that I want to talk about
our primers I have been loving my it
cosmetics feel the moment anti-aging
ultra hydrating sensory awaking sensory
awakening Brymer serum this is the
longest name ever but I love this stuff
I've talked about it um in my favorites
before and also in my a cosmetics
follow-up all video it's wonderful very
very hydrating and nice on the skin and
I have been wearing a fuller coverage or
heavier coverage foundation this week so
I have been loving that a lot as far as
eyeshadow is concerned I've been loving
this NYX eyeshadow base in white this
just
really Nate makes like a nice base for
eyeshadow and it is stark white so any
color that you put on top is really
going to pop so I really really love
that and then I have been going in and
filling in any fine lines or areas that
kind of cake up when I wear a fuller
coverage foundation I mean going in with
my Revlon age-defying wrinkle remedy
line filler this is just a silicone sort
of product that basically you can put on
any areas where you start to crease
throughout the day under my eyes and
around this area I smile a lot and also
when I'm playing flute I'm always
flexing these muscles so sometimes if
i'm wearing a heavier coverage
foundation it starts to crease so i
really like putting that over it just
helps and as far as a foundation goes
this week i have been loving my mac
studio sculpt SPF 15 foundation my shade
is NSC 15 this has a nice amount of
coverage without being overly drawing on
the skin I just think it's really really
nice it does give kind of like a demi
matt appearance to the skin and it's a
really good shade for my skin tone um
been loving my age rewind dark circle
treatment I talk about this like every
single week I'm sorry I just love this
underneath the eyes in the little
triangle shape and on my eyelids this is
the brightener one it has a pink
undertone it's very very brightly and
beautiful and then as far as um you know
basically concealing any spots that I
want to cover I've been loving this
Revlon age-defying targeted dark spot
concealer treatment this has amazing
coverage and I am in the lightest shade
it looks like this it has one of those
little kind of sponge tip applicator
which I feel like is kind of like dumpy
and gross but I'm telling you these dark
spots like erasers or things like that
these have amazing coverage those kind
of concealers do alright moving on lip
balm this week loving my Nivea a kiss of
mint and minerals this is refreshing lip
care it's so nice it smells amazing very
very minty and it's kind of pretty it's
like a linked blue but really really
moisturizing really really nice my lips
tend to get really dry this time of year
so I've been loving that and as far as
lip color goes this week I've been
loving my to face of melted liquefied
long-wear lipsticks the shade that I
wearing today is melted Chihuahua I
don't think I agree with that name at
all like melted Chihuahua didn't mean
like chihuahua cheese or do they need
like an actual melted puppy like
Chihuahua not cool um but this is the
shade it is what I'm wearing on my lips
today it's kind of a nudie pinky color
and then I've also been loving melted
berry and that is a lot of people have
been commenting on this lip color this
week it's beautiful it's a beautiful mix
of kind of reddish bread and plum mixed
together beautiful beautiful true berry
shade I've been loving my tertius
contour kit from Tarte I just love
everything in here I love the contouring
shades I've been using the lighter one
which is right there and then I've been
using the blush this week as well
exclusively and I just love this palette
I think it's absolutely fantastic for
setting my foundation I've been loving
my Revlon nearly naked pressed powder in
010 fair it has a little bit of a pink
undertone but it's really really nice
it's very finely milled and it sits
beautifully on the skin I have been
trying a new palette that I've recently
purchased this week this is the vi's art
um or visi art how do you say it is if I
start busy art these art a lot of people
say this differently differently but it
is in 07 cool maths and this is what it
looks like and you guys probably have
noticed I've been wearing a lot of cool
tones this week on my eyes there's a lot
of blues in here a lot of Gray's like
slate blue just very very pretty colors
and I will say when I use this for the
first time on monday um it was a hot
mess I could not blend it out i don't
recommend using this particular palette
or this formulation with any kind of
dense brush it just doesn't work you
really want to use a nice fluffy brush
especially in the crease area so that is
what i recommend because it did not go
well when i use this with a dense brush
whatsoever but fluffy brushes oh my gosh
these blends like a dream they're
beautiful and I think the colors are
absolutely stunning so been loving that
and then also I have been incorporating
I shadow singles into my eyeshadow
routine every single week
I'm trying to this was actually a
recommendation from my friend leora I
was telling her I have all these
eyeshadow singles and I never reached
for them because I always reach for
palette so she said why don't you take
one shade that you can use like on your
lid every single week and incorporate it
in with a palette so Thank You leora I
have been doing that and this week I've
been taking steel as kitten eye shadow
this is the Stila kitten single and it's
a beautiful champagne II sort of color
and it's gorgeous all over the lid and
also on the inner corner of the eyes and
you can just pair it with anything and I
just think any kind of color like that
lid colors that you can pair and
incorporate into your routine with an
eyeshadow palette is kind of genius
because I feel like we all reach for
eyeshadow palettes they're easy to work
with you have so many color ranges and I
feel like I just neglect my single
eyeshadows all the time so I have been
blowing that steal a single in kitten I
just think it's such a beautiful
champagne II color alright for brows
this week I've been loving my BH
Cosmetics flawless brow gel this is in
the shade blonde this puts a little bit
of color in it combs through your lashes
like it kind of you know it shaped them
and also it gives hold it's like a
perfect trifecta um products so really
really love that um eyeliners this week
I've been wearing either the knicks um
slide on eyeliner in SL 0 for pure white
on my waterline or like today I've been
wearing my clinic skinny stick in 03
slim sable I love these this is really
brightening in the water line and then
this one is a very precise and gives a
beautiful beautiful definition and it's
a gorgeous gorgeous color if you have
light-colored eyes Browns really really
bring it out so love that as far as
highlighters go this week been using my
makeup revolution vivid baked
highlighter in golden lights I talked
about this a lot I'm obsessed with it
look at that pigmentation it's the most
amazing thing ever it's just a gorgeous
gorgeous white opalescent ethereal color
with tons and tons of golden shimmer and
I just love this highlighter and talk
about
alright and i have been wearing just one
mascara this week you guys know i
normally pair my mascaras but I've only
been wearing one this is the laura
mercier extra lash sculpting mascara in
black onyx I love this it has a really
really funky wand it is really big so
you want to make sure you don't poke
your eye out but it's got a lovely wand
it's a rubber bristle brush which is my
favorite kind of brush to work with and
I just absolutely love it if you don't
like clumpy lashes you're not going to
want to reach for this one because um
they clump up pretty quickly but I don't
mind clumpy lashes I think it's just
very very defining so I really love this
and if you do want to wear more than one
layer you've got to work fast because
this dries quickly all right and lastly
as far as makeup is considered I've been
loving this NYX matte finish setting
spray I really love this settings very
beautiful if you want a matte finish on
your skin and not too much of a globe
this is a perfect product it really does
prolonged aware of your makeup all right
let's move on to fragrance my fragrance
duo of the week have been this paris
hilton perfume mixed with the victoria's
secret sexy little things fragrance mist
these smell very very similar and i
think that's the reason why i've been
pairing them together i really really
like the combination of these two and
yeah not much to say about that by the
way this paris hilton perfume this is
just the original one you can get these
for super super cheap now and also they
last a very long time they have a very
long like where time um for taking a
bath this week I've been loving my bath
and body works aromatherapy sleep
lavender vanilla bath soak I have been
getting to bed at a reasonable hour like
this whole week which has been amazing
like a twelve o'clock that's when I've
been going to bed which is very abnormal
for me I'm usually the kind of girl
that's up until 2am and then wakes up
that like six or seven and in the
morning so I really burn both ends of
the candle I just don't get a lot of
sleep but this has helped me really to i
go to bed at night if that makes sense I
take a bath every other day and just so
calming the lavender and vanilla is
beautiful and um the bath soaps they're
kind of like epsom salts so they help
with
and pain in your body and yeah love it
all right as far as mass go this week
I've actually been using a peel um so
this is kind of interesting this is an
enzymatic um what would you call it like
fruit acid kind of peel it's from Alba
Botanica allah alba botanica it's called
be good and clean fruit acid detox
fusion it is a poor purifying mini pelé
it's an oil-free gel it you just slather
it on and it starts to tingle and it
really really eats off the top layer of
the skin I don't recommend this if you
have sensitive skin but if you have
combination skin oily skin dry skin this
can really help to exfoliate I really
like the elbow botanica brand they are
one hundred percent vegetarian
ingredients they have no parabens no
synthetic fragrances nothing bad like
that and I just really really love this
deal so that has been my go-to mask or
peel for the week and then the last two
products are hair care products the
first one is my redken all soft shampoo
I love this shampoo it is just beautiful
I don't recommend it if you don't color
your hair like if you have hair like
mine that's just very very flat and
naturally straight and kind of gets
greasy quickly but you don't color it I
don't recommend this I tried using this
when I didn't color my hair and it just
weighed it down but now that I do color
my hair I have a little more texture and
hold to it I guess and this works
beautifully it smells really good it
smells like apricot and baby powder and
it just really really moisturizes the
hair on you do need to basically wash
your hair every other day if you're
going to use it because it doesn't
really deep clean the scalp but it is a
really really nice shampoo and then I've
been loving my oh gx or organics
renewing argan oil of Morocco
penetrating oil this is a fantastic
little oil I'm almost done with this and
I just love the way it makes my ends I
feel so anyway of those were my
favorites for the week I hope you guys
will join me for a sample week starting
tomorrow or yeah when you're watching
this video it will be starting tomorrow
yes monday so i hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you
