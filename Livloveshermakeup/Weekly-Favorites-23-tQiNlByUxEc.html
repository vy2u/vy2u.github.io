thank you so much for joining me if my
hair looks a little windblown we are
actually having a straight-up blizzard
here in Milwaukee right now like it's
crazy i think all over the midwest right
now you're having i think the storm is
called Goliath or something he's crazy
he's all over the place there's huge
winds blowing and snow everywhere it's
kind of fun no no but anyway I am here
to share my weekly favorites with you
guys if you see little rings in my eyes
yes I got a ring light for Christmas so
lighting is a little different let me
know what you think of it in the
comments below um I think it gives
really really even lighting on every
side of your face which i think is great
so please let me know what you think I'm
still gonna fuss around with everything
and see if I can get some lighting in
the back so you guys can see all the
princesses and move my camera and all of
that I'm still getting used to my beauty
room or whatnot but um please let me
know what you think of the new lighting
but anyway i'm here to share my weekly
favorites with you guys I was supposed
to do this video yesterday I said I
would do this video yesterday and I'm
one of those people I really like to
follow through was something that I plan
to do however I did travel back from
minnesota yesterday i was going to say
from holiday but yeah I was on holiday
in Minnesota with my family and I did
travel back yesterday it took six and a
half hours to drive back to Milwaukee
and I said that I was going to come back
I was gonna film my weekly favorites and
then post him right away and honestly I
got back and I just felt yucky and
Dunkey and I don't know I just felt very
like frazzled if that makes sense and
i'm one of those people i only like to
film my videos when I feel like filming
them and I was just not in the mood so I
did not film them but anyway um I am
here now I'm ready to do it and I I'm
gonna share a my weekly favorites with
you guys there's mostly just make up
this week because if you tuned in at
this past week i was using up samples
basically all week for skin care hair
care of things like that because i was
doing sample week so most of this is
makeup but a lot of people have been
asking to what i've been wearing on my
eyes and stuff this week so let's get
started the first thing i've been using
and wearing and love
is this palette right here this is what
I've been wearing on my eyes all week
this is the Makeup Forever palette nine
artists shadow and this is the natural
one it's got nine gorgeous shadows in it
you get some nice highlights on the top
some pretty like priests colors there
and then some like defining shades I
mean you can do whatever you want with
them but really really gorgeous shades I
am wearing this color today in my crease
and then I have this color on my lid and
a lot of people were asking me you know
what shadows are you wearing and what
not this formula is very comparable to
the makeup geek foiled I shadows they're
just very pigmented they go on very very
creamy very smooth and I just love the
formulation so I have been absolutely
loving this palette I think it's super
neutral and it's just been great for me
this week so that is the first favorite
the second favorite is the two-faced
Coco contour chiseled to perfection kit
I've been traveling with a lot of kits
because I feel like they're the easiest
thing to travel with you know pallets or
things like that because you get so many
different options so I like this for
just bronzing up and contouring my face
it also has two highlighting shades I
didn't really use those that much this
week but I definitely use the kind of
more topi contour and then also that
bronzer shade and they do smell like
chocolate they're really really great
they blend really beautifully on the
skin I'm actually not wearing any
contour or promising product on my face
today probably why I look a little
washed out but I did wear it every other
day this week so I love that as far as
highlighting goes I really enjoyed my
becca on champagne glow little palette
just because you can mix and match these
highlighters and you get a nice like
array of them I didn't really use the
darker one but I really really enjoyed
it mixing this one right here which is
champagne pop and pearl together this
week the two of them together on top of
each other is really really beautiful
today I'm only wearing a champagne pop
but the two on top of each other let me
layer them on so you guys can see so
that's the two of them mixed together
they give a beautiful you get this
golden glow and then you get a little
bit of that wipe out like that white
opalescent kind of glow so I really
really love those two pair together and
I've been wearing that a lot all over my
cheekbones and things like that and then
I'd be wearing a lot of lip colors this
week so then what I have on my lips
right now is kind of like the nude that
I've been wearing
week or at least this is a nude for me
this is the NYX soft matte lip cream
this is the shade a stumble it looks
like this i'm going to go ahead and
swatch it for you guys so you can see
it's a beautiful mavi pink color and you
know it's really not a nude color but
you guys know I don't I always wear
lighter colors on my lips I have a lot
of lighter colors I just don't wear them
all the time I really really should
though but that is the shade Istanbul
that's the one I have on my lips today
like i said i've been wearing that a lot
and then of course for the holidays for
christmas i had to wear a red this is
the it cosmetics blurred lines lipstick
in it girl it's just a beautiful blue
toned red shade is right there and then
i also have been loving this little tart
lip surgeons in the shade pizzazz this
is wonderful it's like a beautiful
reddish berry color like really
beautiful can you guys see it it's right
there so a little more like Barry toned
than the red right there at the it
cosmetics one sorry everything's
backwards what I'm point from the
viewfinder but anyway that pizzazz shade
is really really gorgeous i love that
one a lot and then i also have been
playing with this little dual-ended
lipstick from bite beauty this is in
mulberry and scarlet really really dark
shades these were just kind of berry
lips that i was playing with this week
that i really enjoyed I didn't pack them
on super heavily I'm just very very
lightly right there we have mulberry
which is a beautiful berry color and
then we also have scarlet which is more
of a dark dark vampy kind of cherry dark
cherry lip I would say and that one is
right there so really really beautiful
colors I kind of just wanted to like on
my trip I kind of just want to have like
a very a kind of pinky color like a new
dish color um a red and whatnot so those
works out really really well for me I
did you use a lot of lip products this
week but I really had a lot of fun doing
it so I really enjoyed those the next
product um that I really really enjoyed
this week is my Smashbox photo finish
hydrating under eye primer this is a
product that is in my 2016 makeup use up
Trey basically I'm trying to use up
quite a few products before um you know
2017 wait yeah for this night this
coming year I'm trying to use up quite a
few products and this is one of them I
I think it's going to be hard to go
through it is a very very small tube but
it's nice i just don't really think
about it because i think why do I need a
under eye primer but I have one so I
should use it up and it is very very
good as far as foundation goes I have
been loving and wearing my charts of
Estonian clay full coverage foundation
this has SPF 15 in it and my shade I
have a little blessing there my shade is
a fair beige this is a 12-hour makeup
its oil free it's beautiful i love it on
the skin it's a very full coverage and
it covers everything and underneath that
I've actually been wearing another
product that is in my little use up tray
for 2016 this is the Bobby Brown extra
SPF 25 tinted moisturizing balm in the
shade alabaster and this is what it
looks like and this is just a very very
thick hydrating tinted moisturizer and I
basically abuse that underneath and when
I put the full coverage foundation on on
top and I felt like I just had a very
nice flawless sort of canvas this week
for my face so I really did enjoy that a
lot um the next thing that I've been
loving is another palettes got so like a
dirty like I don't even know it looks so
grungy this is the Amazonian clay bling
it on palette from tarts this is this
year's holiday blush palette you get
five gorgeous shades in here most of
them are kind of like a matte satin e
texture and then one of them has some
shimmer but I've really been loving the
shade prim smashing and fetching those
are probably my three favorites in their
beaming and doll face are pretty they're
just not super wintery I guess you could
say but yeah this one fetching prim and
smashing have been my favorite so I
really really love those I think it's a
beautiful beautiful palette and again
it's just nice to you know travel with
these kind of things because you get
such a solution you get to choose what
you want to put on i will say i do like
last year's palette better i know that
it is really chunky i didn't really mind
like the chunky packaging but I like the
colors better there were more deeper
colors in there alright moving on as far
as primers go I've been using one of my
favorites this week this is the Stila
aqua glow perfecting primer amazing
perfect beautiful I absolutely adore
this primer it's gorgeous it's basically
just this little twist up thing here
it's a very cooling easy to set sort of
primer
it really just sinks into your skin
immediately it doesn't leave a cell
Akane fetish it doesn't leave a sticky
finish it just absorbs right into your
skin and really helps prolong the where
okay guy alright what else as far as
eyeliners go this week I've been wearing
like today I have the Sephora black eye
pencil it's just their original formula
it's not even waterproof but literally
it lasts on my waterline so well I've
been wearing that and also my Laura
Geller icare waterproof eyeliner and I
brightener this is the banana shade love
this as well I show this all the time
probably should stop mentioning it in
weekly favorites um oh I wanted to
mention this this is the lip smacker in
royal red velvet oh my god i'm going to
use this again next week because it's so
good it smells like cupcakes amazing um
as far as mascara goes I've been putting
on one coat of the Too Faced better than
sex with one coat of the Sephora
outrageous curl these are two of my
favorite mascaras love them they give a
really really beautiful definition when
combined together lengths volume
everything and let's see that is all the
makeup let's get into there are a few
little skin care products some are
talking about quickly the bath and
Bodyworks black cherry Merlot nourishing
hand cream oh my god okay no I just
can't I can't even it smells so good you
guys I love this scent this is probably
one of my favorite like winter sense
that they have they need to come out
with this scent in candle form sorry but
seriously they need a three wood candle
on the set because it is so good it just
smells like like a black cherry or
something like that like just really
really rich beautiful scent and I'm
surprised because I kind of never really
picked up a lot of these hand creams
because I really thought the set was
probably just gonna irritate me I get
really really like eczema and dry skin
on my wrist and my hands especially
during the winter um but it's great it
has shea butter in it and moisturizers
really well I've been obsessed as far as
shampoo shower gel and Bo basco while I
was traveling I took a three in one
product from philosophy this is the
spice cinnamon stick and like I said can
use this is a shampoo shower gel and
bubble bath it's a three-in-one it's
perfect it's amazing I loved it it
smells really good if you love cinnamon
you will love that and from
asking this week because I was traveling
I decided to take little tiny these are
like mono doses or mono pods but you can
get more than one use out of these
little things these are the Sephora
lotus sleeping mask which is amazing
smells really good and the Sephora jelly
mask it's moisturizing and energizing
both are great this one is super great
if you pop it in the fridge before
putting it on your skin and then my last
two favorites for the week are my
perfumes I will be filming right after
this video will be up later today I will
be filming how i pair my fragrances I
know a lot of people might not be
interested in that video but I have had
some requests of people asking me
because every single week I mentioned a
body miss paired with a perfume because
I love to pair my fragrances so that
will be nice if you guys are interested
just want to let you know but I've been
loving this marc jacobs mod noir which
is interesting i usually wear this
during the summertime um it has a
heavily heavily dose of heavily made no
sense and the heavy dose of gardenia in
it okay it just smells like straight-up
gardenia it's amazing it's beautiful and
it really pairs well with this secret
wonderland fragrance mist from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works I like this because it was
like wintry sort of packaging super cute
this has a floral e undertone with a
sweet overtone so I don't know if they
just paired well I really really like
that they both have that kind of
florally undertone so they won't they
worked well together all right so anyway
those for all my favorites for the week
I'm sorry that I did not get this up
yesterday um I'm always like I get
disappointed when my with myself when I
say I'm gonna do something and then I
don't um but anyway it was just one of
those things I wasn't really in the mood
to film and I love coming on here and
just being myself and filming when I
want to film I don't believe you should
feel if you don't want to obviously so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me
and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
