thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic day i am
sharing my weekly favorites with you
guys today and there's a lot i have a
music stand turned like flat and i put
all the products on there which probably
isn't a good idea is probably gonna get
all dirty but i don't care all right
let's start the first thing i've been
loving this week is the Neutrogena
oil-free acne stress control
triple-action toner i use this one it is
at that time of the month and also i'm
gonna lupus flare right now so I've been
dealing with a lot of rashes textured
tilde textured skin just really really
um just a lot of texture on my face
which I don't like so this has 2%
salicylic acid in it it does clear out
the pores it does smell very very
strongly of alcohol and a little bit of
cucumber so if you think you won't like
that you probably should get it my
second favorite is the be joyful Shaitan
vitamin E shower gel from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works I love the formulation of the
shower gels they're actually very very
moisturizing and the scent does not
bother my skin even right now when I'm
going to flare up and I've been having
lots of rashes and things like that this
does not bother my skin um smells very
very strong very fragrant you know it's
so weird because fountain body works
I'll so this one I was going to show you
guys the japanese cherry blossom bubble
bath has been a favorite like I think
that I could use these during flare-ups
I normally use like cetaphil and really
really calming things and don't even put
bubbles in my bath but these fragrances
are not irritating it's we're kind of
interesting but anyway this Beach Eiffel
scent is great it is a mix of sparkling
clementine golden mango frosted Jasmine
winter melon and shimmering sugar love
it and like i said the japanese cherry
blossom for bubble bath really really
nice perfumey warmer sent perfect for
any time of the year you could use this
during the summer during the spring
winter any time all right as far as
makeup goes I've been loving glowy skin
this week I've been carrying I was
insane matching I've been pairing my
L'Oreal True Match Lumi powder globe
illuminators in n 20 2 rows and ice
which is the cool tone 1 so this is the
row shade and when I first tried these
like by themselves I didn't think the
rose one really showed up that well I
didn't think it was anything special
and then this month the Seas c30 to ice
was so cool domed it literally looked
like I had like blue on you know my
cheekbone it still does kind of show up
like that but when you do the Rose first
and the ice I just love the color that I
get and I have very very fair skin and
this ice one it's like 22 strong by
itself for me so highly highly recommend
those two if you have them I was going
to actually you know donate them in my
declutter series but I'm glad I held on
to them because they do go well together
all right next lipsticks and what I've
been wearing on my lips so today towards
the end of the week I basically just
went into wearing a tinted lip balm
because my lips are super dry this is
the benefit venable and it's great it's
just a tinted um reddish rosy color I
have it on my lips right now very very
moisturizing and I just I've been having
really dry lip so I can't wear the other
two that I've been using this week but
towards the beginning of the week I was
using my Rimmel show-off lip lacquer
this is ben big bang it's a beautiful
kind of red color absolutely gorgeous
love that and also I was wearing my Kate
Moss lipstick from Rimmel in 10 for this
is a beautiful kind of nudie your lips
but better kind of color I really really
like it so sorry if my hands are a
little shaky when I'm holding things up
I get a little bit of a a lick hand
twitch when I'm in flare-ups which
totally freaks me out but like I'll be
holding something and I really start
like twitching it's kind of kind of
strange but if you notice what that's
what's going on that's why all right
I've been wearing one blush this week
this has like they built an illuminator
in it this is the hard candy glow all
the way blush in 994 punch look at that
what it's a beautiful pink shade and it
goes into like an ombre effect of a
highlight so basically I've been wearing
a blush highlight with two highlighters
I've really been glowing and then the
last step that I've been doing this even
more luminous and gives you an even more
glowy complexion is the touch of
luminous dewy skin mess I just sprayed
three sprays with this on my
at the end of my makeup and it's just
not prolong my makeup because it have
like oils in it but it does give you a
beautiful dewy luminous look to the skin
try not to use too much because honestly
that stuff goes through the bob you get
through the bottle really really quickly
and unfortunately it is like what like
sixty dollars now 4030 it's expensive
all right as far as foundation goes this
week towards the beginning of the week I
was loving my L'Oreal visible lift serum
absolute pro retinol a plus vitamin C in
143 soft ivory really really love this I
was saying in the video actually the
tutorial I was saying oh yeah this is
really nice like light to medium
coverage but then i did a first
impression on this one and this is the
laura mercier canceled glow soft
luminous foundation in the shade shell
and this is light coverage this is like
medium so what I did today actually was
put one layer of the Laura Mercier on
and then I did one layer of the L'Oreal
visible lift and I feel like it gave me
a really nice even complexion I've been
into really glowy skin this week and
also not trying to cover everything not
trying to literally hide every blemish
or every rash or whatever's going on
with my skin I've just been liking the
kind of natural look where you can see
through it basically um but I would say
this one is more meetings and the Laura
Mercier is definitely like a light
coverage and i think one layer of this
is you know all you need because when
you start to build it up it actually
starts to look worse and worse honestly
so one layers all you need it's
beautiful um let's see here as far as
hair stuff from it out oh wait a minute
what's that the right one okay sorry I
just had a spaz moment this is the right
one ok this is the germ x silver biting
miracle leave-in conditioning treatment
it is a five in one formula wait just
not the right one oh no it is it is
Tommy yes sorry guys I have two models
like this from jermack and they look
identical and one is like a pump and
it's like a cream and this one is the
toner but is the one I've been using
it's basically conditions softens
brightens add shine and moisturizes
actually made my blonde hair look almost
like grayish this week so I would
recommend using this every time that you
shower but it does help to detangle and
it does help get rid of any sort of
ce n'est that might be in your hair
honestly I need to see my hair styles
I've not seen her for a very long time
and ultimately i'm going to be doing
like the really really platinum ash
blonde color but we are gradually going
up so that i don't damage my hair too
much but that has been really nice
because my hair naturally pulls a lot of
gold and yellow tones even though
naturally like my virgin hair is
actually very cool and Ashley toned very
strange alright for setting a my
foundation I had been using my Revlon
nearly naked almost the whole week and
then the other day I picked up this
L'Oreal Paris True Match mineral instant
shine eraser in n 12 I love this this is
wonderful to set your foundation in like
it's just like I don't even know how to
explain it has the same kind of
consistency as the elf tone correcting
powder that's why I like it so much
that's what I'm comparing it to i love
the elf tone correcting powder it's very
finely milled you can't tell it when you
look at it you can't tell like there's
you know powder really on your face it
just look so natural and i love it this
shape is really good for me to the n12
um it's not yellowy it's not too pink
it's really just right in the middle
really nice alright for eyeshadow this
week I've been loving my physicians
formula map collection quad I shadow in
classic nudes it looks like this and
today I am wearing let's see I did like
the sandwich technique where you just
use two colors and I put the lighter
color all over my lid and then I'm
wanting with that darker color right
there and let me swatch these guys
they're really really pigmented really
nice matte drugstore eyeshadows and I
feel like you can't say that very often
about the drugstore like oh yeah matts
you know well now it's kind of a big
thing everybody's coming out with Matt
palettes but these have been around
forever i also have the one in canyon
classics i believe it is that's more
cool toned beautiful beautiful beautiful
love all right ah let's see here all
right at nighttime after I've been using
that toner the salicylic acid one from
Neutrogena I've been going in with my
Olli henriksen invigorating night
treatment it's an overnight resurfacer
it helps with texture and it has 12
source aah A's in it love this stuff it
does tingle and bernal
on the skin but that's because it's got
like like colic acid and things in it
it's really really good though for acne
hyperpigmentation fine lines wrinkles
you name it it's great for that and then
I'd also been loving the Olay henriksen
ultimate lift on gel this is super super
like lifting literally my eyelashes get
stuck up here and then like it's every
time I blink slit it gets sticky and I'm
what's going on and I will be like that
and it's because my lashes are actually
stuck to the you know my eyelid so it's
really really sticky but in the morning
my eyes look so bright and pretty and
fresh and crisp and that's unheard of
when i'm in a flare-up usually it's just
like everything's like super like my eye
so pretty yellow and tired and tons of
puffiness but this has been really
really great for me I love it um all
right i want to buy a full size of this
primer i've been loving the benefit
brightening face primer this is the back
gal1 it has like a pink undertone and i
almost have like CC correcting
properties to it I feel like I put it on
and it kind of looks like I could a BB
cream on which is awesome so I've been
loving that i've also been loving my
bosha a detoxifying black cleanser this
is just one of those little deluxe sized
samples from Sephora it's awesome it
starts to heat up on your face the
charcoal activates and it really clears
your pores out awesome product and in
the morning I've been loving my Olay
hendrickson truth serum collagen booster
really brightens my skin up it's got a
beautiful beautiful scent it smells like
an orange creamsicle like the ice cream
um and what else is I going to say about
it it is a little slimy like it feels a
little slimy but it sinks in immediately
so you don't feel that on your face so
really really love that all right
shampoo for this week which is really
strange i usually use a medicated
shampoo when i'm going to flare up i
keep saying I'm gonna flip it I talk
about like the items that i'm using this
week are specifically because i'm in a
flare ups so if you're wondering why I
keep bringing it up it's because I'm
really doing lots of like treatments on
my face at night to help rashes and
itchiness and things like that tells us
I'm sorry I don't mean to keep you like
all of its clovis but this is the farne
fructis daily care normal hair shampoo
and this has been working really well
for me um it feels really soothing when
I
lather it up on my scalp it really helps
with all those little scab ease and you
know rashes that I have on there and it
doesn't bother my hair and it doesn't
dry it out and who knew guy may through
tease had the best shampoo um all right
as far as moisturizer during the day I
beneath you my clinique dramatically
different moisturizing lotion it is just
very very basic it has no scent it
doesn't irritate your skin whatsoever
and of course I mix in three drops of my
polished choice was this moisture rota
moisture renewal oil booster for dry and
very dry skin talk about this all the
time but I mixed that in for my hair
I've been loving my otx renewing argan
oil of Morocco penetrating oil actually
I mentioned this last week sorry it's
still a favorite um taking off makeup at
night like specifically my eye makeup
the bomb has this bombs away I make a
breakup it's like it's super cute
packaging of course it's a bomb but this
is what it looks like it's like a thick
petroleum jelly and I basically rub it
all over my eyes and then I go in with a
little cotton actually I have them right
here I use these cotton ovals the
premium cotton elbows from the up-and-up
brand these are my favorite they have a
textured side and then the soft side and
I use the soft side around my eyes and
just my gods really takes makeup off
well I really would enjoy it I've been
using this little dry bar the chaser
shine cream just to kind of finish off
my hair um you know put it on the ends
just how to make it look shiny and
pretty some people were commenting um a
couple days ago yeah I've been braiding
my hair a lot um and so I've been having
ways the next day and people are saying
oh your hair looks so shiny it's because
I've been putting that in kind of as
like my finishing product if that makes
sense alright let's see here was that
everything wait a minute I have to be
missing something oh yes okay the label
has come off of this but this was from
the Melissa otra subscription bag I did
end up cancelling on my order after
three months that just wasn't really
interested in her bag but I do love her
as a youtuber this was her sea salt
spray smells really really good and
again I've been doing a lot of texture
stuff with my hair basically lots of
braids and because i do have fine hair
um
just doesn't really hold a curl so if I
spray a little bit of this into it it
doesn't make it crusty by any means it
smells really good and it just adds a
little texture without it being like
sticky if that makes sense and then
another product I have to talk about
this one upset all of it okay I'm
looking at it now and I'm like what I
was going through so quickly cuz I
honestly thought this was going to be a
six hour video alright well apparently I
got through that pretty quickly um but
my last favorite is the non SEMA
ultimate clear anti blemish pads
salicylic acid 2% can do you see a trend
here with the acne products for this
week these are great they smell very
strongly up like oof eucalyptus mmm oh
it's actually kind of opening my sinus
is that ok cool a little bit of home
there too probably not a great idea hey
guys but don't smell them but they are
great I don't have a lot to say I've
tried the acne stress control from the
Neutrogena they have like a two percent
cell silicic acid little pad to they're
all kind of the same stridex um I don't
know you know they're just like smells
like ass acid back knee pads and
basically just put it and you spot treat
any area that you want to or you can use
it all over your face so um dad is it
Wow listen you actually went by pretty
quickly I hope that all my thoughts were
together and I wasn't rambling too much
my boyfriend always jokes around um I
have lupus fog I get kind of like oh you
know I get very distracted and a little
um just a little aloof I guess you could
say so I do want to say you know it and
you have the past videos like up in the
past couple days have been sort of um
not very straightforward I can't help it
I don't know just I just don't feel good
and um I don't know I feel like
sometimes I look back at the video and
I'm like wow I was acting strange why do
i doing nothing but it is what it is
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed on my
favorites tomorrow I will be demoing and
doing a review on the new benefit what
is it called shy shy girl not shy beam
shy girl shy beam highlighter and I'll
be demoing batch for you guys as well I
already said that come on Olivia get
your thoughts together that's it i'm
going to go before I just dig myself
into a hole of embarrassment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
