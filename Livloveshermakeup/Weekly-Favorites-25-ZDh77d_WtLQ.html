here to share on my weekly favorites
with you guys so if you would like to
see what I've been loving this week then
let's just get right into it the first
thing I've been loving is wearing first
of all darker clothes just like clothes
that are darker in color I don't know
live and loving Gray's dark blues like
Navy colors black all that kind of stuff
i've just been loving darker clothes for
whatever reason and then also on
hairstyles i've been wearing my hair up
pretty much the whole week i actually
think i wear my hair up every single day
this week i've been loving really really
sleek ponytails like ones that just go
right on the back of your head i
normally end the kind of person any time
you see me with a ponytail it's like
right on the top of my head i learned
that from my cheerleading days we used
to wear our hair bright at the top of
our head and then we would tie it with a
little ribbon which I a cute are they
sleeps by the way aren't those adorable
they're like those um don't like
bell-bottoms sleeves so think they're so
cute anyway I would wear my hair right
at the top of my head and tie it with a
little ribbon which i think is an
adorable style you guys maybe see me
wear that next week actually um but I
used to do that all the time so I felt
like the only thing I would really do
with my hair if I was wearing in a
ponytail was we're right at the top of
my head but this like I've been loving a
ponytail right at the back of my head
and also I've been loving doing a bun
right at the back of my head so those
have definitely been favorites this week
and now let's get into the actual items
that have been favorites my first
favorite is definitely my makeup eraser
I've been loving this thing this week it
is amazing um it really really removes
makeup on my face really really well I
was very skeptical when I first got this
product but I see now that it really is
just fantastic and amazing and all you
have to do that's a little annoying is
rewashed it every single time you use it
which honestly can be quite annoying but
I have just gotten into the habit of
literally throwing it into the dirty
hamper after I use it every single time
or just throwing it directly into the
wash and washing it by itself every
single
it which yes can be costly because
you're using detergent every single
night to watch this thing but it really
does remove face makeup really really
well and I've been pairing that with my
bare minerals mineral licks tours facial
cleansing oil god I have like a hair on
my lip hold on a minute you can feel it
where is it there ok like I feel it um
and I've been pairing that with my bare
minerals mineral Xers facial cleansing
oil I just talked about this in my
follow-up haul the video right before
this one I love this for removing my eye
makeup excuse me my eye makeup it really
really is good it removes every trace of
waterproof mascara just everything that
you've been wearing on your eyes this
will remove so I've been using that for
my eye makeup and then I go in with my
makeup eraser for it the face makeup all
right another favorite has been this
aromatherapy energy lemon zest body wash
and foam bath I've been using this F a
bubble bath and also a body wash it is
an invigorating blend of lemon essential
oil and ginseng that provides a
pick-me-up it's amazing i've been loving
citrusy sense this week um you guys will
see that in a second when I show you my
other favorite but this is amazing it
smells so good and it just smells like
lemon and I feel like lemon is just such
an uplifting send anything citrusy is
really an uplifting sense so I've been
really really enjoying that and it does
have that little bit of like 10 cuz it's
got that zest in there really enjoy that
as far as fragrances go this week again
more citrus been loving this duo on my
Pacifica Malibu lemon blossom perfume it
smells like lemon and it's just amazing
and I've been appearing that with my
body shops Satsuma body mist I am
discuss with this stuff oh my gosh it
smells so good it smells like be like
literally like you just cut open oranges
and you get that lick sent that's really
really citrusy and I may think that is
literally what this body mist smells
like so I love this and I love
everything citrus this week I've just
been loving it the next thing I want to
talk about if they hair product I am way
overdue to get my hair done I have not
to see my fair girl and I think two
months or maybe two and a half months
which is crazy she couldn't get me in
over the holiday season I didn't call
soon enough I felt really bad I know
that they get very very busy that time
of year um but I might my outgrowth like
my roots have been horrible so I saw
this from john frieda I am a fan of the
clip go blonde or a line a lot of people
hate this line if you have really really
damaged hair you're going to hate this
line there's peroxide in here if you
have dry damaged hair you just don't
want to you don't want to go for these
kind of products but um they have this
new go blonder in shower lightening
treatment and it's supposed to let you
have like a one shade lighter in one
wash and I did put that on my roots and
I feel like it blends in a lot more than
i did this and so i did this in the wash
the other day and basically it has
peroxide in it you can smell it there's
definitely some sort of peroxide or
bleach in there so just be careful but
what you do is it has this little duel
treatment like tube and you squeeze it
all out you put it on your roots or your
hair work wherever you want to put it
wherever you want to lighten you leave
it on for five minutes and then you
rinse it out or you wash your hair
normally with shampoo and conditioner
and I really did feel like this
lightened my roots a little bit it
didn't make them look rafi it just kind
of is helping my hair to blend in more
with the color towards the end so this
was definitely very very helpful for me
this week and I would repurchase this
alright another hair product i've been
loving and i used up completely is this
caviar anti-aging moisture intense oil
creme this is a pre shampoo treatment
for dry hair and coarse hair it looks
like this i will be purchasing a full
size of this i really really like this
product I'm not in love with all of the
caviar anti-aging hair products honestly
I heard really good things about their
shampoo and conditioner but I've tried
some of their leaving sprays and creams
and I've never been a huge fan but this
is a product that you put in your hair
before you wash it and it really does
help just to kind of put a little extra
moisture into your hair and just make it
more manageable help tame it a little
bit brush through it get tangles out
before you wash your hair so I really
did like that a lot and it will
repurchase um I've also been loving this
Nivea lip butter and caramel creme kiss
at night
I it's so moisturizing and it smells
amazing it smells like smells like a
caramel cream latte I don't even know it
smells great it has a really luxury as a
buttery texture to it I've had this for
a long time and it hasn't gone rancid or
bad and it's just really really awesome
really moisturize this might look really
nicely I've also been loving my glam
glow super mud dual cleanse treatment or
power mud sorry this is the dual cleanse
treatment I love this one this is great
for those who have combination skin it
really helps cleanse and kind of clear
up your t-zone but not dry out your
cheeks so I really really love this one
smells like Kiwi really awesome and then
the last skin care product I want to
talk about is the oly henriksen the
clean truth cleansing cloths these are
the brightening ones with vitamin C and
coq10 not for makeup removal but just
for cleansing your face in the morning I
have not been I kind of have been
skimping on like you know skincare this
week which you guys can probably tell
because these these two products are
really the only skincare products that
I've been loving this week and I feel
like that says a lot because I honestly
just haven't been taking great care of
my skin this week but that will change
next week but um these are really really
great just for running over your face in
the morning to pick up extra makeup
excess makeup that's around your eye
area or even um you know sorry you know
it's got really really runny simply for
picking up xsi makeup just tiny tiny
little bits it doesn't remove like a
full-on face of makeup but it also is
nice if you've been working out or
you're sweating a little bit or you just
want to cleanse your face really quickly
in the morning without going to the sink
so really really love those old I
henriksen wipes I'm going to definitely
get a full-size and then the rest is all
makeup so I've been loving me some
makeup this week the first three things
I want to talk about our blushes that
I've been wearing and they are all new
to me and they are all amazing the first
one is from Laura Geller this is the
baked gelato vivid swirl blush in plum
berry how gorgeous is that blush I want
to go ahead and squash this for you
because I want to swatch all three of
the blushes I've been wearing this week
side by side so you guys can see but
that is what it looks like it's
absolutely beautiful this is the
gorgeous blush this is what I'm wearing
on my cheeks today
and there it is Oh excited it is so
pretty it is so pretty so that has been
my first favorite i love the
pigmentation I think it's gorgeous if
you apply it lightly on the cheeks it
looks really really beautiful the second
flush I've been loving is the CC
radiance ombre blush in Sugar Plum from
it cosmetics and it looks like this
again kind of a deep moppy color but has
it goes into an ombre effect that has
like a highlight built in which is
beautiful and that is what this one
looks like you guys can see there's a
lot of different just drop it which is
fell on the floor um there's a lot of
shimmer in this one and it's beautiful
but these are all very different things
look similar in the pan that they are
very different when you swatch them so
there is the ombre CC blush and then the
last one that I've been loving this week
is the Too Faced love flush and your
love is king and it looks like that
another gorgeous kind of deeper mavi
pink color and it's right there on my
finger and it is swatched at the bottom
right there so you guys can see they are
different in tone these two are similar
but I mean they're just gorgeous they're
just absolutely gorgeous and that
two-faced plush wears all day they are
not hitting when they say like 16 I are
right yes 16 hour blush it literally
will wear for like 24 hours if you want
to keep it on your skin that long as far
as highlighters go this week I've been
loving my becca shimmering skin
Perfector in the shade of moonstone this
is a beautiful kind of white gold color
it's got a little bit of a yellow
undertone go ahead and swatch it for you
guys you can see really really beautiful
full-on pigment just really pretty color
I don't know I've been loving that on my
cheekbones I think it is really really
gorgeous and yeah that has definitely
been a favorite I feel like these lasts
a long time on the cheeks as well like
when you put them on in the morning that
is how it's going to look at the end of
the day which is great all right as far
as concealing goes this week for any
sort of hyperpigmentation or just you
know things that I want to cover I've
been using my it cosmetics bye-bye
redness neutral
I think correcting cream loving this a
lot this is a product I'm trying to use
up in 2016 and I feel like I'm getting
there like I don't know I feel like I've
used up quite a bit of this since I
showed it in that video of the video of
what I want to use up in 2016 but this
is a fantastic product it does look a
little dark as you guys can see it is
definitely darker than my skin tone but
somehow it blends in and it just covers
things and it is just the smoothest
creamiest product ever I mean it will
just glide on like butter on your skin
so I plan on just keeping that in my
rotation for a couple of weeks interest
using it when I can and I feel like I
will definitely get through that product
which is variously another product from
my youth up 2016 use up collab video is
the Milani fierce foil I shines in 03
Florence I've been putting one of these
colors on my lid every single day today
i'm wearing the lighter kind of yellowy
color what i don't like is that they
start to mesh into each other which is
just annoying but these are absolutely
gorgeous on the lid I mean the colors
are outstanding um they're very very wet
so they do crease a little bit but i
don't know i just don't really mind it
because i think that they're so
beautiful on the lid and i have no
reason not to use these apps so those
have definitely been a favorite i think
they would also look beautiful on the
lower lash line i have not tried that
yet but maybe next week for foundation
this week i've been loving my elf
flawless finish foundation this has SPF
15 sunscreen beautiful beautiful
packaging it's like one of those glass
bottles really really pretty i love that
my shade is porcelain it is a little
dark but this has amazing coverage i
absolutely love it a beautiful product
eyeliners i've been using two of the
Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye pencils in
delirious and zodiac delirious is a
beautiful purple color and zodiac is
kind of a muddy green color with gold
sparkles in it really really beautiful
on the eye area before I put on any sort
of lip products I've been using this
little soft lips cube this is in the I
think it's called vanilla bean sent
really really nice these guys on a lot
smoother than any of the EOS lip balms
in my opinion do let us ones have a
little bit of texture to them and I feel
like it's nice because it kind of primes
your lips if you're going to be putting
a product on top but my lips have been
very dry this week and I've been wanting
to wear full on color so this has been
really really nice because it makes them
glide on like a dream and as far as the
products go the one I'm wearing today is
from the Melissa autry cosmetics line
this is her lipstick in the shade
truffle and I really love this I think
her lipstick line is really fantastic
it's a beautiful deep brown color I'm
gonna go ahead and swatch it for you
guys actually beautiful deep brown color
it's got a little bit of red undertones
in it really really gorgeous and i have
been pairing that with another product
that i'm trying to use up in 2016 which
is the NYX butter gloss in tiramisu it's
a beautiful kind of pinky you know pinky
neutrally color and it goes beautifully
on top of that lipstick it's right there
and I'm that's what I'm wearing on my
lips today and I feel like I just kind
of lightens it up into a really gorgeous
gorgeous shade so I've really been
enjoying that I've been topping that on
actually on top of everything that I've
been wearing this week there's another
Maybelline lipstick that i was using
this week that i forgot it's in my purse
right now it's called deepest cherry
which is a really really beautiful dark
color it looks like it's going to be
super dark out of the tube however it
really looks like purple on the lips but
it's very very pretty so I've been
wearing that as well and topping it with
the next tiramisu and then the last
combination is this Revlon Ultra HD
matte lip color there is no name on this
oh sorry 630 in seduction it's a
beautiful kind of neutral your lips the
better sort of shade and I again have
been topping that tiramisu shade on top
of it and I think it looks beautiful so
there is seduction so really really been
loving that lip combo this week or those
lip combos and as far as climbing my
face
I've been loving my Too Faced hangover
RX this is a replenishing face primer
really really feels good on the skin
smells like coconut I'm definitely going
to repurchase when I run out which you
guys can see I will follow them out of
and then as far as I primers go I've
been loving my benefit Air Patrol this
is like a BB cream eyelid primer it
really is um hydrating and not silico
dior sticky on the eyelid area I really
really enjoyed this a lot it has a
little bit of color correcting like
yellow undertones in it really really
fantastic ah let's see here mascara this
week been loving wearing my Urban Decay
subversion lash primer my favorite lash
primer of all times and then on top of
that i wear my Maybelline lash discovery
mini brush mascara this is great for
reaching those little bottom lashes it's
just a fantastic let me show you guys
the wand it's a fantastic tiny little
tiny little brush so really really great
at getting those bottom lashes and also
really lengthens the upper lashes I was
very surprised so I love that and then
I've been going what is that further
because I've been loving some dark eye
makeup this week I've been going one
step further and applying the Maybelline
the falsies push-up drama on top a lot
of people do not like this mascara it's
got a great wand but the formula is very
wet and very oily so does smudge on a
lot of people but I personally really
like it it makes your lashes very very
clumpy so if you're not into that you're
not gonna like this but I left me some
clothes so and the last product that i
have been loving this week is what i've
been wearing on my eyes for eyeshadow it
is the Urban Decay smoked palette as
much as I hated the naked palettes from
urban decay I love this palette this is
a fantastic pilot you get I think 10
shades in here and get 1 2 3 4 5 yeah 10
shades in here they're all smoky they
have like jewel tones just beautiful
beautiful colors it does come with a
full-size perversion mascara or is it
zero I can't remember which one but a 24
hour or a 24-7 glide on pencil
god I thought I just put literally
lipstick on my cheek a 24-7 glide on
pencil and I think you could still get
this for around twenty dollars i believe
they did may be discontinued it but this
is my favorite like smoky palette to
reach for they just have some beautiful
jewel tones in here like evidence and
loaded and rockstar these are gorgeous
jewel toned colors and then today i'm
wearing asphalt which is this beautiful
kind of gray color I'm wearing that in
my crease on my lower lash line and then
I went in and blended it out with free
style which is a matte kind of
transition color and then Kiki I have
that on my brow bone so really really
gorgeous palette and it doesn't have to
be so super dark and smoky you really
can use it with a light hand and get
just kind of like a pretty wash of color
I will say when you use it with a light
hand it does start to kind of blend into
each other I feel like the colors aren't
as like precise but really really
gorgeous and I've been enjoying at a lot
this week so anyway those were my
favorites for the week I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
joining me and i'll see you in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
