my channel I am here to share my weekly
favorites with you guys um how are we
liking this like textured pony today if
you guys know of any products that
really really texturize the hair let me
know below because you guys know I have
very very fine flat hair and this is
pretty much a textured and I can get my
hair I've gone out three days without
washing and I even put sea salt spray in
this today and hairspray so I'm kind of
liking it because it looks messy and
just not like the usual sleek ponytail
but I always always wear because that
just gets boring to me you know um so
this is about is it I feel like a loser
but a lot of textured at the meijer can
get but let me know if you guys have
product recommendations that really
really can get you lots of body and
textures I would love to know but anyway
let's get right into it I'm going to
start with makeup my first favorite for
the week has been the blush that I have
been wearing all week this is the only
one I've been wearing all week it is the
gosh cosmetics multi color blush in
number 50 pink pie and this is a product
that I am trying to use up in 2016 and
it's gorgeous when you swatch all the
colors together it looks like a
beautiful kind of burgundy color on the
cheeks it's really really stunning so
that is my first favorite my second
favorite has been contouring my nose and
I have been using my Mally pro tricks
nose contour kit they have a highlight
and a shading color i only use the
shading color so there's the shading
color and there's a highlight and what
I've been doing is just wiping a my
middle finger in that shade color
putting it together like this and then
just running it down my nose I'm not as
good like when I'm using brushes and
things like that I feel like it's not as
precise and it gets a little muddy
looking so this has been great just
going in rubbing it together and then
putting this straight down my nose I
feel like it's a very even and it looks
pretty darn blended so I really been
enjoying that um on the inner corner of
my eyes I've been loving eyes use this
all the time it's my physicians formula
I brightener in natural I light it's
just a beautiful Lola it's just a
beautiful beautiful multicolored kind of
whites that really just brightens up
right underneath the brow bone or the
inner corner of the eye wherever you
want it it's really really amazing as
far as highlight goes this week I've
been loving my
forever pro sculpting duo I haven't
burned the bronzer shade in here a
little bit but not a ton this is
basically like that baked Jill a sort of
formula it's really really wonderful but
that gold highlight in there is
absolutely stunning and I am wearing
that today on my cheekbones down with
the bridge of my nose on my chin and I
feel like it is so so vivid and gorgeous
and I really really love gold tones so
that has been my favorite this week for
an all over like eye shadow just color
before I let go in with my little quad
I've been loving my Maybelline shake
naturals in 15 s linen this is another
product that I'm trying to use up this
year and this is what it looks like i
have hit pan on here but that was before
I started this little 2016 makeup utha
collab but anyway I really like this
it's very very similar to wet and wild
brulee or creme brulee where you just
kind of put it all over this does have a
little bit of shimmer in it but it just
brightens up the eye area and um it
helps so that you don't like have vain
showing through or any discoloration and
then I've been going in with my
eyeshadows for the week and I've been
using the moat bomb from the bomb
cosmetics how cute is that packaging
really really cute this is just a little
quad and I think it's absolutely
beautiful um you have a burgundy shade
I've been wearing that in my crease I've
been using Cortina which is a blending
shade to blend that crease color out
I've been wearing zermatt on my lower
lash line and then Whistler on my lid so
that is what the shades look like really
really beautiful for the wintertime and
that's why I like to go in with my
Maybelline linen just to kind of make
sure that there's a little light there
because that cortina shade is a little
dark like as a transition color I mean
it's not it's a nice transition color
what I mean it's like lightening up the
whole eye area like having just like a
wash of color over the lid it's a little
dark but anyway been loving that and
then all week I've been wearing one eye
liner the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on eye
pencil in perversion this is a matte
black it's absolutely fantastic one of
the best out there I have been
my benefit gimme brow this is such a
fantastic product and one of those
people that doesn't like i'm not good
with like the anastacio dip brow or
anything that's to let can come off too
harsh i'm really not good with working
with those kind of products because i
always put on too much so this is really
easy way to basically build up the
thickness on your eyebrows that kind of
has little fibers that attach to the
hairs that you already have in your
eyebrows and it just kind of darkens
them up a little bit it looks like you
have groomed your brows even if you
haven't and it's just very very easy to
use so my shade is light light flash
medium and that is the lightest one that
you can get so I've never been enjoying
that and then as far as mascara goes
I've been carrying two mascaras this
week my wet and wild mm excuse me my wet
and wild max volume plus mascara I
really really love this it's a very very
natural on the lashes very beautiful and
then I actually use this product up I'm
really happy this is the Rimmel London
glam eyes mascara in extreme black and I
paired that on top and this really
really makes your eyelashes look very
like glam like not very clumpy or long
or thick just like very light curve and
like wispy so I really really like that
and i did use it up and then ah for
foundation this week a lot of people
have been asking me they said my skin
looked really good thank you so much you
guys i've been using my L'Oreal Paris
visible lift blur foundation I love this
foundation it has a silicone sort of
texture so you can just go in and apply
it with your fingers my shade is 201
light ivory it does pull a little bit of
a yellow tone on my skin but I feel like
L'Oreal is kind of known for you know I
feel like their shades really really do
pull like a yellowy warmer undertone but
anyway it's really really beautiful you
can apply with your fingers like I said
had that silicone II sort of texture
it's just absolutely fantastic though I
highly recommend the only thing i don't
like about this foundation is the fact
that it does not wear very long at all
on my face and i think that
same problem for everybody i was reading
on makeupalley a lot of reviews about
those people were saying the same thing
like it just starts to come off it looks
so beautiful when you first apply it
I've been wearing it for about I don't
know maybe an hour and a half now and I
feel like it still looks good but after
a while it's like girl no not looking so
cute so that's kind of a bummer but it
is really beautiful I've been wearing it
three lipsticks this week they're all
from the Revlon Super Lester slide the
first one is a cram that this is love
that pink this is the shade I was
wearing yesterday and it looks like that
it's a beautiful beautiful kind of dark
pink colors really really gorgeous the
second shade I've been wearing is now
awake creme it's in 5-10 very rich and
this is similar to love that pink but
obviously it has more of a berry
undertone so you get a little more
purpley color in there and then the one
I would have on my lips today is a pearl
and it's in 245 smokey rose this one
sometimes goes on a little bit um patchy
I don't know why the other two don't but
this one goes on a little bit patchy I
don't know if it's because it's a
pearlized finish but it's a beautiful
beautiful kind of smoky rose color all
right moving on I have been loving this
little I gel this is the peter thomas
roth anti-aging cellular repair I gel
I've been wearing this at nighttime it's
absolutely wonderful has a really really
nice kind of cooling sensation when you
put it around your eyes and I really
have used a lot of this so that product
you may be seen in my fd's very soon as
far as skincare goes at night I've been
keeping it very very simple and I think
this is that been this has been really
really nice for my skin this week these
are the knit + fab skin Dragon's Blood
fix cleansing pads they have hyaluronic
acid salicylic acid and dragons blood in
it whatever that is anyway I really like
it because if you have um like acne
prone skin but you're like I don't know
I would say if you have combination skin
that's how I should describe it if you
have combination skin you have drier
areas and you have oily area so
salicylic acid is great to help out with
the oily areas but this also has
hyaluronic
sit in it which puts moisture into your
skin and helps it to retain moisture so
it's actually really really nice because
it will clear up any breakouts or little
bumps that you have but at the same time
it won't dry out your skin so these have
been fantastic they're really pillowy
and soft and they have a really nice
little sent to them so i highly
recommend checking these out I want to
try more from this nip + fab line you
can get this at Ulta so that's the only
thing I've been wearing on my skin at
night and it's been a really really
great in the morning I have been wearing
my Josie Maran whipped argan oil face
butter as my moisturizer I did a whole
review on this i will link below where
you guys can watch that video if you
want but this is a fantastic moisturizer
I feel like anybody sensitive skin oily
skin combination skin dry skin you could
get away with using this I've oily what
comes going to say I have combination
skin I shouldn't say oily skin I
accommodation skin so I'm oily in my
t-zone and I'm dry on my cheeks
especially during the winter I get a
little more dry this is fantastic it
sinks in immediately there's no scent to
it and it has this really nice kind of
whipped buttery texture to it it's just
an absolutely beautiful beautiful
product and love it I do mix that with
three drops of my polish choice resist
moisture renewal oil booster drops and
it's just it's perfect all right I've
been working my way through this little
its potent eye cream deluxe sample from
benefit I've really been enjoying this I
think there was a time last year where i
purchased this and i loved it so much
but I feel like maybe they reformulated
it a little bit it really does wear
beautifully underneath makeup I'm
wearing it today I've been using this in
the morning at nighttime it's not
hydrating enough but it's really
beautiful underneath makeup but I feel
like I liked it more last year I don't
know if my skin has changed or they
reformulated things but that's just my
opinion for my primer this week on my
face I've been loving my NYX honey do me
up this is a primer and serum built into
one it's got honey in it and it's got
gold flakes and collagen this is what it
looks like the only thing I'm a little
annoyed with is it has this little
spatula thing but the further I get
through with it like you can see I'm
almost i would say halfway through the
bottle I now have to like dump it out
the little spatula is not picking up
products so that's my only complaint but
this is really fantastic if you are
someone who doesn't like those silicone
ii primers you know pore filling sort of
things you would really like this it
just prolongs aware of your makeup
it's really wonderful the only thing it
cannot go along the we're up is this
darn foundation this L'Oreal one but it
really makes other foundations we're
really nicely on my skin and I've been
asked sending my makeup with the elf
illuminating missed in set I love the
original one and this one is really nice
to give a little bit of a glow to the
skin and luminosity again for whatever
reason it just cannot set this
foundation and it's driving me crazy I
want to find something that will make
this where longer but I know that the
illuminating mist and set can make my
other foundations last a long time so
all right on my lips at night I've been
loving my little big tub of the vaseline
lip therapy this is the cocoa butter one
really really cute you do have to dip
your finger in there but I have used a
lot of this can you guys see that like
I'm almost up with this product like
it's almost done so really really love
that a lot as far as masking goes this
week I've been loving my glam glow flash
mud this is a fantastic mac it really
really does lighten up acne scarring
hyperpigmentation any sort of likes
watching us you may have on your skin
this is a really really good mass for
that I am dreading the fact that hold on
we open it I'm dreading the fact that I
am almost done with this mass can you
guys see that I literally have maybe an
inch left at the bottom of this product
and I'm dreading it because I'm also
good I'm really dreading it because I
mean this is a like $69 mask and I know
I'm gonna want to repurchase it so it's
kind of driving me crazy I'm like no
save it don't use it but that's not the
way you should look at things you know
just repurpose it if it works for you so
that's what I'm going to do I've been
loving this toner in the morning it does
have alcohol in it so if you are
sensitive if you have sensitive skin if
you have dry skin do not use this if
your oily or combination you would like
this it's from Olay it's the oil
minimizing clean it really just wakes my
skin up and it definitely helps with
little bumps and whatnot because it does
have witch hazel in it so it is highly
highly fragrant so like I said if you
are sensitive do not even try it as far
as bubble basco I love my bath and body
works aromatherapy stress relief this is
the luxury bath in eucalyptus spearmint
it's beautiful it's got a wonderful
smell it really really calms me down at
night and the luxury baths are just so
well luxurious they really
really call me down they make beautiful
soft bubbles in your tub i an i just
thinks a fantastic product love it all
right as far as hand creams go I've been
loving also from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works the
true blue spa che cashmere hand cream
this is wonderful it is like the
silkiest hand cream I have in my
collection it literally feels like
there's like silicone in here but it
doesn't intensely intensely hydrate as
much as I thought it did because I get
eczema on my wrist and also my hands
during the wintertime and I noticed that
I'm still dry but i like it because it
has a fantastic smile and it does give
the right amount of moisture and it
doesn't um leave like an oily residue on
my skin but at the same time i think i'm
going to need to go into my collection
for this coming week and pick out
something a little more hydrating all
right fragrance duo of the week this has
been a good one i have been loving my
victoria secret total attraction perfume
this has a I would say a floral a floral
undertone with a sweet overtone it
smells very very sweet really really
good i love the scent of this and i have
been mixing it with a solid perfume
which I normally don't like to wear
these just because I felt like they
never lasted very long but this has been
great on my pressure points like on my
wrist right here that kind of area
really really the back of my neck is
really has been staying on for a long
time I got this in one of my
subscription boxes it's the list off
perfume in zoo zoo and this is what it
looks like and it smells like jasmine so
that floral um sent really really goes
nicely with the total attraction perfume
and that is what it looks like it smells
so good you guys and love the scent of
jasmine love it love all right I have
been wearing nail polish this week the
past couple days I've just been like it
now uh-huh but at the beginning of the
week I was wearing these daily Hansen
hardest nails xtreme we're in the shade
425 pink satin it's a gorgeous gorgeous
purpley pinky color and it's just got a
wonderful iridescent to it and then on
of it I was putting the Nanticoke o nail
polish snowflakes in 2 1 102 this is
what it looks like they're just like
little snowflakes and I think the reason
I no longer i'm putting that on my nails
is because my boyfriend who's a doctor
literally the other day was like paid I
think you guys like vitamin I can't
remember vitamin K deficiency or
something like that he was like you have
those little white spots all over your
nails and I was like excuse me I was
like those are snowflakes and he was
like why he was like it looks like your
vitamin deficient in I was like don't
happy oh my god are you but anyway
another little project loving this week
has been my serum in the morning this is
the shiseido ultimate power infusing
concentrate i'm scared to look at the
price of this because i know it's going
to be like a hundred twenty dollars but
i love it it's great it really really
evens out the texture on your skin for
shampoo this week I love mixing these
two this is the Shea Moisture raw shea
butter moisture retention shampoo mixed
with the 12 benefits love at first
lather moisture balancing shampoo the
reason I like to mix these is because
this one tends to leave a lot of residue
in my hair so I don't like to just use
it by itself most of the time so the two
of these mixed together really really
leaves my hair nice and soft and shiny
in the morning for cleansing my face
just getting that first layer of grime
off before I go in with my toner I've
been loving my granny a clean plus
balancing daily exfoliator it smells
really good it really wakes me up in the
morning it's nice it is for combination
skin so it will help clear up any oil in
your t-zone but it won't dry you out on
your cheeks which is great and then this
is oh my god this inholy grill is gonna
be Holly Grail from now on okay this is
amazing these are the rock daily
resurfacing discs they are clinically
shown to diminish the appearance of fine
lines and wrinkles I swear these work i
swear to you anybody can use these oily
skin they are basically these pads oh
god well and it's just like broke that
little they basically are just these
little um cells lathering discs that
come like pre-moistened one side is
textured the other side is soft a only
use the soft side but if you have oily
side if you have oily skin go ahead and
use that texture decided you know
leather this up
on your skin they smell great they
honestly I feel like I have noticed a
difference in the fine lines around my
face when I use these and they really
take off like grime on your skin I do
some after I remove my makeup in the
morning and what I find are in my makeup
in the morning after you remove my
makeup at night you can tak Olivia's he
could do it after I remove my makeup at
night I will go in with one of these and
I'm so surprised I really really thought
that my oil cleansers were taken all
that makeup off but apparently not
because there is still left over makeup
that I find on these and I'm so just
like grind like dirt like little pieces
of like dirt it's disgusting but I have
been loving these I'm going to be using
these every time after I moved my makeup
at nighttime all right I've been loving
a really unhealthy deodorant the reason
I say that it says it has aluminum in it
I will be doing a video called battle of
the natural deodorants where I am going
to be trying out three or four different
natural deodorants that are free of
aluminum and basically then you guys
know which one I like the most hopefully
I will find one that I adore so I don't
have to buy products like this anymore I
know Luminum is not good for your immune
system and I already have a compromised
immune system so it is probably not very
good for me but this secret one this is
the clear gel it leaves no white marks
and it smells so good and also leaves
like a cooling sensation underneath your
armpits but this is the scent
expressions in passion d tango and it is
mango scented and you guys it just
smells so darn good so I've been loving
that in the morning um as far as after I
put all my skincare on you guys know I
like to balance out my skin with like a
facial mist I've been loving my tony
moly pocket bunny moistness the cup
cutie is isn't that cute I love him um
it's really really nice missed it does
smell good and I feel like it does put
moisture into my skin it has glycerin in
it which is good for the skin however
it's not my favorite I really like Rose
sprays I feel like those ones really put
something back into my skin besides
moisture they really really put other
like brightening properties into my skin
and just nice things like that so this
one I will not repurchase however I
the reason I'm showing it in my
favorites is I love his little the
little container is so cute so I will
fill up my other facial mist with this
other guy all right almost done guys I'm
sorry I know I had a lot this week let's
talk about some hair products people
have been asking me if I got my hair
done you probably can't tell today cuz
when my hair is up all you see is roots
um but I have not gotten my hair done
yet I have not gotten my hair done in
like 8 to 12 weeks it's been crazy I
have a lot of new growth and I need to
get my roots done but i have been using
these two products here they have
hydrogen hydrogen peroxide in them so
just peroxide in them so you need to be
careful if you do have dry hair I
wouldn't suggest using these um but I
have been spraying this on my roots the
john frieda sheer blonde go blonder
controlled lightning sprayed that I've
been helping with my roots I do get my
hair done next week or the week after
not this coming monday the monday after
so hopefully i won't have to use these
as much but this has been helpful to
this is the l'oreal summer light hair
lightening gel a it's a natural sun
kissed glow built in conditioner
permanent gradual lightning i put this
all over my hair when i get out of the
shower and I really believe in enjoying
it so love that and then two other hair
products they want to talk about my last
two products right wait nope there's
like 10 more I'm just kidding babe it'll
last you my cheese silk infusion silk
reconstructing complex love this as like
my leave in conditioner it's really
really beautiful and wonderful and then
the brioche e / row Sarco Rosario milk
yeah this is a reparative leave in
conditioning spray it repairs hydrates
and strengthens with rosehip our bond
and coconut oils really really love this
I got this in one of my um what was it a
lower sample society boxes no that's not
a sample I got that in my one of my
subscription boxes and it's fantastic so
anyways that is a guys those are my
favorites for the week I know I had a
lot but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and i will see you my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
