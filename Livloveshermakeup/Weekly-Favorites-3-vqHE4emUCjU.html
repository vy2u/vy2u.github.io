hope you guys are having a wonderful day
today I'm going to be sharing with you
guys my weekly favorite so basically the
products that I've been loving this week
so yeah let's get started the first
thing I want to show you guys is
actually from my boyfriend this was my
birthday week or this past weekend it
was my birthday and one of the gifts
that he got me was this beautiful little
trio of jewelry these are actually
pearls and they're so beautiful because
they're like a peachy pink color which I
don't really really love that color so
um he got me this beautiful little
bracelet and it also came with this
gorgeous little necklace that looks like
this and it also came with these cute
little earrings so you can wear them
altogether or obviously separately I
just think that they're so pretty I
loved the little thought that everything
was in a trio and I just love the color
I love pearls and yeah so that was one
of the birthday gifts he got me and I've
just been really really loving those
this week the next thing I'm going to
show you guys actually a food item um
these are actually possible I've been
loving these these are they Philly swirl
swirl sticks as its Italian ice swirl
bars and these are fat-free dairy free
gluten free at peanut free and I've
actually been loving these these taste
really really similar to like um very
much like gelato or like very very
creamy even though they're not at all
they're only I think 48 calories yeah 48
calories for one bar and they have like
six different flavors I believe yeah so
you get a banana split flavor which is
one of my favorites on a limited edition
mystery flavor which I don't really like
um you get very very cotton candy which
is another one of my favorites rainbow
and also orange dream another one of my
favorites so they're just really really
yummy they're really really low in
calories and I've just been really
liking these they taste so much more
like ice creamy and like thicker than
what you think they would be like you
would really think they taste like
popsicles but they just taste so much
better so I've been loving these I
already went to a whole box of those
this week so I've got to go back to the
supermarket and pick up another one um I
shadows that I have
I've been loving these what are these
called prismatic I shadows from NYX the
three colors that I have been loving
this week have been tin which is PS 12
it looks like this it is a gorgeous
gorgeous silvery color these just have
amazing pigmentation they're so silky
and soft and I've just been loving
putting it all over my lid with a little
bit of mascara this week and I just
think it looks so beautiful so like I
said this one is 10 this has been one of
my favorites this week the next one that
has been one of my favorites is PSO for
Girl Talk this is the one I am wearing
on my lid right now and it's more of
like a pinky kind of like nudie sort of
color and it's just gorgeous all over
the lid i'm going to swatch it here for
you guys so you can see it's right there
it's a little more subtle than the tin
color but it is still really really
beautiful and then the last one that i
absolutely been loving is called mermaid
and it's PS 05 and this is just such a
gorgeous color it's like this mermaid
blue color with little flecks of like
gold glitter and I just love like I said
the pigmentation the colors they're just
so shiny and beautiful so I've been
really really loving these mixed I
shadows so those are the three colors
you have tin Girl Talk and mermaid and
like I said I just been loving using
these either underneath my lash line for
a bold pop of color or um you know
taking it and just putting it all over
my lid with some mascara and eyeliner
and speaking of eyeliner the eyeliner I
have been absolutely adoring this week
has also been from NYX this is the next
slide on glide on stay on and definitely
a turn on the eyeliner and this is in
the color FL 15 brown perfection and
I've been loving those these are dupes
on these Nick slide on liners are dupes
for the 20 open 2k 24-7 glide on our
slide on is a glide on oh yeah who could
glide on eye liners so these are dupes
for those and I just love the way that
these go on and I've been loving this
particular color I have quite a few of
these but this color has been my
favorite that's a swatch from something
different completely ignore that but
this one right here that brown color
that is what I've been wearing I'm
today on my um oh excuse me on my inner
and upper you know lash line so really
really been liking that my waterline and
my tight line yet okay um what else
let's see for removing my makeup at
night time I've been really enjoying the
ponds Eve evening soothe wet cleansing
towelettes with chamomile and white tea
I've been really really loving these
they're just been so they've been so
like quick and easy to remove everything
really really quickly they are a little
textured and a little rough so they're
not super gentle around the eye area but
I've just been really liking them this
week they smell amazing i think the
scent is wonderful so really really
liking these next four just like
moisturizing my lips in general without
having any color or anything i've been
loving these this little soft lips cube
this is in um the mint scent and smells
so good it's really really nice i find
that it just really really suits my lips
and it also gives it a little bit of
protection because it does have SPF 15
in it so i've been loving that for my
lip balm this week um and the lip colors
that i basically been wearing all week
have been these these are the wet and
wild juicy lip balms i love the
packaging they're like really big and
cute and i am wearing one today on my
lips it is the raspberry one and as you
guys can see it gives like a little
flush of color to the lips and it's
basically just like a moisturizing lip
balm so it's kind of similar to like the
soft lips but with like a little bit of
color and i just love that they all
smell really good and they have cute
packaging and they're cheap and cheerful
so i have the one in cherry which gives
a little bit more of a red lip the one
in strawberry which is a little more of
a light pink and then the one which i am
wearing today which is raspberry which
gives a little more of a dark berry
color and all of them have SPF 15 so
been loving those as my lip color this
week or like my tinted lip balm really
just any kind of lip color I've been
wearing that's just mostly what I've
been sticking to I feel like I go on and
off between loving like lipsticks and
then loving like tinted
so I've been loving goes this week um an
eye cream or in I gel I guess that I've
been really really loving and I've been
thankful that i've been using right now
has been my peter thomas roth clinical
skin care anti-aging cellular i repaired
gel this is just a tiny little tub of a
really really nice clear jelly like
formula um you guys can see I've used
quite a bit of it you can even put it in
the refrigerator if you want a really
really nice cooling effect I find that I
see an immediate difference when I use
this on my eyes um I've seen immediate
difference in like fine lines and also
just like under eye circles things like
that and I just think that the gel
formula is so nice to use during the
summer months another little product for
the eye area i don't know why i've been
waking up with such puffy under eye
areas but i have been for the past week
so i did pick up a full size of the
benefit puff off i think i talked about
this in my last empties video i had a
sample of it that I had gone through and
I said oh you know I really am going to
purchase this I really like it so I did
and I've been using this it this week
and I just really love it it basically
is just a um like pink tinted I gel and
it comes with this wonderful little
applicators you guys can see it is
completely metal and you just Pat it
underneath your eye and its really
cooling it feels really nice and the
formula is just really really good it
says it isn't gel I you know instant eye
gel to help smooth the look of puppies
so it's really really nice like I said
it does have a little bit of a pink
brightening um color to it and I've been
really enjoying that um my favorite
mascara this week has been the Lancome
Hypnose drama this is actually a hundred
point per sample that I got from Sephora
but I've just been loving this and it's
not the kind of one that I normally go
for it's just like a natural bristle
brush I really like the rubber ones but
this one is just wonderful it kind of
has a bit of a curve to it as you guys
can see and I feel like it really just
um picks up my lashes holds the curl the
formula is really nice it doesn't flake
off at all during the day and I feel
like gives really really natural looking
lashes
I'm wearing one coat of it today on my
lashes and I've just really been liking
that so I've been loving the Hypnose
drama oh and we're almost done here I'm
a toner that I've been loving this week
I've been so obsessed with this
especially my boyfriend's huh this is
the polished choice resist advanced
replenishing toner for all skin types it
is a super charged toner that smooth
wrinkles build collagen for firmer skin
and has anti air to irritants that calm
redness been loving this it's like a
thick like a nighttime sort of toner
like it feels so nice on the skin it
almost like it's moisturizing and it's
like just really really nice it doesn't
feel like any other kind of toner that
I've used and I've just been really
really liking it so I have been having
some skin issues this past week so I
feel like this was just very calming and
nice and soothing on my skin which I
loved which the next product i'm also
going to talk about which is also my
boyfriend but basically been stealing
all his skin care um another soothing
product that i've been putting on after
that had been this skin inc um custom
blended soothing serum you guys can see
it almost used up the whole little thing
this is so nice it is so soothing and
calming it really reduces any redness on
my skin and I just feel like it doesn't
irritate or bother my skin um like I
said I've been dealing with like some
rashes from the Sun this past week and
also just some breakouts and whatnot so
the combination of these two products
the toner and the serum at night have
really really been helping my skin and
the last favorites for this week is a
foundation I am wearing it right now and
I've just been loving it it is a tad
dark for me and I do have it in the
lightest shade but it is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin liquid makeup with titanium
dioxide sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 20
and the color that I am in is plastic
ivory number 10 this is their lightest
shade like I said it is a bit dark for
me but um nothing too crazy um so I've
just been really loving this I've heard
that it is a dupe for the NARS sheer
glow I've never tried the NARS sheer
glow but I heard that this is a dupe it
just feels really good on my skin it
doesn't seem to irritate it
I noticed that my skin does look better
the more I wear it um and I just you
know I like it it says it's an exclusive
blend of it has antioxidants in it it
keeps skin young and healthy looking I
don't know if it actually does that but
it hasn't been irritating my skin that
has been acting up this past week so I
think quite happy with it so I really
really love that my favorite way to
apply it is not with my Beauty Blender
not with my fingers but with a brush so
any kind of buffing brush and just
buffing it into the skin I think it
looks really really beautiful and
natural and kind of below e so then
loving that and yeah those are my weekly
favorites um for this week I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
