thank you for joining me today i am
sharing my weekly favorites with you
guys so yeah happy sunday and let's get
started on the first thing i'm going to
share is actually a food-related item it
is what I've been drinking every single
morning to start off my day it is the
tazo chai classic latte which is a rich
blend the black tea cinnamon ginger
cardamom and vanilla it looks like this
this is the actual concentrate so you
put this in with milk or a milk
substitute I've been mixing mine with
almond milk i'm pretty sure it's
unsweetened almond milk yeah and it's so
so good i've tried it with sweetened
almond milk unsweetened skim milk like
everything i want to try it with cashew
milk annexed I heard that's really good
too but um it's really good with
everything I've been doing the almond
milk this week and loving it so what you
do is you mix have a cup of this with
half a cup of milk or milk substitute or
you can do a whole cup and a whole cup
of the milk whatever you want to do but
I've been doing half a cup of this and
half a cup of the almond milk and I've
been loving it and I have been drinking
it every morning in my the wizarding
world of harry potter diagon alley
Universal Studios Florida mug I love
this mug it's so cool I think it's like
super dark but it's really really fun I
love it it's like a left-handed mug
which I am left-handed um and if you
have not visited the new Diagon Alley
little like installment at Universal
Studios you need to check it out it's
amazing it's wonderful and so cool so
anyway that was my food favorite for the
week um next I'm going to get started
with i think i'll start with hair care
because they do have quite a few things
the first thing i've been loving is the
Pantene pro-v silky moisture whip but
this is like a leave-in conditioner that
you just like put from you know
basically just on the ends of your hair
if i put it up towards my roots I tend
to get a little oily so I don't do that
but I've been loving this it comes out
really nicely you just like press
literally one little pump will go on all
like your whole head really I mean a lot
comes out at watch so you want to be
careful but it's like this really really
silky silky like oil
kind of whip literally it's like moose
and it feels really really good in the
hair it makes your hair really nice and
soft I personally don't really like do
heat styling on my hair this is what my
hair looks like naturally just from air
drying and I feel like this really makes
it nice and shiny and soft so I've been
loving of that the second haircare item
I've been loving before I put in the
stokke moister whip is the Kevin Murphy
untangled leave-in conditioner detangler
I love this stuff I got this from my
hair salon um the last time I went in
and it smells amazing it smells like a
hair salon you know that really nice
smell like when they're washing your
hair and it's like it all herbally like
delicious smelling and you can never do
it at home like that's what it smells
like so it smells like hair salon um it
is twenty-five dollars but it does a
really really great job into tangling my
hair tangles you know like mama love
mascara says my hair tangles if you know
the wind blows the wrong way that is
exactly like what mine is like to so
I've really been loving this and I do
think it does have a little bit of like
a nice leave-in conditioner so it does
kind of make it very manageable and soft
so been loving that detangler and that
the last haircare item I've been loving
have been the oh gx or the organics
brand some kiss blonde lemon highlights
highlight activating citrus oil mess it
says it's a tropical blend of sweet
citrus oil to enhance shimmery sunlit
highlights with rich coconut oil to
smooth and add shine for hair that is
silky soft while exotic key lime extract
takes you way to a sensual sunkissed
paradise so I spray this on damp hair
after I put in the detangler and this
will p moisture whip on my ends I'll
take this and I'll spray it all over my
head a little goes a long way you don't
want to look like if your hair is too
like greasy or anything but it gives a
lot of shine to my hair I love the scent
it's really beautiful and I think it
does tame flyaways um I haven't noticed
so much that it's been like bringing out
any kind of highlights in my hair
however I have been going lighter and
lighter um so I can't even really tell
anymore um but I think it's nice I think
that it is kind of helping to hide my
roots and things like that so I do like
it um well actually really look I really
like it I love
lot so I mostly have been liking it for
the like properties obtaining flyaways
and also just like making my hair look
very very shiny but hopefully the more I
use it it will help conceal my roots ah
so yeah until my next coloring
appointment all right I have two bath
products i'm going to share with you
guys will go into those next the first
thing i've been loving is from the body
shop this is the vineyard peach shower
gel if you guys have never smelt both
this is one of the yummiest smelling
things ever um it smells so good it is a
soap-free cleanser with peach extract
and vineyard peach fragrance and I love
that it's soap free because it really oh
give me gosh it just like jumped on my
own tongue it really really just like
cleans you well without like stripping
the oils from your skin and also um it
doesn't feel like to drying or anything
like that so I've been loving that but
mostly just because of the scent it is
so good this this vineyard peach sent
from the body shop so good it's my first
time trying the vineyard peach sense and
I'm in love so I've been loving that
body wash and the second item I've been
loving is also from the body shop this
is the frosted cranberry bath jelly and
i have used like almost all of it you're
probably going to be seen these two
products in my monthly empties for the
next month or for this coming month even
but this is basically a jelly that like
you taking your hand and you hold it
like closed and then you put it under
warm water for your bath and it makes
bubbles and it's just really cool it
literally is like a jelly um and it's
just I don't know it's really fun as a
different kind of concept from making
bubbles and it's just I don't know it
was really fun I'm aware that it is
frosted cranberry scented which is kind
of a twin to resent however I find that
like cranberry is very um you know
fruity and it just smells like it you
could use it during the summer yeah so
um you could definitely use it during
the winter if you're like this oops got
some of my lip this is something that
you could use like all year round
because again it is like a fruity scent
so anyway really really love that it's
great and now let's get into my makeup
favorites for the month or the first
thing that I've been loving is this
Neutrogena moisture stick color stick
and it is in fresh papaya 20
and it looks like this and it's just a
really really natural like peachy color
and it's kind of like on my lips but
better I've been liking that a lot and
when I'm not wearing that one oh by the
way it has these gorgeous little goals
like flecks of shimmer in it and it kind
of reminds me of narsus orgasm blush
like it's that peachy color with little
gold shimmers it's really beautiful but
it's not gritty you know it feels really
nice on the lips and when I haven't been
wearing that I have been wearing this
this is the elf lip glow in perfect pink
it looks like this really nice little
packaging I am wearing that today and
basically it goes on glossy at first and
then it kind of leaves just like a stain
to the lips and this is beautiful
because it's supposed to take on the ph
of your particular like lip color so you
guys can't really like see it there but
when you apply it to your lips it
actually um is supposed to take on the
ph of like your skin or whatever so it
leaves like this beautiful beautiful
like fresh pink color I feel like that's
what like little baby lips look like
like you know what I mean like little
kids have that perfect pink pout I feel
like that is what this color is like on
my particular lips so I've been loving
that I just it's so good so those two
lip products have definitely been a
must-have for me this week I've really
been doing like a natural lip except for
yesterday I did more of a strong like
pink lipstick but other than that I've
just been wearing those and they're
really comfortable on the lips to their
kind of like bombs both of them are so
really been loving those two the next
thing I've been loving I've been loving
um glow this week as you guys can see
from my cheeks cheeks and whatnot I've
been using again the mary-lou manizer
I've been really into this this week it
is gorgeous a little goes a long way you
do not need a lot of this product and
yeah I've just been loving it gives me
gorgeous like golden glow and I think
it's so pretty during the summer and it
looks nice on people with like every
single skin tone it looks nice on deep
skin tones it looks nice on fair skin
tones like mine I just I love it the
next thing i've been using oh my god
everything else is from ELF that's so
funny this is the elf bronzer
palette I've been loving this I have
been using the top two shades here I
haven't really gotten into the bottom
ones but the top two shades are now
they're on the bottom here you get one
really really shimmery one that looks
like that and then you get a matte 1
i've been using those to contour my face
lightly with like a big fluffy brush and
I can't let you know like my temples on
my cheekbone things like that been
loving that I think it's a wonderful
wonderful contouring sort of palette
even though it's a bronzer palette one
of them have more shimmer but then the
other one you know is like Matt and have
that nice like Toby undertone a lot of
them do in here so this is really really
nice i've been loving this palette um
and the next thing is that the elf
ultimate blending brush this is a new
brush that they recently came out with
yes it is dirty because I used it today
I've been loving taking any foundation
spotting it on my face and then blending
with circular motions with this brush
it's wonderful I'm not normally the kind
of girl that goes for like foundation
brushes i love my Beauty Blender so
that's a lot that this has been so great
for me so definitely been loving that
the next thing I've been loving is the
elf this is like the essentials like one
dollar blush this is in glow that is
what I'm wearing today it's very very
light it's not too pigmented but it's a
gorgeous gorgeous like um I don't even
know how to describe it it's like this
gorgeous glowy color it's like a mix of
coral and peach and just tons of little
gold shimmers and I've just been loving
it i think it's gorgeous and the brush
i've been using to apply that you guys
can see it's dirty because i used it to
apply it today um is the alpha blending
brush I love this for blush for some
reason it's really really soft and it
just hits right on to the apples of the
cheeks so really been loving that so
anyway those were my favorites for the
week I hope you guys enjoyed this video
