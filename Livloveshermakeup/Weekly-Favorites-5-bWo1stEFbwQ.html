hope you guys to have me a great day it
is Sunday happy happy sunday i am
filming my weekly favorite so let's just
get started and i want to say right away
if you see bunch of boxes behind me
please excuse them my boyfriend and I
are moving into our bigger apartment in
about a week and a half so we have a lot
of packing to do but anyway let's just
get started I have a lot of body
products a few shower products and a
whole lot of makeup stuff so um let's
just jump right into it I have been
loving the Knicks honey do me up primer
um this week it looks like this it comes
in this beautiful little packaging it's
like gold and nice little glass
container it actually says it's a skin
serum and primer I've been really liking
it because i haven't been liking like
the silicon e thich feeling stuff on my
skin this week I'm not saying I don't
like it at all i really like those it's
just this week I've been opting for
something that is a little more um I
don't know I want to say like nourishing
because it really busy sinks into the
skin so anyway it has honey in it which
is a natural antiseptic it has gold
flakes which increased the skins
radiance and it also has collagen for
smoother skin so I've really been liking
that it is a beautiful primer it opens
up like this and has this cute little
applicator like spatula it's really kind
of like a sticky formula when it's going
on really feels like honey however it
really really sinks into the skin and it
just like colony inflammation and
redness and I've been loving it so that
is what I've been using for primer as
far as I primers go I have been using a
concealer out of this Too Faced natural
faced natural radiant face palette there
are a lot of to face products that I've
been loving this week and that gives me
because I recently did a two-faced hall
so I wanted to try I wanted to try all
the products that I had hall so anyway I
got this face palette and I've been
liking this color up here it a concealer
color and it's very very tacky it is
much too drying to use anywhere else it
really doesn't have good coverage and it
just makes it look very dry underneath
my eyes and also on any areas that I
might want to
up so I've been using it as an eye
primer and really really liking it um so
yeah that is definitely a favorite I
also want to point out one other product
in here this blush down here the powder
blush I've been loving this week as well
it is called oh just as blush so yeah
it's really really pretty it has a
really nice Sheen to it it's kind of a
rosy tone so been loving those two
products in this palette this week um
the next thing I've been loving is the Q
face soulmates blushing bronzer and
blush and bronzer this isn't Carrie and
big I picked up both shades I picked up
at the Rachel and Ross 12 it's a tad too
dark if I'm not you know I just
sometimes just want to do a really quick
like bronzing all over the face I've
been really into that lately instead of
doing a really really harsh contour so
um this one is a little lighter in tone
the bronzer and the blushes and so I
find that it's easier to work with I'm
mostly just been using it the bronzer
and just going over you know my temples
my cheekbones and underneath my jaw
really really quickly and lightly with a
big fluffy brush and I just really
really like this one I feel like the
Rachel and Ross one is a little bit
darker and it requires a little more of
a precise application which is nothing
what I've been looking for this week so
I will use it when I am really having
the time to like chisel out my face but
overall I've been really just liking as
they carry a big one because it's liked
and easy to work with um makeup setting
spray I've been loving my elf makeup
mist is set with the a lo green tea
cucumber and vitamins a c and e this
makes my makeup lasts all day really
really love it um two foundations i've
been liking i've been loving the sephora
tone infusion it looks like this my
shade is number 10 ivory this is really
easy to blend you can even blend it with
your fingers it goes on really nicely
with any kind of a buffing brush and
it's just super super easy it's like a
no-brainer kind of foundation the other
one i've been loving is the cover girl
plus ol acc tone rehab my shade is 105
ivory you guys can see i'm almost out of
this i love this it is a tad dark like
it really does oxidize on the skin so
it's a bit dark for me however it really
just gives a
beautiful beautiful finish to the skin
it's really nice and moisturizing and I
think that again you can apply it with a
brush you can apply it with a Beauty
Blender or even your fingers it just
blends really really easily um another
blush that I've been loving this week
that i am wearing today is again her to
face this is the i actually didn't haul
this this is actually something out of
my collection that I've had for like a
year now it's the sweethearts perfect
flush blush in something about Barry
it's this beautiful like a trio of
colors right here really really highly
shimmery gives a really nice nice Pig
kind of berry flush to the skin I am
wearing that today and really liking
that I've really been liking cooler
tones this week so um this is a bit
cooler highlight wise been lovingly to
face radiant glow face powder this is
something that I've recently hauled and
I wanted to try out really really been
loving it and it has these little tiny
little hearts that are like multicolored
it just gives a really really natural
nice highlight to the skin I know it
says that it's a face powder but it is
too dark for me to use like all over my
face because it does have a few little
prompting beads in there so I just use
that as a highlight but it has
definitely been my favorite highlight of
the week um the next thing I've been
loving is the Maybelline master conceal
this is the my face studio it's just a
concealer I am in the shade 10 fair it's
really really nice and light i've been
loving it underneath my eyes it also
does cover up any little marks that you
might want to cover um I do use it
before my foundation and I've just been
loving it it's really really nice and
moisturizing and it doesn't take up
underneath my eyes it's awesome so I've
been loving that um mascara why sorry
guys have a lot of makeup this week um
I've been loving the L'Oreal telescopic
shop shocking extensions mascara in the
waterproof formula i love this wand it's
really really thin it gets into all the
little crevices and also um I've just
been liking the waterproof formula I
know it's hard to take off at night
which is why I don't put tons of it on
but it really just you know stays on all
day especially in the heat that we are
having the weather um I've been loving
this mixed slide on glide on and
and definitely a turn-on um waterproof
eyeliner this is an SL 0 for pure white
I'm wearing that today I've been liking
using it just to brighten up my
waterline especially because the pallid
I'm gonna show you next is what I've
been using for eyeshadows this week and
it's a very very smoking kind of dark so
really been liking that white eyeliner
another eyeliner I have been loving have
been from Maybelline it is the master
drama by I studio in Midnight master
this is amazing if you want really
really good um excuse me really really
good definition um it really makes
everything look really defined and clean
and just lovely so been loving that
eyeliner um and the palette that I've
been loving is the Too Faced smokey eye
palette and like I said I've been this
is what has been making me grab for
cooler tone products i am wearing it
today on my eyes i've really been loving
these four shades right here so firefly
white lie cloves and nice ash this nice
ash for me color formula the color is
the one I'm wearing right now in my
priest and its really really dark and
kind of smoky so been kind of sticking
with the lighter shades in here I
haven't tried the other ones yet but
been loving those for I just love the
cool tone look this week and um it
really really gives me that really
nicely and I think it can be you know
day appropriate um I've been loving this
brush from Sigma this is the diffused
crease crease ether t8 brush it's like a
very very thin and not super fluffy and
been liking that with the darker colors
in that palette because it really just
gets in there without blending it too
far up you know or all over and making
it look muddy so it's really really nice
and thin and precise so been liking that
for working with darker colors um
lipstick that I've been wearing all week
has been the elf lipstick this is the
one dollar lipstick and classy it smells
amazing it tastes amazing it's beautiful
it's like a nice cool toned pink and on
top of that I have been liking an even
more cool tone color this is a the
Victoria's Secret flavored gloss beauty
rush in so jelly so the two of these
combined is what I'm wearing today
really really nice and cool toned I
think it complements the eye look very
well
I've been loving those two together and
that's so jelly gloss tastes really good
to it tastes like grape and for my
eyebrows finally I've been loving the
Milani brow shaping clear wax I have
been filling in my eyebrows a little
thicker this past week so I've been
really really liking this it really
makes them hold very well and yeah just
very good all right let's get into some
shower products or no first I'm going to
show you guys my nail polish I've been
loving this week I am wearing it today
it's the only one I've been wearing all
week it is the illamasqua nail varnish
in collide it is this gorgeous gorgeous
hot pink color and it's just really
really warm tone so it's very summery
and it's just absolutely lovely so been
loving that for removing my makeup at
night I've been like easy Neutrogena
makeup remover cleansing towelettes I
belt on and off with my book with my I
was going to say Moshe No boscia makeup
breakup cool cleansing oil I think it is
absolutely the best way to remove my
makeup because it doesn't tug at the
skin it leaves my skin feeling really
refresh but sometimes it's just not
quick enough and I don't want to be at
this think washing my face before I jump
with a shower so these have been really
really nice I know that you know my skin
is definitely a little more irritated
after I use makeup wipes it just isn't
as nice because it really kind of pulls
you know at the eye and skin but I've
been really liking these these this week
I love for Santa these are very very
soft towelettes they're probably the
softness that you can probably find but
overall you know I do think my bosha is
probably delete ago oil cleansing your
makeup off is probably the safest
easiest way for your skin but these are
just are not easiest the safest way
these are probably the easiest though
for removing makeup so been liking those
cleansing towelettes I have been loving
this glam glow youth cleanse mud to foam
cleanser this is awesome I got this in
my glossybox for the month Ibaka has
been using it all week I'm almost done
with it I love it um the youth masks are
the youth what's it called youth mud is
my favorite mask from glen peloso i knew
i was going to like this one it has the
same scent it doesn't have the same kind
of exfoliating particles and these ones
are a little like
kind of feel like little plastic beads
whereas in the mask it feels like a
really really small amount of like micro
dermabrasion so it's different kind it's
a different kind of exfoliation but it
still has the same scent you can kind of
leave it on your skin for a little bit
to kind of soup sink it you know sink
since they sync it up now kind of let us
sink into your skin first because it is
literally like a mud to foam so the
minute you put water on it kind of
starts foaming up but I'm loving this I
use it every single morning another
product that I got in a box a
subscription box for this month this was
in my um lower beauty box for the month
this is the oven um plano gel this is a
for oily blemish prone skin it is so
good i have mono lauren in it so it's
kind of like a acne treatment without
being super super abrasive and strong
and just like stripping at your skin
like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid
it's really really nice it smells really
good it's very refreshing it a little
goes a long way I use this at night time
with my clarisonic been absolutely
loving that let's see here I cream again
this is from a subscription box this is
from my popsugar must have box for the
month of August this is the royal
apothic t foam firming eye treatment
I've been liking this a lot you get a
full-size you're awesome um it has a
very like mild scent to it but it's just
a lovely formula I use it in the morning
and it just really glides on nicely on
my eyelid all the way underneath you
know my whole whole orbital bone
basically it's amazing so been really
really loving that another skincare
product i've been loving is the polished
choice resist moisture renewal oil
booster for dry or very dry skin it has
ceramides and argan oil in it of course
you do not have to have dry or very dry
skin to use this i have combination skin
but what I've been liking to use this
for is mixing it in with a moisturizer
putting in two to three drops you can
put it in with a serum or moisturizer
I've been putting it in with a
moisturizer this whole week and I just
kind of forgot about how great this
product is if you just want that extra
little
moisture you just add like I said two to
three drops you can even add it into a
serum I only use it in the morning and
the moisturizer I've been mixing it with
is this one I've been loving this this
is a sample that I got from know maybe
it was like a point perk thing from
Sephora it is the oly henriksen sheer
transformation face crab it's really
really nice it's oil-free it's glides on
really really easily again I think that
it doesn't have the highest amount of
moisturization so mixing the polished
choice product in with this is
definitely the way to go i'm just going
to keep mixing this with any kind of
moisturizer i'm using because i really
think it does um like up its
moisturization game so yeah anyway and
the next product i've been loving is the
out lip exfoliator this is awesome it
looks like this it looks like a lipstick
you just put it on there's no need to
rinse your lips off after you just have
this nice like coding of really yummy
like brown sugar smelling lip balm on
and it just really really exfoliates
nicely it's super super quick and easy
been loving that um let's see here an in
shower treatment that I have been loving
is the oh gx or the old like organics
brand is what it used to be called I'm
sorry there's like a glare I have big uh
what is it it's a big lights in front of
me know I'd actually don't have my you
tube lights up today it is very very
bright out today I have big brightness
coming through the window so this is the
hydrate plus repair argan oil of Morocco
miracle in shower oil you can mix this
in with your conditioner you can mix it
in with your shampoo what I've been
doing is mixing in 2 2-3 drops with my
shampoo every single time my shampoo and
I have very very fine hair that tends to
weigh down very easily and it does not
give way down at this product so I
absolutely love it I think it does boost
you know moisturization in my hair I do
need to try it with my conditioner to
see if that gives even more um you know
moisture but you can also use it on your
skin in your body so really really good
liking that but mostly
for putting into my shampoo um almost
down here sorry guys I feel like this is
the really long one this week um but
I've just been liking a lot of things
I've been loving the body shop Satsuma
body sorbet I think the thing I love
about this the most is obviously the
scent if you are someone oh my gosh too
good if you are someone who loves citrus
scents you have to pick up a Satsuma
body product from the body shop you have
to pick it up it's an amazing scent it
smells so pure and fresh like you just
cut open an orange it's amazing um so
this formula is really really nice to
you can put this in the refrigerator and
make it nice and cool and it literally
feels like a body sorbet but basically
it is like a really really lightweight
moisturizer that sinks in right away and
it says it has cold-pressed Satsuma oil
from Argentina in it I really just love
the scent and it's amazing so 11 that
another product I've been liking for my
upper arms my belly and my butt and
thighs is the kouachi anti-cellulite
booster I'm pretty sure this came in a
glossy box um maybe for the month of
july i want to say um but i have tried a
few questions they had in the GlossyBox
a few months ago that lovely lovely like
peach smelling toner I love that stuff I
need to go online and purchase another
one but basically this is another
product from quest that I've really been
liking this week it is the anti
cellulite booster and it basically is
enriched with a natural extract complex
that come back existing cellulite while
preventing the formation of new
cellulite I've not noticed a difference
yet like I said I've only been using it
a week but I really really like the
formula it really really moisturizes my
skin nicely and I just used it on areas
where I need to like target any kind of
i don't have cellulite on my arms but i
tend to carry my weight in the upper
half of my body like my boobs and my
arms so I this is just nice for like
firming and I just really really like
the texture it comes out really really
thick and you really have to rub it in
and I think that's why it's good for
cellulite
the more you rub the more circulation
and the wire blood flow is coming to the
surface of the skin so it kind of makes
sense but just really really been liking
this I think it is nice it doesn't have
sent it's just I don't know I I really
feel like I'm gonna start seeing results
with this so I'll keep you guys updated
on that product and let's see here is
this the last product I think this is
the last product i've been loving this
little hand cream from tony moly it is
the tony moly red apple hand cream it's
adorable it comes an adorable little
packaging it smells exactly like a red
apple it's wonderful I've been loving
this I use just a really small amount
and it makes my hands smell amazing
before bedtime and ringing moisturizes
so yeah those were my favorites for the
week this is almost a 20-minute video
that's pretty long for me um so I hope
you guys enjoyed this please give this
video a thumbs up if you did and I'll
see you in my next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
