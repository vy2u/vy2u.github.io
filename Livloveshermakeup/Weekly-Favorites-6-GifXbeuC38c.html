thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to beat my weekly
favorites so let's just jump right into
it I'm going to start with makeup um two
products that I've been using as primers
this week and absolutely loving have
been the Garnier five-second Blair skin
renew instant smoother this is what I've
been using on my face or as my face
primer it's really nice it has that very
like silicone e texture so really kind
of fills in your pores and any kind of
like um imperfections you might have
like texture wise on your face so I've
been absolutely loving that and I've
also been loving the Revlon age-defying
wrinkle remedy line filler it looks like
this um you can get this you know at the
drugstore i have used quite a bit of it
i love this product I just kind of
rediscover dit and I was like where is
this been all my life um so basically
you just kind of tap this in on areas
where you may have fine lines or areas
that tend to crease throughout the day
for me that's around my mouth my eye
like under eye area and then I have like
a little wrinkle right here that because
i'd like to go like this I raised my
face a lot like that so um I tap it in
there and it just helps to make sure
that the makeup doesn't like settle into
that area so absolutely been loving that
and for my eyes this week I've been
loving the Too Faced shadow insurance
anti-crease I shadow primer this has
just been really nice again it has that
really kind of silicone II feel when it
goes on and then it gets tacky so it's
really really great at concealers I have
been loving my Rimmel match perfection
skin tone adapting concealer it says
it's a two-in-one concealer and
highlighter my shade is 125 fair I've
just been really really enjoying this I
love it underneath my eyes all the way
down kind of in like a triangle shape
and then also on my eyelids it's just
really really nice and it's a perfect
match I can put it anywhere where I
might be breaking out as well and it's
just a really really nice match um for
my skin tone and I'm just really really
liking that this week I've been applying
it with this is dirty because I used it
today but my real techniques sponge it's
just it's damp and I've been applying
that over my foundation which brings it
to brings me to the foundation I've been
loving this week which has been d tart
and
clay full coverage foundation this has
been great it is kind of one of those
foundations of a little tacky on the
skin but it blends beautifully it gives
awesome coverage and my shade is a fair
beige if you guys are wondering so I've
been loving that to set my makeup I've
been using two products so um I really
like this NYX blotting powder and I like
this to actually set my makeup my shade
is in BL po1 which is in light and it
looks like this and I like it a lot and
I like it even though it is a blotting
powder I like it to set my makeup
however it does have some color to it so
it is actually a little light from me
right now which is interesting because i
am quite there but during the summer I
guess I got a little color this summer
at least I like to think so so um I have
been going over it after with the Revlon
nearly naked powder in um 0-10 fair it
looks like this and you guys can see I
have hit pan on this and I just like
this because it puts some color back
into my skin um so after i use the
blotting powder I top it with this and
then I can get like the perfect color
match for the rest of my body um let's
see here blush wise i have been loving
two blushes this week the first one is
from tarte it is the Amazonian clay
12-hour blush in pampered it's gorgeous
it is this beautiful peachy coral II
sort of color it is what I'm wearing on
my cheeks today and I just think this is
gorgeous it gives like just a beautiful
beautiful color to the cheeks it is
completely matched so when I've been
wearing that I have been topping it with
my josie maran argan enlightenment in
luminizing veil and this is what i've
been using as a highlight with that
blush this is really really gorgeous it
gives such a gorgeous glow to like the
cheek area and I have been liking
applying that with my ELF blending brush
just because it looks like kind of like
a highlighting brush and it just kind of
stamps the product on really really
nicely onto the areas you want to
highlight and with that tart blush and
with the blush i'm going to show you
next I've been liking my elf complexion
brush um this actually you know if you
just want to get the apples of the
cheeks this actually really does kind of
like cover that area really well so I
loving that and the other blush I wanted
to show you guys this is when i wear
alone um I don't wear it with the josie
maran highlighter because it kind of has
like a built-in highlight in it whereas
the tart blush is completely matte this
is the Physicians Formula organ where
ultra nourishing argan oil blush in rose
it smells amazing first of all it smells
so good and this is what the actual
color looks like it's this beautiful
kind of fleshy pink color and it has a
lot of built-in um like tiny tiny
glimmers and shimmers of like a silvery
highlight so there's no need to use a
highlight with this so I've been loving
that as well um from my lips all week I
have been wearing the same thing it is
the Sephora kissimmee bomb in strawberry
fizz it looks like this I love the
texture I love the formula of these this
color is beautiful it goes on like a
very very pigmented and then throughout
the day it kind of leaves like a stain
on your lips which i think is gorgeous
so I've been loving this and that is the
only lip product i've been wearing all
week i'm really impressed because
normally i kind of switch out my lip
products at least i have more than one
you know but that is it for this week
that is the only one i've been wearing
for eyes or for like you know eyelashes
i guess i should start with i've been
using my Urban Decay subversion lash
primer and I have been topping it with
one of my favorite mascaras which is the
Sephora outrageous curl so the two of
those combined really give me some
gorgeous gorgeous looking lashes and
I've been very very happy with that I've
been liking this little mally beauty
prix contour kit this is for your nose
that is a nose contour kit um it has a
darker shade for the actual contouring
part and then it's got the nice little
highlight shade which doesn't look like
much in the pan but it's actually really
really beautiful I've been really liking
this I'm getting into the hang of like
contouring my nose so I've been liking
this a lot it came with this little dual
ended brush that I've been liking a lot
um it says to use the contour with this
one and then the highlight with this but
I
actually been applying the contour with
this and then just taking a separate
brush blending it out and then putting
the highlight down my nose um I have
been loving this eyeliner this is the
Urban Decay heavy metal glitter eyeliner
I'm wearing it on my eyes today actually
on my eyelid um and I just love it it's
in the shade baked and I think these are
discontinued but these are gorgeous I've
been wearing this on my lash line I've
been wearing it on my lid just several
different ways this whole week and I
just been really liking that the two
eyeliners that I have been sportin this
week have been the knicks slide on
eyeliner in SL 16 golden bronze it's
just nice golden bronze kind of color
and then what I am wearing today is the
clinic skinny stick in 03 slim sable so
um really really been liking that
haven't been wearing any like white eye
line or anything like that really just
kind of tight lining and doing my
waterline with a nice brown color and
then be from i shadow i have been using
the same palette all week this is the
Cielo in the moment eyeshadow palette
it's gorgeous you get some darker shades
you get some nice like neutral you know
colors i am wearing impulse today which
is like this beautiful light uh kind of
purply color I don't know if you guys
can see it right there well yep right
there and then I have this in my crease
oh my gosh sorry like the camera goes
backwards I'm like this so that in my
crease in that shade is called wonder
i've been loving it i also have impulse
on my lower lash line I think it's
gorgeous I have instinct which is that
bright highlighting shade underneath my
brow bone and I just think you can get
such great looks with this um I've been
wearing this all week the only day I
didn't was when I was reviewing the
Bobby Brown teller I'd I palette so I've
been absolutely loving that I palette
and for my brows this week I've been
loving my Revlon browse fantasy by color
stay in dark blonde do you get the eye
pencil on one side and then the gel on
the other this just goes on really
smoothly um it is kind of like you know
you have to be careful with it because a
lot goes on it once and it is such a
like soft formula but it really kind of
builds your browser
nicely all right skincare I've been
loving this clean and clear morning
burst facial cleanser this is new to me
this week I've been absolutely adoring
it it really really wakes me up in the
morning and it has bursting beads that
says it wakes you up rinses clean with
vitamin C and ginseng so been loving
that for my moisturizer this week for my
face I've been loving me josie maran
argan infinity intensive creamy oil this
has been awesome it is very very
moisturizing and it really pairs nicely
with that Garnier five-second blur skin
renew primer so I've been loving that
for my lips I've been liking this
lollipop a delicious bone I lipka or lip
balm this like piece like cake like it's
so good I got this in some sort of a
subscription box so but anyway I love it
it's really really good it smells
amazing taste really good and really
really moisturizes my lips it has kind
of that um like a bass alimi sort of
feel to it so maybe it does have some
petroleum in it but it really protects
my lips I've been loving this Victoria's
Secret flavored lip scrub in what is it
strawberry fizz oh it's the same name as
my little Sephora kiss me bomb it looks
like this and it smells really good it
tastes really good and it explains my
lips very well um let's see here for dry
shampoo this week I've been liking this
tresemme fresh starts new formula no
visible residue volumizing dry shampoo I
love the way this smells I like wearing
this when putting this in when my hair
is up like today I am wearing it so I
like that a lot and then on the days
whoa oh my gosh I almost just felt this
on the days where my hair is down I've
been liking Johnson's baby powder as my
dry shampoo just to give a little lift
and make sure that I'm not putting too
much check texture into my hair when my
hair is down because I only like texture
in my hair when my hair is up like on
days where my hair is up that is the
only time I like texture in my hair so
um yeah so I've been loving this
Johnson's baby powder on the days where
I wear my hair down I don't love to
smell a baby powder but this has been
very very nice so um
like texture-wise I've been liking it so
I I can excuse the smell for that and
the last thing I've been loving is my
country apple fine fragrance mist from
Bath and Body Works the smells really
good mmm yum yum yum it smells like
apples and I feel like you can wear it
during the summer you can wear it during
the winter you can wear it during the
fall because it's one of those
fragrances that's like I don't know I
for me personally I think that any kind
of fruity fragrance you really can wear
at any time because like you associate
apples with fall but also you know you
can associate it with summer or spring
so it's just been one of those things
that's been taking me into the fall and
I've just been loving at the scent of it
so young oh my gosh I'd just sprayed
myself like 20 times but who cares i
want to smell like a country apple so
anyway those were my favorites for the
week i hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you did please give it a thumbs up
and i'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
