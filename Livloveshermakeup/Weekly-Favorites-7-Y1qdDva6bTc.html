thank you so much for joining me happy
sunday i am here to share my weekly
favorites with you guys i have some food
items i have a lot of skincare items
because i've been dealing with some
hormonal breakouts this week and then i
have my makeup items so let's get
started i'm going to start with makeup i
will then do skin care stuff and then go
into the food favorite so yeah let's
just get started the first thing i've
been loving this week has been the Too
Faced hangover RX replenishing face
primer this is like free of silicones
it's really really nice it smells
amazing like coconuts and it's very like
refreshing and just nice and different
to put on your skin it doesn't have a
silicone II feel to it it doesn't feel
heavy on the skin and I've really really
been loving it because like I said I
have been dealing with some hormonal
acne this week it is at that time of the
month for me so it's just been those
really really big painful zits like that
are under the skin that absolutely like
you can't pop them nothing works like
topically really um all you can really
do is like put ice on them or like a
cold compress I did find a few topical
products that have been working a little
bit but still like I'm left with scars
and just oh you know all that kind of
stuff is just kind of annoying but
anyway I'm the two face primer has been
really nice just because um you know
it's not heavy it doesn't feel silicone
II it doesn't feel gunky on my skin it
doesn't it's not clogging my pores and
it's just it's really really nice so
I've been loving that this week this is
definitely like a Holy Grail primer for
me the setting miss that I've been
loving this week is the Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray this is
cooling and hydrating I actually used
this up all the way so you guys will be
seeing this in my next empties but it
really makes you my makeup like stay put
and still gives it like a nice um like
bit of moisture to the skin it feels
really good for highlight this week I
have been loving my NARS super orgasm
illuminator it looks like this it's
absolutely gorgeous I've been wearing
this on my cheeks over a blush that i'm
going to show you guys next but it just
gives this gorgeous glow it has a lot of
glitter and shimmer in it and it's just
this beautiful kind of pinky coralie
peachy color with tons of gold
shimmer and I've just been putting it
topping it on top of the matte blush so
i'm going to show you guys next but it
just looks absolutely gorgeous so I've
been loving that the matte blush that I
have been wearing is the fit me
Maybelline blush in a light nude it
looks like this let me show you guys so
this pair is really really nicely on
with that illuminator that I just showed
you guys and like I said this is
completely matte and it's just this nice
nudey kind of peachy color doesn't give
a lot of like um dimension or color to
the actual skin but if when you pair it
with like an illuminator that has a
little bit of color to it it just looks
gorgeous so I've been loving that the
bronzer I've been using this week it is
like the names like worn off i've had
this forever this is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster glow boosting
pressed powder in light to medium it's
really really beautiful this has been a
favorite for many many years it's just a
really nice light color that looks great
on my fair skin tone and it has tiny
tiny little flecks of gold shimmer but
you really can't pick up on it I kind of
used it to bronze up my whole face and
kind of contour out you know my um not
really my cheekbones but you know what I
just kind of bronzed it all over but it
does give some dimension to the face and
it's gorgeous and I really don't think
those little tiny flecks of shimmer and
pick up that much of that make sense I
just like spit you um let's see here I
feel like I'm going in a weird order
like primers and then like powder
products and i'm going to show you my
foundation probably should have gone in
order but um this is the foundation i've
been loving this week it is the estee
lauder double wear stay-in-place makeup
my shade is 1 n 1 ivory nude and the
reason i have been loving this is
because like i said i've been having
some skin issues this week and this is a
lovely lovely full coverage foundation
i'm wearing one layer of it today on my
skin you can build it up last night um I
went out with my boyfriend and his
family and I actually wore two layers
and it was like amazing like it just
looks so good the skin looks beautiful
and it really really covers very well
and I really really like it with like a
damp beauty sponge I've been using it
with my Beauty Blender this week and
also my Real Techniques sponge whichever
one is clean that
the one I have been using so it really
really looks nice when you apply it with
a damp sponge but you know it's just
such great coverage and it's really
really a thin consistency so you kind of
have time to kind of work it into the
skin which I like it's not like the kat
von d locket or like the revlon
colorstay where you literally have two
seconds to blend it in like you can kind
of move it around a little bit and then
it sets really full coverage so it's
very nice I've been using the it
cosmetics bye-bye redness neutralizing
cream to cover any little spots that I
may have basically as my concealer this
week it's really helped with the redness
this is just amazing it blends really
really beautifully it won't irritate any
like existing pimples you have on your
face I've noticed it's just so creamy it
doesn't you know how sometimes like
you'll get those pimples and then the
more like harsh kind of acne products
you use it starts to kind of get like
flaky and dry so then your oily and dry
at the same time this concealer like
goes over or the correcting cream goes
over it really really beautifully so
that it doesn't look patchy with your
makeup so been loving that to cover my
little imperfections and then for under
the eyes I'm back to one of my favorites
tried and true another holy grail
product this is the Maybelline instant
age rewind eraser dark circle treatment
this is in the brightening formula it's
got like a pink undertone to it it's
absolutely gorgeous I am almost out
literally I it is on this last little
leg of the race and probably see you
will probably see this in my empties
video soon but I just take it under in
the triangle shape you know and I go
straight up and then I take it on my
eyelid as well it's so beautiful it
really brightens amazingly amazing
texture you have to try these age rewind
concealer shout if you have not yet
alright I've been loving my best omnia
cosmetics the boudoir finishing brush it
feels like silk I like to take it down
my neck to distribute product kind of
take it down and just make sure
everything is blended really well and
also I've been liking going underneath
my eyes after i put my eyeshadow on to
pick up any fallout love this brush it
has become like an everyday brash that I
used absolutely every day alright for
lip color this week I had been liking
two different lipsticks the one I'm
wearing today is the Revlon
lipstick this is the Revlon super
lustrous lipstick in 671 mink and it's
just this nice kind of brownish
beautiful color it goes on a kind of
sheer so you know it doesn't look too
dark on the lips it looks really dark in
the packaging but doesn't go on too dark
I love the way it feels on my lips it
doesn't have the longest staying power
but it just feels great on the lips and
I really really think the color is
beautiful and the second lipstick color
I've been wearing this week is from my
Melissa Autry subscription bag this is
her lipstick in Rosie stone looks like
that I love her um am i holding I
thought I was holding that upside down
I'll absolutely love the formulation of
her lipsticks and this one is no
exception it's really gorgeous and it's
just a beautifully a beautiful kind of
rosy tone with a bit of like a brown
undertone so I've really kind of been
liking those neutral brown Rosie kind of
lips this week um let's see here okay so
so for mascara and I forgot to bring out
the other part of this because it's
gonna make no sense I have been liking
the Stila um huge extreme lash mascara
and this is going to make no sense
because I recently reviewed this product
last week and I did not like it the only
way that I like this product and I can't
believe I forgot to be a little thing
that I used with it but it is the Urban
Decay perversion or subvert subversion
lash primer I apply that and then I
apply this and it looks great so I
really was disappointed after I gotten
this I reviewed it I did not like it i
think you could probably tell in the
review but i just in one of those people
that likes to use a product up I like to
find a way to use it and this actually
looks really really good with the
subversion lash primer so that has been
a favorite this week I'm wearing it
today it does make the lashes a little
clumpy so if you are not into that you
probably won't like it but um that is a
way that I have found it to be you know
usable for me so i've been using two
different eyeliners this week and it's
just been I pencils that I put right
into my aunt waterline today i'm wearing
the sephora i pencil in 01 noir it looks
like this oops looks like this
just nice jet black where's really
nicely in the waterline and the other
one I've been wearing in the water line
this week has been the NYC Kohl eyeliner
pencil in 926 quite so I've been liking
both of those that's all I've been doing
with eyeliner this week just right in
the water line just those two colors for
my brows this week I've been loving the
benefit gimme brow I am in the shade um
light/medium I think this is the
lightest one they have it does really
really kind of darken your brows of a
bit but this is the best way to thicken
up your brows really quickly without
having to pencil them and its really
really awesome love that product um the
eyeshadows that I have been loving this
week have been the Bobby Brown teller
I'd I palette um or yeah I guess yeah I
can call it the eyeshadows I've been
liking this week because it's a palette
it's got a bunch of them in there so you
could step in really nice shades in here
you get some sparkles some metallics to
matts you get to really nice transition
colors um really really beautiful I
reviewed this last week and um you know
I just I liked it right away after i had
reviewed it and i was like i'm going to
you know i'm gonna use this palette next
week so really really been liking that
been wearing it all week I think it's
gorgeous you get all the neutrals you
could want in there and it is a tiny
tiny little palette that is great for
on-the-go and another shadow that I've
been liking using with the Bobby Brown
tell ride ipod i am wearing it on my lid
today is the Loreal infallible eyeshadow
in 892 amber rush looks like this it is
absolutely gorgeous let me show you guys
up close um this just pairs really
nicely with those teller I'd I am back
those Kelly ride I colors yeah the eye
palette it pairs really really nicely
with that it's kind of got that
neutrally beautiful like undertone its
kind of rosy it just went really really
well with that palette this week and I
love this it looks like it's like wet or
when you put it on your eyelid it's just
so shimmery and perfect and beautiful
you do get a bit of fallout but it's
just the color is amazing and the
formula so those are the makeup
favorites let's go into skin care
actually I want to show you guys what
I've been wearing on my nails this week
first this is the sally hansen hard as
nails xtreme where i've been loving this
this week it is
in the shade 425 pink satin it looks
like this and I just love this it's got
like this like silver tone but it's got
like this beautiful pink and like lilac
iridescent to it so that has been
absolutely my favorite nail polish this
week the only one I have been wearing
let's see here perfumes my Marc Jacobs
mod doire should be no surprise to you
guys pick this up what like a week and a
half ago love it it's all I'm wearing
it's all I have been wearing all week it
just smells like gardenia and like a
little bit of like musk it's so
beautiful it is an amazing scent highly
highly recommend that definitely a
favorite this week and also this has
been a favor this is kind of funny i
picked this up probably like two months
ago and i never got into it except for
this week i just kind of popped it out
and I was like I want to try that this
is the bath and Bodyworks jingle Bellini
shimmer mist and it is actually like a
perfume spray that you spray on to your
skin and it leaves like a bit of shimmer
I don't even know if you guys can
probably tell i did spray it on my arms
that i've been wearing it like that and
i just have been liking like the little
flecks of shimmer on my skin this week i
have no idea why um i really don't know
why because normally that's not
something i'm really into but i just
been loving this and it smells amazing
it smells like peaches and like
nectarine let's see what does it say it
says jingle Bellini a festive cocktail
of peach champagne apricot nectar and
powdered sugar so it smells amazing and
it just gives us nice like shimmer look
to lick your skin and I could ran out on
my arms my legs and loving it so really
been liking that this week and now let's
get into more like skincare items
because like I said have been dealing
with some hormonal acne so I have been
masking a lot this week and I've
actually been doing two masks and I
don't mean like multi masking where you
put masks on different parts of your
face I mean literally putting one on and
then putting the other one on so um I've
been using the formula 1006 mass I
really really like these the first one
I've been using is the deep down detox
ultra cleansing mud mask with orange and
bergamot it looks like this and this is
really nice it's like a clay mask but it
doesn't completely dry on the skin and
it just feels like nice
kind of keeps a little bit of moisture
and it smells amazing it really really
pulls out like impurities and it really
leaves my skin looking a lot more clear
and then I'll go in with the formula
1006 keep your cool skin calming gel
mask coconut plus cucumber it says this
unique gel mass helps reduce the
appearance of nasty breakouts coconut
sues blemishes while refreshing cucumber
helps calm even the most angry of
flare-ups the result skin is cool calm
and under control this is actually not
really that much of like a gel formula I
was expecting it to be a lot more gel
like let me show you guys it's actually
like white and kind of runny can you
guys see that but it really smells nice
like cucumbers and coconut and I noticed
that like if I apply a small like little
layer of this all over my face first of
all you can like literally probably put
your makeup on over this because it just
goes in clear on the skin it's not like
a normal mask but I just noticed that
like it really kind of mattifies my face
without over-drying it and like I said
been dealing with those nasty breakouts
this week and it's funny because last
week my skin was very very dry and then
this week I'm dealing with you no more
oil more breakouts things like that so
um you know your skin can change on a
weekly basis guys it's crazy it's
unfortunate let's see here I've been
liking to of the products from like the
rebab revitalizing black which is called
like black mask line or whatever from
boscia if this revitalizing black
hydration gel is really nice it's got
glycolic acid in it they say you can
wear it day and nice however I only like
to wear it at night because it does have
glycolic acid in it but it's a cooling
gel moisturizer it feels great on the
skin I've been wearing this every other
night and um it's got it really just
helps like refine the skin and keep it
clear and I just really have been liking
that and then the other product is the
 luminizing black mask and I
actually don't like this as a mask at
all it's supposed to be a one be one of
those like peel-off masks and it just
doesn't really work no matter how much i
use and i just don't really like it like
that so i have been using it as a spot
treatment and i have noticed that those
big hormonal breakouts that are kind of
under the skin have been um you know
like responding to this so i have been
putting that on my blood
areas um at night and I've been liking
it as a spot treatment um let's move on
to something not so skin care related
quickly before I come back to Mars thin
care um well it is skin care but it's
more shower related this is a body wash
this is the co bigelow number 14 11
mental body vitamin body wash with one
point nine percent peppermint oil it
says our vitamin rich formula deeply
cleanses with an invigorating sensation
oh my gosh this stuff smells so good if
you love the smell of peppermint you
will absolutely love this it leaves like
a really nice cooling sensation on your
skin it's got tiny little micro beads in
there that help to kind of like refine
and exfoliate your skin really lightly
and it just has the best scent ever it's
really nice for like this time of year
to worse getting cooler and it's like
fall kind of but still summary like you
I don't know peppermint is one of those
scents that can go you know in a lot of
different directions so I've been
absolutely loving that back to skincare
um the facial wash I have been using at
night this week has been the peter
thomas roth glycolic acid 3% facial wash
it is oil-free anti-aging cleanser with
alpha hydroxy acid pro beat vitamin b5
and alottoni to stop in and exploit the
skin and I've been liking this because
like I said um I've been breaking out
and glycolic acid is great for removing
dead skin cells so basically like I felt
like my skin was very congested this
week and also just my pores everything
was really congested so I opted to
switch to my glycolic um you know facial
cleanser and also glycolic acid is
really really great too for blemishes um
so you guys are probably wondering
because I was last week I showed my
favorite was the oven clin install or
clean old Joe yeah and I was using that
at night with my um with my clarisonic
just forgot that for a second with my
clarisonic and I have like multiple
multiple cleansers that I switch up
because my skin tends to get used to
stuff and also depending on how my skin
is that week I just like to be able to
switch to different things so right now
i have three gel cleansers
that I basically keep like in rotation I
have the tea tree one from the body shop
I have the oven Clinton's gel and then
this one so just depending on what my
skin is like that week I will you know
change these things out so if you were
wondering I still love the of 81 it's
just I didn't want it this week for my
skin because of all the breakouts I've
been having all right another skincare
item that the l'oreal hide refresh toner
refreshes refreshes in a splash this is
amazing i really really love this it is
very very nice for combination skin
doesn't dry out my dry patches and does
not make my oily spots any more oily so
I've really been loving that it is
awesome if you store it in the
refrigerator to its really nice cooling
sensation something I've been liking for
my lips before i put on my lipsticks has
been these soft lips cube in um i think
this is like the sweet mint one not even
see it smells like peppermint but this
is really nice it has sunscreen in it
and i noticed that if i apply this
before I apply like my lipstick or like
you know because i have been wearing
lipsticks that are a little more heavy
duty you know what i mean like they're a
little more matte they they're not super
super glossy so i do feel like i need a
lip balm with them and this just sinks
in really really quickly I could
literally be doing my foundation put
this on my lips and by the time I get to
my lipstick they're nice and like plump
and soft and I won't have any like
skipping when I put my mmm actual
lipstick on um a product that i have
been loving to you has been being now
essential oils one hundred percent pure
lavender oil i picked this up at my
whole foods and i've been liking this
because my boyfriend and I are moving
soon as hence all the boxes I we are
moving next weekend um so by the way um
weekly favorites will probably be early
next weekend probably on Friday instead
of sunday but we are moving next
Saturday and I just kind of stressed out
we're not actually moving into a
different building we're just going ten
floors up in the building we are in
right now well sorry guys I feel like my
notes got a little runny we're just
moving ten floors up so it's not like a
huge deal but
packing boxes and things like that is
still stressful so I've been taking this
lavender oil at night putting it on my
wrists and kind of like rubbing them
together and just like inhaling and
doing some aromatherapy because at
nighttime is when I start to really
think about stuff and my brain is like
running like just I have tons of
thoughts going through my head so it is
the time of day where I get a little
stressed out I guess you could say so
this has been very very helpful kind of
suits me and helps me to go to sleep and
okay that is all like skincare makeup
products I've three food favorites to
show you guys um so let's get started I
love the boom chicka bites what are
these ancient grain popcorn clusters in
mixed berry just tastes like raspberry
popcorn if you want to taste raspberry
popcorn by this I got this a target it
is so good another target thing that I
found was the chill Bonnie Greek yogurt
these are the flips but this is the
pumpkin harvest crisp so you get pumpkin
yogurt and then little Chris that you
dumped into it and it is pumpkin low-fat
yogurt with pie crust pieces pecans and
glazed pumpkin seeds if you are a fan a
fall and whatnot you will absolutely
love this it tastes like fall in a
little cup it is so good and the last
little thing I want to talk about is
this beverage right here I love tazo
like concentrates I love their chives
and this is the black tea concentrate
this is I sangria black it is a fruit
soak summer tea with citrus notes a hint
of cinnamon and a touch of sweetness and
it is so good you just mix this with
equal parts water and you are good to go
you have some nice like unsweetened um
or is it sweet it tastes like it's kind
of unsweetened you could add in sugar if
you want but you have this nice
refreshing tea so anyway those were my
favorites I'm sorry this video was so
long I hope you guys enjoyed though um
and I will see you guys in the next 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
