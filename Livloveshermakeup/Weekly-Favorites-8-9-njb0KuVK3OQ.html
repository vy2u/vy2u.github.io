thank you so much for joining me i hope
you guys are having a fantastic weekend
i'm here with my weekly favorites video
for you guys today i know that i missed
weekly favorites last week you guys know
that i moved into my new apartment so I
wasn't able to film we ended up getting
our keys a day earlier so I was not able
to film last weekend but I was looking
at my products this morning and I
realized that the products that I've
been using this week I was also using
last week like I said it was a big week
it was very busy we were moving and I
just realized that they are basically
the same thing so I thought I would
combine last week's favorites with this
week's because they are the same so
anyway um everything is makeup except
for two items ah which is weird because
most of my stuff was boxed away so I
didn't really get to use a lot of bath
products or things like that I only have
to kind of skincare items so I'm
actually going to share those with you
guys first so the first thing i've been
loving for the past two weeks is the
Garnier clean plus a blackhead
eliminating scrub it says it clears the
complexion unclogs pores with charcoal
and it is for oily skin it is oil free
and it has salicylic acid in it two
percent so basically this is um just a
really really nice scrub I like to use
this in the morning it smells really
really good it actually kind of smells
like a man's cologne so I don't know if
you have like a boyfriend or a man in
your life like your hubby or something
that you know you want to get I don't
know you want him to kind of like clear
up his skin this really smells like a
guy's product it smells really really
good um and I just noticed that this
really helps like unclog my pores that
helps the blackheads and it has a really
nice like texture to it really does
exfoliate my skin and I really really
like it so also this is the bonus thirty
five percent more so you can get this
for under five dollars at target so
definitely go check that out thanks
target so the second thing that I have
been loving is the yes to grapefruit
correct and repair rejuvenates
rejuvenating facial wipes I love these I
cannot believe this is like from the yes
to tomatoes line except this is the one
for like anti aging or something I think
the grapefruit one is for that yeah the
correcting repair but these are amazing
for removing your makeup they're great
for using if you just need to cleanse
your face really quickly I've been doing
that a lot the past two weeks since I've
been so busy I haven't had time to
literally wash my face at the sink every
single day um so these are great for
that but also these like literally take
off all of my eye makeup they take off
all of my face makeup I'm so so
impressed so I'm definitely going to go
check out the blueberry ones too and i
think i have tried the cucumber ones but
these ones are really really amazing i'm
very very interested with these
grapefruit ones so i am yeah very very
happy i will definitely repurchase those
and yeah now let's get into the makeup
what i have been using the past two
weeks for primers i have been loving the
bombs put a lid on it iowa it eyelid
primer it looks like this it has a
really nice smooth texture not silicone
ii in any kind of way um and I feel like
it really just makes my eyeshadows look
brighter and makes them stay on longer
and I just really really like it so I've
been loving that and for my face I have
really been liking the covergirl outlast
all day primer this is just a makeup
where extender it does not have any kind
of silicone II feel to it it does not
feel moisturizing it literally is only
an extender so that is all it's going to
do is extend the life of your foundation
and your makeup on your face so don't
expect any kind of pore filling benefits
pore filling benefits or anything like
that because this really is just an
extender but it is awesome and I have
been having very very long days you know
moving boxes and things like that and
unpacking and this has kept my makeup on
all day so love that the foundation i
have been wearing this week is the gosh
cosmetics CC cream illuminating
foundation in 01 porcelain this is like
a moisturizing foundation i did a
foundation tutorial on this last week if
you guys are interested i will link that
video below but i love this it is very
very natural it looks beautiful on the
skin i am wearing these products today
obviously it does like show your skin
will show through with it like you won't
it doesn't cover everything you want you
still will be able to see you know red
marks hyperpigmentation things like that
but i think it's very very nice
it's very beautiful and I love the way
that it sits on the skin so I like to
apply that with a damp beauty sponge I
think that really is nice it looks good
applied with like a buffing brush and
also it looks great when you apply it
with your fingers it's just one of those
foundations that's so light that you can
do it you know either way um for let's
see here like primer like setting sprays
I've been loving this NYX dewy finish
long-lasting setting spray I'm almost
out you guys may see this in my next
empties video for the month but this is
really really nice it does give like a
little moisture back to the skin and
like I said the foundation that I've
been wearing has not been very full
coverage so I'm not afraid of this kind
of taking away from any coverage because
it is such a sheer product but this is
just lovely I really really like this
it's very very nice it does moisturize
it doesn't smell that great but that's
okay and it does out prolong the life of
my makeup too set in my foundation I've
been loving the Rimmel London stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder in 001
transparent and it looks like this you
guys can see I have hit major pan on
this baby so this thing is going to be
running out pretty soon maybe you guys
will see this in my next empties video
as well but I really really like this it
keeps me very very mad um the foundation
you know that gosh cosmetics one has
like a little bit of luminosity to it
and I kind of like the combination of
the luminous foundation mixed with like
a matte powder I don't know it gives
like a very like Demi back kind of
finish to your whole face and I think
it's very beautiful so I have been
loving that and then to go over on top
of it I have either been using the
buffing technique the Wayne Goss
technique with my um what was it I think
it's my ELF ultimate I was gonna say
kabuki brush now ultimate blending brush
probably should have brought that on
camera sorry but um I don't have it in
front of me but I've been using that or
I've been going over with like a
finishing brush any kind of big loose
powder brush and i have been using the
NYX HD studio finishing powder this is
one of those a hundred percent pure
mineral like silica powders this one is
in
FP 01 studio finish powder and it's very
very similar to the elf one and also the
make up for ever one but I really really
like it it really looks beautiful on
camera and because i was wearing such a
sheer light you know foundation the past
two weeks i think that this just steps
up um the overall like it just makes
your complexion look really really
flawless so i really really liked that
something else that i have been loving
has been at the benefit puff off i feel
like this is in a weekly favorites video
like literally every other week but this
is just a tinted I gel basically it's
just one of those steps that you can go
in if you are having like issues with
not sleeping enough or your eyes are a
little red we haven't gained a lot of
sleep the past two weeks so this has
been really nice it does have a little
bit of a pink tint so it's very very
brightening underneath the eye area and
also it helps with little puppies and
things like that like under eye bags
because it has a really nice little
metal tip and it's very very cooling
when you apply it so I've been loving
that this week as well mascara wise my
covergirl the supersize our love with
this mascara this is amazing you can
apply one coat like I have today and get
like a really nice um just really really
nice definition it really holds a curl
it looks really good or you can apply
two coats and really get like above a
boom lashes really really beautiful um
let's see here eyeliner I have only been
wearing one this is the NYX slide on
eyeliner in SL 0 for pure white I've
just been wearing this in my waterline
like I said lack of sleep has been
giving me you know a lot of redness in
my eye area the only way to brighten
that up is to use a white eyeliner in my
opinion for blush I've been absolutely
loving and only been wearing this one
this is the clinique cheek pop in 02
peach pop it looks like this it is so
pretty it is just gives you the most
beautiful like innocent flesh to your
cheeks it is a beautiful coral kind of
peach color and the
she is so cute look at it's like a
little flower I love that so absolutely
been loving that product and then for my
lips I have been liking a few different
kind of things so I've been liking just
a really really natural pink lip um
nothing too heavy something that has
like built-in moisture so one of the
first things I've been loving is the YSL
I got this like this is just a little
deluxe I sample this is the ville up
tint oil I don't even know what shade
this is but it is a beautiful um like
fleshy not fleshy but like pinky rosy
color it's very very natural looking on
the lips I absolutely love it and then
what I am wearing today is my ELF um
perfect pink what is this glow I think
this is called like a lip glow yeah in
perfect pink it's really beautiful it
looks like this it kind of takes on a
your lips but better color when you
apply it I am wearing that topped with
the Victoria's Secret um pink sugar lip
balm it looks like this and this is
really nice it has a beautiful light
like pink color to it and the two of
them applied together is gorgeous it
smells really good it's very minty it
gives a lot of like shine to your lips
so I really love the combination of
those two together for my brows I have
been loving the bhcosmetics HD brow
pencil this is in blonde and it's just
like a retractable pencil it looks like
this I really really like it it has such
a fine little tip that it's just so easy
to apply you know it's not like like a
pomade or something like that that's
going to go on really heavy it's very
precise very exact and I really only
been feeling in like the front of my
eyebrows I haven't been going in very
heavily so I have been absolutely loving
that and then foureyes when I have been
wearing eye shadow there's been a lot of
days the past two weeks where I have not
been wearing eye shadow but i have been
loving this little tart high-performance
naturals palette it is actually magnetic
it's a very cute you can travel with
these they're very sleek I think this
was from these sweet indulgences kits
from last I want to say this was like
part of the
holiday collection from last year I
think it was I didn't get it until later
but it's really really beautiful basic
basic basic neutral colors in here and
that is what I have basically been going
for the past two weeks I haven't wanted
anything too heavy or crazy so this is
what it looks like when it is combined
you guys can see there are a lot of
dusty colors in here like not you know
colors that pop or anything like that
very dusty lots of neutrals dusty roses
you got some dark like kind of greenie
muddy colors I know that sound so weird
but they're actually very flattering and
very pretty so this has been the palette
I've been working with for the past two
weeks and like I said they are a
magnetic you know so you can actually
take them apart and you know use them
separately and I think that's so cool so
I really been liking those just very
basic very easy very very neutral eyes
so really really been liking that and
yeah that looks like it is it I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I will of course
have new products for next week it's
been like two weeks now of using the
same thing and I'm like so over it so
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a thumbs
up and I'll see you my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
