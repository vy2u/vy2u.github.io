my channel today I wanted to walk you
guys through what I like and do not like
about the morphe brand so let's go ahead
and start with the one thing that I do
like for morphe that is their brushes
and what I say like I mean like I don't
love these okay I'm not obsessive that I
don't think there's the best brush on
the market I just think that they're
okay the reason why do like them is
because they aren't really a pretty
cheap price in my opinion unfortunately
they are pretty cheap quality that you
tend to be a little more Scratchy
but because they are a little more
scratchy and a little more densely
packed I notice that they're actually
really good for application one more big
and domestic own sort of shadows aka
foiled shadows now I am someone who
loves me some soiled eyeshadows and I
notice that a lot of morphine palettes I
have tried out two different eye shadow
palettes now the 3/5 Oh as well as the
Jaclyn health favorites palette from a
couple years ago I noticed that the
shimmers in there have that really
DeMatha cone-like consistency to them so
I do think that you're going to get a
morphe iron shadow palette
getting a morphe brush along with that
is a good idea so the two that I really
do enjoy are the M of 513 brush as well
as the end of 511 brush the other ones
that I try not really wasn't too
impressed with but I do would like these
two brushes right here this one reminds
me a lot of you Sigma e35 but I just
want to show you guys really quickly for
a little bit of comparison here these
things like e35 this guy right here I've
tapped for four years of my collection
and this my 13 I've had for one month in
my collection you can see the bristles
look almost identical this is not
watched very well it's a shed sometimes
but again if you're not a professional
when it comes to makeup if you don't
really mind that much I would say go
ahead and pick up a morphe brush they
have a lot of vegan options as well so
that is the one thing that I won't be
more be credit for is that their brushes
aren't so bad they're not
amazing but they're not so bad that was
not having to talk a little bit about
what I do not like about the morphe
brand so the first is definitely the
makeup I have extreme reactions extreme
reactions to morphe eyeshadows and
morphe concealers I have not tried
anything else from them I will not try
their highlighters I will not turn their
blushes because that is how that the
reaction is the only other time that
I've had such a bad reaction is when I
try like Mac's foundations which make me
break out like crazy I'm telling you
right now those
okay let's just the sex when you open
them up and you can smell those
chemicals I swear to god it's just
horrible
so basically I try to be a Jacqueline
Hill favorites palette I'll get into
customer service in any second here but
I tried the outfit the Jacqueline kilt
papers pellet it took three different
times for me to actually get it right
because two of them and did comma
shattered and when I try to announce I
noticed after about a week of using it
consistently consistently exists
consistently I know that I was getting a
lot of io reaction so I was getting
little tiny bumps up here near my
eyebrows that were very very itchy for
some reason I clearly stated she and I'm
bitching they were very very itchy these
tiny little red bumps and then after
using it for about a month I was
noticing that I had swelling eyelids
like every single day my actual eyelids
were swelling and you could not see the
crease of my eye you can barely see the
eyelid I mean it was just the most
disturbing thing and I was like why am I
using it this eyeshadow palette that is
how bad the reaction was so I have tried
to jacqueline health favourites I tried
it be 3/5 Oh palettes and both times I
had an extreme reaction with these
palettes so that is why I won't purchase
eyeshadow palettes for more V I do not
think they're good quality I do not only
have the ingredients going and there are
good quality and I would just be very
very careful if you do have sensitive
skin now I did also try out to be more
if you concealer about a year ago you
did a first impressions on my channel
actually and what I first tried the
matter when I was not so bad I mean the
shade swatch and really really
horrendous I could not find a shade that
really matched me I think I got the
three lighter shades and because we were
three 99 or $4.99
I thought you know what was gonna be
great I can play around with you and I
can get like three or four shades so I
really didn't like the consistency was
very Lucy I didn't feel like the
coverage was very good is definitely
something to fine lines and wrinkles but
again after using that consistently for
a week in order to get a lot of
irritation around my eye area my eyelids
were very very swollen a very very red
and then right here I was getting a lot
of Millia and those are basically the
tiny little bumps where your pores are
being caused so and that is what
definitely the first thing that I don't
like about them working Bratz is their
makeup I mean I have such a bad reaction
to practically every single product that
I tried from them I know they haven't
come out with like foundations and stuff
yet but that's pretty much why I stay
away it's just because got there I
should have held for for me
some of those spoiled cheese and there
are nice and creamy and buttery but like
their mass and stuff we're very patchy
for me I just don't think it's worth it
I really don't think it's worth it I
know everybody says it's only in $20
dollars only $15.99 is only $10.99 it's
just not worth it when your skin is
going to have such a bad reaction which
again a lot of people don't have this
sort of reaction but I personally did
this video is about my experience with
morphe alright the next thing I'll let
me talk about that I do not like it be
customer service so when I first got the
Jacqueline Hill favorite palette up both
times but ordered two separate times
it came completely shattered so
effectively every single shade in the
palette was shattered I emailed them and
it took two and a half months to get a
new palette now I understand that this
would be very sought-after palettes
because Jackson Hale herself picked out
the shades and that's not why I wanted
it I wanted it just because I liked the
color selection it was the first morphe
palette that I had ever tried out I
emailed them I called them I could not
get anybody to actually answer me and
I'm like can I get some help over here
you know and I think because it was the
first time that more teams had to deal
with a little bit of like a scandal like
that because there was again a little
bit of a scandal every time they
collapse with Jacqueline yelled as I'm
sort of like the palettes run out or you
know they don't have enough for everyone
it was just very strange to me that you
know a brand would just hide under a
rock and I felt like that's what they
did and I would just I would call I'm
gonna reach out to them I'm thinking oh
can I get a new palette and finally two
months later without them even at
contacting me back of a sent a new one
so that was super weird now the next
thing I want to talk about that I
definitely don't like about morphe is
kind of the last thing that I want to
talk about in this video and I feel like
this will kind of wrap it up I feel like
Morpheus had a very very negative
experience or negative influence I
should say on the beauty community very
negative the Morse code the morphe
sponsorships the morphe videos are so
overdone and one of the reasons why I
hate using affiliate codes and I don't
want to ever do sponsored videos on my
channel is because of like Morpheus is
not even getting in a way that they put
things together the way that they collab
with influencers is honestly rather
sickening to me I'm so sick of
opening up the description bar and
seeing a bajillion little
link's I don't give a flying your
stuff is not that good it's absolutely
ridiculous to me like I know a lot of
people do like more of you but for me
someone was a high like I have a very
high should I explain that I really like
I like good products okay so I am like
Rueda product I like good makeup I can
tell when it's good even if you guys
think I at putting on my makeup I
can tell when something is good quality
it is not good enough for the amount of
collaborations the amount of people that
they get to push these codes is
ridiculous your stuff is not good enough
your makeup is not good enough maybe
your brushes are okay but my god I mean
it's just so overdone they're a better
quality brushes out there Sigma you know
there are better luck see you know
there's so many different brands out
there and I think it's just one of those
things where I've gotten so sick of
seeing the code that got cystic I've
seen all that and that was just a
big a big thing that I don't like about
morphe they really had a bad influence
with the beauty community a lot of
people don't trust the u2r is anymore
because I'm 40 I mean it's so
sad and I know I'm just sitting here
ranting about it now but I felt like it
needed to be said and that is the last
reason why I don't like morphe so anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed it this video
like I said the one thing I do like is
their brushes other stuff I don't like
is their makeup their customer service
and the influence they have had on the
beauty community let me know what you
can down below I'd love to know if you
feel the same way if you feel
differently thanks for joining me guys
and I'll see you tomorrow
