to my channel today we're gonna be
talking about professionalism where the
 did it go where did it go with some
of these beauty brands I want to talk
about some beauty brands that have made
some really really big mistakes
on social media now I already know I'm
gonna get comments down below about how
live the Snead's very drama like it's
like a drama channel and that is not
what I'm going for in this video I've
already kind of posted about that I
wanted to make this video you know i
posted about it on instagram and a lot
of people were saying i don't want to
see this material i'm not interested and
you know what shame on you
you should know who you are purchasing
from i'm not trying to come off as a
drama channel in this video
not that there's anything wrong with
drama channels you guys know I love me
some rich likes but I will say I think
that it's very important as a consumer
for you to at least know some things
that have been said on social media it
would be very easy for me to go in and
really do a lot of research and find
certain little stupid petty things that
brands have said back and forth to each
other I'm talking about jeffree star
cosmetics bitching to Jared from Too
Faced the two of you look like little
 twats I don't care if you watch
this video I don't care if you try and
take this video down both of you are
incredibly incredibly unprofessional
when it comes to your beauty brands but
I think the majority of us know about
those dramas we know that they have gone
back and forth and said stupid little
petty things to each other so that's not
what we're gonna focus on in this video
we're gonna focus on a different sort of
things or hopefully bigger sort of
things I should say let's go ahead and
start with Tarte cosmetics and the
racial Mima that they actually posted or
reposted from style by her Bruce's
Instagram about a month ago and this is
what the meme says my brain during the
day a potato potato ching-chong tomato
no my brain at night I wonder why the
earth was placed exactly here and
allowed us to provide a perfect climate
to sustain human life they then wrote
yep
do you experience this tartlets hashtag
lol hashtag total mush hashtag repose at
styled by her Uche um first of all I
have no idea why stop Irish we're both
something like this I don't know why I
tart we post something like this this is
incredibly racist hello people and you
know when they write down here do you
experience this tartlets no I don't
 experience that it's racist what
you
said his racist it doesn't mean even if
this was in the context of a funny kind
of meme like Oh during the day I think
about all these things nighttime I
really start to think about you know
what the world means it almost kind of
it's still a racist and it doesn't
matter about who posted it it doesn't
matter if it was the intern it doesn't
matter if it was Maureen who was the CEO
of Tarte cosmetics this is inappropriate
now there are twenty two thousand three
hundred seventy-five legs when I
screenshot to this and that was after it
had been posted for maybe about I would
say ten hours and then they took it down
and then they went and they posted this
ASAP picture of a kitty cat and this one
had six thousand two hundred and
nineteen likes it says right here we
deeply apologize to anybody we affected
today it was a complete oversight and we
absolutely didn't mean to post with that
intention we removed it immediately and
spoke with the intern explaining why it
was offensive that's right go blame the
intern this is not okay this is not okay
doesn't matter who posted it there needs
to be a public apology immediately and I
don't want to see this goddamn thing of
the sad looking cat I want just
something basic I want something
simplistic I want to see that you
apologize and then you know that it was
wrong now I'm clearly not of Asian
descent but I can tell when something is
racist and I feel like now in 2017 we
should be able to see when something's
racist we should be able to put a stop
to it a lot of people noticed it but
there was still 22,000 people that
either didn't care that it was recessed
that they retweeted this or I'm sorry
reposted this or they didn't know that
it was racist it is incredibly
incredibly sad that our world has come
to this okay and I don't mean to go on a
big rampage on this but just a recess in
general is horrible even just reading
those words and reading them out loud on
camera really makes me feel sick I'm
very sad that I had to say that and read
that but I wanted you guys to be able to
see what had been said and what had been
done now a chart finally did come out
and say that they made an incredibly
ignorant a mistake by posting and that
meme and this is what did their apology
said this is from marine the CEO and
founder of Tarte cosmetics she said dear
tartlets from the bottom of my cards I
am sorry and I am embarrassed yesterday
we made a mistake by sharing an
insensitive beam with a racist term
there is no excuse before using any type
of racial slur regardless of the
texts we understand that this ignorance
has caused us to lose oil fans and we
completely understand I take full
responsibility and we thank you all for
helping us to educate our team and each
other and that was a very good apology
in my opinion but that should have come
before the second before the first
apology okay
Moran's like where the are their PR
teams you know what I'm saying like I
love you need to go and you need to
apologize you need to understand that
you were wrong you need to express that
you were wrong you cannot have a sorry
not sorry kind of apology what was this
what was sent that was wrong why was it
wrong you know you have to go into depth
and you have to explain we we didn't
understand we didn't understand our
intern didn't understand whoever it was
that posted obviously made a mistake and
this like you know this apology right
here in my opinion was sincere so anyway
I wanted to go ahead and walk you guys
through that little tart incident
because there's a lot of people that are
not going to look past this there are a
lot of people that are going to say that
was incredibly racist I don't want
anything to do with the brand so I
thought it was worth mentioning now
let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about Z palette I'm the Z palette
controversy in my opinion and definitely
there were certain parts of it that were
extremely petty I'm gonna try and leave
that out we're just gonna get to a
certain thing that was said that in my
opinion really really struck me the
wrong way and it was classism and its
finest so let's go ahead and talk about
to the Z Potter from Z palette so this
is described as a game-changing device
that expertly separates your makeup from
its original packaging and melts your
lipsticks and concealers saving you time
is saving your makeup and saving your
body parts not when this originally came
out it dug it a to retail for $85 which
is still that's a retail for $85 it
looks like it gets a five-star rating
but as usual when it comes to brands you
are always going to get complaints from
customers there was somebody that posted
on their Instagram after they released
the photo of the new Z Potter and they
said you know what that seems a little
high up there as far as price tags are
concerned but there were a few little I
would say very very petty comments that
flew back and forth you know see palette
firing back in the comments saying thank
God we don't need your money and about
time you evolved but then there was
something that was sad
and this was in response to the girl who
said hey that seems a little expensive
and they said you're in a dorm room it
may be a stretch for your budget
give customer service a call on Monday
she had basically described that she
lived in a dorm room she's obviously in
college she doesn't happen money for an
$85 little machine like that and for
them to go and say something like it may
be a stretch for your budget Oh God like
again where is your goddamn PR team you
know what I'm saying you never say that
to your customers you don't know if it's
a millionaire buying your products you
don't know if it's somebody who has
saved money for six months who's buying
your products you don't say that it
doesn't matter how much money they have
how much little money they have they are
your customers they are making you money
you shut the up when they want to
buy your product and they have a
question about it okay and there's just
certain things that you don't say and
again this is felt like classism in my
opinion it felt like prejudice against a
certain social standing and I really did
it like that that rubbed me the wrong
way and guess what I will not be
purchasing from Z palette further let me
tell you when I used to work at Sephora
as a skin care consultant when I was in
college it was always the people that
looked like they weren't going to spend
a huge amount of money that ended up
spending $5,000
they dropped money on our Glass Chanel
Dior you name it they bought it and it's
just really really inappropriate for a
brand to sit there and say oh well just
because you're in college like this is
probably gonna be out of your budget you
don't know that they're your
customers you shut up you shut up and
you don't say things like that again
where the hell is their PR team now it
does turn out that Xena who is the
founder of Z palette to come out and
issue an apology it was sort of like a
backhanded apology sort of like sorry
not sorry
again I don't appreciate that if you are
going to have a beauty brand if you were
going to have a brand in general you
don't get to be a salty little
 and this is why I will
never have a beauty brand because I am a
salty and I will strike
back I know it's not appropriate but
some people are just hot-headed it seems
like Xena is it seems like every star is
it seems like Jared is there are certain
people that just shouldn't have beauty
brands because you know what you're not
professional enough you're not
professional enough and it looks like
she did kind of fire her back and then
she issued two different apologies a lot
of people ended up actually pulling
their palettes out of their stores so I
believe that make big drop them makeup
geek drop them and
was like beauty lish or something like
that but I yeah that was a lesson to be
learned you never ever ever act like
that to a customer all right up next I
want to talk about a brand that I still
feel a little 50/50 on there have been
some posts made by ERG decay on social
media that have really really erupt me
and a lot of people the wrong way but at
the same time I believe that their brand
is kind of built on a certain a persona
you know they have the naked line and
then they have they're kind of heavy
metal' line where they're all about you
know making druggie references and even
just using the word rookie as one of
their eyeshadows if you read it far into
it which a lot of people as they would
say get triggered at which it's horrible
that triggered is something that's so
commonly used out it's a word that's so
commonly used but a lot of people say
you're overreacting just because they
name an eyeshadow druggie doesn't mean
anything but does it mean something does
it actually mean something is it okay to
reference and names like that and put
them into makeup which is such a
simplistic thing that you can wash off
at the end of the day when you're going
and you're naming your shadows these
things are you actually low-key kind of
shaking people that do have substance
abuse problems the whole naked line and
a lot of these brands that come out with
very over sexualized terms for and their
makeup products like naked skin orgasms
super or gas and deep throat underage
red which is one of Kat Von D's lipstick
shades I would love to make a video
talking about that a little further but
for me I'm right in the middle when it
comes to urban decay I do personally
still purchase from them but there was a
post that was made about some eyeliners
that they released and immediately when
I saw this I could see what it was but
some people may be dense this is a post
that they made a while back on their
sharp liquid eyeliners this is right
here our secret to looking sharp
it says razor sharp liquid eyeliner for
a quick tip check out our Instagram
story now the way that these are
swatched across at the wrists and at the
fact that they use the words sharp as
well as a razor sharp I really made
people believe that they were somewhat
referencing so hard a lot of people deal
with self-harm and a lot of people died
because of
harm and because a beauty brand is using
such terms or they're saying things that
even maybe they didn't mean to you know
what I mean
Urban Decay did come out and immediately
issued an apology saying hey we did not
mean it that way we're very sorry and I
personally think with this post it was
something that they didn't see correctly
you know they didn't really understand
okay we have the swatches here and then
using terms like sharp and razor sharp
it obviously came out the wrong way I
believe that they were sincere with
their apology I believe they didn't mean
to come back that way but when you have
a brand that is really really focused on
using such terms like that are you going
to get yourself in trouble I think
that's the biggest thing I want to talk
about so I didn't want to go ahead and
squeeze urban decay into this video just
because I think it would be fun to have
a conversation about this down below
what do you think about brands that do
over-sexualize and makeup what do you
think about brands over sexualized
makeup use over sexualized terms for
makeup what do you think about brands
that do use words like a drug you what
market something as simplistic as
eyeshadow and finally guys the last
brand I want to talk about is a Lime
Crime now I feel like Lime Crime is very
very controversial it's very hard to
look at Lime Crime and only see certain
things that were really really bad
because there's tons of petty stuff in
between but just in general their social
media presence really hasn't been it
that great I want to give you guys some
examples of things that have happened
with Lime Crime funny and now if I
actually think Lime Crime does have some
good products their eyeshadows are
pretty good I used to like their liquid
lipsticks until I found out that they
were being investigated by the FDA for
allegedly having some sort of dangerous
chemicals inside of their liquid
lipsticks but funny enough they're
actually now sold on the Ulta home
website and I would love to know what
you guys think of that down below
because for me
I was really really surprised when I saw
that Ulta wanted to pick them up and put
them in store and online but anyway the
first thing I want to talk about is the
issue of cultural appropriation for the
giant china doll palette so they had a
palette i'll call b china doll palettes
where they had a woman and she had
basically kind of like a Geisha
painted a face going on a lot of people
were very very upset
because it just didn't look right you
know what I mean you had a Caucasian a
woman kind of dressed as a Geisha and it
just seemed like overall the whole
entire pallet was kind of put together
in a strange way so that was the first
thing that people were talking about
some people really thought the others
were reading too far into that and some
people believe that it was cultural
appropriation that's up for you to
decide another issue was doe deer who is
the founder of Lyme crime I did address
office Adolph Hitler one year for
Halloween and this was just shortly
after she had actually started the
company but I don't know how these
people are just so stupid that you would
actually post a picture like that on
social media or you would just take a
picture like that or even go to a
Halloween party dressed as Adolf Hitler
that is obviously incredibly incredibly
important taste okay and I don't care if
you're just a regular person who doesn't
own and makeup company or if you own a
makeup company don't do stupid
things like that okay up next we have
lime crime and denying the fact that
their web site had been hacked and they
have identity thieves that came onto
their website and they are they
basically deny that this happened for
three weeks straight now a lot of people
lost a lot of money their credit cards
were hacked and a lot of people still
haven't gotten their money back and
Lankaran literally denied that they even
had a hacking on their web site for
three weeks which is absolutely
ridiculous if you've been hacked you
need to let people know you need to
apologize you need to try and do what
you can to help them and unfortunately
they didn't do any of that and then like
I said the velvetine lipstick formula
has been investigated by the FDA for
having chemicals in its that are just
not as good as they say it makes you
wonder if they're really cruelty free if
they're really vegan and it just makes
you wonder a whole lot about the brand
so anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for joining me I
tried to film this a video in a tasteful
way without getting too involved in the
drama there is always drama going on and
everybody does make mistakes but I think
it's a really really big deal to look at
them and see who can own up and fess up
to their mistakes and actually give a
genuine apology and who cannot it says a
lot about a brand and yeah that's pretty
much it I'd love to know what you guys
think down below thank you so much for
joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
