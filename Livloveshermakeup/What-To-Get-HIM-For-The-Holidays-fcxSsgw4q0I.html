thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be what to get him
through the holidays so basically a
holiday gift guide Oh for men now I want
to say right off the bat before I get
into this I am NOT an expert when it
comes to getting gifts to for men you
guys requested this video and i thought
i would share with you guys basically
what i'm getting for my brother this
year and then also tom so my brother is
definitely a lot different than Tom he's
a lot more laid back and then Tom's
really into really techie stuff so I
kind of thought that I could hit up that
whole like a mesh of man basically so
you have some guys that are a little
more laid back some that are into more
like techy high-end kind of stuff so
yeah let's go ahead and jump right into
it so the first thing I want to
recommend for holiday gift guide as far
as men are concerned are definitely gift
cards I feel like you can never go wrong
with gift cards you guys because let's
be honest during the holidays it's
really hard to tell what somebody wants
unless they have like an Amazon gift
list or wish list or whatever it's
called so these are gift cards here to
Trader Joe's and also target I am
filling this up for three hundred
dollars for my brother for target
because I'm like well why the hell you
know I mean I feel like everybody goes
to target you can get food there you can
get toilet paper there you can get
whatever you need there so that is the
first thing I want to recommend is gift
cards if you really don't know what to
get them the second thing that I want to
recommend is a Keurig so I don't have
mine here to share with you guys just
because it's so big and heavy but we've
recently got a new keurig it is the two
point oh so it's like the newest latest
version and basically I feel like a lot
of people drink coffee and even if you
don't drink a lot of coffee actually Tom
doesn't drink a lot of coffee which is
very weird because he's a doctor you
think he would want caffeine but what he
likes is that also just has a hot water
dispenser he loves tea so you can drink
tea with that you can drink coffee you
can do whatever you want i feel like a
curing is a great great great gift and
then also i want to recommend it at home
brewing kit for beer so that is another
gift that I'm getting my brother I found
this little kit on amazon I will go
ahead and link it down below for you
guys it's not an affiliate link or
anything like that it's just basically a
fifty-dollar kit where they can put
together their own beer and my brother
loves beer so I really think that he is
going to enjoy that the next thing I
want to recommend is actually a candle
so this is funny because this is
probably the only candle that I feel
like Tom actually really does enjoy now
he does put
with me burning 3-wood Campbell's all
over the place in the apartment but this
one right here is from the brand
archaeology and we found this at Target
and I have walked in on him lighting
this damn candle like I don't think I've
ever seen him light a candle so this is
the number five urban and number five
grapefruit and lemon grass candle and
like I said I got this for about ten
dollars at target I think one of the
reasons he likes it is because it's very
sleek it's black so if you do have a guy
who likes fragrances and he wants a more
like manly looking candle instead of
something with like a picture of a
cranberry on it and then i would highly
recommend looking into that branch right
there also I'm something that I got him
last year was this little bossy speaker
this is called the Soundlink mini and
when he was studying for his medical
boards he was listening to like audio
tapes and things like that so he would
program it through this little mini
speaker and basically you can just go
ahead and pack this into your bag you
can bring this on trips with you and he
really likes this so yeah this is the
Soundlink mini it is a little more on
the pricey side but he uses it all the
time so really enjoy that and I know
that he likes that a lot um if you
really want to get your guy into
cleaning his face and things like that
something that's actually quite cute and
if they are into taking care of their
skin is to get them a clarisonic and
then a matching cleanser so and this one
right here is Tom's clarisonic this is
the aria so they do have clarisonic that
obviously come in manly colors like
black and gray so this is what the aria
looks like and he just uses the cashmere
brush head and then I got him this not
so long ago this is the clinic for men
of face wash and I noticed that he
reaches for this mote more than he
reaches for any other cleanser and I'm
pretty sure it has to do with the
packaging so the packaging is obviously
just like this slate gray color and I
feel like it looks a little more manly
he really likes this it's a very very
basic face wash it's not going to
irritate them if they've been shaving
and things like that on their face so
would highly recommend that as well the
next thing i want to recommend is a
deodorant and cologne pairing i was
going to say a perfume pairing though a
deodorant any cologne appearing so one
that Tom really loves his favorite scent
is aqua di gio this is from Armani so he
has this and then he has the column so
you can go ahead and match those two up
something that I got him last year was
spice-bomb from Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf this is
what it looks like this is a really
really amazing smelling cologne you guys
it's actually a unisex n so if you want
to go ahead and wear it yourself
can but yeah I really really like this
and I did get him a matching Cologne and
that's actually what I got my brother
last year as well so if you want to get
them that that would be adorable also my
favorite cologne that he wears is the EC
miyake this is what it looks like the
smells incredible i also got him to
matching Cola a deodorant for the throne
as well and this one just smelled
absolutely incredible and then if you
don't want to purchase a full-size you
can't get these smaller little bottles
here for like half the price this is
armani code and again i got this at
sephora i got all of these at sephora so
would highly recommend that i feel like
you can't go wrong with the cologne and
also a deodorant sparing alright the
next thing i want to recommend is a
watch so i just have two of Tom's here
to show you guys I don't even know
really what these are there just watches
so this is one of his watches and this
is another one of his watches he just
left a bunch of stuff out for me to show
you guys so I'm actually getting him the
Apple watch this year for Christmas he
doesn't know so I hope he's not watching
this video but I feel like you can never
go wrong with a watch so any kind of
watch that you want to buy either if
it's like a little more fancy looking
like this or even just like one that's
kind of like a stopwatch and can also um
you know track like your steps and all
that kind of stuff any sort of thing
like that even a Fitbit I think would be
a really really great gift for a guy
another thing that I want to recommend
is a universal remote Tom and I use this
all the time this is our logitech
universal remote so we watch as you guys
can see Apple TV and also we have a ps4
or tom has the ps4 a PlayStation so yeah
that is basically something that can
control everything it can even control
like the speaker so you can set it up to
the little bosie speaker if you want to
get that Anna we really like this and
actually I really like this I got this
for him for christmas as well last year
and honestly it has been great it really
can control absolutely everything on the
TV anything around you and it's just a
really really great gift and then
finally I also want to recommend
something for just like sanitary kind of
things is a electric razor a Tom shaved
his face every single morning with this
and I feel like you really can't go
wrong with this is the Bronwyn and I
don't know what version this is or
anything like that it says series number
seven but this is what it looks like
it's very manly looking and you don't
actually have to put shaving cream on
and do all that kind of stuff he just
turns it on and he shakes his face every
single morning so would recommend that
if you have a boyfriend who's more in a
professional environment and
maybe he just can't let go to work with
like a full on beard or things like that
and also if you do have a boyfriend in
the medical field I feel like this looks
like crap it's got water stains all over
it but if you have a boyfriend in the
medical field like I do um Thomas
obsessed with washing his hands if you
guys are wondering why I go through so
much frickin soap every month it is
because Thomas obsessed with washing his
hands so this is the simple human hand
dispenser and i'm going to show you guys
you put your hand underneath and it
literally spurts the soap out so anyway
he really likes that because he's
constantly constantly washing his hands
you guys so i would highly recommend
checking that out and finally if you
really don't know what to get your man
it's kind of a joke you guys but at the
same time and no man is not going to
like this this is a little trophy right
here that says world's greatest lover so
anyway guys those are my holiday gift
guide ideas for men I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for joining
me and I will see you guys later for my
20k holiday giveaway bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
