my shoulder like this and this one is no
exception is huge and lovely it is from
JustFab calm I do the monthly

unboxing videos from them I never really
thought of doing that because you get to
pick your own stuff but if you guys want
to see that let me know so this is the
bag this one is called illuminates and I
believe they have it in black maybe blue
and then this nice like peachy cream
