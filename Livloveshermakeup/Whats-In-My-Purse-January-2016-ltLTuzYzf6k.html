last year in january i posted a whats in
my purse video so i thought i would just
make a little trend out of it on my
channel and go ahead and post it what's
in my purse video every january so here
i am for january 2016 with my purse and
i'm going to show you guys what's in
here so yes this is my processes from
justfab.com it is 3995 i will link below
where you guys can pick it up if you're
interested i'm on their subscription the
thing like monthly subscription plan
where basically i get a new bag from
them every single month which is a lot
of purses I know um so I do a regular
like seasonal decluttering of purses and
I end up giving them a lot like a lot of
them to friends you can have to skip a
month and just they don't like charge
you or anything like that so that's
another thing you can do or they give
you credit and if you have like clothing
and oh they have cute shoes as well I
get a lot of shoes from them as well but
anyway i'm not affiliated with them in
any way this video is not sponsored or
whatever so i will link below again not
an affiliate link but i just wanted to
show you guys what the purse is so yes
it's from just wrap comments a beautiful
slate gray color and I know it's huge um
I did like I said I did one of these
last year at this time and I showed a
purse that was out so really big and my
boyfriend's always like why'd you carry
such a big purse like it looks so
strange i'm really short and 52 so he's
like why do you carry such a big person
looks weird because you're so small and
i'm just like i like big purses i carry
a lot of random with me so anyway i
have not cleared this out whatsoever so
let's just get started um the first
thing that is in here is my lilly
pulitzer agenda this is the extra large
one i love this i basically write
everything in here this is the august
2015 through december 2016 agenda it's
amazing i love it if you guys would like
me to do a video on like how I organize
my life with my agenda I could
definitely do that alright i also have
the simple flute this is a book by
michelle duboce he's a you just like so
obviously if you're not a musician or a
flutist you probably wouldn't get a kick
out of this but i do i like it so i've
been reading that I also
some weird it I have one of these little
stuffed animals in there I don't know
why I have an obsession if you guys saw
my beauty room tour I love these little
stuffed animals have big eyes for
whatever reason oops so I have like a
bunch of these I have like really really
big ones that I sleep with at night and
then I have like a little mini ones I've
no idea why this is in my purse but
anyway this little guys need is spells
and he has big blue sparkly eyes I know
my boyfriend thinks these are so creepy
but I think they're so cute um but yeah
I threw him in the wash with a king
shirt and he turned a little pink but
he's still really cute I have no idea
why zimmer thurs probably take him out
and anyway the next thing I have in here
are hot hands hand warmers and hot hands
foot warmers if you live in antarctica
like I do I'm scared don't live in
Antartica i live in Milwaukee Wisconsin
but in the Midwest it gets very very
cold here like below zero during the
winter so these are really nice you
stick these into your boots and then you
can stick these ones into your gloves or
mittens so I like those a lot the next
thing I have is this little quotes
journal um anytime I see a nice quote or
something i will write it in here I got
this at barnes and noble i think it's
really really cute house a little
bookmark as well so i love that i have a
bunch of these it really should organize
this a bunch of these emergency
raspberry dietary supplements they're
basically just like for your immune
system if you feel like you're coming
down with something I basically have a
shitty immune system so anytime I feel
like I'm gonna get a flare-up or
something like that or i feel like i'm
getting a cold i will drink one of these
you just mix it into water and actually
they give you a really nice boost of
energy so they are nice throughout the
day so i carried like four or five of
those with me in my purse yeah here's
another one and then here i have the it
cosmetics by jamie Curran this is the
bye bye pores poor Liz finishing HD
micro powder in translucent I like to
use this to touch up my makeup
throughout the day if I'm getting oily I
just used a little like puffs that comes
with it and I'll push it into my skin
and it really makes my makeup just look
nice again so I do enjoy that I also
have this little lip balm here from tony
moly it's the
peach lip balm I carry that around with
me as well it's super super cute and it
smells amazing yeah it smells super
super good i've used quite a bit of that
and it's nice because it doesn't leave
your lips kind of shiny too so it's not
just like a lip balm it does nothing it
makes them look pretty and shiny alright
and then i have this i also had this in
my purse last year it's my little crazy
cat lady um purse with in a purse a
little pouch thing and I just carry a
bunch of random in here I have this
hairbrush that's really really cute I
got that from forever 21 I have a little
poo pourri this is the lavender vanilla
scent these are nice when you are using
the bathroom at someone else's house um
I have a little mirror from forever 21
as well I like it because I have a
magnifying inside on one side will yeah
it's really really close up but it's
nice it's like a magnified side of one
and then just a regular one on the other
I have a pocket back in frosted
cranberry from Bath and Body Works I
love just heaven can gel or hand
sanitizer all the time I have the tacos
Victoza taka this is the Cleopatra
grapefruit and cucumber hand cream I
like this a lot it's a very very nice
smells really really good and then I
have like a bajillion jolly ranchers
these are my favorite candy ever so they
have to be in my purse at all times I
have this band-aid friction block if you
wear heels or anything like that
especially for work if I have a gig I
will go ahead and wear my regular
clothes throughout the day when I'm
teaching and then if I have a gig at
night I will pack my heels into my purse
which is another reason why I like to
have a big purse and then I will put
this on my heels so that I don't get any
sort of blisters and then I have a tide
to go stain removing pen in here these
actually work they're amazing another
pocket back this is about done this is
an iced white cranberry the scent
actually gave me a huge headache
everybody was like oh what is that scent
and at first it did bother me but then
it started to bother me i have an EOS
hand cream this isn't the blossom one I
have a little perfume sample that's
basically done and you just exchange it
out it's the DKNY be delicious skin and
then
that is what is in that little pouch
show you guys all of that and then let's
see here I have a hair brush with tons
of air on it pretty gross that is a boar
bristle brush it's really really nice
because it really kind of smoothes the
cuticle out there nice I have my wallet
I got this from I think the place is
called icing I got it in the mall was
really really cheap it was like five
dollars I liked it because it was very
classic looking and let's see here I
have my phone with my little phone case
that does the picking get it to work it
has sparkles that are supposed to
trickle down but it started stuck in one
place because it's freezing here and add
up the Arctic i know that in and our
tech pack alright i always carry my nail
polish that i'm wearing that week in my
purse in case i need to touch them up
which i do i need to really really
really really I need it to my god that's
like really bad i really need to paint
my nails so this is the trust fund nail
polish in champagne problems i love this
color it's beautiful but i don't want
you guys to see my nails though but you
can see the actual color it's beautiful
and it goes on opaque in one coat so i
will touch those up after this and then
the last thing I have wait no it's not
flashing I have my keys I have my car
key I have my hufflepuff badge because I
don't know I feel like if I were going
to be put into a harry potter house it
would be buckled up and that's what my
boyfriend says to you guys let me know
what you think and then i have the key
for my apartment and then that is like
everything in there but i know there's
one little pouch the way public i don't
really want to go through this one but
it's okay whatever um I have little pads
just in case you never know girl you
never know it's good to have these with
you these ones already u by kotex

two little tiny tampons in here as well
