thank you so much for joining me i'm
doing a different kind of video today
i'm doing a what's in my shower video so
i've been watching a lot of these i
think they're really fun i'm kind of
nosy and I like knowing that people have
in their shower what they're using so
that's what I'm going to show you guys
this is my shower this is my shower
curtain we got this at target I had a
really really girly shower curtain when
I was in Manhattan living alone but now
I live with my boyfriend so we picked up
a shower curtain that we both kind of
liked and we thought looked like I don't
know it's like girly and guy eat at the
same time anyway so i'm going to show
you guys the book is in my shower so we
have some products up there and then we
have these little shelves that hold
certain things and on this side too so i
will just get started I'm gonna stand up
on the tub so i can get up here and show
you guys the first thing we have here is
a loofah I like this it's really cute
it's like orange and yellow I think we
got it at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and then
this is my boyfriend's clarisonic this
is the clarisonic aria and it's the
black one obviously and then I have a
declara sonic Mia or is it the mia 2
no it's just the clarisonic mia and it's
in the pink one and we both have the
same brush heads we use the lux brushes
or the lux brush heads we really like
those i have a little conair like wet
hair brush here i like to comb through
my conditioners when I have them in my
hair in the shower so I can help with
tangles then I have a little pink soap
holder i just have like an orange cream
soap in there right now smells really
good not the orange cream up here I have
some shampoos this is my John Frieda
sheer blonde color correct cleansing
treatment i'm almost done with this this
is just okay it is definitely not the
best purple shampoo I've ever used I'll
show you guys what I like best in a
minute but I'm going to use it off its
ok and then back here i have a shampoo
from OGX or the organic spray on that
used to be called organics there OGX now
this is the Sunkist blonde lemon
highlight shampoo I really really like
this it has a really really nice scent
to it and yeah right here we have our
clarifying shampoos i use the suave
daily clarifying shampoo it says that it
deep cleanses for normal to oily hair
and then my boyfriend likes that this
one right here this is the Neutrogena
anti residue formula i'm in back I have
a twilight woods bubble bath from Bath
and Body Works that's almost used up
holy be using that up pretty soon and
then over here I have my purple
conditioner i use i like to use this
once a week with my purple shampoo this
is the shiny silver ultra color
enhancing conditioner this is the best
uh you know a purple conditioner i found
it's from one and only and its really
really cheap and cheerful this is also
really cheap and cheerful and it's my
favorite purple shampoo this is the
jermack distinctions silver plus ageless
shampoo for gray blonde bleached or
highlighted hair that is what i use once
a week or and maybe not once a week but
maybe every two weeks when my hair is
looking a little
dull and I want to kind of amp up the
color I have this little bikini zone
anti bumps shave gel here for your
bikini line you can also use it like in
your armpits or anywhere that gets a
little sensitive then I have a glazed
Apple bath jelly up here from the body
shop and then a body scrub I'm working
through right now is the derma dr KP
duty I use this all over my body and my
boyfriend uses it on his arms because he
does have KP on his arms or Pateros
polaris or whatever it's called it's
like the little bumps you get on your
forearms alright so here we have our
cleansers the cleanser my boyfriend uses
in the morning is the clinic from n face
wash it's just very basic there is
nothing too harsh in it and then the one
he likes at night time with his
clarisonic is the peter thomas roth
anti-aging cleansing gel he likes this a
lot but he said next time um you know
when he is done with this which he
almost is he's going to pick up the rose
stem cell one and then for me I've been
using the clean and clear morning burst
facial cleanser with bursting beads it
says it wakes you up but rinses clean
with vitamin C and ginseng I've been
using that this is a new product for me
this week I'm absolutely loving it but
that is what i use in the morning and
then at night with my clarisonic i have
been using the oven cleaner or cleaning
on shell clean off no it's not clean on
Sid it's just clean us gel and this is
from a vein and I got this in my arm
allure beauty box so I really really
like that and then down here i have my
summer's eve cleansing wash ladies you
got to clean that downstairs area this
is nice because its pH balance this one
is only or this scent is only a target
it is the aloe loved one it's really
really nice very fresh smelling going to
come over here down here um this is the
shampoo that my boyfriend uses it is the
head-and-shoulders two-in-one purely
purely gentle scalp karen has Ella beer
in it he loves anything with aloe vera
and then right here i have my hydrate
plus repair argan oil of morocco miracle
leave-in or a miracle in shower oil from
OGX or organics i mix this in with my
shampoo and i wash my hair it gives just
a little extra moisture boost right here
we have
body washes that we use the one I am
going through right now that will
probably be in this month's empties
because I'm almost done is the bath and
Bodyworks pear berry with Shea and
vitamin E it's really really nice and
then the one that my boyfriend likes and
continues to purchase every single time
he runs out is the Olay ultra moisture
with shea butter he really really likes
that he tends to have kind of dry skin
so that's why he likes that one and then
up there I have a razor I like to trade
between using a mens razor which are
really nice it has like five blades in a
super sharp and I go between that and my
chick intuition which I also really
really love but the razor heads are
really really expensive so I like to
switch off monthly and then up here i
have my gillette venus plus ol a violet
swirl shave cream this is new to me i
love it and then right up there is where
my conditioner is for now because it's
one of those huge like liter bottles it
is the redken all soft conditioner so
anyway that was the what's in my shower
video I hope you guys enjoyed this if
