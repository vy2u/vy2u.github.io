all having a wonderful morning i'm up
quite early because it is storming here
and the thunder was so loud i could not
sleep so what did i do I of course went
on to the sephora.com website so that i
could just empty out my bank account and
give them all my money but in all
seriousness seriously that is what I do
when I'm bored I go on to the Sephora
website and I happen to notice that when
I was on there I really didn't have a
lot of my love list I had a few items
that were remaining from the vib sale
like the what is this the Nirvana
hydrating this from josie maran and also
the Estee Lauder revitalizing supreme
global anti-aging cream which is still
sold out it says it's no longer
available in the u.s. so I should
probably just take that off the list but
I'm gonna wait a little longer I still
have the Laura Mercier fresh fig wash on
there and the drunk elephant be Hydra
intensive hydration gel and then I do
have the Tsubaki deep hydration
sleeping mask in the oly henriksen the
clean truth arose class on there but
then everything else is new and I
thought it'd be fun to walk you guys
through what I'm kind of interested in
and what you may be seen in my upcoming
halls so let's go ahead and get started
the first item that I have a lot of
interest in and I thought this was
completely like done I i know this is
limited edition and i thought that this
sold out but anyway it happened yet this
is the burberry spring / summer 2016
runway pallets it you to get let's see
here zero point three ounces of product
in here it's huge like the reviews i
have seen it looks amazing this is a
beautiful opalescent sort of highlighter
it does have a beach delay formulation
from what i can see and it looks like it
is very very similar to the glowing
gardens like illuminator from do our
which i love but this is in the shade
optic white number 01 and yeah it's $68
but that is definitely on my list
because i do have a cool undertone i
feel like that would be nice on my skin
alright another sort of high lady
products i have on here is the bare
minerals invisible like translucent
powder duo I wanted to wait till this
came to sephora i did see it on the
house are just bit my tongue i did see
it on the altar com-web say first but i
prefer the points and the perks with
Sephora so i like to purchase from here
but anyway it looks very nice it is $32
and if they're comparable to the
hourglass products i think that would be
awesome so maybe i'll do like a showdown
video
when I do end up picking that up and
then of course they always have a really
gross water balance eNOS waiting on hold
to go because honestly I have picked up
some facial mist from so for that I've
not been too pleased with I am liking I
should say like and I'm not gonna say
loving I am liking the new Olli
henriksen ones they are they're quite
tacky and sticky on the face and I don't
like that I do think they're really
nicely priced I will go more in depth
and do a review on those probably
sometime next week but yeah I don't know
I'm nothing really compares to Major
League rosewater balancing best and i
recently also picked up the herbivore
coconut rose hydrating 10 I didn't like
that either and was had shitty
ingredients so I don't know I've just
been kind of disappointed lately with
facial mist from Sephora so I'm just
gonna go back to that baby all right and
then the next item I have here is the
foreo luna this is the mini it is ninety
nine dollars so i do you have a
clarisonic I've had a clarisonic since I
was 17 years old when they first
released I've got really into skin care
when I was 16 or 17 years old and I did
all this research and I wanted to be at
dermatologist and all this kind of stuff
so I got very excited about declare
sonic i love the clarisonic still now i
have the little i think it's the mia to
mia one I don't know it's cute little
colorful one I just find that after
using it for so many years it doesn't do
that much for my skin anymore now the
difference between this for a oh and the
actual clarisonic is that the clarisonic
has the little interchanging bristles
and basically six foliated your skin and
cleansing the foreo has these little um
I guess they're like silicone like bud
they're like little tiny baby fingers or
something you could say you know they're
like these little grippy things that
basically stimulate collagen flow and
blood flow to your face so that would be
very nice for anti-aging and then the
clarisonic would be nice for deep
cleaning so that is on my list i'm very
interested in that the next item that i
picked up but was the purity I'm made
simple from philosophy this is one of
the cleansers that you can use like on
your brushes or on your face I've heard
so many people talk about it so I
finally was like I'm just going to go
ahead and pick it up so yeah I am going
to pick that up at some point and I
recently discovered these pharmacy NASA
literally yesterday I tried out the one
that I got in my boxee term for the
month and I was like oh my god they
such a cool consistency to them and
they're not like these sephora facemask
where it's like an actual sheet or paper
these are actually gel and I feel like
they really adhere to the skin so the
ones that I picked up that I want to get
a three pack our of our the pharmacy
hydrating coconut gel mask these are the
anti-wrinkle ones in rhubarb I feel like
when I don't get enough sleep at my
under eye area looks really really crazy
like really really bad and just like
very wrinkly and horrible and lately
it's been looking like that because I've
been so tired I haven't been sleeping
very well hold on put my legs down but
yeah I just thought that these would be
nice too because I need some anti-aging
in my skin is what I'm trying to say all
right I have a few more of the Sephora
collection I'm asked I do love the
pomegranate one and I love the rose won
a lot but they have a new one that I do
want to try it and that is the let's see
here what does that say LGI mass was
supposed to be like revitalizing and
cooling and then i recently tried out a
sample of this and i'm just like how do
i did i do that because this is
expensive this is an 81 dollar serum
from Clarence this is the shaping facial
lift hotel the contouring serum and it
is beautiful it is absolutely stunning
there was a product from Clarins that I
tried out it was like the firming lifter
sir one minute lift or something I hated
that it felt so strange on my skin but
this smells beautiful it has a wonderful
consistency very very similar to one of
my favorites of like my all-time
favorite serum which is the bare
minerals skin longevity vital power
infusion and I just love it it's a
beautiful product so I do you want a
full size of that and then since i am
using up a full size of the bare
minerals skin longevity vital power
infusion the next one would be the only
henriksen a truth serum I go back and
forth between the two of those those are
my all time favorite serums so I'm
looking out the window and looking at
these deathclaws and unlike when you're
gonna come for me tornado huh all right
and the next item I have here is a nail
polish and I don't even know if it's
picking up on camera but this is
gorgeous this is the colored curators
sanya richards-ross addition this nail
polish is so beautiful I just need this
peachy rose gold sort of shade all right
I do you want to pick up one juicy
Lancome shaker I know that sounds silly
like really just one but yes I only want
to get the one that has like the cherry
flavor and the like cheery color they
all look really really cute but this one
is called cherry symphony first of all
symphony so
and then the actual flavor is cherry pop
and I think that like you know I feel
like Reds look good on me and it's just
one of those colors I don't have to
think about and these are supposed to be
very hydrating and easy to wear so I
thought that that particular color I
cannot speak I thought that particular
color would be the best one for me to
try out first if I love them then maybe
I'll just have to get all of them all
rights and then I have a few of Rose
perfumes that have been recommended by
you guys the first is the Juicy Couture
Viva La Juicy rose a and look at that
bottle isn't that amazing you guys know
I love anything rose-scented it's like
my favorite scent ever so I definitely
want to try that one out or the viktor
and rolf flowerbomb levia angles on
clothes Olivia Hallows sorry I had to
but yes this is what it looks like and
it looks like it's sold out I probably
would get all three of these to be
completely honest but probably just buy
them separately because look at those
price tags and then the last one is
supposed to be the best one this is the
Khloe from a roses do Chloe or just yeah
Chloe and this is Rosita Chloe and this
is supposed to smell like straight up
roses so I'm super excited for that and
as that is the guys you guys have seen
the other items that were in my love's
list and this is the new little
collection and edition so I'm excited um
to definitely get these because i'm sure
that i will be picking them up and yeah
i plan on doing these kind of videos
probably every two to three months when
i change up my actual little loves list
thanks for joining you guys and i will
see you later for my videos in the heart
of files bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
