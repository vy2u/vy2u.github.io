today's video is going to be an updated
what is on my current loves list at
Sephora it is 2017 and I thought you
know what this is a great time to show
you guys some new items that I have
popped onto the list so let's go ahead
and jump right into it if the first item
that I have on the list is the lava nila
seven days of deodorant this is seven
full sizes of the LA vanilla deodorant
for only $42 which is ridiculous the
actual sense that you are getting here
are fresh vanilla lemon vanilla
blackberry pure vanilla which is the one
I have right now vanilla grapefruit you
are also getting vanilla coconut vanilla
passion fruit and vanilla lavender which
is amazing so very very excited for that
I probably will be scooping that up next
time I loves list I'm really interested
in this peter thomas roth listen to this
this is called the water drench
hyaluronic cloud cream like yeah I want
to cloud on my face this has I believe a
30-percent yeah thirty percent
hyaluronic acid cream so this is really
gonna bind in that moisture into your
skin which i think is amazing so I'm
very excited I would love to go ahead
and pick that up I do have some other
moisturizers I need to get through
before I scoop that up but that is
definitely something I'm interested in
next we have the Sephora collection pro
dimensional highlighting palettes they
have two different versions a cool in a
warm this is $42 I believe these are
cream products now this may stay on my
love's list or it may go as you guys can
see this is getting five stars on these
sephora.com website right now which is
really good I want to see a review
before I decide on it but basically you
get for different cream I think they're
cream highlights this is the warm
version if you are curious but the
actual shades are called lunar glaze
cosmic glaze Nova pulser and what was
that say chromosphere so anyway I think
these look really really beautiful and
obviously they are getting amazing
amazing reviews on the sephora.com
website so let me know if you pick that
up and if you like it I may have to
scoop that up i also am interested in
these new stila magnificent metals
glitter and glow liquid eye shadows i'm
just going to try out one to start
because they are twenty four dollars a
piece so the shade that i'm interested
in is called smokey storm which is a
light pewter and silver doesn't that
look beautiful it was really hard to
choose between this one this one this
one which looks amazing and
Swan but I feel like I have so many
colors like kitten and also rose gold so
I thought I'd go with the puter shade
and I feel like for my cool toned
complexion that will look quite nice so
excited for that also support collection
released this holy sheet set and this is
basically just a bunch of sheet mass and
things like that it's only forty-eight
dollars for all of these so inside of
here you are getting four face masks and
algae pomegranate rose in orchid you are
getting for eye mask in lotus LG orchid
and avocado to hand maps in avocado and
aloe vera to foot mass in lavender and
almond you are getting a charcoal no
strip before sleeping mask in Rose pearl
pomegranate and Lotus the yuzu cleansing
wipes is an excuse me and they use do
cleansing bikes and also the charcoal
exfoliating bikes so I have a lot of
favorites in here I'm not a huge fan of
their face mask but I don't mind you get
so much in here so I definitely would
not mind going ahead and picking that up
alright but that is currently out of
stock the next item here is something
that you guys told me about or I think
one or two of you did this is the new
sunday riley CEO antioxidant protect and
repair moisturizer this is $65 I believe
it does have a nice a whopping dose of
vitamin C in there really really want to
try this out they say it is good for
normal oily combination dry and
sensitive skin the reviews are not so
great so far so we shall see how that
goes i would love to go ahead and pick
that up i also have an eye cream on here
that I used years ago when I was in
college and I remember it being amazing
this is the Bobby Brown extra repair eye
cream this is $72 which is ridiculous
it's more like a really thick kind of
bomb but I remember loving this so i
thought i would go ahead and pick one of
those up next we have the st edit gritty
and globe magnetic I and face palette
I've heard everybody raving about these
recently I've seen them on camera they
look incredible this is the gritty
pellet as you can see and it's not
actually gritty all these are like a
satiny kind of texture and this is the
glow now these can be used on your
cheeks as well look at that color right
there right there yes for the cheeks
like yes so anyway very very excited I
would love to go ahead and pick that up
and obviously this is just me showing
you guys what's on my love list not
saying I'm going to pick all of these up
at once but these are items that are
definitely on there that you probably
will see an upcoming halls also the best
of me cosmetics this is the brightening
face powder trio set for $25 it seems
like you get
pretty nice amount of product in each
one of these emilynoel83 was raving
about this little set I think it's a
great deal so when that comes back and
stock him to try and pick it up the losi
tag cleansing and softening shower oil
with almond oil oh my god it's $25 which
I actually think is very much worth it I
tried this out recently and it is
absolutely incredible and beautiful you
guys it really really really is amazing
so I need this right now for my dry skin
honestly my skin is like dry right now
it's not even combo it's just straight
up dry so I would love to try that out
another item is the coda Lee grape water
I am very interested in trying this out
as my next kind of setting spray or not
setting spray the facial spray you guys
know I love facial spray so gonna try
that out and then the last couple items
are ones that you guys have probably
seen before these were items that I've
had on my list for a while d bosha
Tsubaki deep hydration sleeping mask the
sunday riley title brightening enzyme
water cream i would probably get this
one before the CEO then we have the
clean reserved blonde rose travel spray
chloe my little roses take slow a
perfume and also laura mercier flawless
skin nourishing rose oil so anyway those
are some new items that are up on my
love's list that i'm looking forward to
