this video is going to be part 2 of my
first impressions on these two love
story foundations I have had them on now
for 8 hours I have these Giorgio
Armani's luminous silk foundation in you
sheet number 2 on it the left side of my
face and the YSL fusion ink foundation
in be shaded b10 porcelain on the right
side of my face so let me show you guys
what time it is
it is currently 9:40 p.m. and I did
apply these at about 150 this afternoon
so almost 8 hours here that I have been
wearing them but let me do you guys in
so you can see it what my face is
looking like alright so here is what my
face is currently looking like I guess
we will go ahead and start with you
Giorgio Armani side I love the way that
this wore it definitely started to come
off a little bit I am one of those
people like you can see around my nose
boards I am one of those people that you
know I've definitely a little more oily
or combination skin but I do get more
dry during the winter time and I feel
like this did start to get a little oily
around my nose and things like that if I
go like this you guys can see the
foundation is rubbing off but to be fair
I forgot to put most of it on my nose
this morning when I was applying the
Armani so most of the foundation that's
wiping off right now is actually the YSL
but for the most part I thought it were
pretty darn beautifully I love the way
this goes on at first if you guys saw
the application video which I will go
ahead and link down below it looked
amazing really really great coverage
I love how seamless it is on the skin
and for the most part I feel like it
stayed on relatively well now the wires
outside I know if you guys can tell this
is looking really really patchy on my
skin I'm assuming I've been even closer
this is looking at quite patchy on my
skin I just don't think it looks good it
looks very very drying especially around
my hairline as well and to be fair it
did get dry over here with the luminous
silk as well around the outer perimeter
of my face but I don't feel like this
foundation wore that well I feel like if
I wipe I actually get the foundation off
on my finger I do feel well no I don't
really feel the same way about the
Armani from me personally I feel like
the Armani stayed on a lot better so
yeah that is what my face is looking
like I think if you have really really
oily skin you would like dyf ala more
because this does have a more matte
finish to it which I was not expecting
this is supposed to be more of like a
water-based foundation so I did not see
that coming but I
only thinks that it is one of those
foundations that is better for those of
you with combat oily skin if you are dry
or severely dry I would highly recommend
the Giorgio Armani even on my combo skin
I thought that is satin really
beautifully throughout the day so again
here is what my skin is looking like so
here is New Jersey or Armani side and
then here is the YSL so yeah that is it
guys that is my first impressions part -
I will definitely play with these
foundations more I did apply them today
with being sponges and also with this
little primer right here and I
definitely think that they held up
pretty darn well for a foundation that
is meant more for like drier skin but
they're not like the most long wearing
foundations I've ever used on my face
but I really do like the Armani I will
play with the YSL some more some people
were telling me to apply this with a
brush or even my fingertips I don't like
the applicator on a Zyl whatsoever but
yeah hands down Armani is winning as of
right now so thank you so much for
joining me guys and yes I think I will
see you tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
