channel instead of shop and swatch my
stash today I am sharing with you guys
my huge ass Sephora vib sale haul I did
pick up quite a few products I picked up
some stuff from Stila I picked up a lot
of stuff from NARS because NARS is one
of those brands that I never ever like
try new products from so I picked up a
lot of gnar stuff I have a lot of
primers and then I also have a lot of
lip products so we're gonna kind of
separate it into categories like that
we'll start with lip products go into
primers go into the stuff from Stila go
into the stuff from NARS and then we
will end with the one skincare product I
picked up yes only one which is very
strange for me normally when I do a haul
from Sephora I get like equal parts
skincare and makeup because I love
skincare maybe even more than makeup but
today like I said I only did it pick up
a one skincare product so let's go ahead
and jump right into it I did feel like I
spent quite a lot of money um but you
know that 15% off it's pretty damn good
it's not as good as like 20% off during
the fall but it was still pretty damn
good so anyway let's go ahead and jump
right into it we are going to start with
the lip products I picked up quite a few
so let's go ahead and jump right into it
the first item that I did pick up was
the bite Beauty excuse me he bites it
Beauty a moves boost lipstick in the
shade a honeycomb so this is something
that I do have in a deluxe size and I
really really love this shade I'm
usually not the kind of girl that likes
nude lipsticks but this is like the
perfect nude lipstick so this is what
the packaging looks like really really
nice and sleek and the shade is just
absolutely gorgeous so there it is I am
not wearing any of these products on my
face today but I will be wearing them
throughout the week I'm going to give
you guys my follow up haul or final
thoughts or first impressions on a
Sunday combined with my fails and holy
grails and then on Saturday I will put
together a look for you guys using these
products so here is the shade of
honeycomb as you can see it kind of is a
neutral nude so it's got a little bit of
pink tones a little bit of warm tones
and it is just absolutely fabulous I
really love this formula so yeah that is
the first two lip product I picked up
and then I told you guys I picked up a
lot of NARS products so of course I did
have to get some more of the NARS it
velvet lip glides I got these shades
lipu last two seven one eight and then
also danced at area which is 207 104 so
this is what they look like and I really
am starting to be a fan of NARS
packaging I used to really not like it
but now I'm kind of a fan so here is the
shade Dan citerior which is a really
really beautiful kind of fuchsia
color it's a little more muted or at
least I think it's a little more muted
having even swatched this yet um but
yeah it's a little more muted and it has
a little bit of like a berry tone
running through it so that is what it
looks like still a nice hot vibrant pink
I love the formula on the NARS Velvet
lip lines these are amazing I will be
doing a big big lip declutter for you
guys soon I really only want to keep the
stuff that I'm absolutely crazy about
the really really comfortable formulas
you know like my wife Ella boils these
guys I have found that I have a very
high taste for like high-end lip
products I don't know what that's all
about but I just really like comfortable
lip products and I want to do another
huge declutter although I know I did
declutter what like 300-400 lip products
already I just want to do another one
and only use the stuff that I am
completely partial to so here is the
shade nopales or Laplace lip at us I
think it is and it is a beautiful
beautiful true cherry red so there is
that shade right there so these are
really really beautiful the shade that I
do already have from them is called
bound which is a nice dusty nude pink
shade and I feel like these are gonna
pair together really nicely with that so
I got those and then I did go ahead and
pick up a NARS audacious lipstick these
are pricey as how you guys but
so many people were saying that this
shade right here Bridget 9 for 62 is
really amazing and the packaging is so
nice I did I didn't haven't watched it
yet but I did already take it out
because I heard that it has magnetic
packaging and honestly this is the
nicest packaging for a lipstick I have
ever seen in my life I even had Tom like
hold it and he was like this feels
luxurious so anyway that is what the
shade of Bridget looks like now on the
website I did think that it was gonna be
a little more red toned but I still
think it's really really pretty it kind
of reminds me of bites Beauty bite
beauty's agave a gobby lip mask what am
I talking about there butter cream
lipstick in the shade Heather's just a
really nice warm tone nude and I wanted
to get something that I don't have a lot
of colors in my collection like this if
that makes sense so those are the lip
products that I picked up and now let's
go ahead and jump into primers I did
pick up two different primers one of
them is totally an Instagram made me buy
it it is the force Ollie unicorn essence
skin enhancing antioxidant serum so I
guess that this is like a serum and also
a primer built into one have you guys
seen those videos on Instagram where
people are like applying the
on their face directly I don't know why
they do that I was talking about that on
snapchat last night do they do that
because it looks like unicorn tears or
are they sponsored and like the brand
specifically asks you to put it on that
way why would you put it on that way it
looks so weird I am just going to be
applying this to my hands then putting
it on my face just because I feel like
it's gonna be really messy if I start
literally applying it to my face
directly but yeah it basically just
comes in this kind of packaging really
really pretty and it is a really shiny
pink liquid so please tell me is this
actually a serum or is it actually a
primer because it says on the back here
this innovative solution acts as the
dual purpose serum which it uses the
skin with beneficial skincare while
preparing it for layering moisturizer or
makeup application it contains four
super fruit extracts rich in
antioxidants and packed with vitamin C
which helps make the skin appear visibly
younger and healthy looking I feel like
I only see people use this as like a
serum or I'm sorry as a primer so can I
use this as a serum I have absolutely no
idea but I did pick that up and then I
also did pick up a full-size of the Beca
first light priming filter I hate
absolutely hate the back light priming
filter I do have combination skin I have
a full-size of that I've been trying to
work through for quite a few months now
my issue with that is just the fact that
I feel like it leaves a very artificial
looking plaster on my face it's just not
a natural looking glow and on top of
that I don't feel like it really
prolongs aware of my makeup but I did
get a sample of this and I really really
liked it again I don't feel like it
completely you know um you know enhances
like the longevity of my makeup but I
thought it was really beautiful on the
skin the purple tone is kind of like
whatever I don't feel like it really
brighten my complexion but you guys it
really felt like a nice base for putting
my foundation I know that might sound
weird like if it doesn't you know
prolong the wear of your makeup and if
you don't even like the purple cast that
it gives like why did you buy it I just
really really enjoyed it the actual
consistency of it and I did feel like it
kind of prepped my skin nicely so that
is what it looks like as you guys can
see it just has a really really light
lavender looking color to it it does
smell kind of like pledge or something
like that like an artificial lemon scent
but it really stunk in nicely on my
combo skin so I am hoping that this is
going to be something I really enjoy it
I really enjoyed the you know
little deluxe a sample I got so yeah I
did pick up a full-size of that now
let's go ahead and get into the Stila
products because I picked up a lot of
the glitter and glows you guys know I've
been obsessed with these so I did go
ahead and pick up six more so I do have
this shade smokey storm and I saw that
they had released their duochrome so
let's go ahead and swatch those first
because they are absolutely incredible
looking the first one that I have here
is called oh I'm missing one the first
one I have here is called C siren this
is what the packaging looks like similar
to like the aqua Glo packaging that they
released about a year ago and these ones
are the duo crumbs I heard they aren't
as pigmented but oh my god look
at this look at this color this one
right here is C siren and I do plan
eventually on picking up all of these I
will do a full swatch video as well as a
review on these but I really do like
them I still think this looks pretty
damn pigmented this is like a light
lavender with a blueshift as you guys
can see I am so into the holographic and
do a chromatic like trend right now so I
knew I had to pick that one up and then
I also did pick up the other two which
are let's see here into the blue look
how cute the little sticker is into the
blue and then also Sunset Cove so let's
go for Sunset Cove first I think this
one has like a little bit of a well it's
very similar to this one so this is what
it looks like
and I feel like these two are very very
similar but this one has more of like a
warm color to it so let me go ahead and
swatch that one oh my gosh this formula
looks a little different this one looks
a little patchy I'm not quite sure if
I'm going to like that
yeah this one doesn't look nearly as
pigmented so there is sunset coat they
are very very similar do you guys see
that I might return this one because
it's so similar and this one seems to go
on very very thin if you have the
original ones they have like a very very
glittery effect to them so I'm not sure
about Sunset Cove I will keep you guys
updated like I said I will have my
follow-up haul going up on Sunday and
then we do have into the blue and this
one just looked amazing on it the actual
website look at this oh my goodness do
you see that holy alright let's go
ahead and swatch this one this one is
definitely like a violet color with I
would say like a blueshift running
through it and it's definitely the most
painted out of all of them so there it
is I think I'll end up keeping this
one and this one into the cove or Sunset
Cove or whatever looks very very I don't
know which doesn't seem to have that
much pigmentation it definitely has a
silver shift to it on like this one
which has more of like a bluish shift
but yeah they look really really pretty
I'm quite excited for them now let's go
ahead and swatch it the other three that
are from like the collection like the
true collection the ones that released
first I did get the shade a diamond dust
which one that has been sold out forever
it is a true silver shade and this is
what it looks like so true kind of like
I just know I don't know like silver
glitter beautiful last I'm so excited
and these are just really really
beautiful so there is the shaded diamond
dust as you guys can see love love love
that very excited to play with that I
feel like it's going to be gorgeous with
cool toned eye looks and then I did get
violet vixen this one is more of like a
fuchsia purpley color and it does have
quite a bit of your Edessa --nz running
through it as you can see it is a true
of violet and I think it has pink
shimmer running through it
I don't know these colors look very
different than they did on the Sephora
website but I don't mind holy look
at the pigment on that you guys see that
really really beautiful and then finally
the last one that I got is gold goddess
I just thought this one would be so so
nice a for everyday wear and I've been
loving these like I said this formula is
just absolutely fantastic you have to be
very careful with them you have to work
with them quickly you have to place them
on your eyelid and then not blend them
out seriously if you start blending them
out you're gonna have fallout everywhere
but I really really like them and like I
said I love the shade smokey storm so
here is gold goddess beautiful beautiful
beautiful so anyway like I said I picked
up six of those so very very excited to
play with those and then now let's go
ahead and get into the miscellaneous
NARS product so I did pick up the NARS
orgasm blush I kind of wanted Super
orgasm but this was the one that I tried
out I love those names
I kinda wanted super orgasm but this was
the one that I chose out to just because
this was the one that I tried in the
sample challenge this is what it looks
like and you really looked absolutely
beautiful on my skin I don't know how to
describe it I feel like there is gonna
be a little bit of a overlay here that I
need to work through on but it just
looked incredible on the skin you guys
it had that beautiful beautiful glow
from within but at the same time
almost rosy toned on my skin I don't
know how to describe it honestly
everybody says that this is so similar
to like the Bahama Mama is a Bahama Mama
no not Bahama Mama I can't remember that
and that one blush from um what is it
the balm cosmetics I feel like it's so
different like this one is just
different it has this really nice golden
sheen running through it with a pinky
rosy iridescent that's how I would
personally describe it so I did go ahead
and pick that up and then I did also
pick up the NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation so I do have one
NARS foundation it is that skin tint and
I feel like that's a really really good
true foundation it's not a skin tint it
all has a lot of coverage now normally I
have gotten matched at Sephora before I
am the shade Siberia which is the
lightest in the NARS line when they
match me that's what I came up as but
today or this week I did go ahead and
pick up the shade Gobi now and that is
because I do have two layers of self tan
on self-tanner on my Jergens like mousse
in the shade fair / light and I just
thought this would be better for me
because it does leave me a little more
yellow tone so this is like literally
holy this feels amazing in my hands
beautiful beautiful packaging it does
have a pump and like I said I got the
shade Gobi so this one does pull a
strong yellow undertone this is not what
they matched me for but I do want to try
it out because like I said I am self
tanned we shall see how it goes but yes
super super excited to wear that
tomorrow and then I did also go ahead
and pick up the radiant creamy concealer
which everybody talks about I got the
shade Chantilly yes Shanti so yeah that
is the one that I am going to be playing
with and this is what it looks like I
feel like this is going to be a nice for
me this is like the true color of my
skin and probably without self-tanner
but I thought it would still be nice and
brightening with the self-tanner so
there it is actually kind of matches me
with the self-tanner right now this
might be too dark for me when I'm not
self-tans but yeah very excited to try
this out I have heard that it's very
similar to the Too Faced Born This Way
so yeah very excited to try that and
then I also did pick up let's see here
some miscellaneous items the first one
is the Becca under eye brightening
corrector
I keep seeing what is her name hashtag
fab life here on YouTube and on
Instagram I keep seeing her use this I
have gone through
go on through but I have tried out they
aren't there concealer in the shade
praline and then also um what is it I
have all six of their color correctors
which I ended up decluttering I know
that this is the same sort of formula it
does have like a rose gold lid to it but
I just thought this would be really
really nice for correcting before going
in with foundation it has a very very
thick kind of consistency to it but it's
like the perfect light pinky kind of
shade I don't know how else to describe
it I just think it's going to be really
really nice on my skin so that is what
it looks like very very nice natural
light pink color corrector so that is
what I am going to be using I feel like
I have snot dripping out of my nose that
is what I'm going to be using before
going in it with the foundation this
week so before going in with that Gobi
shade and then finally I did pick up the
let's see here ceramics lip clay
cleanser from Sunday Oh Riley this is
what it looks like it's the only
skincare item I picked up which is kind
of surprising I've heard really really
good things about this actually I've
heard good things and then bad things
but I want to try it out for myself it
is made for normal to oily skin with
French green clay Moroccan lava clay
vitamin C and neroli essential oil it is
a plastic container which kind of feels
cheap to me um but yeah I will try that
out this week alright and you also have
the vib bruise little gift I know that
this is a little brush that they give us
and then I do have obviously some
samples that I picked up we have some
sent samples here and then I got a
little kit here from Olay Henriksen we
have the three little wonders seven day
transformation kit with the truth serum
which I've gone through to full sizes of
that it's fantastic the shear
transformation perfecting moisturizer
not a huge fan of that and then we do
have the only Henrickson find your
balance oil control cleanser which I'm
very excited about I do like a lot of
the products from the Green Line from
Olay hundreds ten and then I do have
this little Clinique pep start hydro
blur moisturizer I do not want to
support Clinique I know they do a lot of
animal testing this is not something
that I chose that but they gave it to me
anyway so I will try that out and then
also a YSL again not what I ordered but
that's okay this is the YSL shocking
volume and intensity intensity truly
mastered what is it isn't a mascara so
like a true mascara I think it's a true
mascara and that is what the wand looks
like kind of similar to the Lancome
Hypnose drama so anyway
guys and then I got a bunch of different
samples I got to see here if he believes
the truth cream aqua bomb clinic instant
hydra blur moisturizer again like none
of this is what i chose but i did choose
this out it's the sk 2 facial treatment
essence i know that they are not cruelty
free but i've heard great things about
this so i want to try it out so anyway
guys that is it that is my large
extra-large support vivc haul let me
know down below what you got and like I
said I will be back on Sunday to give
you guys my first impressions and final
thoughts on these items bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
