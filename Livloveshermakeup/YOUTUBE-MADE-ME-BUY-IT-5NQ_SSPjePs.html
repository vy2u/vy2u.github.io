thank you so much for joining me this
video is going to be the YouTube made me
buy it tag I don't know if it's like a
tag nobody tagged me I'm just doing it
and I wanted to show you guys some
things that I bought because of YouTube
some of them are really good and worth
the hype and some of them were just
flat-out fails for me and I was like why
did I get this oh that's right because
somebody was talking about it and raving
about it so I feel like we are so like
um you know like you see like your
favorite two Beauty vloggers or whatever
talk about certain products and we're so
inclined to run out and get whatever
they're raving about and sometimes we
realize like oh this product maybe
doesn't really work for me or it maybe
you didn't do enough research before you
purchase it you just got it because
somebody said it was good so yeah I have
a few products here I did pull out a
bunch others and a bunch of others bunch
others I pulled out a bunch of others
and I looked at it and it was gonna be
like a 30 minute video literally so if
you guys would like a perk to choose
this the video then I can absolutely do
that cuz I have some more stuff to talk
about but today we're gonna talk about
some foundations a setting sprays and
bronzers highlighters and mascaras so
let's just get right into it the first
thing that YouTube made me buy was the
Kat Von D locket tattoo foundation so
the first time I saw someone use this I
can't remember who used it but they were
using the Elena shade at the time which
was liked 44 and it looks great on
camera I think now that I look back on
it I think the girl was in really really
bright lighting because she looked like
she was my skin tone but she must have
been darker because I picked up like 44
and this is super super dark on me like
super dark like just does not match me
whatsoever it dries really really really
pink and let me see if I can show you
guys I don't know if you'll be able to
see but it drives a very very pink on me
and especially when you have such a full
coverage foundation like this one you
just absolutely don't want that so I
ended up buying it and I was like this
is the lightest shade I hate it it
doesn't work for me it looks Orange and
then finally Kat Von D released the
shade light 42 and so I picked this one
off because I was like oh it's great
this is gonna be great everybody's
talking about it now this one is too
light for me so what I do is I mix the
two together
when they are mixed together I think
that they are really really good I don't
know I felt like I spent a lot of money
and time running around trying to find
my perfect shade when in reality this is
a very very heavy-duty foundation and
every time I was watching somebody apply
it I think they were under really really
good lighting and it just looked amazing
on their skin and I personally I like
this foundation I don't love it it's not
my favorite full coverage foundation it
really tends to settle into fine lines
on my face it kicks up in certain areas
on my combination skin and he even
leaves my t-zone pretty oily so I guess
that this is one of those products that
you tube maybe buy and I'm kind of
regretting it's way past like the time
that I can return it now so obviously
I'm going to keep them I have used quite
a bit of this one and I like to mix them
together but I can never find the
perfect time to wear these foundations
I've tried them with everything during
the summer I get to oily and it feels
too heavy during the winter I'm a little
too dry and it emphasizes dry patches so
I need to find a good way to use these
if you guys have any recommendations
like different kind of tools to use or
maybe a moisturizer let me know because
these were expensive and I want to use
them I just don't think they're the best
and everybody like there was so much
hype about it and I think they really do
cover well but they don't look beautiful
all over the face on my face they only
look beautiful in certain areas so that
is the first product that YouTube made
me buy that I kind of regret the second
product that YouTube made me buy is the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mess now I
don't personally watch a Jaclyn hill
here on YouTube but there was one video
that I saw and I was like God she looks
so beautiful I clicked on it and I was
watching and she used this product I
think that she just like you know has a
really really beautiful glowing skin in
general and she really is great with
like putting on her highlighter and
things like that and I kind of feel like
I was tricked into thinking that it was
this mist that was giving her that glow
don't get me wrong I think this mist
really does give your skin a nice glow
but I think in the video that I was
watching again she was under really good
lights and I think she had quite a bit
of highlighter on and I guess I didn't
notice during the video because she was
zoomed in on her eyes and when she
zoomed out after she would use this well
her skin is so glowy
I picked it up and I'm not in love I
have talked about it in my weekly
favorites video before or in one of my
weekly favorites of videos um it's nice
I just don't think it really prolongs
aware of your makeup and if anything it
actually breaks it down the wear of your
makeup because it does have oil in it so
if you have dry skin you probably would
like it a lot I guess Jacqueline Hale
does have dry skin but I don't know this
is a very very expensive
I would not repurchase I think the only
way that I like to wear it is if I have
a lot of powder on my face and it's
starting to kick up a little bit I'll go
over it with this but for the most part
it's just to put some moisture back into
my skin I don't think it's really a
setting spray I do think it makes your
skin look dewy and luminous but if you
have combination or oily skin you might
want to stay away it's just it's quite
oily if that makes sense it could be
nice as I think I'm gonna start using it
as actually like setting in my skincare
if that makes sense I really like using
products like that they have a little
bit of moisture to them but overall this
was very pricy there's not a lot in here
and I just didn't think it was really
one of those products that I should have
bought and spent the money on I much
rather would have gotten the other skin
mist that I was looking at which was the
Josie Maran Nirvana hydrating mist I
wish I had picked that one up in the
long run but it is nice I just didn't
think it was the greatest and YouTube
definitely made me buy it if that makes
sense
alright alright the next thing I want to
talk about is the Vice art cool mask
palette I talked about this in my club
video with Amy I just I'm gonna keep it
I can return it I did pick it up pretty
recently but I'm going to keep it see if
I can still kind of play around with it
I think it's absolutely beautiful and
the shades in here are gorgeous but for
the most part like the packaging isn't
that great on here they don't come with
a mirror I know they are for a
professional makeup artist and I think
the reason I bought it was because I saw
Tara babes and Emily Noelle 83 talking
about them and I have to remember that
those girls even though they're not
makeup artists they could be makeup
artists they're very very good at doing
makeup and I'm not on that kind of level
so when they're talking about you know
oh these are so wonderful and creamy and
pigmented it's because they know how to
work with them and
you know I'm just one of those people on
a day-to-day basis I just want to put my
eyeshadow on blend it and have it like
be done with which is why I prefer
products like the Too Faced like 9 pan
palettes or things like that these are
just very very difficult to blend and
the colors are quite dark it's just it's
difficult it's difficult to say the
least you have to find the right brushes
and I don't have all the right brushes
to use this so yeah this was one of
those palettes again this is an $80
pellet and I just feel like YouTube made
me buy it and it really isn't meant for
somebody like me if that makes sense
I'm going to keep it see if I can kind
of play around with it I think the
colors are beautiful
maybe I'll get better and better at my
makeup and then I can use this in the
future but for the most part I feel like
professional makeup artists or people
that are on that level really really
love it because they know how to use it
alright the next thing that YouTube made
me buy were the hourglass ambient
lighting powders a lot of people bought
these because of YouTube a lot of people
were disappointed and a lot of people
love them I ended up loving them I never
really knew what to do with them this
little one in dim light I have the
little tiny size here I barely use this
I don't really know how to use it
honestly because it's not really like a
highlight for my skin tone it's a little
dark by the way look at that foundation
do you see how dark that dried Oh anyway
it's a little dark for my skin so I
don't really use it as a highlight I
think my favorite way to use these
powders is to highlight with them or to
set my under eye area I don't like to go
all over my face I know a lot of people
do like to do that it just looks shiny
and weird on my face but my favorite one
out of all of them is ethereal light I'm
so happy it picked up a full-size of
this this was the first one I picked up
and honestly I think this one is my
favorite I did end up picking up that
hourglass ambient lighting edit palette
and I really liked it but like this one
right here I think it's called mood
light and then you have dim light like I
don't know I feel like if I had picked
up a full size of dim light everybody
was raving about dim light like it was
like gonna fit everybody's skin tone and
it really doesn't if you have fair skin
this one is not going to be like a
highlighting powder for you or anything
like that it's kind of like
beca's opal like that is one of those
highlights that everybody is like oh it
works for everyone absolutely not opal
is so dark on people who have fair skin
tones like you can't actually wear it
it's a highlight it's more like a blush
topper but anyway I'm glad that I did
fall into the height but I didn't
purchase a full size of dim light
because that was the most raved about I
went ahead and I got the lightest one
which is ethereal light which has a cool
undertone this is the best for my skin
tone I love it I like to use it like I
said as they liked highlight or
underneath my eyes to set in my like
product I don't like it all over the
face and yeah it's just it's - glowy on
my face if that makes sense
so overall I am happy even though I
would not purchase a full-size of dim
light though that is the one that
everybody talks about and I don't think
it's Universal for everyone alright the
next thing I want to talk about is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara I
never fell into the hype of this I
thought it looked really flimsy and
cheap and then I purchased it and I was
like wow it's like a nice like weighted
mascara and I thought I wasn't gonna
like the wand I'm obsessed with this
this is one of those items that YouTube
made me buy it and it was worth the hype
this is one of the back mascaras I have
ever used in my life it is absolutely
amazing I have had this particular one
for six months and it has not dried out
now I do put in little eye drops once in
a while to kind of moisten it up but for
the most part this formula lasts forever
and I love it it's just an amazing
amazing mascara you can get like little
- let's eye samples to try out it's
really really good the wand is quite big
but honestly it just makes it your
lashes look fake if that makes sense so
that was definitely something that you
to baby buy that was worth the hype a
mascara that was not worth the hype that
YouTube made me buy was the benefit
roller lash I did purchase a full-size
of this I tossed it in my empties video
what maybe six months ago during the
summer you guys might have seen that I
did not like this whatsoever this was
all over YouTube and I don't know if it
was because benefit was sending out the
mascara but everybody was talking about
this and I felt like it did really
nothing for my lashes and I'm one of
those people I used serums and things
like that to stimulate like growth and
sickness in my lashes so a lot of the
time I don't attribute like my lashes
looking good to be in the mascara
because I feel like it's because I do
condition them and take care of them and
use lengthening treatments but this
didn't even make my lashes look good
so I really did not like this I didn't
like the wand I thought it was just very
basic it was just like a basic bitch
kind of product I'm sorry it was just a
very basic not a special formula not a
special wand
I think the lash sensational at the
drugstore is the same sort of wand and
I've heard it's much better so yeah I
would I would I yeah excuse me I would
not repurchase that alright and then
another mascara that was super super
hyped up that I do love and it was kind
of like the Too Faced better than sex it
is worth it is they they are real from
benefit this was like the first mascara
that released that had that really
really spiky crazy wand and I remember
trying like a little sample size of like
one of these and I was like oh my
flippin God like my lashes look good and
then everybody started making blondes
like this but this was the original
everybody raved about it nobody really
talks about it anymore I feel like
people still talk about the two-faced
one but not so much of this one this one
started at all it's amazing I love this
this and the Too Faced combined amazing
so yeah YouTube made me buy this and I'm
happy I did alright the next thing I
want to talk about that you to maybe buy
was the Becca Jaclyn hill trio palette
this was so hyped up on Instagram and I
had just opened my Instagram and I was
like whoa like I need that
I never purchased a full size of
champagne pop it just didn't really
speak to me and I was thinking I very
fair skin tone is that even gonna look
nice on my skin and I'm happy to say I'm
happy to say that I am happy that I did
not pick up a full size of champagne pot
because I liked it I know I'm gonna get
a lot of heat for this I like it I don't
love it so this is the trio that I
picked up and I do think the trio was
worth it you get blushed copper which is
a beautiful blush topper you get
champagne pop and then pearl out of this
palettes my favorite one is pearl I know
everybody was raving about champagne pop
I don't love champagne pop I don't love
it on its own I think it's a little too
dark on my skin tone so what I actually
like to do is mix
champagne pack with pearl on top perfect
beautiful beautiful highlights if this
little palette
comes back I highly recommend picking it
up just because I don't know I never
really reached for my full-size Becca
shimmering skin perfectors I like them
but I never reach for the full-size ones
I think it's nice to have them in pallet
form so this definitely was one of those
items that YouTube made me by a slash
Instagram made me buy it all right and
the last thing I want to talk about is
the Too Faced the little black book of
bronzers you guys know I love Too Faced
I'm a huge fan this is the most
unpractical makeup item I have I don't
even know how to store it in my
collection it's huge its clunky and it's
bronzers and I'm one of those people I
don't bronze or contour my face on a
daily basis I saw this all over YouTube
and I was like I have to get it and I
was like wait a minute why do you have
to get it and now it's too late to
return it but I do like this product I
did end up reviewing it and I think I
was just like brainwashed in the head
when I did the review I was like it's so
amazing and I'm wearing them on my face
and I'm like you were wearing like one
and it was the lightest shade a lot of
these are super super dark they do smell
good they're nice I think the packaging
is just so like I'm practical like I'm
practical practical it's not practical
I'm practical it is just not practical
whatsoever you guys it's just not
practical
I never reach for this I can barely
store it in my Alec series 9 drawer and
I don't know what it is I only really
like milk chocolate Soleil in here I do
like these separately I should have just
purchased like a full size of them
separately because I just never reach
for this it's so big and clunky and I
don't even really wear bronzer or
contour my face every single day so this
was an item that YouTube made me buy and
I'm kind of disappointed that I got it
so anyway those are some of the products
that YouTube made me buy let me know
what youtube made you buy down below I'm
scared of being foundation on my shirt
oh here we go
so that has completely dried down now as
you guys can see pretty darn dark and
that is the Kat Von D lock-it tattoo in
late 244 anyway so these are products
that YouTube made me buy let me know
down below the products that you bought
because of youtube do you love them do
you hate them and let me know if you
would like to see more of these I do
have like more products I would like to
talk about but I didn't want to make
this video too long so thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you guys in
tomorrow's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
