channel thank you so much for joining me
I hope you are all having a fantastic
day and always I am here to do another
YouTube made me buy it tag video except
this time it's going to be a little
different in the first video that I did
I kind of talked about products that
YouTube made me buy that I actually
didn't end up being a huge fan of and I
will go ahead and link that video in the
description bar if you are curious if
you would like to see the products that
wasn't really that thrilled about but
YouTube made me buy but recently my
friend Haley I'm you guys probably know
her it xoxo Haley R Ella here on YouTube
but reached out to me and we're close
friends we talk all the time about
makeup about personal things about
everything we really enjoy each other
and she is a good true friend of mine
and she recently reached out and was
like do you want to collaborate and do a
YouTube made me buy it and I love it
video because then I can show you guys
some of the products that YouTube made
me buy that I actually really do enjoy
and I said absolutely so anyway I am
going to link all of Haley's info down
below I really really enjoy her and I
would love if you guys went over and
checked out her channel I'll leave her
Instagram she is a fantastic Instagram
she post so many cool pictures of it
anyway I'll leave her Instagram below
her channel and also her video go over
and tell her I say hello who and anyway
let's just get right into it let's talk
about some products that YouTube made me
buy that I really enjoy so I'm going to
go ahead and start with some blushes
these are the Milani baked blush is I
have quite a few here but the one I
specifically want to talk about is
called alumino so literally the
packaging is just worn off on this baby
I love this so much it doesn't even have
the name on there anymore this is a
product that's so many big like beauty
gurus and just like people on YouTube in
general talked about and I finally went
out and purchased it and I have made
quite a dent in this sucker like this is
like such a gorgeous gorgeous color it's
got like a beautiful iridescent to it it
seems amazing on every single skin tone
and it just glides onto the cheeks like
butter so this is definitely one of
those products that YouTube made me buy
that I absolutely adore and after I
tried that one out I went ahead and
picked up the shade delicioso pink which
is a gorgeous cool toned pink shade I
also picked up this one which is called
red vino which is really
just as well especially if you have a
deeper skin tone I also picked up
coralina which is one of my favorites as
well this one has a little more like
glitter in it as opposed to like shimmer
but it's very beautiful and then I also
picked up Dolce pink which is beautiful
as well so I highly recommend these
Milani baked blush is everybody on
YouTube raves about them specifically
the shade luminoso absolutely stunning
on all sorts of different skin tones and
types of skin alright moving on the next
thing I want to talk about are the Real
Techniques sponges both of mine are
dirty but this is what they look like
and people started talking about these
after the Beauty Blender had released
and these release people were like that
is it a dupe and in my opinion it's a
dupe but better I recently got rid of my
last Beauty Blender I will not be
purchasing them anymore because I
honestly love these little guys so much
more I really enjoyed that there is a
flat side here so you really can pack on
your foundation you can bake your
under-eye area you can do whatever with
it I think it's perfect I love that you
get the little side right here so that
you can go underneath like with the
pointed side on little areas around your
nose or your eyes and then this flat
side is perfect
I love these they're so much easier to
clean and they are a fraction of the
price of the Beauty Blender so highly
recommend these they are a dupe for the
Beauty Blender and in my opinion they
are just better in general than this use
cleanser alright the next product that
YouTube made me buy is the neat matte
nude palette I had never heard of the
balm cosmetics brand until I started
watching YouTube videos and I love this
palette it is so so so wonderful first
of all the balm does come adorable
packaging but when you open it up you
get some gorgeous gorgeous matte colors
in here and recently the balm did come
out with a neat matrimony palette which
looks beautiful as well lots of gorgeous
cool tones in there but this one is so
fun because he did a nice mixture of
warm tones and cool tones and you get so
much product in here and they're very
very nice they're not super super smooth
and creamy and buttery but I love the
shades and I love that this is like a
kind of like drugstore priced
all matte palette I think that's really
really special YouTube made me buy it
and I really really do enjoy it alright
the next products that you to baby by
where these gorgeous gorgeous little Too
Faced melted liquefied lipsticks now I
love these I love the
elation on these if you guys watched one
of my products and returning videos the
one that I did well I think it's the
only one I've ever done my channel I'll
link that below as well but I mentioned
the new like matte formula that they had
come out with I don't personally like
their liquefied version but these ones
are amazing I love these I have like I
think I have like three of the melted
Chihuahua shades yeah I have three of
the melted Chihuahua shades beautiful
beautiful kind of like neutral your lips
but better color I have melted metallic
dream house or horse house whatever that
means I have melted candy I have let's
see here melted metallic PD I have
melted peony and I also have melted
berry I love these they are so beautiful
they go on so nicely they just have a
gorgeous gorgeous color selection I've
always kind of found that their color
selection is kind of in-your-face and
kind of like wham-bam but I really
really like that they smell pretty good
they go on so nicely I love the
applicator and I just love the way these
sit on my lips I can actually practice
my flute while I'm wearing these and I
think that the melted peeny one is
probably like the most like talked about
when I go ahead and swatch it for you
guys it's just like a beautiful like
your lips the better sort of kinky mauve
shade absolutely gorgeous and then the
melted - Wow
which I hate that melted Chihuahua like
no thank you
I do not like that one bit let me go
ahead and swatch this one for you guys
though it's beautiful it's just like the
Kylie Jenner asks kind of brownish lips
so you get a really nice selection of
super super bright colors you can get
some neutrals I love the formulation on
these I think they are so so so good
YouTube definitely made me buy them and
I absolutely adore them alright moving
on let's talk about something else that
YouTube maybe buy that I love those are
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette now
I have to say my least favorite of the
three is the original wine this is
everybody's favorite everybody loves
this one I barely have made a dent in
like half of the colors in here honestly
I don't know what it is I think it's
just it's so basic that it's almost too
basic it's not that it's like a base of
pinch kind of products it's just one of
those products where like I really love
it I think it does a lightly smell of
chocolate it's a very very nice
very like alluring I guess you could say
but honestly the tip chocolate bar
palettes that release that are my
favorite are the Too Faced chocolate
bonbons and then also these semi-sweet
the semi-sweet is like the best one in
my opinion and I think people hate this
one the most but I have a lot of warm
tones in here and then you get little
pops of color I just love this one the
most it smells the most like chocolate
it's just the best in my opinion but
also the Too Faced chocolate bonbons is
wonderful as well really like the cool
tones in here personally I would say
that the Too Faced semi-sweet chocolate
is a little more warm toned also the
original chocolate bars a little more
warm tone this one's a little more cool
tone but overall YouTube definitely made
me buy these chocolate bar chocolate
bomba chocolate bar palette and I loved
all of them I really do love all of them
but I preferred these two alright moving
on let's talk about some liquid
illuminators that were all over YouTube
they're not really anymore but they are
like the bomb diggity bomb okay these
are the NARS eliminators because the
liquid illuminators in super orgasm then
also Copacabana these are so beautiful I
love these so much so Copacabana I'm
gonna swatch it over here Copacabana is
a beautiful kind of silvery pink color I
think these are absolutely stunning you
can mix these in with your foundation
you can just take them with like a damp
Beauty sponge and put them like on your
cheekbones I love them during the summer
just mixing into my foundation so I can
get that really beautiful glow also if
you have a very very matte foundation
you can mix these in I just really like
these they're so thin so they can be
mixed to really really easily I do like
the ones from hard candy quite a bit but
those are a lot thicker and honestly
they're a little more difficult to mix
into foundation these are just wonderful
and they were all the rave on YouTube
about like two or three years ago and
then here is super orgasm just love that
this is a beautiful kind of salmony
color with gold undertones you guys look
at this color yeah yes yes yes I love
that I think it's so beautiful I love
wearing these during the summertime I
really literally make it a point to grab
them
almost every single day during the
summer and I just think they're really
really fantastic so yes the nars super
orgasm in copacabana liquid illuminators
are amazing alright moving on let's talk
about primers I have two so the first
one is the two-phase hangover RX I
thought this was so gimmicky honestly
but I thought this was so good Ricky
wouldn't release I was like I'm so not
getting that that's so gimmicky like who
wants to put primer on their face after
they happen like when they wake up from
a hangover nobody you don't want to do
anything you do not want to put makeup
on when you have a hangover so I was
just like that's so gimmicky I'm not
getting it I love this I think this is
my second one I believe this is the
second one that I have gone through
pretty much and you can see I'm almost
done with it I will be repurchasing one
of the best primers I have ever used it
just replenishes my skin it smells like
coconut I love the way it makes it feel
and makes makeup go on so nicely it
doesn't have like silicone or slip to it
so if you're looking for like a pore
filling sort of primer I would not
recommend this one but overall love this
and then the second one is the it
cosmetics let me take a deep breath
cause this was quite a mouthful feel the
moment anti-aging ultra hydrating
sensory awakening primer serums this is
the one that comes with like the kind of
like pink sort of liquid in it now I
will say during the altered 21 days a
Beauty event I picked up the other one
for like half the price it was like $25
that comes in a little white container
let me know if you pick that up as well
I was so excited that I got that for $25
my friend Mellie with like all her
coupons and stuff actually scored it for
$4 I was like a mini thing but anyway I
was super super excited to get this one
and then also when I you know copy wipe
on the other don't do it the other day
when I got the white one I have my
little Ulta 21 days of beauty box like
back there and waiting on a few more
things and I will be doing a haul for
you guys I got all the goodies that I
picked up but anyway this is a fantastic
fantastic primer it really does kind of
feel like sense to me awakening it kind
of smells like a spa and I just love it
it's kind of beautiful consistency if
you have dry skin or aging skin this is
going to be your best friend okay it's
amazing it just feels luxurious like on
the skin it's
it has caviar extract hydrolyzed
collagen peptides hyaluronic acid
vitamins a c e r9 ha hobo avocado
avocado a deep ocean water you get the
point
it's beautiful everybody was talking
about it on youtube and they were like
oh god it's just as like the best thing
ever when I first got it I didn't like
it because I applied too much this is so
hydrating and thick a little goes a long
way but I love it now and YouTube made
me buy it it's my best friend all right
moving on a lot of primer talked about
like two minutes would be going crazy
all right moving on I love this little
Too Faced no filter selfie powder this
was so hyped up on YouTube I thought it
was so gimmicky when I first got it and
then I have fallen in love with this
middle shade right here called totally
toasted like yes yes I love dusting it
all over my face these really do have
just like a light reflecting sort of
property to them they're absolutely
gorgeous they're very very lightweight
and not super super ultra concentrated
or pigmented so if you are one of those
people that doesn't want to straight-up
put bronze like you know a grungy color
or like yellow or lavender underneath
your eyes or something like that these
won't show up like super super like
dramatic if that makes sense and I feel
like this was like the whole like they
started like the color correcting craze
I mean the color correcting craze has
been around forever but this came out
like what like a year or two years ago
and I thought was really giving at first
but I'm glad I got it because I really
really do get a lot of use out of that
totally toasted shade alright and the
last thing I want to talk about are the
makeup geek products / brands so makeup
geek I never heard about them until I
started watching YouTube videos and do
you follow Marlena on here I think she's
a wonderful businesswoman she's classy I
love her I love the way she does her
videos whoa I almost just dropped all
her products still love her but I think
she's just a wonderful person and I
really do love the brand makeup geek so
I have a V palette here I don't have
tons and tons from the brand this is
actually not from the brand this is just
like the little yellow setting powder
from I think Kiko cosmetics or something
like that anyway the top row right here
you can see but that is just like her
basic eyeshadow formula I think those
are nice I'm not crazy about them what
I'm crazy about are these foiled
eyeshadows
I have these shades mesmerised Houdini
I have flamethrower and also the shade
grandstand these are so beautiful and
creamy and pigmented and like just like
yes yes yes
they're amazing I love these so I would
say from makeup geek or foiled
eyeshadows are incredible and also her
blushes I have fallen in love with I
have four shades right here in another Z
palette and these are just fantastic as
well I have these shades first love
let's see here at rendezvous I have
secret admirer and I also have
spellbound spellbound is my favorite
it's so beautiful like just like
everyday sort of natural peachy color so
yes YouTube definitely made me buy some
of the products from makeup geek and I
don't regret it I'm really impressed
with her foiled eyeshadows and also her
blushes alright guys that is it for the
youtubes maybe buy a tag except these
are all products that I love I hope you
guys enjoyed this make sure to go check
out Haley's video as well tell her I say
