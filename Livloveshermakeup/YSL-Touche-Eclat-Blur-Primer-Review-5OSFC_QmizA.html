you for joining me today I am doing a
review on the new Youth Saint Laurent or
YSL Touche Eclat blur primer this goes
for $52 on the sephora.com website and I
have never tried any of the too chic lot
products I've not tried the radiant
touch concealer I know I know I'm crazy
and I have not tried the foundation but
I've heard so many good things and I
just thought you know what I'm gonna try
this out so anyway this is what the
actual packaging looks like like I said
it comes in that beautiful little gold
box but um really really beautiful this
makes me feel pretty you know like I
want this on my counter like why I sell
really knows how to package stuff um so
it's basically just one fluid ounce of a
beautiful you know glass tube it has a
pump which is awesome and you know you
have that kind of like glass and gold
look and I love white and gold together
so this just looks so beautiful and I'm
like oh I want that like on my counter
all the time but inside if you guys can
see there's like tiny tiny little flecks
of gold shimmer I will tell you guys
right away
I was worried those were gonna you don't
really show up on my face they really
don't when you put the actual product on
it just is so small it's like glimmer
not even shimmer you know it's like it
doesn't feel chunky it doesn't make any
texture on your face you really can't
see it I wanted to give that out there
right away because that would be a
deal-breaker for me if I had shimmers
all over my face um anyway so the
thought process behind this oh and let
me mention the ties first and yes it is
$52 so that is quite pricey but when you
get into the really high-end brands like
at Sephora like Dior and Chanel and why
sell best just kind of the price and I
think you kind of pay for packaging and
also quality um I've only tried a few
things from YSL but I've not been
disappointed by any of them so that just
kind of says a lot for a brand and you
know I've slowly started getting into
those really really high-end brands and
I just haven't been disappointed so I
keep her purchasing I don't want to go
crazy and like spend tons of money
because obviously two of these like $100
but it is you know I think it's worth it
to kind of dabble into the high higher
higher end of makeup at Sephora because
you never know I mean you may find a
private product that you just absolutely
cannot live without
but anyway so like I said I really feel
like pretty when I'm looking at this and
it just like makes me feel berry like no
you know like old-school like I want to
put my makeup on right now kind of thing
and every time I see this I'm like I
want to put makeup on even if like at
nighttime I'm like just to move my
makeup I see this I want to put it on I
want to put makeup on but anyway so like
I said it was fifty two dollars I got on
the support website I will link below
where you guys can get it um it is
supposed to be the concept is that you
know it extends your makeup obviously
like a primer it has kind of best
silicone II feel like the pore fillers
that are so so popular right now however
it's not nearly as thick so it's kind of
like the good nice in-between product of
the two of those so you have the makeup
extenders you have the pore fillers it's
like in between so it's kind of perfect
because it will blur imperfections on
your face but then the best concept or
the best thought about the whole thing
they basically put it together so that
it makes the foundation that you wear
look better I know that you know we wear
primers so that we can prime our face
and you know extend the makeup time but
I think this is really special because
it does actually give a different look
of a foundation um with it on I have
tried it with a few different
foundations now I am wearing it today
I'm really hot and sweaty today but um
it my makeup has stayed on pretty well
around here the t-zone and not really
but overall I mean my makeup has really
really stayed on and it's very hot we do
not have HDS at the cabin so that says a
lot um but what I want to say is it does
extend the makeup you know it doesn't
leave any color on the skin or anything
like that it does have a little bit of
the you know pore filling thing going on
but I noticed that my foundations look
different when I wear it with this and
they just look a lot more beautiful it's
kind of like when you add like a drop or
two of oil into a foundation like it
just kind of like blends into the skin
it looks it makes my foundations look
more like skin and that's really
impressive
so I really really love that like I said
there is a pump I don't know if I said
that yet but beautiful little gold pump
and when you pump it out it gives just
the right amount and you can see that
it's not runny it is kind of like that
pore filling you know still a pony look
I'm you rub it in and it just feels
amazing it doesn't feel to fix that it's
going to you know take up and get dry on
certain parts of your face do you say it
went like this then
and myself in between um and it just has
this gorgeous gorgeous floral subtle
subtle floral scent to it I mean it
makes me feel like my grandma I'm not my
grandma this one's so bad but it makes
me feel like those ladies back in like
the fifties like doing their makeup and
elegant it makes me feel elegant know my
grandma yeah it's not like my grandma no
it just makes me feel elegant like
old-school makeup was packaged so
beautifully and it just seems so special
to put your makeup on and I feel like
they captured that in this product so
anyway scent is beautiful you can see
there are I mean you won't be able to
see but there are a few of those little
Lintz of shimmer but they're so smooth
you you really can't feel it and I think
it's also the formula because it does
have that kind of silicone II texture
you won't be able to you know it it will
be on the bottom of the actual product
you know that will go over it so I never
get any kind of dryness or you know I
mean - but you know how sometimes you
get a product that does have like
shimmer or something in it and you just
can't go over it nicely it's not smooth
this is still smooth because it does it
have that I'm silicon texture so anyway
I really just love it I think it really
does extend the wear of my makeup
obviously today is a different story
I've combination skin I get very oily
right here and I've been out all day and
like I said at the cabin about 95
degrees here today and we do not have
air conditioning so everything else
though has really really stayed on
nicely I'm wearing my makeup forever
foundation today and I notice that I
only used one pump of it that's really
impressive from me personally because I
like a lot of foundation I usually wear
three or four pumps so um the fact that
this is like making me feel so good
about the way my skin looks before I
even put the foundation on is awesome
and I use less product so really really
like that anyway I'm going to review
guys a little bit about what it says on
the support website it says an
illuminating primer that blurs
imperfection and boosts the radiance of
foundation and it says what it does to
chic lot blur primer prepped skin for
foundation application creating
unimproved refined appearance pores seem
to be minimized skin texture feels
smoother and skin tone is more even it's
enriched with four nourishing oils at
foreign oil apricot kernel oil
past flora oil and rice for
I don't know if the passiflora I don't
think that's like the maracuja is it
passions are no different oil um it says
it leaves your skin feeling incredibly
soft without a christie residue tapped
with blur technology this universal
primer provides a subtle golden shimmer
for ultimate luminosity it says what
else you need to know this product is
non-comedogenic
and it's suitable for all skin tones
including sensitive and um you guys know
how to use I don't have to list a little
how to use thing on spora but um so yeah
I agree with all of that and I do want
to add that you know I really like that
this doesn't have even though it does it
is that silicone texture it is not
greasy and it doesn't feel slick on the
skin because this time of year
especially for oily people and or oily
skin people and combination you know we
really are like oh my gosh you know we
need like that Becca ever matte stuff
all over the face so it's just very
comfortable to wear for personally my
skin um it doesn't take off on the dry
patches of my face and uh it you know it
holds up decently you know I'm in my
t-zone of course this has been on for
probably eight to nine hours and I've
been out you know in the Sun and it's
hot there's no a/c but I think that that
is pretty cool so anyway I'm really
impressed with this product I just I
feel great when I use it it makes me
feel pretty and also um I love what it
does it extends the makeup it blurs you
know you get that great pore filling
thing which is so in right now and then
um also it changes the way your
foundation looks for the better so
anyway I really really like it I will
link below where you guys can get it I
hope you enjoyed this video I'll see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
