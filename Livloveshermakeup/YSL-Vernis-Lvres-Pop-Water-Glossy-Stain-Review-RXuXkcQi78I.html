have another review for you guys today
this one is going to be on the you've
seen the haunt or YSL Bethany I live top
water glossy stain so basically they
came out with this kind of for the
summer because you know you think of pop
water glossy stain it sounds very
summery and they wanted to come up with
a formula similar to their other glossy
stain I guess they do have other glossy
stains I know they do I just don't own
any of them I know a lot of people talk
about them but I guess that formula can
be a little sticky or a little tacky so
they wanted to come up with I guess a
lighter version and you know a more like
glossy version for the summer so anyway
I have it pulled up on my phone right
here of how like what the product is and
all that kind of stuff and they have
eight different shades it appears so
they have all these shades that are kind
of in between pinks and reds and then
they kind of have two more oranges sort
of shades so nothing too drastic nothing
purple and nothing crazy and one of
these is $36 so this is what the actual
packaging looks like it's really really
beautiful and sleek it's just why I sell
on the top in the gold you can see the
color through here and then it's a
little black case and when you undo the
little lid part you can see that you get
this really really beautiful well first
of all color but also doe foot little
kind of applicator that's very very flat
on the side so it's really really easy
to get on to your lips so um I have
swatch this color this color by the way
is 201 I believe it's 201 right yes
201 do we read and I think it's the
perfect mix of pink and red for summer
like it's basically the red lip I'll be
wearing for summer so um I have swatched
it here on my hand a few minutes ago to
show you guys what the finish looks like
when you first apply it I'm also wearing
it on my lips by the way and then this
is a swatch of the product applied about
two hours ago so as you can see there's
quite a difference so over here you get
the kind of glossy beautiful finish a
lot more color it looks a little more
red and then over here it has completely
dried and left kind of a pinky reddish
stain so this really is long wearing I
do find that it's quite moisturizing it
doesn't feel tacky or sticky on my lips
at all I love
when I first apply it I'm like I did on
my lips right before this video because
it's so glossy looking and it's just so
pretty the only thing I would say that
is a little iffy about the formula is
that you know it almost feels like you
need a lip liner when you're applying it
cuz sometimes you get these little areas
that go outside of the lip line you have
to wipe them away it just kind of like
cakes up a little bit in certain areas
so you want to make sure that your lips
are completely exfoliated before
applying these so basically like I said
it's a really really nice formula it
doesn't get on my teeth or anything like
that however I do recommend once you
apply it just let it sit for a second
before you go I'm someone who tends to
go a lot and I find that it doesn't get
out my teeth which is great but I find
that it moves around a little bit in
like ah little blotches if I do that too
much so you really want to let it kind
of set first and it does set even though
it looks like it probably doesn't
because it has that nice glossy finish
it does set and it does feel really
really nice on the lips you know it
feels like something you can grab and
just put on in the car or something you
don't have to think about and it will
give you that little burst of color and
it does you know feel great on the lips
it's not drying it's not too sticky not
too tacky my hair doesn't get stuck on
my lips when I'm wearing it so I really
really like it um what else do I want to
say about this so yeah so basically the
stain is like a pinkish I would say more
pinky sort of stain it looks a little
more red when you apply it but it's a
little more of a pinky kind of stain at
least the color I got and I do find that
stains tor stains tend to leading a
little more towards the pinkish side so
even if you pick up a color that's like
a little more orange II it might stain
pink if that makes sense
so this stains to a color that's pretty
close to my lips and it just looks like
my lips look better and even when it
stains it's not like abrasive feeling on
my lips it doesn't feel like drying or
anything like that it just feels normal
so I find that I reapply this throughout
the day and I can do it probably every
two hours I'd say so after two hours I
reapply it so that it looks like that
again so it's nice and glossy and pretty
the glossiness kind of goes away after
you know it depends if you're eating
like 45 minutes if you're not probably
about an hour but you could just keep
reapplying it
and it shouldn't be an issue like I said
it does like it's not that it kicks up
but it just starts to it doesn't go on
evenly every single time when you're
applying it especially over areas where
maybe you're a little more dry in the
lips so that's something to keep in mind
but this is really one of those products
that's like foolproof you can just pop
it on you don't have to look in the
mirror and you know it won't get on your
teeth
so anyway I'm gonna read for you guys a
little bit about what it says on the
actual support website so says you st.
Nohant
Avenue I live pop water glossy stain $36
and like I said there are eight
different shades it says it is a long
we're hydrating sheer color gloss and it
says dive into the newest wave of color
with these long-lasting color and shine
glossy stains each is now boosted by a
10-hour hydration effect for a
refreshing splash of moisture along with
the vibrant burst of sheer color the
formula glides onto the lip thanks to
its onto the lips thanks to its
high-performance applicator with an
extra flat shape and fine tip for
perfect dosage and application this
lifeproof life proof gloss is available
just in time for summer so yeah I do
want to mention right away um well I
already mentioned it but I want to
mention one more time the applicator is
really cool because you know it's flat
so that you can hit the big part of your
lip and then you get this tiny little
pointed top so that you can get like you
know your Cupid's bow and things like
that and in between your lips like
they're very nice so anyway um I really
really like this product I think it's a
great amount of color for the summer it
doesn't give too much color and you know
it wears off into like a nice pretty
pinkish color so it's not like you're
putting on a true red lip and then it's
gonna fade off and get all crinkly
around your lips or anything like that
it's just a nice stain and you know I
really really like the color I think
that it does stain pretty close and
pretty you know true to match the
original of what it's supposed to kind
of look like sometimes you get these
stains especially from the drugstore I
found that lip stains tend to stain
really really like a drastically
different color so you put on your
makeup in the morning and then later in
the day you know your lips don't kind of
match what you had going on earlier but
I feel like this is close enough and
yeah so I really like it I would
definitely consider up
just a few more of these I think I would
stick to this formula just because the
reviews on the other formula people were
saying it's a little more sticky a
little more tacky that might be a little
more long-wearing than this one but I
just love the amount of color that I get
from this so I hope you guys enjoyed
this review I will link below you can
pick up this product and I'll see you my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
