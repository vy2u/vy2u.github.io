today's video is going to be a very
exciting one I am doing a collaboration
with my friends Samantha March here on
YouTube now I reached out to her and
asked if she would like to do something
called in and yang reviews and the
reason why I asked that was because I
really feel like we're very very similar
but at the same time we're not
whatsoever and I really really enjoy
that I think it's so important when you
are on YouTube to make sure that you are
looking at multiple reviews make sure
that you understand just because someone
gives a different review than yours does
not mean that they are technically wrong
it does not mean that you are wrong it
just means that you have a different
opinions and I feel like Samantha and I
sometimes have different opinions on
things however we're still very simple I
Ripple's review based channels and
neither of us do this for a living
she's an author I'm a full time musician
it's really really cool and I feel like
I can really relate to her on a lot of
different levels also I do feel like a
lot of people on YouTube are constantly
trying to promote themselves and do
collabs with other people to try and
make their channel grow and one thing
that I really love about Samantha is
that she's genuinely very very grateful
for what she has and I am also very
grateful for what I have on YouTube and
I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at so
anyway and that is pretty much it like I
said I will leave all her info down
below let's go ahead and get into some
yin and yang reviews we are going to
start with some products that Samantha
really likes that I am not a fan of and
again it's just that you guys understand
that it's okay for people to have
different opinions it doesn't mean if
she's wrong or that I'm wrong it just
means we are to two different people you
know what I mean so anyway let's go
ahead and jump right into it we are
going to start with the amazing of
cosmetics amazing concealer foundation
the shade that I have right here is
called fair I believe both of us were
sent these before at PR because it looks
like she got the same PR package as I
did from amazing cosmetics but yeah I
think was a while ago and it just never
has worked for me you guys who really
really looks like crap on my skin every
time I put it on I can't get over the
sickness of it it comes out and it's
literally like cement on the skin now if
you have tried it the actual concealer
out from them the amazing concealer you
know that thing is literally like cement
on the face you put it on and you have
to just blend and blend and blend with a
damp sponge forever so I felt like this
has a similar consistency to it but at
the same time it is a little more
sheared out now when I was watching her
video from yesterday where she was
trying out this
product for the first time I noticed
that she was actually using this with a
what was it an oval brush and she was
saying that she really liked the way
that have blended in with an oval brush
I have never tried that I've only tried
this with a damp sponge and I have also
tried it with a foundation brush I just
thought it looked very streaky on my
skin it kind of aged me it's sunk into
fine lines and wrinkles and I think that
Samantha might be a little more oily
than I am I just recently moved to the
desert if you guys didn't know so I'm
living in Arizona now and I've noticed
that like solar covers foundations like
this just are not looking as pretty on
my skin but yeah this is the foundation
that I just really really don't like but
she does and it doesn't mean that she's
wrong or I'm wrong it just means that we
have a different skin at types all right
the next product that Samantha really
like that I do not like is the sweet
peach palette so this was something that
I actually returned and I'm just really
not into the whole sweet peach thing
anymore from a two-phase I bought the
whole entire collection I really don't
like this little sweet peach glow face
palette I wasn't really a fan of a lot
of the products that were in the
collection but there were a few here and
there that I thought were pretty good at
these sweet peach lip oils were okay and
I do like the Papa don't peach blush but
the eye shadow palette for me just had
way too many dark colors in it now the
thing about Samantha is that she's
actually a really really good like a
makeup artist sort of person okay I know
that she doesn't glass safai herself as
that but she's actually very very good
at makeup way better than I am so what I
notice is that she can work with darker
colors and make them look good on her
eyes I'm someone who really likes to go
for more natural makeup on a day to day
basis I do not take really dark colors
and smoke them into my outer-v all the
times you guys been watching my channel
for a while you probably know that so
for me that was kind of just a pass on
that palette I feel like the formula is
the same as the OG kind of chocolate bar
or the semi-sweet or the chocolate
bonbons palette so I think that the
formula is very good quality it's just
that I felt like the shades were very
dark in that Palace there weren't
actually a lot of peachy tones which I
thought was kind of weird so she really
really enjoys that palette and I it did
not
alright guys let's move into some
products that I really enjoy that
Samantha does not like the first one is
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
Nicole Guerrero glow kit so I
of this she does not like it she is not
a fan of really really dark highlighters
and she's also not a fan that these kind
of have a little bit of glitter in them
now you can see right here I don't know
if you guys can tell there's definitely
some oil like seeping through here I
really would change the packaging on the
anasazi of Beverly Hills highlights but
there is a certain formula when it comes
to the Anasazi a Beverly Hills highlight
then you have to like that they have a
very thick texture to them they're
extremely foiled and they are wham bam
in your face like you put it on is there
you know what I mean these are
definitely not a natural highlight and I
feel like Samantha tends to go from
where natural highlights I'm someone who
goes for more and natural eyes but a
stronger highlight so that's where we're
a little different but I really really
love this glow kit I know a lot of
people did not the only shade in here
that I feel like is a complete mess is
probably this one right here we're just
called daydream it has a whole lot of
glitter in it I mean it's absolutely
crazy but the other ones in here you
really can work with them so you might
want to take something with a little
more of a densely packed brush and
really kind of work it on and then you
can actually take something that is more
of a fluffy consistency and you can wipe
away the glitter or you bump it on in
circular motions with a very densely
packed a brush you can actually buff
away the glitter so if you are not a fan
of glittery highlights I mean I'm
guessing that the salad is probably not
the one for you but I really enjoy it
like I said she doesn't but I really did
alright guys and then the next item we
have here is one that again sounds like
so many people did not like but I really
enjoy this this is the Too Faced white
chocolate chip palette now I remember
seeing their review and I was laughing
because so many people felt the same way
if she did a lot of people just felt
like this was a waste of money they were
like there's just all the shades blend
into one another a lot of people did not
enjoy it and I can definitely see that
if you have more of like a medium to
deep complexion this is not going to
work for you so this is what it looks
like up close just you guys can see
really quickly there are a lot of matte
shades in here that are kind of like
transitioning shades and then you do
have like a deep dark matte black lip
not even that it's that with a little
micro glitter in it I'm not a huge fan
of this shade but then you have some
cooler tones you almost be able to warm
tones popped in here
the overall color selection in here when
I look at it is very romantic and pretty
to me but a lot of people were like what
is it like what the hell is this
why I like this is because I normally
have a very very very fair complexion
I'm talking like NC nw5 now I'm probably
about an NC or nw15 currently so I
definitely have a little more glow or
color to my skin currently but this is
beautiful give you up up your complexion
it actually blends really really
gorgeously I feel like the formula in
here is very similar to what you would
get with the OG chocolate bar palette
any of the sweet peach you know you know
what I'm talking about the sweet peach
palette as far as the formula is
concerned at the chocolate bar palette
the semi-sweet the bon bons palette same
sort of formula just different color
selection and this is definitely not a
color selection that's going to work for
everyone and now what I think a lot of
people missed when it came to this
palette was that you really needed to
pick up the sister products which would
be little matte chocolate chip palettes
I think that the two of them were meant
to be used together so you can take
those darker colors in the matte
chocolate chips blend those into your
crease and then use these mars-like lid
toppers now I ended up not even liking
the matte chocolate chip palette that
one I felt like was super super
pigmented but unfortunately it did not
blend very beautifully on my eyes so I
actually decluttered that one but I kept
this one so this is definitely what I
would consider a supplementary palette
so I don't know if the Manzo still has
this in her collection if you do
Samantha go ahead and try mixing it
together with another palette maybe it
will work for you but overall you guys I
really do like this palette it's a good
one in my opinion so anyway guys those
are yin and yang reviews from me and
Samantha March I hope you enjoyed this
video like I said please go over and
check out her Channel and I guess it's
pretty much it I will see you guys
tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
