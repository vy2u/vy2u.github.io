my channel please excuse my hair I don't
know what's happening with it today ok
but anyway today I am going to be
talking about something very exciting
we're going to talk about trust yeah
so trust is something that's huge for me
on my channel that is literally what I
pride myself on that is what I create my
content on is about trust and some
people really like that some people
really don't like that but I get
questions all the time about ok well who
do you watch who do you trust so today I
have a list of eleven people here these
are review based channels that I want to
talk about that I feel are very very
trustworthy I will tell you why I like
them and then I will go ahead and link
their channels down below in a pinch
comment as well as a link to their
channel so you can kinda over and
subscribe if you would like to you but
these are people I really trust
immaculate trust is and is a big thing
for me okay and I really only like you
both on our performance so anyway I want
to see as well if you would like me to
do a video on my favorite like makeup
tutorial channels or makeup artistry
channels please let me know as well but
again at these are more review based
channels because I every review based
channel so the first person I want to
talk about is Tara babes
she has over a hundred and forty a
thousand subscribers she does a lot of
haul she does a lot of reviews she's
unbiased shoes I'm sponsored and she
rarely accepts PR so if that sounds like
right around what you want she is
perfect for you I really really enjoy
her to me know this is not something
that she does full time kind of like me
if you really like that laid-back feel
and she's not trying to get a bajillion
views and a bajillion subscribers I
think you would enjoy her a lot like I
said she rarely except PR like less pure
than I accept and I don't feel like I
accept that much so she's very very good
person to look for as far as reviews are
concerned and her halls are literally
like Hall porn okay she holds so much
but you know that when someone is
hauling that much and trying out those
products you know that they know what
they're talking about so she's the first
channel I want to recommend next I want
to talk about Keeley about she has a
15,000 subscriber she's actually one of
my friends here on YouTube
she has hands-down the best pilots
comparison videos if you were looking
for comparisons on different palettes
like old school palettes versus new
palettes that are like new releases
she is the place to go literally hands
down the best palette comparisons out
there so would highly recommend her I
love her a lot
alright next we have Emily Noel 83 she
has over 800 south
subscribers and the reason why I love
her is the lessons because she is old
school but she has never ever ever
changed you can tell when she gets on
camera that she still loves what she's
doing and I think that is such a big
thing she has never done a sponsored
video and I'm kind of following in that
footsteps I have never done a sponsored
video nor do I really want to so if she
is someone that I definitely feel like I
look up to you and I just love the way
that she approaches her channel she
recently had her second baby and I know
that she had kind of become more of a
mom in the past couple years I mean
obviously she's a mom but you know what
I mean she's really invested a lot of
her time into her family the past couple
years but that doesn't mean that she
doesn't give unspun surd an unbiased
opinions because she is absolutely
amazing at giving reviews without
sounding negative so if you're into that
would highly recommend you check out
Emily all right next we have Stephanie
Nicole stephanie nicole is literally my
idol I love her I love her no
attitude I love the shoes and give a
flying and I really really love all
the information that she has to offer I
mean I don't think there is any channel
out there that can actually provide as
much information on skincare makeup
Beauty everything like that as much as
Stephanie Nicole she's just like she's
literally like a dictionary when it
comes to beauty stuff so if you really
like in-depth reviews about stuff like
that you would absolutely love her I
feel like when I listen to her videos I
almost have to like take notes and she
does have around four hundred thirty
five thousand subscribers right now so
her channel is definitely growing very
very fast and quickly but I love her I
love her
no attitude I love her dry
sense of humor I looked literally
everything about her okay all right next
we have Seri Brianna here in Vienna has
a hundred thousand subscribers and I
believe she just hit 100k
she does awesome awesome foundation
review so if you were someone who does
like foundation reviews she has some of
those and also I really enjoyed her
favorites video sometimes she will do
these top ten videos as well you know
everybody does like top five series she
does top ten and she talks about her top
ten products from each brand which I
really think is awesome she also does a
lot of first impressions on different
you know boxycharm unboxings and all
that kind of stuff so if you are into
that I think you would really enjoy her
even when she does a sponsor video I
still feel like she's trustworthy and I
think that's really awesome so I enjoy
her a lot next week
jaci ina I love her she has 1.5 million
subscribers we have a completely
different skin tone as well as skin type
but what I like is that she speaks her
mind even when she has 1.5 million
subscriber she will still speak her mind
about brands she will speak her mind
when she needs to about certain people
she has no problem with that and I
really really really look up to that
okay she is someone who just never ever
ever has fallen down the rabbit hole
wanting to make more money one to do
more things for views I just I really
really appreciate her and what I also
like is she has a fabulous setup like
her
lighting as well as her camera quality
and everything like that is really
really nice you can super like see the
texture of products on her hands and
stuff like that like I said I definitely
do not have the same skin tone or skin
type as her but I still find her very
knowledgeable and I really do enjoy her
alright next we have a thrift sick or
Kathy she has over two hundred forty
three thousand subscribers I comment on
every single one of her videos because I
love her personality she's very much
very honest and unlike Jackie she
doesn't have this big elaborate sort of
high-tech setup she actually sits in
front of a window I think the highest
quality that you can watch her videos on
it's like 720p but she's off them
she's totally awesome because she is
nothing like any other beauty group that
you will find on here okay she's very
much different with her style I love
that she doesn't give a flying she
just does what she wants and I think
that's absolutely awesome we need more
people that are super super unique on
YouTube and I love her foundation
reviews I love her first impression
series and her YouTube made a me buy a
video so would highly recommend you guys
check her out alright next I have
another friend of mine Lisa Stevens but
Alisha has around 25,000 to 30,000
subscribers now on here she is wonderful
we've collab before in the past I really
really enjoy the content she puts up
it's very laid back which I really
really like she does a lot of comparison
video she does reviews but she also is
really really good at makeup and again
could probably fit into that category of
me talking about makeup artistry sort of
like people that are really damn good at
makeup unlike day so I really enjoy her
I think you guys would like her as well
next we have Jessica Braun she has over
three hundred ninety six thousand
subscribers and Jessica is actually a
new new channel to me a lot of you were
recommending her when I
did on my last livestream and I have to
say I'm really enjoying her because
she's definitely a teacher I can tell
see the future because I'm a teacher and
the way she talks is just so cute it's
the way I talk to my students when I'm
not on camera so I like that she's very
professional even on camera which is
nice but not in like a in-your-face kind
of way like I'm better than you kind of
way I hate channels like that I
hate that when I get home from work and
I want to relax the last thing I want if
you telling me exactly what to do with
my makeup or you acting like you're
better than me like a superiority
complex I hate that okay I hate that so
I really like her because she still has
that laid-back feel she's very honest
she does do sponsorship so she's very
honest about it again she always just
like Cassie - they always say welcome to
another sponsored video like would you
ever click on a video and hear that you
know what I mean it usually have so dude
in the description box and being like
I'm seen let's see snoop around to see
if it's a little of songs or video
around here but I like her honesty and I
think she's really awesome so yeah she's
a newer channel to me next we have
Samantha Marsh she is a newer person
that I started following and I
absolutely love her she just hit 20,000
subscribers on YouTube so yeah Congrats
Samantha Samantha is like me when it
comes to reviews but like a sweeter
version so if you don't like when I get
a little here dude when I get a little
controversial I think you would really
enjoy Samantha we're actually going to
be collabing together either next week
or the week after Samantha if you're
watching this please write to me in
ideas and tell me what day we've decided
on because I could not remember but I
really really like her we're going to be
doing something called yin yang reviews
because like I said I feel like we're
very similar but at the same time I get
a little more heated a little more
controversial sometimes you get the same
sort of honest opinion from her without
the staff so if you really don't like
the sass which there are plenty of
people that do not like my swearing they
do not like my staff you know I'm a
little fascinating over here sometimes
people don't like that would highly
recommend you check out Samantha she is
absolutely a sweetheart and she gives
very very good reviews I love her and
then finally we have Battaglia Batali
opposite oh yeah - Euler
know how to favorite yellow name she's
out the newer to me at first I do not
like her channel only because of her
voice and I know that sounds horrible
but you know what we're just going to be
completely honest here I'm a musician
and sometimes if someone's voice doesn't
register with me well I just can't do it
they're lunging people that cannot keep
up with my videos they do not like my
viewers who do not like the way I talk I
totally understand so she is a very very
monotone but I love it now and I love it
now so many of you are like just keep
watching her you're going to love it
she's so different than other channels
and you know what her voice honestly
calmed me down now so I really really
enjoyed watching her foundation Friday
video so basically every single Friday
and I believe she just got done with
like a 15 days of foundation series
she's just like the queen of reviewing
foundation so she does have cystic acne
but she also is a pale princess so if
you're super super fair I mean she's
like paler than me I would guess she
probably nc5 or nw5 like in max
foundations I'm usually an N w RN C Ken
when I'm at my Ferris so she really
really does have a light complexion but
she's absolutely awesome when it comes
to foundation reviews so really enjoy
her I like her kind of dry sense of
humor she's kind of quirky I think it's
super super cool and awesome so anyway
guys those are the 11 people I want to
recommend to you guys the people that I
really trust on YouTube the channels I
really really enjoy again let me know if
you would like me to do one based on
more like makeup artistry skills and
channels where I go to learn things as
far as applying makeup is concerned but
yeah these are my favorite review based
channels the people that I trust I hope
you enjoyed this video thank you so much
for joining me and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
