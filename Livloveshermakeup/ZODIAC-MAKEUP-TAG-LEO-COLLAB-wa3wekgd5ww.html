I know my hair is crazy right now
I know I know anyway welcome back to my
channel today's video is going to be an
exciting one because I feel like I'm
collaborating with my long-lost twin if
you guys do not know who makeup
struggles is here on YouTube you are
 missing out and yes I have to
say because she's got a potty
mouth just like me and that is how we
are very very similar so I recently
reached out to her and I asked would you
like to collaborate and she came up with
a really really great idea so we already
have a lot in common I really enjoyed
that she talks about things that a lot
of people don't want to talk about on
YouTube which you guys know sometimes I
do as well
did you guys hear that mr. banjo please
don't scrape at the door trying to get
in here and film with me anyway you guys
know I do talk about a more
controversial topic sometimes with the
beauty community once in a while she
does that all the time and no she's not
a drama channel she does it in a very
very chill laid-back away sometimes
she'll have a glass of wine and she'll
be talking and I never feel like she's
negative she always has a disclaimer at
the beginning of her video saying like
you know I use I swear I use improper
language which is really nice because
people just turn my videos on and I'm
like hey everyone how's it going back if
I could be back and they don't see it
coming but she's really really sweet and
I do feel like she's very polite and I
don't feel like she's over the top a lot
of people call me over the top with some
of my videos that I put out there but
it's just one of those things where you
know sometimes when you get a little
heated um things happen I mean I'm a
fire sign what can I say so yes we've
all discovered that we are a Leo so the
zodiac sign you guys know the zodiac
sign leo is in the fifth house or the
fifth sign
um it is a fire sign hence away I'm a
very fiery person she's a very fiery
person and we thought it would be fun to
go ahead and kind of go through the
characteristics like the key
characteristics of Leo and kind of
associate that with certain makeup
products so the ones that I chose were
extroverted active open stubborn regal
ambitious enthusiastic creative and
self-assured and there are a lot of
different characteristics for Leo but
those are the ones that popped up first
on the website I have no idea if she's
going to have the same ones as me but if
we shall see but yeah if you guys have
never looked at like your horoscope or
things like that it's actually a lot of
fun in my opinion
I had like a horoscope reading done and
I thought it was very interesting I
really enjoy it what just happened my SD
card like skipped do I have to edit
clips together what's happening with my
electronics anyway guys let's go ahead
and jump into these keywords associated
with Leo and then I will associate them
with some makeup products so the first
one at like I said is extraverted now
for me I'm a very extroverted person and
I really feel like at the NYX ultimate
shadow palette in the brights version
it's also very extroverted now I'm not
one for playing with too much color I
really do like more a neutral and
natural makeup but I have to say when I
want to pop a color when I'm feeling
kind of Aegeus and bold I definitely go
in with this particular palette I like
this more than the Urban Decay electric
palette because some of the shadows in
the electric palette you can't even use
on your eyes they're not even eye safe
which is kind of strange and this gives
you all of those shade options they're
pretty easy to blend I like to smoke
them out on the lower lashline or tap
them onto the lid really enjoy that
palette and it definitely is a very
extroverted alright up next we have the
word active so for that I definitely
have be Tarte Amazonian clay BB tinted
moisturizer with broad-spectrum SPF 20
sunscreen in the shade ivory I feel like
if I were to work out which I don't work
out but if I did I feel like I could use
this now I'm always moving around I'm a
very very active person anyway and this
really stays on nicely a super super
light coverage of this particular shade
which is called ivory is a little too
late for me currently but it's just
really nice for everyday wear and I feel
like I could you know go for like a mile
run a long run for a mile and this would
stay on my face I clearly don't work out
but yeah this is definitely at the
product that I would associate with
being active especially because it does
have sunscreen in it
alright guys up next we have the word
open so for me I just so say that with
this guy right here because I think of a
mascara kind of opening up your eyes and
this is the bone cosmetics and madelyn
mascara this was recently sent to me for
PR I have like a little deluxe size that
I really enjoyed it kind of has the same
sort of wand as the roller lash from
benefit it's got a little bit of like a
whoop a little bit of a spoon shape and
it really really just defines that the
lashes on days where I don't want to
wear eye shadow
I just going with this and a little bit
of white eyeliner and it just really
makes my eyes look open and bright and
like I got eight hours to sleep even if
I did it so definitely be mad at lash
mascara for the word active no open all
right moving on guys and the next word
we have here is stubborn I definitely am
a very a very stubborn person so I can
see why this would be a Leo
characteristic because that's that's me
all the way but I have to say waterproof
mascaras so if this is the new a
country's cosmetic
rocket or extreme volume mascara it is a
waterproof version I did not know that
when I first used it this is a very
strange mascara because I feel like I
put it on and sometimes it's smudges but
then I can't get it off at night and I
feel like that is very stubborn I feel
like when I go in to take off a mascara
at night if it's a waterproof mascara it
takes all my lashes with it and I don't
appreciate that so for the word stubborn
I would say any sort of waterproof
mascara all right up next we have a
regal now I don't feel like I'm very
regal like a little princess or anything
like that but I do feel like a princess
when I use this little eye shadow
palette I feel like a princess when I
use all our glass products to be
completely honest just because they're
some of the most like expensive in my
collection the hourglass ambient
lighting edits palettes are probably you
know the $80 range I think that's the
most expensive palette that I have in my
collection this little guy right here
which is the modernist obscura eyeshadow
palette is $62 you don't get a lot of
product in here but I swear to you this
is special a lot of people did not like
this formula but I love it I like that I
can slip it into my purse I feel special
when I use it I can wear it to work I
can wear it onstage it's beautiful its
everyday friendly yes I have colors like
this in my collection but knowing that
this is so buttery and smooth and creamy
and easy to work with really really it
makes me want to gravitate towards it so
that is definitely a my regal pick
alright moving on it we have ambitious
so far ambitious I have to go with the
lorac mega pro 2 I just feel like
there's so many options in here and I
feel like when you have a lot of options
you're a little more ambitious you know
what I mean so this is what it looks
like and I feel like there's pops of
color in here there's a lot of neutrals
you can wear this as an everyday
friendly kind of palette I don't know
this
come back in stock I know it did a
couple of months ago a limited-edition
my ass but it's just beautiful it's cool
tone it's my favorite lorac mega Pro
palette that they came out with I just
really really enjoy this and every time
I use it I really do feel like I'm being
a little more ambitious with my makeup
because I try at different color
combinations that I normally would not
try all right guys moving on I'm sorry
my lips are so freaking drive practiced
so much yesterday but anyway moving on
and the next word that we have here is
enthusiastic and well Susie astok can
you guys tell everybody's always like
you seem very happy about your makeup
about everything I am but I don't think
there's a product out there that I am
more enthusiastic about rather than
these I feel like the honest toffee of
Beverly Hills glow kits
I only say good things about these right
yes I feel like I only say good things
about these I would give all of these a
four or five star rating they are
amazing I have the Sun dipped glow kit
here this one is my favorite it's the
moon child the Nicole Guerrero and the
Aurora
I'm definitely getting the new one that
they're going to be releasing for the
holiday season I feel like when I get
really excited about makeup products
it's usually the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter press or my honest hacia
Beverly Hills the Lucas so that is
definitely an enthusiastic sort of
product for me all right up next we have
creative so for me I feel like my Kat
Von D metal mats palette makes me feel
very creative because I try things that
I normally wouldn't try kind of like the
lorac I mean I guess I'm kind of mushing
together ambitious as well as creative
but you guys know what I made I feel
like I try at different looks that I
normally wouldn't try or wouldn't even
want to test out in a million years what
I have this palette in front of me I
love the mattes
I love the shimmers I like this a blue
shade here even though it's very hard to
blend I make it work or I try to make it
work I love the shade ribbon and silk I
love the purples and the blues in here
now I know that that's a very like dated
for like eyeshadow to have like all blue
on your eyes but I really like that I'm
a very stubborn person I like the way I
do my makeup and I like putting blue
eyeshadow all over the place so that is
definitely a palette that makes me feel
a little more creative and finally we
have a self assured and now I definitely
feel like that is a Leo trait across the
board
Leo's tend to have really big egos which
I definitely do I try and
I have too much of an ego when it comes
to like a YouTube and things that are
more of like a hobby but when it does
come to my professional life I'm
extremely competitive I have a huge ego
and I really truly feel like I could not
have gotten through all those years of
conservatory if that ego wasn't there
because there were so many people
telling me you can't do it you can't do
it you can't do it and I had to tell
myself that yes you can you are awesome
okay and I feel like that's something as
a Leo that I really appreciate I mean
it's not good to be too self-involved
but it is good to have a little bit of
self assurance and it be comfortable
with who you are so for me that product
has to be the hourglass ambient lighting
powder is this one right here is
ethereal light I love these because
every single time I put these on I know
my makeup is going to look good and then
I feel it self-assurance so anyway guys
that is it for this lovely little zodiac
makeup tag let me know what your zodiac
sign is down below make sure that you
check out makeup struggles channel you

you guys are gonna love her too
she's so real but yeah I guess that's
