video and it's 10 things girls wish guys
knew cristobal disclaimer
no not every girl wants these things
love the Lulu but a lot of girls that I
know I met in friends of mine in myself
think these things because there's like
standard things many guys know this not
all guys are clueless of these things
but some guys aren't so I'm just here to
try to help out guys and girls I guess
are only girls but gold you can relate
ok um so yes here are 10 things that I
thought up thought of um that girl's
wish all guys knew number one when guys
Texas first it's cute and the thing
about this is guys always like well
girls Texas first it's cute and yeah it
can go both ways I get that but when
guys took sus first it makes us feel
like I don't know like oh my god we were
important you thought of me would you
text me um obviously girls can text the
guy first
and either way girls can initiate
conversations girls can initiate
relationships and so on but I just
realized I've just experienced like that
one guy's text me first I'm just like
because makes you just feel like special
and stuff so guys if there's a special
girl who you think might like you you
might like you want to get things going
um then it text her first and that being
said have something to talk about that's
really what makes it cute not hey hey
what's up hey what's up L says you're
pretty
as soon as you walk in look oh no what's
cute is when you're like hey how'd you
do on the tester hey how was your day
going er hey I thought about you to me
that'd be a little creepy you know it
depends on how close you are you're
dating me like a the watch it is cute
but if you like some guy that likes it
sexier in class really yeah it's already
did I'd be like what the hell but you
know what I mean um have something to
say if you say hey what's up more than
likely I will not respond to that
because I have everything to do and I
I'm not gonna respond to hey what's up
not much you same great you don't have
something to say maybe wait so she texts
you or just wait till you have something
to say to texture because otherwise it's
just like back and forth mindless
texting
never happens never to saying you're hot
is not always the best term to use
sometimes I can make girls feel good but
more often than not say beautiful
gorgeous pretty is even fine like things
like that and you don't say you're
gorgeous all the time oh yeah it does
another thing too many compliments is
annoying compliments are great
don't get me wrong and if a lot of girls
my think this is weird but too many
compliments like every time you see me I
cannot be drop-dead gorgeous or I can't
be prettier I can't be so funny that
you're just cracking up or I can have
the best personality no not every time
it's like when we got with Goblin
and I don't think this I don't think I'm
dropping gorgeous I don't think I'm
really funny and I don't think I have a
great personality like I'm not saying I
have those things I'm just saying like
I've been told that before and it's cool
to a point but it gets really annoying
after well listen you're hot yeah I mean
it has to be like in the right mood like
that can be suitable sometimes will
morph and the not girls want to hear
beautiful cute gorgeous pretty because
those are more endearing terms and those
make the girl feel better about herself
and oh I think so like you're hot is
like a cat call kind of a thing number
three kissing with too much tongue is
disgusting okay I had a previous thing
with this guy whose tongue was pretty
much out of his mouth before it even got
to mine Oh too much tongue is not good
it's not cute so you know you can work
your way up
start with pegs maybe out Tom you don't
get French okay you know French French
comes later if the mood and the ambiance
is right you don't start with French Oh
guys need to know how to kiss without
Tom because all you can do is kiss with
tongue we got a red flag problem okay
Tom is great too much tongue I hate oh
like there is a thing as too much tongue
you may not think so but then they used
to have a ton fish because there is a
thing as too much Tom number four the
girls won't answer texts that does not
mean that we're ignoring you per se I
mean it's like creepy like hey hey hey
hi hi hey
yeah we're probably ignoring you but if
it's like hey and good morning or
whatever and we don't answer it we
either didn't see it or we're trying to
play mind games that's what girls do
alive it will be like I'm not gonna
answer it
I think I've nothing better to do my
gosh I can't tell that I'm freed next to
think I'm nothing better to do it you
got it act like you're so busy and
you're too cool and you'll have time for
him later even though you're not doing
anything besides watching Netflix and
sleep until noon that's what girls do
with you
I mean it's inevitable you play mind
games especially with guys that you was
the thing you really liked a guy it's
like you all you want to do is texting
when he takes you back you're like okay
I'm gonna wait mall around this one
you've waited like a minute you're like
sweet I waited so long but like when
it's a guy you kind of like these kind
of yeah you're like I can wait an hour
to and like it's bye it means that fine
it's kind of rude but you don't I mean
like you don't want to text back so much
but just go to be don't text back asap I
mean although things we do but audience
we don't it doesn't mean we don't like
you it doesn't mean we're ignoring you
doesn't mean we hate you we want to
break up it just means we're trying to
be cool number Five's
PDA is not always fun I know girls are
suppose to be so much more romantic and
I go my god like holding hands okay okay
okay
but sometimes I want afraid not holding
it I don't want to forget to be sweating
with our palms clenched together all the
time we can walk around without people
knowing down for a couple 24/7 like I
don't know my own hand know but you know
I mean like like if you are constantly
like when guys are rubbing the girl's
back I'm just like oh my god get a room
please like I want to see that like it's
just annoying to me maybe it's cuz I've
never really been in love but I don't
know I just like what I see that I'm
like okay kissing is fine making out
okay little too much I'm putting hands
as five lions all the time okay we get
it you're in a relationship like oh like
rubbing nope we're six Donuts a the
periods are gross
do not say periods or quotes periods are
not really gross if you think about it
yet it's blood but it's like okay
periods are natural they're supposed to
happen if you think that's gross then
you need to go sit up or anything about
what that actually means because that
means that a woman can have children
that doesn't mean that oh it was just
bleeding for no reason so if you think
that's gross you're obviously not going
to be in a relationship
a true boyfriend doesn't need your like
buy tampons a chocolate per se like I
know you always say those things on
Twitter
like my true boy band has a perfect
boyfriend but he just needs to be there
for you and not treat it like it's
disgusting because it's natural I just
hate when guys really on your period I'm
like oh what is the second grade number
seven if you talk to if the guys talk to
the girl's family and especially to have
a girl they're like she's like going to
bathroom and she's like other room for
second you won
you just you won I'm not saying like
fake talk so the girl thinks you're nice
but like okay me and Jeff aren't dating
but I can go out of a room and he'll
chiefly talk to my family um like my
family my mom dead sister or like male
big family you talk to them make
conversation it's nice to see that guys
can talk to family without especially
that you being there it just makes you
feel comfortable and like he actually
cares about you and um I just think
that's really nice like if you just sit
there that kind of makes you look like a
douche bag and like you don't want to be
there you don't really care about her
family and that makes it look like you
don't care about her but or not you do
it's just like ugh guys talk to family
that's just like a major win on your
part my hair is pissing me off in this
video number eight
give us our space sometimes not all the
time when I want to be alone but if
you're like clingy or key like a winch
into my college chains me text running
out to my hands borrow internet you know
anything else to it no I don't want to
be with you 24/7 or mean it releasing
you real fast obviously I'm not ready
for marriage but you know what I mean
it's like even feel her marry dance
without time together if we're dating I
don't have to hang out with you every
single night you know what I mean like
yeah we hang out a lot yeah way to see
each other but I don't know if this is
just me this might be a just Madison
thing but I don't want to see you every
waking minute and talk to you every
waking second it'll be nothing new I'll
have nothing to talk about with you like
oh my god sometimes gives her space
please thank you number nine I contact
can be like really a sexy if you do it
right if it's too much like stare down
like it's like that's not my face like
12:00 staring but like you know what I'm
talking about girls guard I hope you
it's like oh it's like such a magical
moment when there's like eye contact
especially with someone new like a new
guy or girl if you slow that way like
okay there's this one guy like after
college and like I see him all the time
and I'm like I look at him and be like
and he look at me and dealer
you can see that nobody looks like I'm
just like maybe we're faces to a wall
but like it's oh it's like so magical to
me like I'm just like like I feel like
it's like a connection not it's not
stare it's not it's not looking at and
looking the person up and down it's like
that it's just like brief eye contact
and then look away look back and catches
eye again and look away like it's like
oh it's like it's like a little game and
I love it this thing comes from is even
better okay and number 10 talking about
drugs or drinking does not make you cool
I don't drink or use drugs or substances
but it so obviously i wouldnt think it's
cool but even girls to do partake in
those things I don't think they would
think it's cool if that's all you talk
about I don't want to hear that that was
so drunk the other night
that's not cool is not classy for guy or
girl guys want to hear from girls
anything like the last thing kind of
goes along with that do not act on your
douche bag and I know that's hard for
some guys and I know that's just kind of
like an ego or um an ego thing or just
kind of a mask or a front that they put
on maybe they're shy or maybe they're
not super confident and so they put on
this kind of like to like make the girls
Nick they think that girls will want
them or they are so you're cool and like
oh my god this a dad I'm so confident
I'm so cool for that know that oh that
is one of the most irritating things
ever when a guy thinks he's too cool for
this and he just comes across as an
arrogant douchebag whether I'm just
trying to do that me I don't think any
guys like okay today maybe douchebag but
it comes across like that and oh my god
it's so irritating like just try to
watch what you do and say because it's
so annoying I had so many guys who like
put things down that maybe they liked
because they think the girl would think
there's so much stronger and cooler like
broad and cool and and high and all this
stuff if they say that that's stupid or
if they're like this and I won this what
like oh my good don't be a cocky douche
bag and maybe I will date you bet what
my video um I hope you enjoyed this
video if you're new to my channel

much and I love you guys so much I'll
