happy I have tons of friends but people
that I trust people that just make me
feel like I'm so loved and cared about I
can count on pretty much one hand a lot
of people not make fun of you but they
commented there i'm fighting wear heels
to school because i love them why do you
wear converse to school heyo so today I
thought it would do be 10 things that
make me happy tag because this just
looks like a really uplifting tag and
I'm really excited to do this and tell
you the 10 things that I love the most
in the world I thought about this over
the past like week or two because I
really want not to just throw this list
together like a bunch of random things
that you know I liked I wanted this to
be the stuff that I loved and stuff that
I couldn't live without and then I just
think about all the time how much I
appreciate and love and I'm thankful for
so without further ado let's get into
the 10 things i love so the first thing
on my list this is in no specific order
just because this first of them is the
best but number one is pretty great
because it's pizza pieces my favorite
food overall um I always went between
pizza and pasta throughout my entire
life generally know which one I like
better pasta and no goodbyes pizzas
literally heaven it it's so great like
it can change your whole day your whole
mood like if I'm sad or tired or just
like and my moms like me up for dinner
and I'm like and she's like I'm well I
think I'm gonna order a pizza and I'm
just like and the day just gets so much
better because of pizza okay so peace is
great I don't want to sound like every
other youtuber by saying that but
literally pizza is life so it's number
one number two is YouTube I don't know
where I would be or what I would be
doing without YouTube YouTube has just
taken over my life for the better i love
every second minute hour of it i
wouldn't change it for the world and i
love everything that I've accomplished
and gained from YouTube and having a
channel and having subscribers and and
friends on here and and
people that just like my video or share
favorite a comment you know our watch it
just means the world to me and it's the
greatest thing ever number three is high
heels oh my god high heels can literally
change my day if I'm having a bad day I
put a pair of heels on I turn to like a
boss ass bitch and I'm ready to take on
the day take on the world to conquer the
world a lot of people not make fun of
you but they commented going friday wear
heels school because i love them why do
you wear converse to school huh i love
heals so much i will wear six-inch
sparkly heels to school any kind of
heels will be worn to school out to
dinner on vacation to a movie anywhere
that i go to walgreens i will have heels
on and i must say i don't i wear them
every day what i do i just feel so much
more put together and i'm not saying you
have to wear heels to feel or look put
together that's how i am that's why I
work I just feel so much better when I'm
wearing heels I can just strut my stuff
and owned today it makes me feel so
happy number four is going out with
family your friends I just love going
out in general and I'm not saying going
to a club or a bar or something like
that obviously I just mean going out to
dinner going out shopping going out
getting nails down just some little
things just any time I hang on friends
or family it's just the greatest time
ever you know get out of your house
break out of your shell then do
something exciting new or the same um or
just fun that you love and enjoy just
going up to dinner or just going to the
mall something little it just makes me
feel so good like when I go out and I'm
just like I'm having the time of my life
you know maybe the smallest thing but
it's so so fun to me I don't know what
that is it's just going out getting
dressed up it's my forte number five is
driving with loud music I don't know if
there's really any better feeling the
feeling of just freedom in your car
windows down music is blaring is your
music you control what you want to
listen to no one else is in the car you
know why you may have someone else but
when I'm alone I'm just like belting my
little heart out and I have the time my
life because love music can you know
make any day better and I feel like a
lot of these things make my days better
and I feel like I'm noticing that now
when I'm talking all these things like
if I'm having a bad day they all somehow
someway cheer me up maybe not all of
them but most of them doing and then
make my days better and more fun and
loud music it's just music is such a
huge part of my life okay and drive you
such an amazing
privilege so when you put the two
together it's just a great time I'm just
so blessed that I have a car to drive
and that I can list of my own muse I
guess just as great number six is
anything disney I love to see so much
movies songs characters distant world
whatever it is I love to stand such a
Disney girl my top like three favorite
movies two of them are Disney cartoon
movies even Pixar movies are amazing i
love everything disney anna has since I
was a little girl so I just kind of grew
up that way and doesn't just it just
feels like home to me like when I watch
a movie or listen to a song just hits
hard and reminds me of my childhood I
adore just me so much it was always
Disney over Nick for me just always
number seven is sounds kinda weird but
good relationships with people you know
when you may be in a fight with a family
member or you had a falling out with a
friend and those days just suck but
those days where you just see how
amazing your friends are or how loved
you are by your friends and family and
you just feel amazing I love those kind
of days and just those relationships
when you have a strong bond a
relationship with you know a few friends
or tons of friends me I can count my
really good friends on one hand and I'm
not ashamed to say that I have tons of
friends but people that I trust people
that just make me feel like I'm so loved
and cared about I can count on pretty
much one hand and my family as well are
amazing and when I just think about how
blessed I am to have such good
relationship some people i love that
number eight is feeling confident and
fierce and this may sound stupid but i'm
all about having strength and confidence
and fierceness and showing it to the
world because that's kind of a this
channel is I'm you're my fearsome
covenant divas and and I'm not saying to
even a bad way either because when i say
diva people are like i was really
traumatic and rude and overreact and I'm
like no divas just someone who's fears
and competent in their own body some
days I won't Sunday's you know II feel
like crap where you feel weird or you
just don't feel it yourself but the days
that I'm on point everything is going
good for me makeup hair fashion just my
whole life is going well for me those
are the greatest days ever and I love
feeling put together and feeling
confident with myself in my body and not
being afraid to rude the day I love
those days when I feel just so so happy
number nine is makeup and fashion
overall a whole YouTube channel revolves
around makeup and fashion
and i just adore it i finally found a
passion and it's something that I was
good at and it is makeup and fashion and
I'm so glad that I finally found this
outlet in my life because I was like
what the farts my good at you know and I
finally found something that I was good
at and that I loved loved loved to do
and you can change it up your face is
literally a pellet that you can draw on
and it's great and I should love
exploring with new styles of fashion new
books of makeup and it's amazing it's a
great way to express yourself and number
10 is kind of cheesy but it's literally
life I value my life so much I don't do
anything crazy because I just fell you
manage so much I appreciate every day
that I'm given in it's amazing it really
is if you stop and think about it for a
second it's kind of crazy but just life
itself God wakes you up every day to for
a reason he wants you to have an amazing
day and you should live it up and not be
worried that be sad not be scared i'm
not saying don't be those things because
it's kind of hard to I i have an had
anxiety in an anger and you know sadness
and you worry and your map might be sick
there's a lot of things that could go
wrong with life or do go on in your life
that are bad or negative but just try to
have a positive outlook on life because
you are given each day one at a time and
through the oldest you'll ever be and
you're the youngest you'll ever be again
um at the you know this moment in time
it's moment in your life and I'm just so
blessed to have the life that I do and I
wouldn't trade it for anything else
though I may be mad at things that
happen or sad things that happen you
know every now and then I am very
appreciative of what I have you but if I
don't show it all the time so those are
the 10 things that make me freaking so
happy and yes so I hope you enjoy this
