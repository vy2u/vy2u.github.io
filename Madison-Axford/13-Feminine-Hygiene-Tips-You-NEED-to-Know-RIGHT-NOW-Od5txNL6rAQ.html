about feminine hygiene how to keep down
their clean how to keep up on like daily
checks of your vagina your breasts your
skin your teeth when I was younger it
was like embarrassing for me to like ask
you about this to talk about it I was so
like embarrassed by it and it's not that
very same topic at all if you're a girl
watching this hi if you're a guy also hi
today I would get into 15 things that I
wish I knew as a young child if some are
awkward for all of us so I want to share
them with you today so hopefully you
don't have to internet search anymore
none of this stuff you have to do so
don't feel like I'm telling you to do
this or you have to do this so you don't
look like this or smell like this or
whatever no like we're all our own
individuals but this is what I do and if
you were wondering you're questioning
I'm assuming that's why on this video
and so I'm here today tell you that like
of course we are in the era of feminism
so if you want to rock armpit hairs or a
full Bush down there or whatever do it
and never ever look back or apologize
for it so without further ado let's hop
into this video all about feminine
hygiene so my first tip is to just go to
the gynecologist if you're of age
meaning usually people run the age of 18
start to go to the gynecologist whether
or not they've had sex if it's before
the age of 18 most people don't go
unless you've had like a lot of
infections if you got pregnant if you
are having sex and it's known then your
parent or guardian your mom most likely
will take you to the gynecologist or if
she's not for some reason and you're
past the age of 18 you're having sex or
maybe you're not and maybe you just want
to get a check-up down there you do need
to go I feel I feel like this is
important thing just to make sure
everything is clear from like if you're
having unsafe sex to make sure you don't
have STDs to make sure you don't have to
cervical cancer
make sure everything's flowing and
cleaning and working perfectly down
there banana colleges can be a scary
place but don't be intimidated by it you
hear those horror stories of like I did
put my legs up in the stirrups and I was
all spread out yeah it's not the most
pleasant thing but keep in mind your
doctor female or male is trained for
this um like a area they know what
they're doing they're not there to judge
they're not going to judge you the
second feminine-hygiene type of smell of
a vagina I'm confused
right so first of all vaginas
shouldn't have an overwhelming smell
like it shouldn't be like you're just
like sitting here and you can like smell
some weird scent one if it smells like
fishy I know that's always used or kind
of like sour smelling that means an
infection whether it's an STD a yeast
infection something of that nature or if
it's not that present but it just isn't
the best smell it might just be like a
natural sweat and that just means pay a
little more attention to cleaning it
when you're in the shower I'll get into
how to clean it in a little bit but just
make sure that you're keeping up to date
with how you are smelling down there we
can't smell like flowers and cookie
dough like that's not a thing vaginas
shouldn't smell bad but they have their
special vagina smell and a dole
whoever's down there whether you are
engaging in a relationship with someone
in there down there or you know just
like you being around yourself there is
a natural vagina smell and that's just a
smell and that's inevitable we all have
when all of ours are a little different
but we all have the same general scent
some are stronger than others and that's
largely affected by our diet which I'll
also get into but it shouldn't smell
sour or unbearable or like fish or like
sweat so either clean more or go to the
gyno to make sure everything is down
there is okay so if you're starting to
smell a little funky that's not supposed
to be what's happening and get that
checked out for sure just to make sure
that you are healthy in the future one
thing I'd like to point out is douching
is very dangerous because I've heard I'm
not saying don't do it because I don't
want to tell anyone what to do do
whatever you know but it alters the ph
balance within your vagina that causes
the normal smell it's the cleaning
agents that causes the normal smell the
good smell like your vagina smell
if you douche that's like cleaning up
within it and people think if you have
like a lot of sex you're supposed to do
that no just make sure you pee after sex
if you're using what you know no condoms
the only thing that I do to make sure
that I'm smelling good down there it is
using summer's eve this isn't a brand
deal this isn't a sponsorship I use it
in the shower but I just take a nice the
gentle washcloth and go all around it
and I just feel very fresh and very like
clean after doing it I've never stopped
using this for like the past six seven
years and I've never had problems that
I've never gotten affection I know these
are very controversial for some people
so yes this is what I recommend for
people who are confused or who do think
they might have a smell Oh who don't
like detach
smell and what you try to disguise it or
what not this is the way I go to stay
this way the third feminine-hygiene tip
is all about pubic hairs this is a thing
that me my friends were like what are
these because when you're young and they
start growing in you've always heard
about pubic hairs but when yours growing
you're like wait who and it's very
normal nowadays to get rid of them to
shave them all off to have a landing
strip if you want pubic hairs keep your
pubic hairs they're there for a reason
my personal like when I was growing up I
hated hair I don't like hair anywhere
except on my head so I've chosen to do
accordingly waxing is just expensive and
I found that I got more irritation from
that because I have very sensitive skin
and it's so rough with the wax in fact
like I was like shaving you can get
razor burn you can get ingrown hairs I
have an experience either of those with
my like pubic region shaping but I know
a lot of people have the razor that I
found that works best with me or just
these big ones these are cheaper they're
not like the most um expensive razors at
the store but I just like these they're
get the closest shave that looks the
closest to waxing without going through
all that pain shaving should not hurt
make sure like again if this is your
vagina v like make sure you are going
down don't go up because that's not the
way most people's hairs grow and it's
just gonna pull them out and cause
ingrown hair so make sure you're going
down if you have never shaved before
make sure you trim them with like a pair
of little trimming scissors these just
little I can't just go in with a razor
and shave like if you've never shaving
before to make sure you trim them down
to like a quarter of an inch first
before you go in with this see a fourth
hygiene tip is to keep a healthy diet as
best you can keep track of what you're
eating like make sure you get at least
one to two healthy meals a day you can
eat ice cream you can eat cheez-its you
can eat the junk food but don't eat it
for every meal of the day for every
snack break have an apple instead of you
know pretzels and chips and cookies just
think a little more if you're trying to
lose weight gain weight make yourself
smell better whatever that's the way to
do it the fifth feminine-hygiene tip is
about boobs boobs are something that as
we are young we often Wednesday forget
about but don't pay as much attention to
but lumps and breast cancer is something
that can start as early I mean if girls
are at any age but can be
20 or 21 years old we can have a lump so
make sure you are doing weekly or
monthly checks of your boobs for lumps
it's not funny
like it's not touching my boobs like
it's a serious thing make sure you check
all the way up here up to your
collarbone all around your entire boob
especially under on the sides of it up
into your armpit because this breast
cancer can also go to your armpit so
check your lymph nodes to see if they're
enlarged anywhere - if you don't feel
any present lumps in your boobs if you
see any changes in your breast area Lord
nipple region if there's liquid coming
out of your nipple if they hurt or are
very tender more than normal
make sure you tell a guardian a parent
your gyno your doctor your pediatrician
whoever and make sure you're getting
that checked out it might be nothing but
just in case and especially a little
lumps that need to be checked out it
could be benign but you never know and
it's never too early to start looking
for breast cancer and to make sure that
you are safe boobs they can be tendered
they can hurt they're not gonna be twins
they look like sisters they can look
different nipples can be inward that can
be outward they can be brown pink purple
you know there's a variety of different
colors we have light peach fuzz around
our you know nipples and our boobs hair
isn't abnormal you know all these things
are normal they're weird they can be
gross they could be funny
but they are things that are normal -
boobs but when you start seeing abnormal
things that's when you want to talk
about it with an adult my sixth um in
hygiene tip is to moisturize everything
before you go to bed at night this is
the time where our body refreshes it
gets its night beauty sleep and I want
everything to be perfectly hydrated
especially for a person like me who has
super dry dry dry dry skin I want to
make sure everything on me is hydrated
so my legs my hands especially I make
sure I boy stur eyes my face if you have
a facial skin care routine do that
before you go to bed I put on my snit
cream I make sure to do that because
overnight I feel like my skin is the
most repairing of acne so I put all that
on after I apply my moisturizer all over
my face I put tons and tons of chapstick
on never go to bed with makeup on
because that will just ruin your skin
that is the time that it needs to
breathe especially if you wear makeup
everyday that is just one chance of the
day to breathe and if you go to sleep in
makeup that's your own deal but it's a
really just damage in your skin over
time so make sure you take that all off
and lather yourself up with moisture and
crawl into bed and get a good night's
sleep
this 7 feminine hygiene tip is all about
periods just to take showers off it we
all have blood down there from the
that's dried for the night before so
it's the first thing I do if I wake up I
brush my teeth and I hop in the shower
when I'm on my period every morning you
don't have to but that makes me stay
fresh stay clean my number 8 feminine
hygiene tip is all about mustaches
because we get them okay whether you're
blonde brunette redhead
black hair whatever kind of hair you
have we all have peach fuzz here some
darker than others especially due to our
race ethnicity whatever and that's fine
if you want to keep that hair there keep
the hair there but that was another
thing my friends were always like my
advice to you is you can get your lip
wax make sure you go into a reputable
place though don't go to some like
sketchy waxing place you've never heard
of and no one knows about just cuz it's
cheaper but I've talked about this
before this thing called a Clio I know
what it's called now CLI oh I get it
mine at Walmart but tart has it as well
and it's just a little razor um that
doesn't have a blade it's like this
little green things it turns on like
this it's a vibrating machine thing
that's run by like one or two batteries
in here that they come with and you just
kind of go along here and that gets rid
of all my hairs um that I have on my
upper lip I have dark hair so I have
dark upper lip hair just for my eyebrows
Anna every girl has it it's not
embarrassing but I get rid of it using
this every every day or two I'll do this
and mine have not been crazy since like
high school I never have a mustache so
anymore
number nine is all about sex all I'll
say is make sure you're practicing safe
sex you hear that from everyone but it
is of utmost importance because one
minute of pleasure is not worth an
entire month or lifespan worth of
diseases and health care bills you're
gonna have to put if you aren't safe if
you're sleeping with multiple people
multiple partners try to get to know
their sexual history it can be awkward
it can be embarrassing things like hey
how many people have you slept with you
know that can be weird and maybe they
don't want to talk about it but if they
don't want to talk about it that might
put up a red flag like maybe they're
hiding something and also if they
haven't been tested maybe ask them to do
that if you're worried about it before
you get started just always use a condom
especially if you're not sure where
they've been especially if you are prone
to easy infection especially if you're
not on the pill it's tough like that you
need to be using a condo does it feel
better with or without who cares really
because you need to make
sure that you're being safe my 11th tip
for feminine hygiene is to exercise just
to overall feel better
I didn't exercise for about 20 years of
my life I'm being real and I was kind of
unhappy mentally physically emotionally
everything was just kind of off with me
not every day not every year but just
overall I feel like I could live a
happier and more successful life but I
didn't know how to get there I run every
day and it just really helps me gain
weight which I wanted to do it's made me
happier it's gotten me so much more
stress-free I don't have any anxious
problems anymore because I run away when
I have no problem when something's kind
of weighing on me whatever is going on
in my life if I like run or exercise
whether that's dancing at the gym yoga
um Pilates and elliptical walking even
anything that you do that's just
physical activity or exercise makes me
feel so much better number 12 is based
around underwear I typically don't wear
much underwear I like to keep everything
out there just like aired out and free
but if you are gonna wear underwear
which is perfectly normal and what most
people do make sure just to keep
everything fresh down there that you're
wearing cotton underwear I know they're
not the cutest underwear ever but this
is what allows the most like breath of
breathability is that word ones even
like that so these is cotton with lace
this allows much air flow nothing stays
wet or sticky down there like everything
gets air and the smell stays fresh
beautiful underwear these like silk nice
very soft touch ones this is what
doesn't allow you for China to breathe
because the material is so thick so
stick to cotton and you'll be good to go
or stick to know when you're wearin just
be a free lass like me the last you tips
are pretty self-explanatory and simple
but I had to include them because I'd
want to know this make sure you're
brushing your teeth at least once a day
preferably twice in the morning at night
and make sure your brushing your tongue
because especially if you're kissing and
switching saliva a lot there's just a
lot of bacteria there and it really
clumps on the tongue and no one wants
that a white tongue it should be red and
pink so make sure you are scraping it
don't scrape off your taste buds but
make sure you're scraping it with the
bristles on your toothbrush just after
you brush your teeth don't forget about
that because that also contributes
heavily to bad breath and the last tip
is
this simple phrase that I just
constructed sex shouldn't hurt peeing
shouldn't hurt in inserting tampons
should it hurt so if any of those three
things hurts that's when you know you
have a problem if you're peeing and it
hurts or it burns or it stings that is
nuts what's happening is the thing we do
20 times a day
and that should not be happening so that
is usually the sign of an infection or
something wrong down there and get that
checked out
inserting tampons should not hurt if
you're inserting it wrong it either
means that you're like vaginas aren't
always just like straight up like some
curve to the left or right or more
setback or more up and down so make sure
you know how to like put in a tampon
before you just like shoving it up there
because all of our vaginas are kind of
bent and turned a little differently and
it might be a trial and error process to
figure yours out but a tampon shouldn't
hurt it doesn't mean they have an
infection if it hurts it just means that
you're not putting it in right so go
slow and steady don't shove it or jam it
up in you this is what a tampon looks
like this is your like vagina opening
and you're putting it in its usually
goes not like straight up but like a
little up angle and this little grip
where you put your hands that should be
almost all up in your vagina before you
then go insert with this thing that is
how it gets all the way up in there and
feels comfortable to move to exercise to
sit because if you feel a tampon in you
which you shouldn't you didn't do it
right and that means that it's going to
be very painful in a not comfy you're
not gonna get an infection per se but it
also might cause a leakage because it's
not perfectly situated in there and also
sex shouldn't hurt the first time yeah
it's gonna hurt because most likely your
hymen hasn't broke with a little
stretchy skin at the entrance of the
balm the bottom entrance of the vagina
the first time that will break and it'll
snap and bleed for like an hour
very light bleeding though and then
you'll be fine it might be sore for a
day or two after but then you'll be fine
section of you painful though and if it
is and you talk to your partner maybe
you have an infection if it's kind of a
stinging feeling but if it's like an
aching feeling that means that it's
either not going in right he's jamming
it too hard whatever it shouldn't hurt
so just make sure that you're keeping
out watch for those three things and
making sure that they're painless cuz
that's how girls are supposed to live so
