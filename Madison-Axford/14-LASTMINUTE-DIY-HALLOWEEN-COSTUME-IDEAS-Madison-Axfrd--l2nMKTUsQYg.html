release last year it was so much fun to
do it was my mom's idea it was her idea
again so definitely thank her and follow
her on her social media her Instagram is
Cyndi Axford go follow her she would
love it but it's her idea to push me to
do these videos in and very encouraging
so I love that and so you can thank her
for helping me create yet another one
this video she helps record and helps
finalize the outfits with me I got a lot
of the pieces about what's from my
sister my mom and so this just proves
that you can find these things in your
normal house so um yes I took home DIY
because I put these outfits together
myself
they're not like DIY crafty cutting
gluing creating things but I created the
outfits from pieces of clothing I my
sister and my mom have in our house I
just wanna give a big shout out and
thank you to my mom and my sister for
everything in this video but yes so I'm
really excited it's for a variety of
people from you know ages 8 I guess to
like 30 so anyone could wear any of
these outfits you just have to choose
which one is appropriate and right for
you and it depends what you're going to
average sugar trading a neighborhood
verse like a bar Halloween party you
would obviously wear something different
and you need to use your best judgment
to pick that but I didn't do it because
it's super fun I love the holiday
