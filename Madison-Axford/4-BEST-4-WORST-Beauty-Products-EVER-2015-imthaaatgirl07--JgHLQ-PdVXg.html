new then he had done months like this
before the past it's the four best
products that I found ever and the four
worst products I've found ever and
they're all makeup so it's not like hair
skincare anything but they're all
strictly makeup and believe me I know
these lures products that I've ever
found I don't have that many that's why
I only have four best and for worse
because when I love a product I love it
with all my heart
and I use it everyday and when I hate a
product I try too much time to make sure
I hate it so I don't to give you the
wrong impression but I do hate these if
you like them I know tons of people that
love these products that's totally fine
and and you know you might not like you
some of the ones I like it when I hate
having to put a disclaimer like this in
front of all the videos but people think
that when I have an opinion that's
strong about a makeup product that means
I've opinion about like them to you and
like a finally this product I like them
that's not true obviously that is not
true um if you had this product is just
awesome it just did not work for me for
my skin and I was expecting much more
from these so you probably heard me talk
about all of these best and worst before
if I'm just reiterating them right now
because some deserves more recognition
and some deserve more recognition for
being awful so you don't buy them and
waste your money on them like I did
anyway my first best product ever is
Studio Fix powder by Mac it's a
foundation so it's a very very heavy
Powder Mountain setting or a pressed
powder it is a foundation powder in I of
it and she and c-5 actually a few of
these because I love them so much they
run from I think 25 to 30 dollars maybe
it looks too dark for me it has yellow
undertones and if you know me I have
pink undertones but I am tanner now like
I said so this does imagine everything's
great great terrific um I love this
because it covers up my red cheeks and
he said I have eye
reading about this so much but I got
this from my system for
Christmas and it's just wonderful and it
totally replaced Foundation for me I
don't use foundation anymore I have no
foundation on right now and I have it
the past few months ish because I switch
to this and it's just as if you can see
that it's super super dense and it
covers up everything you think but not
like heavy so you don't feel like oh my
god so much you know poop and crap on my
face like I did when I wear foundation
hair would anyone wears foundation it
just makes you feel like so light but
you know you have amazing coverage if
you have bad acne however mine isn't you
have Betsy and I would recommend this if
you have redness or discoloration like I
do I would recommend this and I just
love it
Mac is known for high-quality it thank
not disappoint with this they do not
disappoint with this the next product is
also a Mac and it's really any mac
lipstick in general MAC lipsticks have
are so high quality but this one in
particular is angel it's just one of
their most like bought lipsticks one of
the most popular by far especially for
pink shade and it is just this is my
second two and I'm almost out of it
again so I need to go get another one
I love this so much I wear it every
single day of my life but it's just our
angel
it's literally one of the most popular
ones it's just a nice baby pink you can
layer on top of you know other lip
colors and it lasts a really long time
it doesn't keep your lips a weird crease
or anything like some lipsticks do they
some lipsticks like dry really match and
they're weird like I don't know they're
just like sinking the creases of your
lips I hate that MAC lipsticks do not
because they're very creamy and moist
and I love them so so much they're
pretty cheap to form a curling like 15
which I don't have those cheap for you
but lipstick slaps a long long hiatus
every day and I still have tons left and
so it's not that bad in my opinion for
high-quality candle and another plus I'm
not sponsored by the way obviously I
mean back without sponsor me but um they
taste amazing and I'm not saying go eat
it but you know if you have that boy you
gonna be like your lips good it not to
be a weird but like if whether or not
you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend or
whatever um you know but it tastes good
or maybe you're just enjoying yourself
it tastes good it's not a lipstick
that's gonna have a weird taste
it's big-city how do you like cupcakes I
love it I love it
that's got weird but I love it okay
moving on is a favorite of mine so it's
been around for a very long time
on this channel it's Maybelline line
stiletto liquid liner I appointed this
everyday on my eyelid so that's like two
years almost now this one I bought me
one stone this one for two years now if
it goes they run out a little not
quickly but it when you wear it every
day did you run out kind of quickly but
I just love the applicator that this has
it's so precise and long and I don't
know it just gives me the perfect line
every day it's a perfect weight if you
want to do the traumatic cat eye or not
I love it and just shake it up and
you're ready to go I absolutely adored
this liquid liner and I'll never switch
as far as I'm concerned and lastly we
have another in
product on this channel to your face
better than sex mascara oh crap I love
this stuff this is just the travel size
I've had many many full-size of this
before so don't think I'm just lightly
trying this travel size no I love it so
much I also have travel size that I take
with me everywhere this is amazing
here's the brush shape make sure lashes
no matter how long or short your lashes
are huge and amazing and separate it and
thick and wonderful and black and just
awful and awful and just amazing yes so
I a special look using this for my
bottom lashes because my bottom lashes
tend to like be tiny but I can make them
bigger and longer with this I just
cannot do like a wiggle motion huh
everyone does that paper and they just
look out Saturday and I love this
I won't try to go back to you Maybelline
great lush lashes it wasn't working for
me so I've now returned to fit better
than sex mascara moving on to the four
worst products ever again if you like
these don't be like you're being
dramatic
I like those you're rude you not say
that like okay the video is supposed to
be preventing people from buying these I
like these companies so don't think that
like I hate these companies obviously
not this products didn't like break out
or get a rash so that's not the problem
either don't be hating on the companies
that I definitely don't I just these
certain products that were just like
and I heard great reviews about them so
then I button they stop folks like first
product is you've seen these probably
all four bunch reiterating Too Faced
melted liquefied long wear lipstick in
the shade you so I got this cuz I love
Neil if something like lips matches your
skin I know some people I hate that
thing it's like gross and like it looks
like you have concealer on your lips but
I have a preference of liking that so
this is not nude this to me I'm sorry
that's not nude that's around I don't
know how I mean it could be a new but
it's a really really dark nude which has
been brown I don't like this at all it
makes you look so dry out so Matt and I
know I get it I know I know it's a long
wear lipstick so that's what they do
they kind of drag your lips and get mad
I absolutely hate this I made my mom try
and she hated it my sister tried it she
didn't like it like no one likes this
but I let try it is that who I waste
money on this I hate wasting money hey
what do you money I'm sure everyone does
I'm just so pissed that I wasted money
on these items but now I'm going to try
to benefit from wasting money on these
by telling you I pass but that's about
it
hey I don't know I keep explaining
myself as like the sixth time and done
that anyway
yeah to face a long word now it's a
disgusting color it's not nude at all
it's so dark and usually people who buy
new in one a really light lip color and
this is brown no it's bad goodbye wait
man on to the next awful product is one
of the worst it's Laura Mercier supreme
foundation in the shade self ivory
you've heard this story before I went to
the actual like kiosk the up Laura
Mercier in Nordstrom's earth and Saks I
think it was in fact sacked the Saks
Fifth Avenue and um I was like I want to
be pill
as my normal skin tone is pale I was
like I have one you know to match my
color exactly and I don't want to be tan
I just want to have a nice and decent
regular skin color because I get so much
crap all the time for saying that my
skin doesn't match my face neck arms
hand whatever it doesn't match and so
this was about 1/2 years ago I think is
that I got this yeah it's so much less
because I don't use it
I've tried to use it so many times the
way it comes off is just so what's the
word ah it's very thick but then it like
misses spots on your face like it's so
it doesn't provide good coverage at all
the color is fine but it does not
provide a good coverage at all
and barely blends and lots of dust they
like cracks okay that's the word I was
looking for it cracks around my nose and
my forehead so much so this is what it
looks like as you can see it like it
looks like it provides good coverage
because it is very very it's covering a
lot but you know once it sets it
literally turns disgusting and you know
I have all this crap book both man and I
have tried to use this many times before
I have tried to use this you know just
like I'll take months off and these
different foundations that I love and
they come back to this and just even
worse and spend $50 on this and
our fifty-five or something it was so
expensive and I'm just absolutely maybe
it was just my face you probably love
less like I know tons of people like
stare about 93 X and Elle Fowler who
love this is why I bought it and it just
didn't work for me it may work for you
so maybe you want to try it it just it
didn't provide any coverage for me it
cracked it crap next we have another
foundation which is the magic skin
beautifier of beauty cream I put this in
my Valentine's new video from two years
ago and I've recently tried it again
and the thing is when you first put it
on it provides a good color it's a bit
orange they only have like three shades
since it is beet cream they don't have
it's like light medium dark never have
many shades to pick from and so
obviously I got the light one because I
didn't want to be orange but somehow I
used to turn orange anyway yeah no I put
this on tonight a few months ago because
I was trying it again like a year to
pass so we he'll try it again because
it's like a makeup collection and I put
this on and maybe it was like my brush
lighting or whatever but like I put it
on and I was like oh this looks great
this is good coverage what was I
thinking before it and then I left the
house to go to my Nana's house for like
especially Church thing and then
literally my face was so splotchy and my
mom was like oh my god what did you do
and I was like what I opened like a
mirror and I was like because I this
comes out white and then matches your
skin tone see you know it sounds good it
sounds like oh cool it doesn't matter
what color I am it'll I bet Shemesh you
know my skin color and know it makes you
Orange no matter what skin color skin
tone skin tone you are and its various
blush you can't see where you put it on
really you just kind of like rub it in
and hope for the best and I thought I
could
every inch of my face and like I know I
did but there was a gap my face not
really white and not being orange it was
bad it was a bet old time so so what
this looks like so it comes out you can
see that like white it's very very funny
too so it comes out like this and then
it takes a few minutes but then it'll
blend in see it's blending into the
color on my hand okay so you can see it
does a good job of blending but it it
will look so OS bachi no matter what on
you it would looks lucky okay like
literally I blended this and put so many
layers and song still exposure it's like
magic skin splotchy baby came I don't
know I made my last ah my last worst
product is surprising I had this in my
box ever got buying it's just the NARS
orgasm blush okay
this is the thing that I know elf and
NARS blush are these same exact bushes
you want to be different if that elf has
a little cutout right here that has like
um so you can see the color and it says
elf on it and it's on another like $30
cheaper than this one and you're only
paying for the name and that on the
front for this in there they they are
almost the same colors all the out
pushes Ian's and are as much as in the
same exact packaging expands engineer
this thing exact amount bounces and this
is what this looks like okay so it looks
really weird already it looks kind of
like
these is on it I got know why it looks
like that but okay so I like rub my
finger so hard and like not much as
picking up okay it's all my middle
finger
not much big do you see that I know
nothing picked up I think that you
really made me mad was that there's a
color just off of this the most number
one bought color everyone loves this
color everyone oh my god oh my god oh my
god oh my god oh my god look NARS Laguna
bronzer in a NARS orgasm blush or the
shaded by oh my god those high-end
things you need about you need it on
this in your recollection so have it and
I never use it this letter just sits in
mine like makeup bag and I never touch
this ever because it just is not good
color there's so many other companies
and blushes that are great grand
cherokee that i would so much more
recommend than this and i don't know why
everyone raved about this I don't know
why I felt the need to buy it I mean I
know I need to buy excess convinced by
the meteor's that you need to get it and
have this to be a you know a real like
makeup percent you know you do not need
this this is a base waste of money
literally don't show you in my Elif is
the same exact thing except it doesn't
have numbers on the front I didn't know
yet at the time but now I do we know
that I compared in they're the exact
dupes Oh
senator that makes me kind of mad but it
see this is what I'm talking about
this foundation is still not dry and I
just touched my leg hold up
and like look at that are you kidding me
