I'm doing a really exciting tag called
the 40 o Beauty questions tagged and I
really wanted to do this because I love
the questions that they have to offer I
haven't really looked at them but I look
to the first category of skincare I'm
just really like them it's not just like
do you let me get with you favorite
mascara I mean it's more intense than
that so let's go right ahead cuz there's
40 questions and well first category is
skin care how many times do you wash
your face daily twice I wish at once in
the morning when I take a shower with my
clean and clear like wash and like it's
like orange and then at night I wash on
my new Jeana face wash and then I do
like I'm makeup remover towelette I'm
toner and I make remover in all this
stuff what skin dude do you have dry oil
your combo out of combo because some
parts are really really oily and Crilley
and some are something really dry what
is your current facial wash like i said
its new Jeana and clean and clear the
clean and clear orange one I really
don't know to call it and then just the
regular blue neutrogena one yes foley
eight no it's so good i really never
have um it's really really sad i need to
be going on that i know it's bad i'll
start to do it you know and the upcoming
months but i really never have it it's
awful but my sins pretty good so what
brand do you use besides the one clean
clear face while i have right now that I
don't really like everything is
neutrogena what moisturizer do you use
obviously neutrogena the combination
pink one your freckles yes I do I have a
lot of reckless but I do cover them up
my BB cream now because I don't like
them but just because there's way too
many and I'd put makeup on so we're just
ends up covering them did you use eye
cream no I do not um you know I don't do
you or did you have acne prone skin um
yeah I do I think I still do but I don't
get a big break out in a while I do have
like random sits so no it's not that bad
of acne but I do get it did you ever use
to use Proactiv no I have never been on
anything for acne next category is
makeup in my nose which is what
foundation you use well usually I use
neutrogena skin clearing foundation but
right now I use the BB cream by Garnier
how about concealer no i don't use any
concealer ladies BB cream right now and
i mean i don't really feel knew that i
have any blemishes to cover up her dark
circles right now and get plenty of
sleep
summer so I don't use it right now but
usually i would use like couple girl or
baby or something like that or maybe
benefit do you know you're under tone
color yes it's really purple and pink
really um what do you think of fake
eyelashes I used to know I hate them
I've had a lot about experience with
them I don't get ahead loom on did you
know that you're supposed to change your
rescuer every three months obviously and
I don't have a problem with throwing it
away i use it within three months like
seriously I just dope through it so
quickly and I mean I don't know how you
cannot know that it's disgusting to keep
your mascara for longer what Brian was
here to use always always always
Maybelline or maybe benefit but usually
always Maybelline kiss drugstore mascara
and the best um great loss loss lashes
is my favorite and it's really cheap 24
hour max before they have so much more
to offer do you have a mac pro card no I
do not what makeup tools to use in a
makeup application sesa means like
brushes and stuff I use an IRA spoolie a
Mac eyebrow brush um maybe bronzer brush
by don't I haven't warm runs in a long
time and a Beauty Blender sponge for my
BB cream do you make a base or primer
for the eyes yeah if I'm gonna do
eyeshadow user becase I shadow primer
and sin um for the face yes i would use
all mais the it looks like DNA like the
correcting one with purple and green and
stuff but i don't use it under BB cream
right now what is your favorite
eyeshadow like I have a lot but hands
down my all-time favorite is the
gunmetal the blue tlass color and the
naked tell at the blue one I just love
pairing this with a nice and white color
from the Stila in the moment purple
palette and i just love wearing that
jerk color because you can make it light
or really dark and smoky do you use
pencil or liquid eyeliner i use both
pencil on what happens i use like it's
like wax like a roll up one so i don't
really use pencil but I use it on the
tight line in one line and then liquid
on the outer half of my upper I haven't
you poke your eyes with an item until
all the time when I'm through my
waterline and I've contacts in so I
can't feel it so it doesn't really hurt
but I poke the contact a lot and I'm
like Bob what do you think of pigment
eyeshadows they're ok I don't prefer to
use them I just you know I mean they
show up better but I don't really use
them that much use mineral makeup no I
hate that stuff what's your favorite
lipstick probably one by Maybelline or
just like a baby lips which is
Maybelline but i don't i'm not a huge
fan of lipstick that's like i said i
just don't look good in it how about lip
gloss i do not worry
at all what is your favorite blush to
use elf they're really cheap of three
dollars if you get the right kind it
turns out break you buy your makeup on
eBay no that's nest you do not do that
you like drugstore makeup of course you
can not slim to yourself to sephora and
mac because you're gonna waste so much
money um do you go to cosmetic company
outlets no I do not did you ever
consider taking makeup classes no I
think makeup should come naturally
whatever you put on you is your talent
no you shouldn't take classes oh my god
are you clumsy I'm putting on makeup no
I am really I think I'm a perfectionist
attics I'm a perfectionist at everything
in life I just perfect my putting on
makeup name a makeup crime that you hate
when people put that shadow on without
primer no do I colorful shade some
makeup lipstick eye shadows or initial
ones i like both but i prefer like
bright colors which celebrity always has
great makeup kim kardashian while all
the Kardashians seriously all the
Kardashians if you could leave the house
using just one makeup item what would
you use my BB cream or mascara but like
not together like I had to pick one and
be like in the BB cream 1 day or just
mascara one day probably be mechanics
emissions really just a lot of different
colors if I don't have that to even it
out because you definitely have saturday
makeup on die do it a lot do you think
you look good even without any makeup on
I don't think I do in your video what's
the best makeup line maybelline and
drugstore in and high-end benefit and
what do you think of makeup i love
makeup I don't think you necessarily
need to put so much on you need like a
lot but I do think it enhances your
inner beauty if you like create your
outer beauty and like it's fun just
paint on you know new look every day and
it's a good way of expression and to
create you know just like your passion I
just really really like it and enjoy it
in such passion of mine and I hope you
