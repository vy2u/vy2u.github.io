someone is trying to fucking roast me
this time they're trying to come for me
I get mean comments on the literal
second not even daily like on the
frickin second and it's fine calm hello
comments do not faze me at all I don't
get sad about them I rarely get mad
about them and I'm not even mad at right
now I'm actually kind of I don't know
humored by this whole thing and thought
I would share with you
um I literally don't get mad I don't get
offended people call me ugly all the
time like people say I should die yeah
that's disgusting but I just don't get
fazed by it you have to have a fucking
sick skin to be on YouTube or get off
because you can't be on here be like a
sissy big come again someone said an
ugly no okay you got to have balls or
get off the internet so this little
person once they tried to come for me
today okay she's roasting me and I'm and
I hold on bitch so I put out your fire
before you even get started so I'm going
on to my comments like I do I don't do
it very often um unless I like s to nip
up a video I'll check them and try to
reply to a few I do see them but I don't
check them that often because they're so
negative all the time especially since
like Jacob videos mine took off that I
just really look at them anymore because
they're just kind of annoying I just
don't even care to look at him I'm like
well but with a guy with tooth gap
people think my makeup looks bad bill of
like I don't have fuck so I just don't
really look at him much that being said
I was all in there today and I saw this
I narrowed Rainville
comment on my video and I was like boom
it was on my Jacob sweatshirt music
video reaction I was like well this girl
has a lot of f-words let me read this so
let's just let's just go ahead okay okay
fuck you swamps again this person
doesn't have a picture icon so maybe
it's like an old man like a Jacob fan
maybe like 15 16 like I was like okay I
had many different options of who this
could be but who turned out to be is not
what I ever thought it would be anyway
you have no friends you've you fucking
bitch ass fuck you in your life don't
hate on Miranda you are racist no wonder
you're single I mean you know you know
props freezing the right grammar like
that's good right there
don't
Miranda I wasn't hitting on Miranda and
she's talking about Midas things a
fictional carrot girl calm yo tits okay
and then I'm racist um I don't know if
I'm racist but I know I'm definitely not
racist if that's what you're going for
it says cn7 s so then I'm thinking
either this person is so angry there's
type of like a mad person and
accidentally misspelled or therefore one
of those is correct you'll see no wonder
you're single bitch you don't know my
life okay you don't know me like that
you know I'm singling up okay anyway um
so that was the first comment I saw and
I was just like okay whatever um she
comes to another one it was something
about like me dying which those comments
I'm like okay that's not cool that's
just scary now if you comment about my
death so I usually block those people
it's rare but they're there um you know
the kill yourself comments are always
there I'm the ones that are like sang
about my death I'm like I need to block
this person and then there's this
comment as like and this person's got to
go they're obviously not a fan or
someone who wants to watch my videos
this probably only video they saw on it
piss them off so I'm just gonna block
them and get them you know away from my
channel so I go on to their channel page
because I I think that's is that the
only way yeah I think that's the only
way you can block someone but suppose
channel entirely is to go on to their
actual channel page so here I have I
narrowed Rainville and I went to her
channel and she's one video and I was
like oh this is great because usually
people who come for me really hard or
really try to cuss me out and they have
a video I'm like oh my god like I want
to see this person if you should like a
gamer not stereotyping gamers in
slightest but it's always a game thing
that you're gonna take comments from
because when I look at their videos it's
never their face but this go had a video
of her her face is on then I really
really can't okay it's literally called
me singing and she's literally seven I
cannot I can't and before any of you
people try to come on here be I Madison
she is so young how dare you that is
show me bitch
if you're gonna come on here and be like
fuck you fuck you fuck you oh my god oh
my god oh my god and try to come for
Muse almost twenty and you're gonna
actually you have some boats or some
badass I can come for you just as hard
ok don't pretend
I'm some bully Oh on your Sony she's so
tiny if she's tiny why the hell she
talking like that okay where are the
parents
I don't know what is this girl doing
with her time I don't know
but she needs to get like something I
almost feel bad for him I can't get some
help girl because that is not normal
behavior for someone such at a young age
as you
it's extremely inappropriate and um yeah
you're seven literally when I was seven
I was still playing with Barbies I don't
understand kids these days like how do
you even know the F word I don't eat I
don't know I don't get it I just have
the audacity to come on my video and
comment that there's more comments for
don't worry but but this video this
feature because what I want to watch so
here we go we're gonna read I haven't
watched it yet me singing here we go
shouldn't try to come for me let's let's
go a little girl she put this up today
literally today let's go let's get
started let's see what she has come on
today guys this is my first picking out
literally a fetus this will be somewhere
over the rainbow we're gonna like I'm
really hoping you got this girl and I
got to hear that vibrato that Tim let's
go and you do you know okay
you can't come for me of my videos and
even edit this down talk to watch you
struggle with the karaoke music you
can't leave all these mean comments in
to put this
hold on I know you're all gonna come up
here be like medicine can you think
bitch I'm like um I don't know I don't
sing like I know little kids often sing
like this but then again little kids
that don't put videos open YouTube so
forget about a video up on YouTube like
can I hear you without chewing my volume
up to max volume leaving the right pitch
of the notes you don't even have a song
even the right rhythm oh thank you guys
heavy great hey smile on that face quick
smile on our face girl Andy don't
anything but to tell you anything else
what the fuck is this
don't let anybody tell you anything else
okay you the rich said go out there put
a smile on your face and be you don't
anyone tell you what whatever the fuck
you just said which is everything again
to what you come tell my videos you're
telling me that I'm wrong this that
Bluff a bit like that's really so
critical overly cynical
I know another song yeah it'd be
different if I just came on here being a
bitch being like this random girl I
shouldn't leave any comment video I mean
that you suck because that's rude we're
gonna put this video of the day you
comin was make comments in Dixon no girl
no have signed it back yourself up with
that's not this video anyway I typed in
her name I narrowed range I'll define
more comments from her and see if she
commented any more of my videos so she
literally went on a few of my videos
including the rekted the gorilla one my
no mirror makeup challenge and then the
Jacob one so obviously if you hate me so
much where the hell are you wasting time
watching my videos literally what are
you doing with your life obviously not
taking singing lessons okay so here we
have this one and then we have she like
went on I guess and come to a bunch of
hate comments at work toward me and like
agree with them so we here we have I'm
sure she looks like a gorilla face
without makeup and then she's like yeah
okay next one New York you are your
attitude is so effing in the lying and
then she comments I know she is so
fucking annoying oMG my brain cells just
left due to your effing voice yes okay
this doesn't end she needs to not
customize very tacky yes girl you can't
agree with the comment it's also
directed towards you did you just see
your last week all this you all head
upwards in it where'd you get the
light-up em in the background and then
we have all these nice comments where
you get a em light up light you are
fucked up girl three hours ago really
really this is my first and last video
from you I'll ever watch said someone
and then she said where's her where's
her where's her where's her yep girl
it's not the last video though cuz you
literally watched at least four of them
oh and then we have her last comment
ready this is a good one
get some popcorn get a snack are you
ready for this you bitch the guerrilla
was not protecting the kid you need to
understand that you stupid fucking bitch
no wonder you ate so fucking stupid
because you can't understand anything
you probably don't even know mo what 2
plus 2 is no wonder you only have as
many subscribers as you have hold up I
never compare numbers like that's not a
big deal with me if I have one person
that follows me that's incredible and
might change one person's life or did
something to help them that's incredible
the subscribers is just a blessing a
gift that comes along with it I'm not
like only doing this for subscribers
that's disgusting but if you're going to
come for me and say you only have as
many subscribers as you have let's go to
your channel what was that what was that
what was that what was that thank you
one goodbye don't even try okay because
nobody likes you you are a fucking bitch
and an ass hole a pice of shit and
stupid the boy felt in not decided to
walk in if you weren't so stupid then
you wouldn't know that there was a gate
like I said everybody hates you and that
is why that one Oh none
no no no no no that is where that one
cancer lady was being so nice because
she felt bad for you sorry you make fun
of me you come for me that's fine you do
that all the time it'll make you feel
better you do not cook for anyone else
and call someone a cancer lady it was a
beautiful woman who's adorable son is
suffering right now cancer and how dare
you write that disgusting sentence no no
so I think that concludes this video of
the five-year-old roasting me she really
came for me she really tried but in the
end we exposed you hon so if you're not
ready to come up to subscribe to my show
become a fierce coven do you like me the
rest of son here really I'm not a bitch
I just was given proof and I'm going to
combat that so if you were prom with
that you know some saw this video and
move the hell on but if you like this
video give it a thumbs up and comment
down below if you want make it more of
these I don't want to draw attention to
haters but at the same time it's kind of
funny if there's like stuff like this
like evidence like of who this person is
so thank you guys so much for watching
guys honestly mean the world to me and
um to play with new videos
okay so much bye
