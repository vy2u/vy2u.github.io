did your video go where did the five
year old rest in the shit I'd imagine
expert go great question thank you so
much for asking
I suggest before I get any further in
with this video if the parents of this
kid are watching make sure your kid is
out of the room this time video was
doing great I put it up knowing that I
was not being a bully or really being
rude that video really was me reacting
and me responding to extreme extreme
profanity through the form of hate
comments those are some of the most
profane cons I ever received on my
channel honestly so I responded to it
like I said I rarely check on comments
and see them but I don't check them that
often because they're so negative all
the time especially since like Jacob
videos mine took off that I just really
look at them anymore like those the very
first statements in the video I really
checked but the one time I check and see
her 19 disgusting comments I was like a
little caught off guard and I wanted to
respond so everything was going fine I
had a lot of shit that I was doing
yesterday so I upload the video and then
I was gone like I was doing work work
work not checking comments I was not on
the computer like everyone thinks I am
all the time I guess being a youtuber
doesn't mean I spend every waking second
on the computer checking comments
checking my youtube videos so I get a
message from the mother or the stepmom
as her Instagram bio claims to say
telling me what happened okay so she's
telling me after they found out because
I guess some of my viewers or people who
viewed the video went on her dad's
channel and like told him to like stop
his daughter from commenting mean things
stuff like that
okay this is the message let's just go
through this hi Madison I'm mr. GU in
regards in the video about the link my
husband brought the videos to my
attention and I watch it we both really
confused because they watch this is the
kicker we watch her internet activity
very closely and I've never seen her use
that kind of language let's just stop
right there okay we watch her
interactivity very closely and we never
seen use that kind of language yet if
you're checking for activity you would
have seen these comments being made if
you're actually on that much of a watch
to protect her and whether or not they
were made from your daughter you sort of
seen them under her account activity if
you were actually checking it therefore
your statement is already invalid and
doesn't really make me want to keep on
reading and believe what you say because
that could have been stopped if your
being responsible if you say you were
and checking it because whether or not
it came from that source you can check
the IP address you can check the details
you can actually delve deep into this
and check to see and then stop it from
going any further so she continues on to
say long story short we found out her
accounts were hacked I find that very
very hard to believe you just through
Google Plus now it's very hard for those
accounts to be hacked it's possible for
sure if if the account was hacked and
really confused unusually a hacker like
not like I'm some hacker knowledged
person but they usually changed the
password or attempt to change the
password as soon as they log into an
account that they're hacked and all the
comments were made by this apparent
hacker that the parents are claiming or
made on the same exact day that she was
present on the channel for the first
time and uploaded to singing video which
makes it very hard and almost an
impossible statement unless clear proof
was provided that they could say the
hacker had done this because it would
have been coming from two to four
computers which it would have logged one
of them out it would have locked out the
original owner which was that young girl
out of her thing if the hacker had come
in and changed a password or the hacker
would have been able to get in it makes
it just makes this story very again
unbelievable and hard to understand they
gave me proof then I would believe him
I'm just giving the benefit of the doubt
right now I'm not gonna be told that
should be like I was not hacked by it
might have been but you're not giving me
proof so it's very hard to believe but
anyway back to parenting if you were
actually checking her account you would
have seen these comments being made
right away confronted her deleted the
comments maybe apologized to the
accounts that they had been written on
and maybe you even would have had them
removed before I saw them if you were
watching her account activity but no
they were left there they're still up
there you still haven't removed them I
reacted to it create a video from it
because I was so pissed off that someone
would leave these disgusting comments my
video therefore if you were doing what
you actually claimed that you're doing
making sure you keep such an eye on her
and all of her internet activity keep in
mind she's 10 why the hell is she on the
Internet in the first place I don't know
then maybe this all wouldn't have
happened oh wait it wouldn't have
happened so really when it comes down to
it I did nothing I did not bully I
reacted to what I was given from your
daughters claimed hacked account and
really it's your fault in the end the
parents show you and all your mom
friends who are coming on my channel and
basically bullying me and calling me all
these names because I wasn't on my
computer checking comments to see your
comment in your email right away have
you to be thanked for this whole entire
mess it's not my responsibility
the slightest to watch your daughter's
activity make sure her accounts not
hacked I had one comment which I will
get you later from one of the mom's
friends that they claim that says I
should have checked to see of their
accounts hacked when I get a hate
comment I did not run someone's channel
be like oh my god react could you leave
the hate 99% of the time it is from that
person and it is hey but I just find it
so hard to believe that you think it's
my fault for not messaging your daughter
on YouTube to say is this account hacked
first one thing I didn't even have a
profile picture which makes it very hard
yet again because its identity less to
think that the accounts being hacked
because it was a nice little picture of
a daughter or a girl a young girl and
then choosing these comments it might
put up a red flag it might look
suspicious but it looks like a normal
hate account so we have this first
comment from apparently one of the mom's
friends that she says her mother posted
in this thread and said that her child's
account had been hacked her mother is a
personal friend who saw the her daughter
accidentally clicked on a phishing site
she said Madison a message explained
what happened and as Madison interested
know coz Madison enjoys seeing little
girls get bullied in she likes her in
and out points how the fuck dare you say
that to me
get off my channel with your disgusting
comments I've been bullying in the past
I've been targeted in the past I've been
harassed in the past and you're gonna
come on here and say that I like seeing
little kids get bullied in my entire
channel my entire life and reputation is
standing against bullying and promoting
confidence and young girls and boys how
dare you you are disgusting to me I
didn't take the video down right away
because I was living my life like a
normal human being I wasn't sitting on
there Peter and looking at comments
refreshing it every two seconds to make
sure no one's feelings got hurt
okay maybe if the kid didn't have a
youtube channel at the tender age of 10
this wouldn't be happening
back to the mom's email she says I don't
know if you have kids but no I'm not a
parent like you but I can tell you for
damn sure my kid will not be on the
internet until they are of legal age and
legal standards through Google+ Facebook
YouTube Twitter Instagram whatever the
hell other social media site which is 13
which I think I I'm pretty sure your
daughter is not 13 which is actually
guess the standards and will be reported
to YouTube thank you very much for
pointing that out
if I have a kid he or she will not be on
the Internet to later old enough until
they are mature enough day none of this
shit that comes along with the Internet
which includes hate comments which I am
sorry that your daughter got but that is
what the Internet
is you have to be at least the age of 13
to have a youtube channel had your name
whether or not you're controlling the
Egyptian have your name which the little
kids name was the main YouTube tag to
control a channel to upload videos to
comment on people's videos you have to
be 13 looking at her dad's YouTube
channel which I was alerted of and went
to I saw a video which is now taking
down but I have proof of my search
history that I viewed it which was a
little girl seeming like let it go and
then her at a second-grade musical which
second grade is typically the age of
someone who is between 6 &amp;amp; 8 which means
now 2 years later from that second grade
musical on her dad's page which all his
videos are private now which means she
could only be between the ages of 8 and
maybe by any chance 11 if she was held
back 100 years that being said you're
not 13 it's illegal for you to own it
and work channel upload videos on
YouTube and have an email account
through Google Plus that's violating
Google accounts as well as YouTube
standards going back to the mom's email
she claims that the account was hacked
by an email that the daughter clicked on
which was a phishing email that made her
type in her YouTube stuff like her
YouTube information user name and
password which then it got hacked and
the email like was opened by the
daughter and clicked she clicked the
links and I want to say it's not that
hard to see a phishing email and to know
that YouTube would never send you an
email that asks you to log to an account
through an email link but it might be
hard for someone under 13 which what yet
again your daughter is under 13 yet
again violating the user guidelines this
entire thing shouldn't be happening if
the parents kept the daughter off of the
internet because she's not supposed to
be on here because of age restrictions
there's a reason YouTube has age
restrictions the reason Facebook does
and Google+ has an email age restriction
because kids don't know what efficient
even looks like kids don't know how to
properly control themselves and work
YouTube accounts elementary school is
very young to be on the Internet and of
course you would be upset about the
comments the mom says she was crying and
shaking of course I would be too if I
was a fetus and scared of comments on
the Internet
I don't understand why you're still
allowing her to be on YouTube after this
honestly after this whole thing not
trying to tell you how to parent but
it's against the guidelines and she
stills the account up the videos got the
account still up with the 90 some
subscribers that have come to her from
my channel in my video I want to make
known that I said nothing in my previous
video about having the viewers or
subscribers of mine go to her channel
dislike a video
so you know watch Videocon something I
never said any of that because I would
never push harm harassment or hate on to
any human being I wouldn't do that
because I deal with it every single day
in my life I don't condone the behaviors
and the actions and the things that were
said I don't I would never wish that
upon anyone any comment that I left was
positive and had a positive twist to a
negative situation that this is but I
can't control people who aren't me are
people's thoughts that aren't mine are
people's actions and words that aren't
mine that's what YouTube and that's what
the freaking world is it's a freedom of
speech do I think what they're saying is
right absolutely not
but I can't stop that it's not me I
didn't send them to go do that I
uploaded a video because I was being
personally attacked but I can control
people who aren't me saying things just
like you can't control what happens on
your account apparently even though
everyone else on YouTube apparently can
I can't stop people from saying things
if she was upset about the comments she
shouldn't have a YouTube channel it's
not like I went on the kids video with
no prior comments being left on my video
and just trashed her that would be
disgusting and completely morally and
ethically wrong but what I did was get
19 comments from your daughter's account
and then responded to it I didn't say
anything mean about your daughter so
yeah don't really see how I'm in the
wrong here we go another one from this
person it is bullying when an adult goes
on a rant and makes fun of children it
was a ran about how I got hate I was not
making fun of children instead of you
know you know yeah no really you can't
smell you know I can't take this
seriously
you ignorant piece of shit shame on you
shame on you for sitting on your high
horse cleaning your confident you don't
care about comments here you are talking
trash about a nine-year-old
oh she's 9 now because of the comments I
saw that she was 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I was
not talking trash you people must be
deaf or something because you can't keep
coming on my video saying that I was
trashing her and bullying her when I
didn't say anything that's logically
deemed as mean in that video you
couldn't even take the time see the
account got hacked or not no I couldn't
see if an account got high because my
job is not to make sure any hate a
comment that I get came from a hacked
account or not so let me do one more
thing and pull up this facebook chat
group thing that I received an image of
you
this is the mom leaving it into the
group XX Fitness social groups this is
the mom my kid is getting completely
flamed on the AG right now my husband
started getting fucked up comments oh
well your language seems kind of I don't
know if similar to the comments I
received which the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree then on his video of
his daughter's school concerts and then
found this link to my video
long story short a quick look at my kids
email found a phishing link again why is
your ten-year-old have an email her
account was hacked did she posted none
of these comments isn't the post your
message my husband reported the video
reported my video I'm sorry maybe you
should report the comments II gotta not
my video which was doing that thing
wrong thank you but I don't know what
else to do my kid has been crying and
shaking because she's 10 and the
comments in the section are littered
with death threats I'll report it I'm
glad to report that because death
threats are discussing it should never
happen but your kids crying because
she's 10 and shouldn't be in the heat of
YouTube they shouldn't have to deal with
hate because they're too young you said
nothing about what happened on my side
you made me look like I went on there
and attacked your kid um no I receive
over 19 comments from that account
somebody didn't even show you seemed to
just accidentally leave all that
information out making me look like oh
yeah a bully which people came from me
calling me yet I wasn't because if you
watched the video I had perfect proof
and perfect reason behind everything
that I was doing and I didn't even come
at your daughter when I could have I did
not and I would not because of my moral
standards that you've got everyone in
your fitness group in your mom group to
come after me and bully me in my channel
and they don't even know the story
because you didn't provide it with them
you provide them with false information
to misconstrue their belief of me my
channel my video in this situation in
total everything I said this video is
factual and everything has proof nothing
I said is bullying because it's true and
sometimes the truth hurts to my viewers
do not leave any more comments these
people is really not worth it it's
really not I don't need you to fit for
me but I want to clear my name when
you're trying to tarnish my reputation
once you tell the whole story before you
try to get you and all your friends to
come from me and report my video which
was not wrong and it's actually against
violations to report video
that's not harassment which that clearly
was not with the proof I gave you from
the comments of your daughter's Channel
do not play the victim it doesn't suit
you well it was that I think we are done
all these people will be blocked today
thank you guys for watching narrating
Rome subscribe my channel it means the
world to me this is the last video I'll
be doing about these people thank you so
much for listening though
and have a great game bye
