advertisement you're known for getting
good grades being in three honor
societies at your university what is the
lowest score you've gotten on an exam um

chemistry final and great going Madison

have a pop socket of myself okay but
phone back guys just me and my boyfriend
at Christmas how cute who is your best
friend
Mohini she's my best friend of all time
how did you meet her um actually when I
transferred from Mizzou to the
University I met now we were in the same
meteorology class like we both didn't
even need to learn about the weather but
we took it and um she had seen some of
my videos in BG before but she's not fan
she's a friend
anyway she recognized me from the back
of my head like with a bun no makeup on
and she knew it was supposed to be best
friends
on a normal day how long does it take
you to get ready it only takes me long
as my hair takes forever to dry and it's
not even thick but two hours that's what
I'm doing like heavy makeup - you've had
three jobs in the past what job would
you be terrible at having a teacher I
love and respect teachers so much but I
have no patience to deal with anything
you have a million pet peeves yeah what
is the most annoying thing someone could
do
but an obnoxious long stares not me
ruder where do you never want to go
space oh my god I just like freaks me
out like imagine being trapped in a
space shuttle going upstairs
what do you wish you knew more about um
probably more languages I can speak
English that's kind of disappointing can
I get you a drink
no I'm good thank you though if I've
spent 24 hours with you
what would we do the most um use excels
in snapchat it seems like that's all I
do anyway
I saw your iconic monthly Spotify
playlist what is a song that always
brings back good memories what is the
most annoying question someone has asked
you how much I make it just because I
have a unique would you rather never
wear lipstick or never wear eyeliner
never wear lipstick I guess I love wings
too much to let that go looking back how
is your life different one year ago I
feel like I was less happy less
successful and less proud of myself in
confident and now I'm just living the
best life who would play you in a movie
myself it's the only person that can do
it justice who is your style icon you
recently turned 21 what age do you want
to live to you are known for having no
sleep every day yes how many did you
have today only one but last week
what is something that you are obsessed
with that no one would know architecture
i love tall buildings so much that they
just like I don't know I'm mr. old with
that like New York Chicago what is the
most impressive thing you know how to do
I mean I know how to do a lot of things
but come in my room what are you
addicted to um so does I drink like five
a day or my boyfriend if you had to
change your name what would it be
Charles that was my papa's name and I
don't know I just love him so I love
that name love what irrational fear do
you have I used to be really scared of
throwing the public but I've kind of
gone past that so nothing really nothing
scares me what is the most illegal thing
you have done oh my gosh can I say I
feel like I flashed before like everyone
has are you in a relationship I am his
jackets right here actually what's his
name well his name's David what is one
trait you love about David um besides
the way that he just makes me feel in an
everyday basis um probably his
intelligence
he's like a writer and an editor for the
NBA so I don't know I look up to him a
lot and those aspects what is your
favorite memory with him um being able
to see him every day is a blessed thing
wake up next to him and like make eggs I
don't know it's so cheesy but it's fun
what pair of shoes is your favorite oh
probably my Christian Louboutins like it
took a while to get those but I feel
like Connick every
what is the most immature thing that you
do I talk in like annoying voice and I
always pick little fights with people
which is just unnecessary but it's a
habit I'll be like are you kidding me
it's like I'm over into boys I don't
know why I still do it in just 17 but I
do if you had a fragrance what would it
be named Madison no the one and only
yeah that's good if you were stranded on
an island what three things would you
bring a generator powered by the water
surrounding us a computer because it
doubles as a phone and a plane what
three people would you bring hmm my mom
my best friend and my boyfriend which of
your scars has the best story behind it
I have a huge one on my knee that I got
like less than a year ago I was at my
Nana's house and I was getting a car
charger out of my car going back in our
house I was like pretending I was in a
movie and I was like we're running like
so unnecessary
I trip on my long pants and fall on
gravel and I always pieces of gravel in
my knee and I still be here to scar hair
so how do you keep friends if you never
text them back oh my god I mean I hate
texting like I like for Miss texts right
now I just that's probably why I have
two friends but I don't know well I
expect a text back next time okay I'm
sorry
what do you smell like um my favorite
perfume is called Lila and it's like
from Norway it's wet and if you've been
at Disney World
it's what Epcot Norway the center that's
what it's mostly and I found it and I
wear it all time I'll be sure to make
sure I check that out next time okay how
many kids do you want two or three as
many as my body can make but um yeah I
want to do a big family what would you
name your kids Charles for sure is one
of them boy or girl and gaylen's I mean
I'll let my husband pick I guess I'll be
kind well you're holding a record what's
your favorite one I have so many I love
them all like
let me just break them while I'm at it I
don't know there's so many good ones to
be honest but probably just Frank
Sinatra one I have it on right now I can
play a little for you Oh that'd be great
being in the public eye what is
something you are self-conscious about
um probably my hairline oh that's my
biggest appeal of like my face it's so
mister
what is one of your favorite smells
peonies they're my favorite flower you
go to a bar what do you order a dr.
pepper what else what age do you
permanently wish you could be lives much
my life yet so I'll say 30 it seems like
a good age being a senior in college
what takes up too much of your time
um running at the gym and you that every
day I should spend more time on studies
probably but I gots treaties anyway so I
run too much when people come to you for
help what do they usually want help with
um it's usually about makeup no one
seems to know how to learn under my
shadow or do eyeliner wings or apply
fake eyelashes it's just always about
fake eyelashes I wear my big day so no
one knows kind of like get glue do tacky
what one food could you eat for the rest
of your life um steak potatoes cheese
things what why do you tell most often I
don't really tell but it's more like
when I'm around people I don't really
like I act kind to them and they don't
even deserve that so that's a lie itself
we know that you aren't the biggest fan
of animals but what would be your spirit
animal a peacock because they're loud
and obnoxious just like me what do you
want to be remembered for just what
television character are you most like
mmm Carrie Bradshaw Sex in the City
she's my favorite what if something
horrible that everyone should try at
least once cigarettes but don't keep
doing them what would be the most
annoying thing about having yourself as
a roommate I feel like I'm so annoying
probably the singing I'm always like
like shut up you don't need to sing all
the time if you could describe your
style in one word what would it be
okay what do you hate spending money on
food
I never earn a meal that's more than
like five dollars I hate it
what is the most expensive thing you
have purchased actually the necklace on
my neck well this one's more important
because my boyfriend gave me but this
one's from Chanel and it was a few
thousands to many let's just say that
what dumb accomplishment are you most
proud of
I mean I have a lot of accomplishments
that I am proud of a dumb one um my
responsibility award in Spanish my
sophomore year of high school for
bringing my flashcards to class every
day so we have finally gotten to see
your long-awaited megamix YouTube video
yes can you sing us your favorite part
in the mix Oh
my favorite part is when I sing counting
stars I don't really like that song but
it's like two seconds
over a radioactive right and it's like
cannons dies I love that part of some
reason and it's just stupid like wait
but what is the dumbest thing that you
have done been actually turned out well
creating a youtube channel it's been the
best part of my life really but it
started out like I was making fun of it
um for it and it was kind of a ratchet
mess at first but it's given me so much
and it helps me become a better person
so yeah well your iconic makeup look is
weighted eyeliner finish the sentence
the bigger the wing the bigger the oh no
that works right yeah what is your
favorite kind of underwear no underwear

to give live your life for yourself
