another hand request thing which is the
$0.99 I haven't done with these in quite
a while it was like a thing that I did
all the time and then also called a pot
of holdup
I do these every day so I need to like
calm down because I would think I'm on
like run 7 or something of this I love
doing them for you guys and I bought
this stuff I have the receipt right here
on December 15th of last year I just
have had this marrow because I didn't

anymore so anyway I got to be fun to
include a guest in our 99th video today
um and yeah for his grammar now ready

further ado let's go start with the
video okay the first thing I have is a
back scratcher um a back scratcher
grunty dough's by the brand April bath
and shower and it was a dollar and it's
made of wood so here tell me how it
feels
don't do - you know that's right ah you
like that huh just feel good it's like
an entree I don't know it feels weird
oh it feels like fingers I mean this 5
ohm it's like a mini hand I don't know
would you buy this no yeah me neither
but I always wanted a back scratcher but
like oh it's like like been next product
we got an antigravity ballpoint pen um
if you write if you take your pen you
write upside down with it it's not
supposed to work normally like pens just
don't do that so um we're gonna try it
to see if this pen actually works
writing upside down just like I don't
know good I do ha ha ha so I got some
paper I'll just try to write like this
cuz like okay okay it isn't oral but no
hands can't do that apparently
do you pain it's not the best pen now
this yeah that's good
now I'm saying this isn't like the best
cellist pen no no I get to say hey
alright so we have like a Bic so
try that like you try to sit down can't
write
