polish not makeup I don't know why
everyone always puts nail plush and like
make up kids make up sides is my make up
let's now pause I shadow palette and a

like your mom or sister or your
girlfriend whatever likes make up get
heard this make up chocolate not real
make up NYX I got a wind-up train set
and a lot of toys they're like
tic-tac-toe and stuff like that I
decided to get this train set and see if
it actually winds up in goes around the
track that we're gonna build so here's a
little train a connector part I don't
care about that and then for tracks
maybe put it up here create it up here
like this a bigger space up here you

winding it up go come on
okay one more time
if you wind it up like oh my Oh what if
you wind it up a lot and like it doesn't
really go anywhere see but if I went up
like a little it doesn't cut you hurt
either
yeah so the key to that would be do not
wide it's super hard or like a lot
because otherwise I won't go it's
confused so just a little bit next thing
I got is this Santa ornament I thought
it was kind of creepy and he was tell
everyone there so I thought like all the
other ones were bought and like this one
wasn't like mentioned you were - Santa
ornament that wasn't bought and it was
just like look at it like he tried right
