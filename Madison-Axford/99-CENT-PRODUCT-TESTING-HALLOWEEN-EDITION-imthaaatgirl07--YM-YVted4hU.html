product just a Halloween video oh my god
I'm so over Allen weenie yeah this is my
favorite kind of videos to do honestly
like - every days you may think they're
stupid I think they're fun I'm not
degrading iodine in Centaurs I'm not
hating on them I buy tons of stuff food
toiletries makeup anything cards bags
balloons whatever from the dollar store
it's wonderful I love the dollar store
so much oh my gosh it's a ceiling which
she she knows how to lean themed video I
honestly love it okay I bought this
stuff no joke um September 15th like I
have the receipt like I don't know if
you can read that read that September 15
I bought it so long ago when as soon as
it came out I was like I'm into this
super early and it's gonna be like super
Halloween even in September put it off
put it off put it off to other videos at
college homework had midterms had tests
and I'm like it's an elective or feta do
the stupid video but I'm excited so
let's get to an answer from the testing
Hall for sweet Helene theme tunes so the
first thing I got is my everything ever
at life a mask it was 50 cents that's a
deal
so let's put this baby on this is on
what I'm gonna be for Halloween this
year
why hello though oh oh my I love this I
think this is really fun
it's hard to wear a little bit it fits
my eyes a little bit but in general it's
like a lopsided highest 57 mess and I'm
glad I bought it like this is freaking
cool looks scary
hello sugar treat oh my god I love
Halloween
right so yeah I'm probably gonna be the
19 year old around my neighborhood
Justin this but I'm not I'm excited my
mom thought it was pretty cool I was
pretty cool it was worth the money so
yes this is wannabe in Halloween pairen
all feeling witchy okay oh it's a little
hot though I'm feeling like that is a
success okay great next I got some
creepy cloth which is basically just
black netting
so we're going to put in the back of my
video and make it a little hell weenie
up in here okay we got to decorate
Halloween decor here it is and
apparently this looks hella weenie so
it's in the helming section so cool next
I dodge this which is a door knocker I
don't know this is Frankenstein this is
Frank Franken's no it's Dracula has
bangs okay so this is just like you know
when you go up to what house sounds like
knock knock but I don't have like a door
and my mom's like yeah we're not putting
the ugliest thing on our door so it's
like okay I'll just buy it anyway put it
in my background so basically this is a
Halloween decor video we're just
decorating my my background a little bit
the Halloween it's not about look on
nice and fancy
oh no it's ratchet like me so here you
go let's push we hang this we'll put it
right here stay drag your head okay
there we go next I got this cute little
hat like guys a dollar for this and like
I know this looks kind of hot topic II
not judging hot topic but honestly looks
like something you would get from there
no shade um but I thought it was cute I
bought it so no shade it's just like a
monster hat and you know all that heat
from your body escapes out of your head
so put a hat on and stay warm this
Halloween it's probably for like a
five-year-old
but I'm 19 don't ya looking cute on this
Halloween I'm gonna look so awesome like
I'm gonna go around and be like
triggered rate you know like hell are
you and I'll be like ah ah ah a monster
anyway next I got these fake scars 50
Cent's probably because they're the most
unrealistic looking fake scars ever but
hey I'm not judging let's see how these
work
so apparently this with the velcro black
obvious band is supposed to look like a
fake scar so here we go is that we're
gonna get my leg here we go
let's put on our fake scar and if
someone saw this would you think this
was real if you saw it I am wearing
pants you just can't tell I think it
looks like bacon and plastic I'm sorry
fix cars like the fake square tattoos
probably that would look better than
this it's kind of a cute bracelet I
can't like putting it yeah I you know
what you know what I'll do because I'm
not gonna let anything go to waste
here's a tiny one probably for like a
bicep of a person who doesn't work out I
can eat here we go thanks Scott over top
of shirt are you that cool next thing
are these glow the dark vampire teeth I
think these are not gonna work they
smell really weird oh my god I don't
actually feel safe putting these in my
mouth I'm sorry um but that's fine we're
still gonna test out the
glow-in-the-dark capabilities so you
like no huh okay let's drop the lights
they didn't work I mean you can't really
tell um they're not too strong but
glow-in-the-dark but they first shirt do
glow I'm not gonna hate on this you just
can't tell if it's lighting because it's
very like candle lit I put it down like
under it is blowing the dark they do
work a bit um probably an all
pitch-black gonna be better you'd be
like you know they have a sort of
friends where Ross has like the teeth
whiter you're the cream would probably
look good but um they're not too crazy
glow in the dark but you know it's
dollar store there were a dollar they
were um yeah
moving on next I got this black crow
because I thought it was actually kind
of high-quality class decor so let's
take it off its little that's dangerous
there's just like random metal sticks
coming out okay
this little crow prop needs frickin
parents help you with it so kids don't
add their selves with this and this is
just gonna go you know right here looks
great oh X I got a paper lantern on that
apparently lights up oh and needs
batteries I don't know
time for that okay so it's right out
there's two key batteries do uh two
triple A batteries cuz I wasn't gonna
like be like I don't too lazy to go
betters we're gonna do this full out and
like this freaking lantern that would
see if it works I kind of can't wait
okay putting in the bad jubie's oh good
I just can't imagine it's working but
let's see oh I'm such a bad person for
judging you oh my god best purchase it's
literally a light-up Chinese lantern in
love with this holy crap and it's on and
off switch so you doesn't catch on fire

are and if these cranes actually work
black white red yellow blue okay let's
draw like fake blood on coming out of my
mouth let's do this work um okay um
apparently random most dots on my face
is blood to me does this look like a
mustache or bloody nose because it's
supposed to be a bloody nose but the
thing is this red is coming a little off
