requested 9 inset video again this is my
favorite honestly my favorite cutter
they used to do no if ands or buts about
it I love them I don't care if you like
them or not these are one of my fav IDEO
is to film and that I love doing and I
think I just enjoy the most so if you
don't like it I'm sorry you know
there'll be more different videos coming
the future but these are my hair to do
so that's why I keep doing these I'm not
doing it to be annoying I'm not doing it
because people don't like them I'm doing
it because I love it so anyway this is
my fourth edition and yes I got some
awesome new stuff so first thing I got
is so I'm really excited about its loose
eyeshadow pigments by one of my favorite
brands
Everts la colors they only have it at
the dollar store as far as I'm concerned
anyway I got loose pigments in gold
sunshine so I don't have any list
payments except for now I have blue ooh
living but I'm excited to gold because
it would be beautiful to do a shadow
with gold pigment so let's see how
pigmented these actually are go there's
a little brush I mean let's just put on
hand even though I had no base that
sucks but okay
oh yes I could just apply this leg
straight to the eye okay first off I'm
noticing love packaging it comes with a
little like spout that not much full
fall out of and a brush I don't know if
there's glue in this or one but that
just applied to my hand amazingly holy
crap like shaking its shaking me shaking
it it's not coming off this is without
primer glue anything Wow
okay oh yes obsessed
definitely check out la colors if you've
never heard of it like literally I have
so many pelts from they're all pretty
much all thing eyeshadows I use are from
ELF or LA Colors I love I love it next I
have a 2 pack of pacifiers actually I
paid $2 for these I wanted one but like
oh well um I just wanted it like I
wanted to reminisce and see me feel like
I don't remember what sucking out sound
so weird I remember what sucking that
pacifier feels like though I mean I
didn't do it's in seconds I suppose
little when I really write lipstick on
is gonna get all over that a well so I
just like wanted to get one for old
times sake and see what it felt like
you're gonna think I'm insane ok let's
do it okay I'm gonna lipstick all over
it okay mmm mmm
mmm-hmm that lipstick though do you see
that
um okay squishy it's not as fun as I
thought it was gonna be I thought I was
gonna be like like second honor for days
but it not too impressed I wasted two
bucks on this but if you're a baby
that's I'm not saying that these
wouldn't be great like they're bpa-free
they're totally fine go get this for
your kid don't spend a ton of money on
it like their favorite Elmo character
and give these to them but I wanted to
do it not to use it necessarily works
cause it's a binky of course it works
your baby's just sucking on it but I
want to see how I could like remember
the feeling and reminisce to things that
happened when I had these but I couldn't
so but it just was kind of like there's
a reason you stopped sucking on these
are like two or three maybe next thing I
got our big razor to need racers these
are my favorite kind razors to be honest
are these like cheap big ones I don't
know I just feel like they get the hair
off you this sounds gross but you know
it shaved the best like they're the ones
that work and how the cleanest cut for
myself I got some razors I also this is
like so much needed I also got it to
brush sentido toothbrush and this is a
Colgate so yeah then I got this awesome
joking around novelty glasses kidnap if
you were like me what you probably
weren't but I don't know if you've heard
of this um big comfy couch anyone raise
little kids TV show ever and they wore
these red condos and I always wanted to
write condos and I can never find it I
had always the I had those huge glasses
when I had my never had the clown nose
so here we go oh oh my god slang the
same and yes
nothing keen on these glasses they're
like really dirty and like not that cute
this nose I would wear this around be
like hey Rudolph's of it Nosed Reindeer
yeah
I'm living for this I'm gonna keep this
okay next I got a bit just because I
love the saying look messy but cute and
I feel like that's my makeup it's like
you're like oh that girl's messy but she
alright okay she's cute and cute
um again like obviously you can buy your
kid this like it's I'm not saying bad
about this I'm just like I love the huh
too tight I love I love to the saying
this cute little owl and so me hang on
let's get this hair out there we go
I need to like wear this like because
first of all I am someone that always
spills no matter what they're eating
what they're doing I can be eating the
tiniest little mint or like a steak
dinner I would still spill it off
somehow
in something on my shirt or pants that
happens a lot too but yeah so cute
little bit next the next thing I got our
summer Gees Mardi Gras beads because I
went to Bourbon Street in love Los
Angeles um in Louisiana New Orleans when
I was younger and I was so scared of
Bourbon Street right because it was
always drunk people they were like boobs
for beads and I was like ah I remember
sister was so scared and so I don't know
well go back anytime soon but and I'm
not gonna show my boobs or beads so I
decided to buy myself some own Mardi
Gras beads so I can wear these okay the
boss acquaintance like look at me you
wish you can sit alone at your house on
a Friday night wearing my Grammys you
bought for yourself from the dollar
store so I'm pretty cool so anyway the
last thing I guys saying that I always
want to try these were always like $10
my Solomon this was $5 marked down to
three so score it's the cooling towel
now I'm always hot
always always always hot no matter where
I am how high or low the
cervicitis I'm always hot open much so
dis
apparently it says take the towel out of
the container and remove plastic wrap
place all under the water to activate
wring out leave someone in the towel for
cooling wait two minutes place to an
area to be cool well finish rinse that
with water in return to the container
moist
okay now supposedly if you ever wash my
aunt has this I don't know that word
not with heart is crap anyway it like
look Benz you see that okay anyway
apparently if you puts on the water and
then use it every it'll cool you down
that's what I need it's like crunchy I'm
gonna wet this and then I'll come back
okay I wedded it I wedded it I wet it
and let's sit for two minutes but it's
still it kind of hard like some parts
are for sure soft like this really soft
but it's like smells we cool smells
really bad but it's like it's so hard
and then I try to like open house it
must open whether this and I think he
liked work too much like that's my bad
like I thought it was supposed to be
opened more though but I don't look like
it but like this is still like it's like
hard like there's parts that are soft
but it's hard so I thought how would be
like a paper towel but I get I don't
know let's see if it is cool though oh
oh holy crap though and not even
exaggerating at all I was about to diss
this and I'm freezing oh this oh my god
okay like it's almost awkwardly shapes
thing I hope pull this out people would
be like what is that a giant pad or what
but Mike it's freezing holy this would
work oh okay oh this is so cold I think
I can really keep this on my skin ah
okay yeah it's cool well um but it's
very awkward like shape 0 out of 10
coldness 10 out of 10 you can see like
the netting and the string but like huh
it is cold okay it is cold but I don't
think it's supposed to open anymore I
think I broke it okay ah okay so that
