Craddock testing my hair used to do blah
blah blah I'm coming for the 19-story
leben eines and store buy everything
Diane Sandra let's get started
this is the absolute greatest thing I've
ever found at the 99-cent store okay so
it's a sign that says give thanks um is
there like a Thanksgiving sign and it
has like a dangly part okay it is I I
bought it like this I swear to God I did
not change this to try be funny this
help was on the Shelf and literally the
guy and cash for sure was like okay you
know that this is and I'm like I know I
love it okay it's a beautiful turkey
sign it says good things
it's upside down it's upside down it's
upside down okay so you're like medicine
you probably holes in it no look there's
no holes on the other side like it's a
give thanks it says good then I'm gonna
Hank and Zig and I love it even though
Thanksgivings over I'm gonna hang this
in my room because it's just the thought
that counts check out all my beasts I
9/10 stuff and I was checking out and I
finished and I walked past and I was
like oh oh we gotta go back in line we
gotta buy this look it's so perfect
because like oh oh oh it's like it tried
so hard and I'm like oh why would you
put this in the Shelf if it was so effed
up but they did and I bought it because
they knew I was coming next
we have a foam craft kit which is a
build round Turkey oh yes
so they're like no stickers so here's
the turkey body and it's like one of
these things for you like peel the
sticker off so it's actually really fun
craft like if you like a three to four
year old they would have a lot of fun
doing this
it smells like mothballs which is always
a plus it's not it's not very sticky but
that's okay so let's put this turkeys
face I guess not a face just like a body
and a head oh it doesn't stick oh it
doesn't stick it's on okay let's see we
got wait how would you how does work how
do you gonna do there's no face sticker
I'm doing a wing
I think it goes there I'm making it go
there like pilgrim big thing collar big
thing Madison okay come on
tada next we have zero foam I was always
like and love face foam kind of things
but I could never get it to moms like we
don't need that I was like you know
if little so I could afford it so now I
got global did our mess free reusable
modeling compound okay and I'm excited
just better not make a mess my room has
become a disaster because of that sense
to our house oh okay oh it's sticky it's
sticky
look at this it's sticky it's sticky
it's also so sticky you can't even get
it out of its box little balls are
spilling okay here this all that noise
oh okay this is not very fun because
it's not very moldable it kind of feels
like a rice krispie treat it does not
mold it's so hard I don't know if I got
like a weird batch its tail one but this
is like watch this right oh I was
pushing with all I might and I don't
know I are supposed to mold us into
shape maybe it's like a stress reliever
so when you're like then that oh so
sticky up next I got these socks which
are snuggly soft you know fuzzy socks
every girl loves um okay so as soon as I
got home I put them on warm all around
the house right my mom was like Madison
what is all this purple stuff look how
cute they are right she's like what is
all this purple stuff around the house
and I was like what pearls stuff she's
their needs from your socks and I'm like
no my socks don't shed Oh
maybe they do look how gross this is I
came to wear these because they shed
everywhere normal fuzzy socks do not
 okay but these folks did and so I
can't wear these because they make a
mess in the house so they're going in a
trash can I'm very upset about it next

David jumbo sunflower seeds my dad we
say sunflower seeds like I'm a triumph

gonna try these and tell you if it is
like ranch tell you what it is like tell
you if they're good so I just she want
them right okay huh

flavor was good it was very spicy on in
your face ranch but it was goodbye I
chewed it I don't think you're closer to
it okay take two my god

weird little flea green thing and I'm
pissed

bought these but it's still fresh so
clean
charcoal cleansing nose drips I Pore

now but they are parently black no
strips so this looks fun last thing I
got is flour you don't know carp is it's
like they make fart it's like putty in
any sport fart noise but this is called
noise putty they're more classy than
