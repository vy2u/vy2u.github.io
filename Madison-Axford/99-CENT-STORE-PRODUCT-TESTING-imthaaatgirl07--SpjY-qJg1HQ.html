product of saying haul I haven't done
one these in literally forever so yes
today I'm doing one of those because
it's been too long
so this doesn t v-- long intro you know
I'm going to do and let's get started
the first day that was just for me like
solely like not for this video but look
it's an organizer file and so I felt
like big waters like this that like
should open the very like I don't know
bendable and just like very floppy I
like love that I don't always like super
sturdy things so I like this there's
like one two three four five six seven
eight different pockets that you can put
uh
paym resin and stuff like that so I just
got this for school next year it was a
dollar everything in this haul was a
dollar so that was a great and I just
like love so like that's my the only one
that likes like getting folders or
getting school supplies and stuff I
don't know I love it so they have black
purple pink and blue I think I got the
black she does everything so yeah I got
that and I just thought it would be like
handy like that's literally the only
reason I got it said oh girl I just came
in a package but I - refrigerator to get
it cold and ready for my eyes so that's
why it's out of the package but it says
pink little spa mask and I just want to
see this was relaxing and whatnot cuz it
says like to do stress like you put this
on and I'm like that's what I need so
then I'm like one size fits all so this
kind of looks tiny like I don't know
that it would fit in many heads but you
know we got this we'll try and I'm a
small head I think for me so um it's
very tight but okay oh oh oh oh oh no my
hair's okay I guess I shoulda left it in
there longer it was like do not leave a
name for more than an hour and I was
like oh God so I was like very careful
with the axe I didn't want to like
explode for the video um it's not very
cold though so maybe I should just leave
it in longer and screw it because it's
not very cold this just feels awkward
and um kind of tight like I don't I
wouldn't like to like oh my god I need
to go home and take a bath and music put
on that pink spot like this is not this
this wouldn't be on my list of
necessities after work but you know it
looks goofy I look like a superhero so
yeah okay hopefully didn't mess up my
makeup um but it was a mess when I did
it so oh well next I got a handy lighter
so I like this because I typically use
lighters
like candles in my room and stuff and so
when you don't always have like a
big-ass lighter so I have a little one
usually on hand it's my yellow one and
it's so hard to light a candle we need a
little flick lighter and then go down
into the candle part like always somehow
burns or my hand or gets really hot so
this one looks very cool and very useful
because it has like a little extender
stem then hopefully can get down to the
candles out burning me so we're gonna
try this out today okay I don't know how
Oh bitch yes oh you don't even gotta
flick anything I hate to like slide flip
it so it took me a long time to get it
you just pushed down well what yes I'm
glad I own this is so cool okay let's
get a candle and see if this like can
work without burning myself in case
you're wondering my favorite candle like
my her dissent is peony I love it oh my
god okay so let's see if this works
oh girl I love this this is the coolest
you ever got look at that and like cuz
it doesn't burn because there's the long
step but it's nifty and cute and like
tiny so you would literally put in your
purse and just I love this like a
mansion on you cigarette though and
being like so I was like I need a light
and you're like like I love this next I
got this monster a Barbie doll I was
very excited because everything was
chores a dollar so I was like oh my god
like I'm my Barbie doll it is only a
dollar yes show
