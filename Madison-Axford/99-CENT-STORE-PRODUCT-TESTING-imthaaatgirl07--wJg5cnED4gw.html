store and bought a bunch of random but
I'll never use again after this video
but I thought I'd be fun for you guys to
explore with me and see if these things
really work I know everyone does these
videos and stuff like that but I always
want to do them and like I don't know
I've got to the point with YouTube where
I don't care if someone's done it before
because I'm not going to do it like they
did I'm doing my own take in my own
experiences and my own reactions to
these things are obviously going to be
different to everyone else's so these
are my reactions in experiences okay
let's hop right in to my hall first Anka
is this kite this Disney Princess kite
I never had a kite as a kid I never flew
kites and ever wenton Park so the
boyfriend and flew a kite so I thought
hey there's no better time than now to
try this like is literally like easy to
assemble and then I was like 90 steps so
this might be a fail and we got SIA and
try fly okay so now we're out here to do
the kite and of course the one day I do
a kite
there's no wind okay I get 12 years to
put this thing together but that's okay
Oh
Packaging though
hot and wear jeans and a long-sleeve
shirt
okay hold on okay so open it finally
there's too many parts okay oh my god
this is like legit okay
directions if I get those okay connect
the crossbars at the middle
these
oh I think it's right oh yes it's right
oh my god I'm a genius attach the tail
piece this I'm gonna put these on tail
piece for extra like flowy princess
magic connect that back together okay
yes and then on the front of the kite
tie the string to the loop every time I
imagine a kite I imagine like Winnie the
Pooh or I imagine someone like failing
with a kite and a getting caught in tree
here it is here's our kite Merida cdbg
jasmine and me I did it I connected it
all even these little frilly things that
were totally unnecessary
so let's go fly this okay okay I got my
kite and hold my little string holder
okay
walking big toe okay there's too much
strain on this time we have to wrap this
up okay
how do you play tight like you just
throw it open best
okay that's a graceful take two
tres again you've never give up I don't
know are you supposed to run with it I'm
really getting hot
oh it doesn't work on my six broke now
zero out of ten I hate this kite I hate
cuz I'm over this I'm loving the tangled
in it how do people do this is fun teach
me your ways people oh my god next we
got a bubble fun bubble playset it
counts a million different bubble design
options and a pack of cheap-ass bubbles
okay let's do this bubble playset it
looks like it to be fun I don't know how
well these bubbles will work okay leave
you a nice little pot so you don't make
a mess pour the bubbles in
that's enough
at first we're gonna try the circle one
dip it in and blow
okay it just like popped on my face you
kind of create a bubble
yes it works but it like pops in your
face about this do I just built it all
over my dreams awesome
it works it just made a circle that did
not make a heart you lie bubbles some
fun anymore
yay goodness knows so it gives life so
mommy goodness knows
oh we can't die alone come on I need
bubbles if I'm gonna be Glinda bubbles
okay work it just shows wing it just
shows when you wicked you know just
shows when you wicked you live on your
own I'm done okay bubbles I gave you a 2
out of 10 cause it kind of sucked then I
got a jump of grow shark car was up to
600 percent bigger just put in water oh
I'm gonna smells awful
oh my god smells like mothballs it's a
fun random plastic container so I'm just
gonna like fill up with water put it in
there and let it sink this doesn't work
instantly okay filled with water chick
okay what why is it not sinking is this
must be totally submerged ah you've put
more water in it cuz it's floating okay
it's literally still floating I got but
tons more water in it still floating
cool okay 0 to 10 you suck okay so three
hours later and the sharpies still the
exact same size so fail next I got at
least a frank coloring book mainly
because I just wanted at least frame
coloring book like Hello throwback to
like second grade right then I got cars
glow in the dark glow wand okay Nate
strategies
Oh Ben snap shake okay whoo I feel like
it's gonna break all over me you just
like put this like random car top around
the top cars go see it even though it
came out like five thousand years ago
there's so much random stuff at the
dollar store like super old things like
tons of cam rock journals like stuff
that like what came out in 2007 I'm
gonna try this car thing to see if you
like glows in the dark so I'm just gonna
turn my light now and see if it works
oh yeah this is cool right Wow
do you remember this Suzanne remember
like Disney - oh this is a Disney
Channel stick on that was so much fun oh
that's ready and that was an expert and
you're watching Disney Channel dancing I
that's pretty amazing it's like a candle
in sleep he sang to me in dreams he came
that voice which calls my name and speed
um cause I'm best lyrics it's like
candle or a Disney Channel stick I think
this is freaking cool okay this make me
dizzy Madi I turn the light back on okay
so a plus for this thing because I felt
like I finally got to live on my Disney
Channel dream of doing the little intro
to the shows so yes cars chopper best
dollar I spent so far then I got this
which we've do this in bathroom as well
it's at one of those magic owls we put
in the water and then I like grows into
a washcloth yes and it's frozen and says
frozen heart wait frozen heart that's
like bad thing frozen heart I've owned
this when I was a kid like I did this
mask it is so fun to me so you just like
put it in water it's a card and then it
expands you a little washcloth that's
reusable it's what it looks like so far
like it's like crunchy if you can see
that like do you see that breaking it's
like literal crunchy you hear that oh is
that so sweet hot water maybe
expand and wash bah oh yeah frozen heart
look how cool that is
it's like a literal La Paz huge ten out
of ten would buy this and we have
child-resistant lighters these are cool
I don't need lighters I don't know iPods
have a quote CF dollar store lighters
work and I give the cool like ones that
can see through to the later food is
work something works that's awesome
that's cool okay cool
I spent three lighters that I don't need
so if you're wondering if nine accents
or lighters work they do go get some
then I got a pregnancy test
haha I'm not pregnant but it'd be funny
to UM just see like what this says like
watch it be like two lines you're
pregnant so I thought you know I'd peep
wait what this isn't a pee on the stick
kind of stick what kind of stick is this
okay it says collect your urine in a
clean dry cup remove the test cassette
from the pouch and draw urine into the
urine dropper that's a lot of work and I
really don't want to pee into a cup so I
think I may just pee on the stick we'll
see what happens because they just put
in a cup I'm not peeing a cup as
disgusting even if it is a plastic Solo
Cup like No so what we're gonna do is
just pin stick and see what we get one
one line is negative two is positive
no lines is invalid okay let's turn you
off to watch me feel just peed on the
stick is quite awkward um but I'm just
has wait two minutes for the results
it's that I'm doing I really don't think
this is going to turn out so if it's one
line by the T that means negative one or
two lines by the C and T that means
positive and then nothing is invalid
mine's kind of not working so it's been
two minutes that's what we got
what is that it's just like one blob by
the T ok now ladies if you are pregnant
or you might be because you don't you
know you don't know it's where you're
taking the test
don't go tuna $0.99 store to get a test
because it's just like a blob can I
trust this I don't know why you would
just go but out by the $20 one you'll be
safe let's just throw that away then I
got this
I've always want to try one of these but
it's like it's one of those actual like
paper face masks not just like a go or
gel it's an anti-wrinkle green tea face
book facial facial mask with green tea
ginseng ginseng ginseng and of collagen
and it's like one of those like actual
masks that you put on for 15 minutes and
