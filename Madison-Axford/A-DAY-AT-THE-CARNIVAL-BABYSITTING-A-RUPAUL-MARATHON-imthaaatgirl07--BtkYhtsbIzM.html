this with this with this bread what is
this chicken what is this chicken to
know what with this I don't a doughnut
okay so here is a noun and this is how
I've done a bit
uh-huh
that's nothing I'm trying to say every
Friday so I need get started cuz it's
doing like three hours so to read this
boring book oh so yeah that's for
picking what I'm done okay and um 47
minutes before my paper is due I
finished that's right oh this look
forever but you know when you finished
paper it's like the best feeling ever
that's what this was I turn the paper
every week um okay so our class is like
eight weeks and so you know a normal
semester is how many weeks it's like
four months wait whatever October
November December okay so it's about an
awesome s it was about 17 18 weeks so
this is like - 10 weeks so instead of
writing six papers over the span of
semester it's in the eight weeks of
summer or you know forgive it take a few
weeks at the beginning and end of summer
anyway in the middle of summer what is
this class and so on I have to write six
papers I have to used six tests I have
to do all these blog posts and stuff
like that all about modern philosophy
which is not fun to any teenager it's
not just me no change it wouldn't really
think this is fine unless you're
philosophers being always just kind of
boring and I don't like to think this is
deep into things
um per se so yeah
it kind of sucks that I did this but I'm
glad I'm here the way like I'm halfway
done with the class right now I just
finished like the halfway mark so that's
good like I've written three essays
three tests stuff like that so that's
good but um it's kind of paying the but

three hours trying to write a paper on
like Friday night but you know
procrastination at its finest so I'm
