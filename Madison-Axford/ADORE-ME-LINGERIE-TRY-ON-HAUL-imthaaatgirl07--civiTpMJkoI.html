you
while you're here
hey guys so today I'm doing a adorn me
lingerie haul it's not really like
strictly lingerie because that's a
little like scandalous who knows what
that quotes from that's a little like
scandalous anyway
this is more like sleepwear and stuff
that I deemed semi appropriate for a
trial and whole if you know what I mean
I wasn't going to be like honey I'm
around underwear but you know this step
is really cute and really affordable if
you don't know about the program which
is amazing like VIP program where you
sign up in your first like any outfit or
anything you want their site is $25 and
then from there on you pay the VIP price
if you do sign up for it it's really
cool I love it and I think they have
amazing cute stuff on there and so I'm
going to try on what I got for you today
and show you my little haul and tell me
okay the first thing I got is actually
like this little pack of like the
must-haves for dresses and stuff so I
got these nipple concealers so the
little nipple consumers but it's like
little nipple petals that cover you know
aka sticky boobs I already used them I
mean you can use more than once but
they're already out of the box so that's
for those winds also in this little
pouch there was so much stuff I had to
get it was like so cool and like
everything I ever believed dress
tape strips if your dress is flippin
flap and all over the place when you
take down your skin bra converting clips
so if you're where is your back you
Brock and follow that form disposable
petals so again these are like bigger
breast petals to cover your nipples and
then you can just get rid of them
lifting tape helps you address the steps
you're not constantly pulling them up
when you're wearing a strapless dress
super annoying this fixes that this is
just also if I need it oh my god um for
hook Brock senders because sometimes
bras are too big or too small and you
knew this to help you out and then
there's two what Brock Sanders as well
as three hook Brad sender so there's
many different choices if you want to
switch out your bra hook and then
accessory dot tape so that you can
secure scarves bags belts ring swash and
hems so that they're not flapping all
over the place if you're outside or
whatever said the day everything's
lengths correctly so that's all that
stuff for like $25 it was so cool I just
knew I had to pick that up just because
like I always want to move now is one
frog
coke extenders now
this is net net converter strapped and
so instead I just got it all into one
package and so thankful that they like
sold back so a must for me okay the
first thing I got is this is like a
halter top neck which needs to be tied
tighter and then it's like a romper with
a v-neck in French I wish it wasn't so
see-through so that I could wear it out
and about but you can't it comes with
these underwear I'm not gonna try these
on because that's weird but it isn't a
song she's like a regular underwear and
then it's elastic waist it's an elastic
waist and then that just hangs down over
the underwear so if you have a special
man you know from Wednesday that already
past you can wear this you know or woman
whatever way you float but you know what
I mean like I don't have that special
guy but if you do then get this I think
it's super cute I just thought were
supposed to floral bouncy cute perfect
for spring I love the corley red orange
color and yes that is the first thing I
picked out then I got a black silk
Victoria Secret robe for Christmas but
then I saw on the site they had a light
pink one and I lost my shit so I had to
get this one to go it's super thick I
love your choice your twine is super
silky and soft but it's not as thick as
this one like this will keep you warm
it's short sleeve it has a tie I love
this rose baby pink color it's just so
adorable and just like I don't know I
had the black one like I said so I felt
like I needed the pink one too in a size
small medium in case you were wondering
it comes in like I think two sizes so
small medium medium large
that's a good I love the color then I
got in this little set black and white
lace set so here's the front it just
looks like typical like sleepwear I
think it is very sexy sleepwear but it's
not lingerie because your boobs are
covered your butt's covered everything
is covered the bombs are very very long
if you can see that you'll see it better
on me because this is hard to describe
when you can't really see it on a person
and then it has lacy on the sides I
think it's super cute they're very long
become everything so it is sexy but it
is like reserved sexy like yeah you are
showing a lot but you're not you know
it's reserved you don't you show
everyone what you got this super cute I
loved the black I think it's very just
sultry and I love it I prefer black /
white any day and then yeah so it's
silky I don't
I love black clothing makes me more
confident I feel last thing I got was
the reason that I did this haul
I wanted this so badly it's like I love
this light blue color and when I saw
they had a light blue lingerie product I
was like I have to get it right because
it just reminds de like Cinderella Oh
again kind of see-through a little bit
of hassle but it comes with these blue
underwear these are thong the other red
ones like I said we're just a regular
panty but oh my god I just love this
club because looks like Cinderella
oh my god I just when I saw it I was
like I lost it I just needed this
because look it's bow as a bow it's
girly it's flirty flirty flirty and
thriving it has lace it has the light
blue color has the lace the bottom it
goes out it's just ties in the back it
just reminded me of being a princess cuz
apparently been a princess before no you
know it just reminded me of like a
princess and I thought her so so girly
and cute I just love it I love it so
much so yes
that's what I got from adore me.com
definitely check them out that they
liked in the downbar I love what I got
I'm very excited to wear it and try it
out and stuff like that and oh my god my
hair I'm sorry what happened what was
