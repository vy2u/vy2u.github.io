today's video cuz it's a super super fun
fall book incorporating golds browns and
oranges my favorite colors ever um that
I found recently I didn't know that
before not but I love them so I did a
gold know an orange gold brown smokey
eye with winged liner a deep contour and
then an orange brown lip using
kathleenlights in Norfolk cosmetics
collaboration with Miami fever for blue
lip and yes I just of the school it
matched look so this is my first full
one of my first no not really well it's
one of my first fall looks for this year
I hope you enjoyed this look it's very
very requested that I do this because I
post on my Instagram so without further
ado let's get started okay start taking
the Mac prep and prime fix+ just to get
my face a little junior because it's
very very dry
I just when I'm wasting it before I
apply a foundation so it goes on easier
okay I can mix up my favorite
foundations covergirl for the dogs are
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation in L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte this is in shade 103
this is 810 so you know I mix them
together to create a better shade for my
skin I believe so I should apply them
book on my hand probably way too much
and just go from there
with my nice clean Beauty Blender that's
pre wet and I just left on my hand and
go in on my face so they're like primer
I will use is that fix+ spray H little
spray because I don't like primers I
just think you make my skin greasy and
then I always break out from them
um you can do your eyeshadow look
beforehand if you want before you
definition but I like to do it just I
don't see foundation first just sort of
a base it just helps me like no I chose
will go to my skin tone stuff it's just
a weird thing I do but there will be
some follow up probably from the eye
shadow so I do my concealer after the
eye shadow just to get rid of any dark
shadows that might have fallen while
doing or while playing the eye shadows
cuz fallout is that something that
always happens no matter how hard you
try not to so yeah this has a little um
the cover got a lots of pink undertones
and if all those yellow undertones and I
am pink undertone more and I love ulanda
chanseong so I've mix them together let
down the neck make sure you get your
jawline and your chin all covered that's
part I always seem to like this and then
we're gonna set the rest later after we
do concealer and all that so I'm just
gonna go right in onto the eyes and I'm
gonna start with my Mac painterly
paint-pot
primer it's my favorite primer to use
because it's so waxy and it really grabs
hold of the shadows it's like sticky
it's not greasy at all which I love so
I'm just playing this just on my lid I
don't want to go too high because I
don't want the shadows to go higher than
that if your shadows go higher than your
lids sometimes you can look like you're
bruised and like your eyes will look
coffee like uneven stuff so so I'm gonna
take my check entails morphe brushes
palette and just go in on the eyes I'm
first just gonna take a nice peachy
color really to just go over and create
a nice transition shade which is going
to be this tan right here it's coming up
very very dark it's not that dark though
just as a nice base before I apply the
other shadows
then also from this palette I'm taking
this nice orange color up here it's very
Brown orange which I'd love and taking
just this flat brush I'm going to apply
this to the inner part of my eye trying
not to go above the crease this is a
very dark color to put in your inner eye
but it'll work in the end of this look
and I love how this has been looking
I've been wearing it so much recently
for the fall
okay that's good enough it's messy it's
fine even fix it later when you apply
the other shadows and blend it all out
next I'm going to go in with my
favorites
L'Oreal and Papa eyeshadows but I'm
going in with the shade
amber rush which is a beautiful amber
pigment look at that it looks like a
freaking foil I love it so I'm taking
this just crappy elf eyeshadow brush
spraying off a little fix+
so it's wet and grabs hold onto the
pigments better and then packing that on
my the middle part of my eye and this
just seems like a little lost when I
blend oh my gosh shadows out so I will
probably reapply a little after I apply
the rest of my eyeshadows dipping it
into here and knocking it off and then
just going in and patting it on the
middle section of my eye
then I'm taking my Too Faced natural eye
palette which I received in my peel box
someone sent it to me so again thank you
so much I told you guys I'm gonna use it
in a video so I am I'm taking this nice
deep deep brown shade called sex fresco
and just applying this on a Mac pointed
brush and going in on the crease and
outer part of my eye I'm kind of
creating like a sideways V as you can
see it's messy again don't worry I'll
fix that later when you blend it all out
don't you take my favorite favorite
brush ever which is this Mac 217 se
brush I don't know if this will make up
but they probably up something similar
and taking a morphe this shade right
here it's peachy sparkly shade taking up
excess and then going in to blend out
these three shadows
and then some of the shadows might have
gotten lost in the blending like the
amber brush with maybe a little of the
orange so I'm just gonna go back in and
pack a little more of those colors on to
make sure everything is vibrant and you
can see every different color
okay then going in with winged liner
which is this hairiest part because you
can easily mess this up and ruin the
whole friggin eye look I'm just taking
this body ography pro gel eyeliner brush
and then my Maybelline gel eyeliner I'm
very unstable when it comes to my
eyeliner and I'm very shaky so we'll see
how this goes but we'll try her best
okay so I finished both the eyeliners
and my camera died and some they look a
little rough but that's okay so I'm just
giving my naked skin concealer and in
the shade light I'm just gonna apply
this under my eyes to highlight it's a
very very thick though and very very
yellow undertone so like a little of
this goes a long way I'm just gonna
bring down the bridge of my nose as well
keep its bow forehead and chin to even
out all of the under-eye mess that just
occurred and I'm gonna look like Simba
anyway I'm just gonna blend in with the
other side of my Beauty Blender
sometimes there's a blend as well it's a
little dry so I'm gonna go again in with
my fix plus by Mac damn it everything up
and then go in again and blend it out
everything seems to blend easier when
it's a little wet um I'm not you train
this concealer because it doesn't blend
well it just sits on top of the face so
after that I'm just going to go in oh my
god I hate that I'm gonna go in with my
favorite master can see all Maybelline
concealer which is a lot wetter and
easier to blend and just fix this mess
that's caused by the naked concealer
then I'm just taking it this Vasanti
foundation brush and going in with some
pressed powder to fix this mess of
concealer blend that all in instead it
so doesn't crease
and then the other parts that I applied
it so it all matches and blends evenly
okay then I'm going to go in with one of
my favorite brushes ever which is from
Vasanti as well and it's a powder brush
and just I'm going to go in with my NYC
runs their in 720 a sunny and go in with
a deep contour for this fault look I
think that's necessary Shin do that cut
it off
and go in lightly and then in circular
motions to form with the contour brush a
little up towards my temples
my forehead and then blend that out as
well a little on my chin and then I'm
gonna go in with a bigger fluffy brush
and blend this all out so we don't look
orange
I'm gonna go very light with the
highlight I pack a highlighter champagne
pop just because I always ever do it
with the highlighter it's just a quick
little swoop and that's all we're gonna
need for this look because the main
focus is not the highlighter this is
just to give a natural glow okay moving
on taking my chela defining eyebrow gel
and just gluing it in the brows down and
this isn't it has no color it's just the
Jo giving them the shape that I want
because otherwise my eyebrows are all in
whack then taking my Mac 219 pointed
brush again that I used for my crease
I'm going to go and under my lash line
I'm going to put a little of this orange
color that I already used and then a
little of this brown just to darken that
up and smoke just under eye out and make
it all match evenly and I already
applied a Mac smolder eyeliner under are
on my waterline and so we're good there
then I'm gonna go in with lashes it /
time with my duo glue in my natural elf
lashes which are my favorite and I'm
just going to put the glue on let him
get a little tacky and then apply them
to give this dramatic look the finishing
touch it needs and we'd start the show
Miami fever or kathleenlights club
liquid lipsticks so its first time I
cited that the first time I've ever
tried it and I'm really excited to try
it I try to say like six sentences there
so liquid this lipsticks that's was
paper long-lasting okay let's see how it
is my true opinion reaction
I color is beautiful it's very easy to
apply it's great oh yeah everyone who's
comment said I overdrawn my lips and I'm
like I actually don't I understand
because I don't like personally I don't
really like the shape of them because my
bottom lip is so much bigger than my
upper lip and it just looks weird fight
over draw it so like I can't always look
stupid so no I don't i under draw if
anything
I don't know kathleenlights personally
inches and on me so like I could say
whatever I'm going to say about this and
I don't care but this is the most
amazing one of the most amazing
lipsticks I've ever tried I love it is
very matte and drying that's for sure
it's not easy to move but like oh my god
