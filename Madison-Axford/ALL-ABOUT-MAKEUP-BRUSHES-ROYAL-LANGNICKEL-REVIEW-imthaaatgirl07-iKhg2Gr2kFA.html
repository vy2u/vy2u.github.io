redundant buzz before on my channel
which is all about makeup brushes in
general I've never had that many makeup
brushes until recently when I got some
royal and langnickel here's the me brush
set and then it's just like changed my
opinion on brush sets I was always like
why do you need that many brushes like
just get that one Zeo Nate I was one of
those people and I get it because it can
be expensive but in the end if you think
about it if you buy one of these brush
sets or two of them are 100 or none
whatever
you're still gonna like save money than
buying individual brushes and you have
like every brush you could ever must be
made for any makeup application ever so
the only other brush that I'm not gonna
talk about that I might be missing is
like a Beauty Blender
a beauty blenders just a sponge you know
what it looks like just to apply
foundation and maybe powders that if
using to apply my foundation though
except I seamlessly anyway today I'm
here to talk about all what brushes do
what kind of which there are four eye
shadow face whatever lip eyeliner and
I'm really excited because I'm obsessing
these brush sets check them out so yes
one is the 20 piece one it one of this
is the 20 piece one and then the other
set is a six piece and one comes in a
carrying case and one doesn't so I'll
start with the six piece that does not
come in a carrying case these are very
thick brushes like look how big that is
yes are not I shadow obviously they're
mainly Foundation and powder brushes so
it's from the revolution line and if you
can see it all be listed down below the
two sets that I have and let me just go
through the individual six brushes in
the video the first one which is my
favorite in the set it's called be X
zero zero and this is what I use for
just powder application and also
blending out bronzer so I'll put runs on
with a different brush and I blend it
out with this huge fluffy brush and also
a new thing is like baking your makeup
which a lot of drag queens started were
you like baked the powder and the
bronzer to really define and make a
heavy distinct precise creases with your
powder and makeup application this is
also great for using that so it's just
really really big fluffy if you can see
that it's they're all very soft and girl
synthetic just love this for powder
application so yes
I'm going to share with you is the x.25
which is the angled kabuki as you can
see it's similar to the first one except
it is angled this is amazing for bronze
your application I find cuz I just dip
this in my bronzer and then go in and
it's easy to define the line of where
you want the bronzer to go with your
cheekbones because angled rather than
round therefore it makes the line more
of a line in a contour um in like a fake
cheekbone rather than like a circle or
blob of bronzer so I love using this for
my bronze application because it's kind
of like an arse eita but not as
expensive then we have bx 20 which is a
flat top kabuki you can see that right
here i am like i talked of flat top
kabuki x' actually i like three other
ones um I really like these for powder
foundation application as well as liquid
foundation you can apply this you can
buy liquid foundation with this brush
because it's just like I don't know it's
easier to apply with this rather than a
dome because this is just all over the
place where this is more stiff on the
top also when I'm using my matte
foundation powders and excuse this
because it's very stiff and precise and
like as you can see it's all even on
every sites not slanted you dip it in
and then it just applies the foundation
powder from Mac seamlessly FX better
whatever this club this is more firm top
which makes powder application much
easier than some of the other brushes
then we have bx 45 and this is known for
a foundation brush however it is such a
small brush i don't think i would use
this for foundation I use this
particularly for putting the powder
underneath my eyes after I said it or
after I concealed my under eyes then I
go in with powder and I pet under here
cuz it's the perfect shape that fits
right under your eyes also if I'm using
a dark like eyeliner on my waterline
like I am now and it goes a little down
below I will set it with powder to make
sure it doesn't smudge and run all over
the place I can wearing blue right now
in my eyes so I set powder with on top
of that as well with this brush I really
like this one's very tiny and it's
actually coming to oh it's very hiding
and it comes in a lot of use I have
found I didn't think I'd use it as much
as I do
but it's one of my most used more than
out of all of these then we have bx 40
which is a larger version of that one
which this is also for our foundation
this is liquid foundation strictly i
don't think i would use this for any
powder but if you're going in with a
very heavy thick foundation especially i
would go on with this and then you
my hand and petted none this is one I
could paint brush rather than like a
sponge obviously or like flat top kabuki
so it does paint seamlessly but I would
recommend more of a thick foundation not
like a BB cream or anything because it
was just kind of move it all over the
place this really sets it in and Pat's
it precisely where you want it to go and
sit so that's what that is and the last
one in this revolution sets is another
great one which is bx 35 which is like a
highlighter this is very very um then on
top you can see it's not very wide like
other ones are because you don't wanna
overdo with the highlighter which i
often do you don't overdo it so it's
nice and narrow and you just kind of go
in either way you can like swoop it on
like that or go in like this I would
recommend going like that rather than
that cuz that's gonna create a huge
thick line of highlighter going that way
rather than this so just going in like
that and brushing it up and yeah it's a
nice highlighting tool but I would
rather use a fan for highlighter because
it disperses it more lightly and this is
very dense this is like if you want a
highlight you better go in and do the
highlight rather than the other works
I'm going to show you but that is the
revolution set which I adore they're
very very high quality synthetic brushes
like I already said and yeah I love them
so they do many different things and
even if it says just foundation you can
obviously use it for other things like I
would show you especially in this kit
many of them are dual uses and kind of
try use it so moving on to this set this
is the royal and langnickel master Pro
professional 20 piece set comes this
nice leather pouch which I feel like a
real makeup artist with this you untie
the fake leather and then here comes for
me look so many brushes like you don't
even know to do it yourself when I first
got this I was just like what what what
so let's just take a moment and adorn
this
I love these brushes because there's so
my quality and I will tell you my
favorites and most used ones I'll just
I'm gonna start right here this end okay
the very first brush we have is bmp-1
5-8 those are the code and he's gonna
look these up and it is a it's naturally
called a lash brush that the more
professional name is a spoolie if you've
heard of that
this is to comb through lashes or
eyebrows I use this for eyebrows I don't
know what you necessarily be coming
through lashes with this you can get a
lash separator for that but this is a
spoolie nice to cut out your natural
brow design and figure to then go in and
fill it or set it or whatever you gonna
do with your brows if you choose to do
something rubs you don't have to do
anything with your brows but if you are
interested in doing stuff with your
brows this is nice to comb through
before and after application of gel just
to make sure everything is in shape and
you don't like over draw and eyebrow
work shouldn't be overdrawn and stuff
like that so I use a spoolie every day I
don't recommend that you do because it's
not necessary but it's nice once you get
if you decide to get more interested in
makeup and stuff like that then
definitely check out civility because
it's just a nice tool really cheap to
have the next brush in this set is a
bmp-1 for seven which is a metal lash
comb now this can separate lashes but be
careful you don't poke your something
iyx it's very sharp
it really hurts but this is also kind of
like an older style of spoolie for
combing it through your brows it does
hurt those wouldn't be my first choice
but it is a comer through this is also
great to use if you want to get like
mascara clumps out of eyelashes um
once you're done applying mascara before
it has totally dry and stuff but I like
clumpy mascara personally my personal
opinion so I don't know if I didn't use
it for that I don't really get much you
said of this one but it's just nice to
have in case anyone ever needs this next
one I have I hate I'm sorry but this is
like what you get with like makeup that
you get it like chuck-e-cheese for your
coins you know I mean like if you get
like free makeup somewhere this is the
little brush that comes with it it's a
sponge brush bmp-1 for four it's great
to get free um I don't use these though
I throw that every time I get it with
any makeup you get at the dollar store
you get at the drugstore you get it so
for it you get one of these with it most
likely I guess not so far but you know
what I mean
it comes with cheap makeup and um I
throw it away
I hate these I wouldn't spend money on
this becomes to the
kid that's fine but it just doesn't do
anything it's like the phone you know
what I'm talking about you've seen these
before it is literally like this is not
good for a plane anything whatsoever so
I don't know why they included it per se
but it came with it so whatever but I'm
like I spent a lot of time on that cuz I
don't use it next we have BMP 143 and
this is a sponge smudger smudges are
much better to use when their
sponge-like material rather than a brush
a brush just kind of doesn't do much but
where a sponge is such a dense material
to be put on to be put on the end of a
brush that it really gets in there and
smudges the shadow the liner whatever it
is because brushes like don't move it
around cuz it more flimsy this is such a
dense like material like I said it
really gets in there and moves and
smudge is that whenever you want to I
smudged out my liner with this and it
really helps move it all together bring
the entire makeup book together because
it is smudged it looks like more
professional like you actually took the
time to blend it all in and not just the
harsh line sitting there so we get so
you can use this for shadows or eyeliner
but I'd say mostly just eyeliner because
you can belen doubt shadows rather than
smudge then but I really like this I
didn't think I would but I haven't using
it a lot so it's definitely necessary
this kit knows what you need the next
brush is bmp-1 5-1 and this is an angled
brow brush you can see there the harsh
angle this is very nice because it is
another dense brush it's not very flimsy
at all because when you're doing
eyebrows you don't want a flimsy brush I
don't fill in my eyebrows but if I did I
have in the past I know I don't want a
flimsy brush I want something that would
be nice and like get in there and create
nice sharp lines because natural
eyebrows usually have sharp definitions
in certain places and flimsy brush is
just gonna make your lines
hey wild crazy looking bad and people
will know that it's fake I mean you can
always kind of tell when eyebrows filled
in and drawn on but at least you want to
make it looking like a good Jonathan
eyebrow not like oh she must be used a
flimsy eyebrow brush so yes this eyebrow
brush is amazing because it's thin very
very thin to create a realistic looking
eyebrow line and outline but it's also
firm and it doesn't move all over the
place when you're applying things next
we have PMP won 5-3 and this is just
called a definer brush you really use
this for anything you can use it for
smudging you can use it for
eyebrows because it is so thin you can
use it for an application you can use it
for eyeshadow this is really a multi-use
brush I don't get much use out of it
though because it is so so skinny um
again it's not flimsy though so you can
easily use it for an eyebrow brush but I
don't get much use out of this if I were
to use this a lot more I would probably
just use it for packing on and applying
my inner corner colors because it's
small and can fit in there nicely but
other than that not I have a used brush
by me we're getting to my more used ones
coming up the next one is one of my more
used ones which I didn't think it would
be and it's BMP 159 it's called a lip
brush however it is very flimsy of a
brush and I wouldn't use this for my lip
because lip okay if you're gonna apply
your lip liner liquid lipstick lip gloss
lipstick whatever it is with a brush you
wouldn't need that brush should be
frickin stiff and firm and dense just
like an eyebrow brush because you need
to create very very distinct precise
lines when drying your lips you can't be
all like no because it would look really
bad and fake then and messy you want to
be like bam bam bam bam bam
when you're doing a lips and this is
very flimsy um for my liking up a lip
brush I know why this is called a lip
brush per se but what I use this for is
when I blend shadows on my waterline or
under my like eyelid right there because
I do like to apply lots of blues greens
blacks Browns grace shadows under here
as many people do you don't just do
eyeshadow right here you do it under as
well and this brush is perfect it's very
skinny and narrow and gets in there and
blends it all evenly and it doesn't hurt
my eyes where he stops just like all
these are synthetic again I I don't know
I adore this brush I didn't think I
would I was like oh it's this time you
want a lip okay
but I find myself using it and choosing
it to apply shadows under here all the
time
next we have BMP 1 for 6 in angled
eyeliner or brow brush um again a little
bit too flimsy for my liking for an
eyebrow brush if you would go innovate
to see how it kind of like goes you can
see that like all over the place um I
would much rather use this this would be
a great gel liner applicator because it
is
tends to a point where
it's good for NN open eyebrows but it's
also kind of flimsy which is also good
for gel liner because you need your
brush to easily be flexible and move to
get that perfect winged liner flick tip
that you are trying to get usually when
you use gel liner to get a cat eye thing
um so yes I really like this for gel
I've not used this one per se I'm gonna
be honest I'm not use this one but it's
just like all the other gel liner
brushes I have a 2 or 3 more they're all
like this they're all the same feeling
so I know it's work just as great I
don't use it yet because I don't want to
dirty this up and I just use my other
ones still but this is the same exact
thing I use for any gel on application
of my liner next brush is a bmp-1 5:4
and this is a concealer brush you can
see it's very very narrow and skinny but
it also has that perfect like okay this
is the thing you wouldn't use this for
like these two for concealer brushes
because they're not the right shape for
like common concealer application spots
like under your eyes the most
predominantly concealer applied spot
does that make sense you know what I
mean most concealer is applied there or
an acne and so this brush as you can see
the tip is rounded so it fits perfectly
in the eye socket and underneath and I
use this to apply the concealer on my
eyelid before I apply an eyeshadow cuz
I'm using concealer as a base now like
right now currently and under here sits
perfectly to apply it my concealer and
blend it all out then I'll go in later
with my meaty blender and help it blend
in a little more um but yeah this works
amazingly especially in this tiny little
spots like in here this is always kind
of a bitch to work with because you can
never get concealer and there without
messing up everything else but this is
very precise and gets in there and I
love that and there's a reason this is a
concealer brush and not an eyeshadow and
the other ones aren't concealer brushes
because this one is perfect for that
next we have in bmp-1 56 angled shader
brush this alright this is the this is
the deal I have a beautiful beautiful
favorite that's it's my absolute
favorite of all time it's in this that I
use it for shading all my shows together
and blending all my shadows together
this one you can use for that but it is
angled so I'm not a huge fan of this any
good shader is where you like apply your
crease
and then kind of blend it in it works
great it's soft and I did use it and
they liked it but there's just one other
one that's just like I think if you're
getting it wet rational you get one
brush get the one I'm about to show you
like that's coming up in like five
brushes but yeah I like this one it's
just used to angle you know the crease
shadow that you are applying and then
blending it all together next we have
bmp-1 five seven it's another angled
blender and angled blender other than
shaders so this one is like a flat top
and good blender if you can see that
where as this one is rounded it's like a
dome this one's like a square you can
see that um this one's kind of just the
same thing like honestly it packs it on
a little better because it's not as
flimsy it's more firm and a flat top but
it's not my favorite to blend all the
shadows together I feel like it looks
very um if you want to be able to see it
there's different color shadows you can
pick one of these but if you want them
all to be blended seamlessly together
you can use one of the other ones I'm
about to show you now for some reason is
to have the exact same brush in this set
I don't understand what happened there
but they're both bmp-1 for eight large
eyes shader and if you can see this
one's a little taller than the exact
same brush though the exact same large
size and this I have one of these from
Mac as well I do not understand why you
would use these two for eyeshadow and I
guess if you're just gonna garage door
and Dew one shade for your entire lid
you can just kind of like swoop it
across there and I guess you can use
this if you wanted you a one shade lid
which I did do in my fall makeup
drugstore look I did just a plum you
could kind of like carve out the crease
with like it pointed and then flat it
out you could just like swoop the plum
on I understand that but it's so big I'd
be worried that I would get my makeup
everywhere like on my eyelid so there's
two of these I don't really use these
unless I'm doing it just one color then
we have bmp-1 for a night in pencil
blender to blend out your pencil
eyeliners however however that's not
what I use this for either so you can
use it for that obviously but I found
other brushes that are for that in this
better for something else when I'm doing
and I should have look I always usually
use four to five eyes shadows and my
three main ones are my inner corner of
my middle transition color and then my
crease color which is usually a darker
call
or a pressed glitter pigment and that
blend it all together with the other
brush that's my favorite it's coming up
anyway this is amazing for my transit
should collect in the middle like right
now I'm using orange right here I'm
gonna brown like round and then a gold
pigment and I'm blending it all together
and the brown applicator you got to get
in there nice and because it's a very
skinny little transition section at
least that's what I do and I blend it in
with this it's the perfect perfect
perfect size it's not too big it's not
too flat it's around you just buff it
into the previous color you got pied on
your inner corner and inner lid and then
I don't know it just like works
perfectly for me for that application
and I like having supper brushes that do
with different things because I don't
want to keep missing up with the colors
and like I don't know I have one brush
for like ooh I got to do my transition
color in the middle of my lid now I'm
gonna get this beyond p14 night you know
I don't know let's just make them next
is one of my own this isn't my all-time
all-time favorite but this is one of my
top top tops and it's bmp-1 5:5 covered
by fluff and this is what I used to
press the pigments or colors in on my
inner corner i have many brushes like
this from ELF from Mac um from Sigma but
uh this is one of my favorites because
it's very very thick elf is kind of not
as thick as this one this is just an
amazing brush because you can use this
to blend yes you can use it for many
different things but I literally pack on
I spray this with a little fix plus my
Mac and then I just press on the glitter
pigments if I'm using them homing in her
corner which I sometimes do or like
right now I have an orange matte color
on my inner corner and I will just press
this on it's the perfect like size 2 and
it fits perfectly not to go above the
crease but press on the shadows that's
why I use this for I love it
and then my all-time favorite brush
these though ok bmp-1 500 tapered
blending if you're gonna get one thing
out of this video get this brush I have
one like this kind of from Mac but I've
had it for like 10 years honestly and I
watched it don't worry but it's getting
a little old because it is old it's been
through many many applications of
eyeshadow this one is flimsy for days
and I love it for that that's the good
thing about this brush lens
it's not always used in a negative
manner this is used to blend all my
shows together especially when you use
more than one color you don't want a
harsh line someone a blonde them all
together so you don't see like oh
there's the orange oh there's the brown
oh there's the go and glitter I want to
blend it all together so it looks like
when I shout out but like there's
different dimensions and parts of it and
so you take this usually within a
transition color I should put a peach or
something a tan nude on it and to blend
these all together to start there and go
in circular motions and go all the way
into my crease and then out love it love
it so much love it oh when it's time to
use this brush I get so excited I'm like
and so then I just go in and I'm just
like yes and yeah I love it if one
seamlessly I never ever had a problem
with these already any of the brushes
this is just amazing
next is another one of my favorites
which is bmp-1 4-5 a finishing fan so
this is what I personally to apply my
highlighter I used to apply it with this
like elf brush which I love love love
but it was applying very very distinct
line a highlighter which I really like
to begin with but after a while I was
like haven't you shown you these videos
I'm too highlighted in these pictures so
this um you usually I don't go in like
that I go in like from the side so I
kind of do that to get the highlighter
on the brush and then I go in and just
kind of fan it on and it gives a more
natural finish I feel like it's very
light and it just like it doesn't pick
up the much product on the fan so then
when you put it on it's not like an
overwhelming amount of shininess it's
just the perfect little highlight you
can go in with your brush pointed down
to the powder and then apply it like
that but it's more again of a thick line
because it's quite a little thick a
little fan there you can see that so I
usually should like to go in with um
just the bottom of it or just like the
bottom of it like it face down and then
just kind of like brushed on like so
next we have three brushes left this is
bmp-1 for tube blush I don't personally
like this for a blush brush I feel like
it's kind of a bad design for blush it's
great it's greatly made it's not truly
made or anything it's just like I don't
like this is such a classic blush brush
when everyone thinks blush or a cup when
companies sell blush brushes this is the
brush format that they sell is always
this kind of pointed thing where I like
a more pointed angled brush to kind of
like a
I inch to the apples of my cheeks and my
temples this I get where they're going
with it I just personally don't like
these for blush but this is a perfect
blush brush if you're looking for one
because you don't want our piyo powders
with one brush like powder needs a
different brush bronzer it's a different
brush and blush does you can't mix all
this together nudes pinks and bronzes or
oranges or tans do not go together they
need separate brushes because they do
separate things in my opinion and my
next we have bmp-1 5 - another
foundation brush and I don't need Chi
foundation brushes obviously because
it's just like the one I have in my
other set but this is the only brush
that really overlaps like any other set
I have two of them um so this is again
just to apply a thick foundation really
a liquid foundation and you just apply
it this is like very very precise I'm
painting on and I used to use these a
lot but I just have fun a little beauty
blender over and over and over again I
never seem to not you'll be better to
apply my foundation with so anyway the
last brush we have is bmp-1 for one
powder and this is the thing this is
another typical powder brush when
companies make powder brushes just like
the blush it's just like over you dip it
in the pattern you put it all over your
face but I would prefer to use this one
that I previously showed you because
it's so big in cover more area in less
time and it's more dense so it really
pets on the powder however if you're
very shiny and the foundation ever matte
mattifies are thrives you might want to
use this because it's very lighter and
flimsier and it wouldn't move your
foundation mine dry sand sets really
quickly products my skin so dry it just
absorbs the liquid foundation so fast
so putting this on it doesn't move my
foundation around but that is a problem
with people very oily skin so this is a
lighter flims your brush and it wouldn't
move your foundation around once you
have it all set perfectly so this is
nice to just kind of lightly apply so
those are my brushes do those are my
favorite Russians ever oh my god royal
and langnickel load them up please go go
look them up they're definitely worth it
