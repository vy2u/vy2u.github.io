so much um because last one we didn't
have the prices and like we get them on
the back of the notecards of the city's
what the is this but then they put
oh my god Sonja thank you bucks a tramp
twenty dollars a month per box for this
box company and if that further ado
let's hop right into the five things
that I got this month first we have
purely slip comfort $16 regular this
advanced little nourishes enriched with
mango and shea butter jojoba and rich
bran oil is that in vitamin E that
richly hydrate and seal in moisture this
exclusive petroleum free bomb heels dry
and cracked lips leaving them lush soft
moist and youthful looking it's just
like a clear yeah okay um okay it's very
like it doesn't have a smell at all but
it does have a very watery oily texture
um I'm usually just use like you as well
so I'm going to be honest but this looks
like a very like expensive like ooh la
la fancy freaking chopsticks oh ok i
will try that cool beans awesome next is
blink cosmetics is lash primer Oh lash
primer ice is that all the time before I
noticed um fake eyelashes ok / fireboats
volume and we'll have your mascara
looking the blackest of blacks this
innovative silicone juan separates and
lengthens while the blank black lash
primer co slashes twice with six dollars
regular what how do i get it out okay
cool beans i was a cool dome tube look
at this okay so it literally looks like
a freaking mascara but it's a primer
mind blown okay so it literally why am i
like putting so much on my hand it's
black obviously cuz lash farmers I've
had before have been clear and white
I've never had a black eye lash primer
but you could probably just like where
this even without mascara because it's
freaking black that's cool um I'm
excited to try this like I had like I
said I haven't tried a um I lash or
mascara primer so long since I hair and
wearing falsies but I put this on then
mascara then volts
the perfect two slashes ever next is
Anderson Lily let your skin indulge and
luxurious and soothing blend of bears mo
citrus white jasmine Brazilian hella

hour and this is sooo yeah okay okay
let's see what this smells like and if
it's a creamy oh my god it's like so
thick it won't even come out oh my god
okay um it smells that my god I got all
over my face it smells good but it
smells like lotions you'd get for free
in like a hotel if you know what I mean
umm it smells good it just smells like
literally like fancy hotel um I the
texture is honestly maybe it's cuz I
mean you so much just like any other
emotion I do appreciate the thickness of
it how it doesn't run right out like a
Gracie slobbering ocean mess um and I'm
sure this makes your hands super soft
but I wouldn't know cuz it's my first
time trying it feels like any other like
creamy lotion to be honest but um yeah I
mean it's nice I'll service in my bag
even though it's freaking bigger than an
article and go from there and I'll tell
you how it is later your minerals
eyeshadow I've had your minerals before
oh it's a loose pigment that's awesome
I've had loose pit minerals before a dry
like setter in white powder and I'm love
it I got it from boxster as well but I
love your minerals from Sweden bran $21

minerals eyeshadow it's a hundred
percent made of minerals and works
perfect as a standalone eyeshadow or
blended together there I showed us
create a more voluptuous effect what
color is this brown hypnotic dare say
that don't Madison come on it is it's a
pressed pigment what's beautiful I don't
know ficking up much but is right there
it's like a light brown that's probably
quite buildable yeah let's see I love
that I love that it's like a gray brown
that's going to beautifully compress it
right on whether you have I shower on or
not
