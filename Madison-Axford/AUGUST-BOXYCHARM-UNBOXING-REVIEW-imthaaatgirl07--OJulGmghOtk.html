video for you it's my favorite monthly
box company it will get that water
bottle off the screen thank you
it's boxycharm this this is definitely
my favorite box company cuz there's only
$21 for the box each month and then you
get five full-size products every month
it says 45 every single time I've got it
for like four or five months I think
I've gotten five full-size products and
I do use a lot of them every day some of
them is just my personal preference I
don't you just like I don't use level
even conditioners and I don't use you
know stuff to fill my eyebrows but a lot
of the stuff I literally use every day
and I love it and there's such good
quality products that you three aren't
sold an ultra support so you might not
know about these kind of brands by
boxycharm is here to let you guys know
about them so yes I'm going to show you
what the what came in their August box
so here's the little card okay gorgeous
Globetrotter deer charmers bucket take
it Mick can I read book a ticket pack a
bag and let wanderlust be your guide
this month we're seeing the world and
exploring destinations unknown globe
shot gorgeously okay okay so the first
thing is something that I wanted for so
long which is a Coastal Scents palette
and I've never bought one i just forgot
about it but I always wanted a Coastal
Scents palette and they give you a
full-size 20 eyeshadow colors palette
and like I was like stunned
so it's called revealed like 3d by
Coastal Scents comes out of the box and
I haven't tried any of these products
yeah except for the eye liner which I'll
talk about later anyway there's
literally 20 colors and they're all like
these really nice pinky purpley autumn
tones so let me just watch one and I'll
swatch this gold Wow look at that
pigmentation okay I wouldn't want to try
Coastal Scents this is one of the first
big brands that a lot of youtubers like
original youtubers used I feel like like
it was like BH Cosmetics and Coastal
Scents arm decay and that's what
everyone really started with and I never
got around like I said you're buying a
Coastal Scents palette so I'm amazed
that they did not give you one color
they gave you 20 colors in
a Coastal Scents palette so that's
awesome and I'm very happy with those
colors and I'll be excited to try those
oh and that is typically 39.95 on sale
now for 1995 so get it by Ken or just
get boxycharm next is Mike mica mica
mica beauty gel eyeliner these are all
full-size products by the way too and
this runs for $35 and I tried the silent
reason I have been very into gel
eyeliners recently it was liquid forever
in a day and I'm never a huge fan of
pencil but I'm trying gel in right now
because I'm doing more intense eye every
day and this this is such an amazing gel
eyeliner however you need to be very
very careful with it you need to have a
very steady hand with jawline and gel
eyeliner and I'd be I mean I'm kind of
glad to say that you need to be precise
when you're doing winged eyeliner
because if you like me are still a
little like I'm the whole winged
eyeliner thing I wouldn't jump right
into this um because it's so wet then it
just kind of slide it's everywhere so if
you can do the per click motion and
bring it down that's gonna be fine
you're gonna be great if you're like oh
makeup makeup makeup artist then you're
gonna be kind of this I like kind of
thicker less smooth formulas like the
Maybelline one or like essence or
something like that because it's easier
for me to smudge it out if I make a
mistake where this is like it's it's a
one-time thing however it's super
high-quality and I loved using it I just
kind of like effed up the wing a little
bit with it
but so be careful with it be careful
with it it lasts a really long time it
does not come off easily by any means
with a Mike white it's a struggle to get
it off
that's good it doesn't melt away but it
is a little wet and gooey so make sure
it dries but be careful when you're
doing it but I loved it I was like this
is some high quality shoes up in here
so yes mica beauty cosmetics they give
you also I love how they always got good
brushes with these things because maybe
you don't have a gel eyeliner brush or
they always make sure you have the tools
you need to use these things anyway um
it's a cita Seita eyeliner brush $16 and
this I've already used are you tried it
with the gel eyeliner and I didn't think
I'd like it at first cuz it's so pointy
there's no angle to it so it'll be hard
to get a cat eye it is a little bit but
it's so nice when you're going along the
top of your lid and down to your
line in the corner of your eye it's so
nice using this because it's so tiny
precise and sharp and not sharp like it
hurts but you know what I mean like BAM
like it gets with you what you want and
it's not it doesn't like costs a thick
line it's very nice and sharp and it's
very nice and tiny and pointy and it's
just like I went to in the right
direction you get the exact precise line
that you want however it's a little hard
to do a wing with this if you're gonna
wing it out because it's so tiny that
you need to have the exact wing like
outline in your brain like you need to
know how to draw it on and do it
otherwise because you usually I do it
was an angled brush and so much easier
to flick it up and drop down so it's a
little complicated but like higher
skills make up people unlike me will
probably love this so I need it used to
wet I liked it is a very high quality
brush there's no G products that I tried
this month so far next we have Neos
shield leave-in conditioner $26 it runs
for and this is a huge bottle in my
opinion like it's literally four ounces
in here I'm going to smell this I guess
because I don't need to put in my hair
right now my hair spine I don't use any
product my hair ever um so they sent a
leave-in conditioner I think last month
or something they sent for hair and I
use it per se because it's not that it's
bad by any means it's not that it's not
worth the price or the money of
boxycharm it's just a personally use
leave-in conditioners or dry shampoos
anymore so no man let me just mist spray
this it's like a pump okay it's like a
gel oh hold on this in the Box scared oh
okay I think it's like a mousse which
actually I might use this because I most
want to try them is non greasy texture
what s SPF 15 for scalp that's amazing
because my scalp honestly gets so burned
okay I'm taking all my words back and
I'm gonna try this and probably tell you
guys it's amazing say love that there's
SPF for the scalp and there I'm sure my
mom that's here she's never freak she
loves protecting our scalps this is what
it looks like on my finger it's okay
it's not a mousse texture per se but
it's like a gooey hold you see that it's
a gooey texture for sure
maybe if it's like a pool or Beach day I
was definitely using that
as my scalp is really pinkish right okay
I'm excited now what the last thing is a
so Susan statement skin what
oh it can highlight in crayon $20 are
ones for it comes this little box to
roll up it's a roll up and down it's not
a sharpen and it's not a liquid so let's
see this crayon how it works
oh okay
it definitely has the a Sheerness to it
like it does blend in I like it the
problem of this is I always have
problems with cream highlighters I think
it's because I put my you know don't get
pissed when I say this because you don't
know I think that makeup and it's like
okay back off girl but I honestly think
that I put the powder on first and then
I should have put a cream on over top
that and then it just doesn't really
work well it always looks flaky and
crumbly on my skin when I put a cream
highlighter on like Mac pearl oh he
sucks where I like a palette or better
like that good Jaclyn hill so um I
definitely like this color it's very
look at that shine it's actually more
surprising than I thought if I was
messed up so check that out for sure so
Susan statements can um just usually
when I find a product I really like like
the judgmental highlighter I just stick
to that forever and I don't really try
to find a new thing this month was a
very successful month I'm very excited
and happy with what I got and I'm really
happy to try the things I didn't try
already if you're not already take a
moment to subscribe to my channel and
become a fierce and confident Eva lick
me and the rest of us on here and check
back later for new videos I post new
videos all the time thank you so much
