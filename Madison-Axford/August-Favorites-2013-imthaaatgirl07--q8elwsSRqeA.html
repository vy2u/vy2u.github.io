my August favorites I hope it's not too
late I know today's September 14th well
then filling it is but I couldn't pass
up in August favorites i love doing
favorites videos i combined june june
and july's so i had to do in august even
though it's lots of teeny bit late sorry
been super busy with work in school blah
blah blah blah blah like always also
would 730 when I'm filming this was kind
of dark I don't have much natural light
and my legs got messed up but whatever
i'm still gonna film I know the lighting
maybe a little dark but you guys can see
me and everything's a ok if you can just
see me we're good let's get started my
first beat of favorite that i have is
Garnier's skin renew anti dark circle
roller concealer thing and i'm patient i
still sell this it is a little old
though i'm not old like oh it's all
crusty and gross but uh the product is
from like last year i think i didn't
open it though until like last month so
i've been using this non-stop it's
amazing and it matches perfectly with
the BB cream i'm using they're both like
in this kind of gold to when i use the
carnate BB cream that i love it's nice
whoa i'm on my second bottle of that
anyway this just matches perfectly with
the color i'm not sure what color it is
you know I don't say anywhere but anyway
it's just a nice rollerball and it's
like matches my under eye color
perfectly I just blend that in and we're
good to go and I just love the stuff i
reapply it a few times said of the day
because does tend to wear off but other
than that i absolutely love this product
and i'm so glad i found it under eye
concealer that works well for me and the
heat from the rollerball like just kind
of brightens your eye and rising wakes
you up and just this product is great i
love it sorry that I don't know the name
of the shade and color again but yeah
it's probably the lightest one next I
have my Urban Decay optical blurring
brush this was kind of a splurge by cuz
I got a paycheck nose like I'm gonna buy
something crazy that I would never
usually buy so i went to alta and they
had this optical blurring brush for
foundation from urban decay and i was
like oh wow this must be a new brush so
of course i bought it i love foundation
brushes and i've been using a Beauty
Blender sponge sounds like what the hey
we'll go back to a brush or than a
sponge for my foundation and this works
amazingly it does a really good job at
getting the crease lines out so if you
have creases like around your nose
around your forehead which I do um if
you just you know I don't even know
brush a little harder in those areas
there's that going to be a line there
because this does like blur those lines
out gets rid of the creases and I do
really love this brush it's big and
fluffy um yet it's like not hard but
it's like soft but firm so that it does
put your foundation I'm good it doesn't
leave streaks or cake eNOS or like
little dots I used to have that when I
would use this sponge like that i got
from Ulta but I way I love this brush
you should definitely check it out it's
$25 from urban decay and yay that rhymed
next beauty favorite I have is probably
one of my favorite things ever and it's
rimmel's stay matte long-lasting pressed
powder i was using one from covergirl
like the huge pressed powder 10 it just
made me look really really really cakey
I wasn't Gracie but I looks cakey and
that's almost worse you know if you look
for the cakey however this um is in the
shade 011 creamy natural show you this
and I don't know what's about this but
it kind of gives me a little color like
that like a bronzer but just a little
extra tent over time I BB cream and I
really really love this product it does
make me cuz they became I have on is so
liquid and I love it but it is really
great see looking sometimes but we put
this over it they just go perfectly
together even though they're from
different companies everyone raves about
this everyone has this and it's
seriously like three or four dollars
like I love this stay matte I not a huge
kind of Rimmel but this is definitely
amazing and it's by far the best pest
powder I've ever had I literally cannot
do a video without dropping everything
that I show anyway next is from my
friend Caitlyn she got it for me for my
birthday which thank you so much of your
washings kalyan love you and it's the
Naked basics palette by urban decay and
I wanted this because I have the naked
one pellet don't have the negative side
in really want it on that anyway this is
like the baby's like they have baby but
anyway it has six shades which I'll read
them off to you it's Venus is the
lightest one then foxy wwos naked to
faint and cut I've and I create a lot of
new like looks from these colors even
though like this has black as black this
has like a peachy
that's peachy color like they're kind of
similar it's like these are the most
used colors that you're going to use for
like every natural look every every
neutral makeup look you know and I
create a lot of new natural looks and
some crazy smoky eye once with the black
crave but I really love this palette I'm
enjoying trying on new you know colors
and looks on my eyes because i don't
typically wear eyeshadow and i'm just
super grateful that she got this for me
thank you so much again and I'm so
grateful that I have this those were my
beauty favorites now we're going to move
on to body and hair first um I found a
perfumed body splash body spray whatever
that I love I work a gap now and this is
from there and it's the one that is
dream more I know we have like a hundred
of these perfumes and bodies first but I
like the dream more one and this just
smells I can't describe it I love it
i've gotten so many compliments for it I
lost I can't describe it it's like so
feminine girl it yet it's like more like
no wonder people come at me when I spray
this in class and they're like coughing
I had a teacher one of my teachers had
to leave the room cuz i sprayed this oh
my god sorry about that anyway i love
this perfume not when i eat it though
but i have solutely love this and i just
don't know how to describe it it's
amazing she gently check it out this was
like six or seven bucks I got it at the
gap outlet I work at a gap outlet and I
love this up so much my god is just like
my smell now it's like my signature
scent it's so girly i love it good for
hair i have not your mother speech babe
texturizing see so it's right I music
with dead sea salt and sea kelp that was
a long title anyway I love it not your
mother's brand it's one of my favorite
hair bristles like the only hair stuff
that I use but on days that I don't want
to have it pin straight and I don't want
to spend much time blow drying and
straightening my hair for school I'll
just keep it a little damp and put this
all over and scrunch my hair and it
gives you nice like beachy waves i'm not
going to say curls cuz obviously it's
not like that it just gives you a lot of
volume and a lot of added texture and a
lot of like crimped
hair pneus hairnet hair pneus crimpy
hairs crimpy hair yeah I'll go with that
it gives you a lot of texture which you
know mine is just like flat right now
which I like but every like navigate I
want that you know sometimes and one
little volume and curled my hair and
this does it the job this this doesn't
fail on you this isn't like a failed
product I love this it smells amazing
too is kind of like coconuts and this is
just great it's all natural there's like
stuff from like the sea in it and it's
not like any like I didn't know it just
make her greasy or hard or crunchy I
just really like this in it makes your
hair have like a different hairstyle
than usual which I love changing it up

Leah music I love amazing part of my
favorites videos this month a lot of
great songs but I narrowed it down to
five um most of them are new but I like
one old one it's kind of random but
anyway the first one that showed up was
the old one and it's Marin the Diamonds
of course and it's her song num off a
really old album 2009 the family jewels
her first album I love this song it's
sad but it kind of means a lot to me and
I really like it so I'm dance pop club
and anthem but it's definitely a good
song to listen to and I just I don't
know I just love it i'm always touched
by it when i listen to it

ball is so touching and amazing and
next we also have an anthem of the month

out together Lady Gaga and Katy Perry I
knew I had to pick one that I liked
better because I couldn't like both of

had to pick one in and and I thought I
was gonna be roar honestly um but it was
applause applause as my oh my god my
total carjam I am dreaming to record of
this when I Drive
