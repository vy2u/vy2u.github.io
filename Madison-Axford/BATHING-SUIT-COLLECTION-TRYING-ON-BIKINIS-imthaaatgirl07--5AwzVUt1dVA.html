most requested videos ever which is a
bikini bathing suit my hair looks awful
in my inner corner is too bright um
bikini beanie suit collection video I
did one of these last year but everyone
wants updated one still here you go so
usually what being sees I've collected
over the years of my life and what I
wear each summer and yes let's get
started first one is like very famous to
see how everyone has it including myself
and it's this neon colored one from
Target that makes your boobs look huge
literally huge so this is the bra this
is the top it's just like a black
triangle and it has this little center
part with like a yellow neon color strap
and then two pink straps and on the back
it has another yellow and a black one
and I got the matching bottoms because
it's such a cute set it's the black
again and it has um the neon yellow
color on the inside and then the
turquoise and pink and black straps on
the side if you can see that next one
that I got from an online site that I
don't actually remember I'm sorry but
any of the Chinese online shopping sites
that you can shop at probably had this
because they all kinda have the same
similar things and it's this infamous
high-waisted black bathing suit bottom
with like all these straps on the side
so like your whole site is cut out and
showing and I really like this very
scandalous and sexy I guess you could
call it the top is a strapless black top
that has like a big floppy bow on the
front and then on the back it's just all
straps if you're going to dive or swim I
wouldn't recommend any strapless suits
obviously but if you're just you know
laying out with friends go strapless
don't get those tan lines okay anyway
the next basic top I have is by gianni
bini and this is a little too small for
me actually I think I might need to get
rid of it but I've had it for a couple
years is this blue and turquoise
turquoise
um top with a gold like stone
centerpiece in the National once again
these things can be tight or let loose
and it covers your whole butt again and
yes it's just this like kind of spotted
print and I really like it's very bright
and in-your-face and I have this random
top that I got from Target clearance for
your
ago and I bought it because I loved the
color and I loved this kind of cups
because it really company boobs too
however when I bought it I was stupid
and young and I didn't look at the
amount of push-up in this so I will wear
this occasionally but it's very rare and
I'm careful why were it's around 8 the
next time I have it's from AB coming
bitch it's very old
I should probably rid of it because it
doesn't fit me anymore it's just this
really cute pink one pink strap this way
to top that ties in the middle and it
has like little flower decals all on it
like this have gotten bigger these tops
don't really fit me because I'm spilling
out everywhere so that's why I can't
really wear a lot of these anymore
next I have this old tub it's very old
actually it's another halter top it's
from Victoria's Secret not pink just for
secret it's gonna rent it but it's cute
at the same time it's stripes no push
ups just cups it's just the triangle cup
and yeah it's cute ish it's basic and I
just really ratchet green tops in
shopsite I'm sorry I'm saying ratchet I
don't love people problems in that word
I think it's just funny because a lot of
these are old and kind of wonk because
they don't fit anymore and they've been
exposed to a lot of chlorine and Sun
over the years this one's from all Navy
it's green I love the color green on me
with my brown hair it has these gold
accents of beads throughout the triangle
top no push up and yeah it's a halter
it's cute it's very rare but aware that
I work I don't fit in it very well this
one you probably seen a lot it is my
fringy halter top one then I got for
Macy's buy the brand bikini lab so what
it looks like no push up it's just the
triangle cups again but it does provide
good coverage for excitement abou
because of all the chaos going on and
all of these dangly hangy little shrimp
things then I have so Navy top that I
rarely wear but I should because of its
ecologic suppose so it's like this and
the food part it's like a little circle
cut out as these very like African
looking beads not racist they just look
like something that would come from an
African shop and then it is leopard
print and it doesn't cover my boobs well
because it is very skinny coverage and
very sexy and cute plus one I have is
one piece I was quite often when I am
diving or swimming around the pool if
I'm feeling like I'm a mermaid that day
then I'll wear this from February 1 it's
actually not a what a swimsuit I don't
think I think it's one of those leotards
one-piece things that you wear with a
skirt or something but I wear does this
swimsuit and it's
material works fine and that has not
fallen apart it's great I love this
because it looks like a retro 70s that
couch or wallpaper and I love this looks
like saying you see in like old LA I
don't I just like this is pink purple
turquoise white and then it just hooks
down here so yeah it's cute
I wear it sometimes a lot it's very cute
