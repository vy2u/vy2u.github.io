other videos whenever I find free time
my busy schedule I love to record a lot
of videos and then edit and upload them
later just so I can get a lot death yeah
I have time so I'm going to record a lot
anyway this is just a really quick video
I'm doing a product review and it's over
Maybelline stream fresh baby cream eaten
one skin Perfector okay so I my window
opens with your cars or wind or people
you know where thats from it's so such a
nice day and I'm not gonna have it
closed so yeah cracked it open and there
might be a lot of noise distractions but
anyway back to the review let's give me
my first review so I feel like I'm not
gonna be able to make this like a super
long video I just really wanted to like
do a product with you because I recently
got this product I think at the
beginning of november i got it in the
lightest shade light sheer tint OMG
cosine stick stop driving as i am very
very pale and um I wanted to get away
from foundation I'm sick of waking up
every morning um to spend like 10
minutes not 10 is like five minutes
which is actually a long time you think
about it so I could like perfect my
foundations does just as well if not
better than foundation so i was using
Neutrogena Healthy Skin Foundation no
complaints it whatsoever about that that
is a great product but again it's kind
of thick and like it takes a lot to
blend it includes a stippling brush and
takes a lot of time please ignore my
weird lighting I don't even know what I
said it was an 8 in 1 beauty balm skin
Perfector no I don't obviously know the
8 things that it does but I can tell you
that this does wonders for me it like
made my skin clear up I used to have a
lot of acne that was trying to cover up
with that foundation and after i started
using this which is so much lighter so
much easier to blend made all my acne
that was on my forehead just go away and
that's where i had most my break ass was
on my forehead you can still see a few
bumps here and there but i'm a teenager
so with you gonna do you know totally
matches my skin tone because again my
foundation was a little darker than my
skin before cuz they don't have a wide
selection in that foundation for like
paler skin tones so it was like from
like really pale to like brown and tan
so I was like f so obviously
was a little dark for my skin tone but
this matches perfectly um the only bad
thing about this product is not very big
it's quite small I prefer maybelline's
BB cream over anything I tried L'Oreal's
not a big fan of it but I just love this
one more than anything so I wanted
something light for the winter and you
can use this during the summer spring
and fall obviously also because it gives
just as much as coverage as foundation
does if not more um you would think that
this wouldn't like cover up like sits or
dark circles are watching us or redness
or anything like that but it truly truly
does um take from me who has very very
red and blotchy skin without like makeup
to cover it up and this does the job so
it also has SPF 30 and which is amazing
so I never ever used to wear sunscreen
on my face and that's really bad because
even if the sun's not shining I'm sure
you guys know this or if it's winter the
Sun is still there so you need to put
some hand lotion on underneath your
makeup and I didn't want to put another
layer sling on so the fact that this is
light and it has SPF built-in is just
amazing they have a broad selection of
skin colors unlike some other BB creams
just really clear up my skin it gave my
skin great coverage I absolutely love
this product so if you're looking for a
change in foundation or you once i'm
very light and easy to blend and put on
super fast but you're scared look maybe
rackney will show i would definitely
just take a risk and try this because it
will help some of it clear up there's
not as much like oils in this it has
sunscreen in it and no foundation really
has sunscreen and this does and I don't
know I just I don't know what else to
say and this was about seven or eight
dollars from target um a little
expensive for what you get obviously I
mean it's not that expensive but for
this small product amount that's a
little like mmm but it's definitely
worth it so I would totally recommend
that checking this out if you go to
Target Walmart Walgreens um they don't
sell it like Sephora or anything but
ulta all those places have it so
definitely check this out i love it is
very hard for me to find a foundation i
love like foundation lipstick and
blushes i have a lot of trouble finding
and i found this and i was like huh so
yes please check this out tell me what
you think about it um yeah thanks for
watching this product review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
