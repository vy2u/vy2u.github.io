video I haven't unfair to do in like a
year no I did one January but I think
those last one and Wow um yeah a lot of
months to pass I bought a lot of new
makeup products I've actually a button
bonded I'd actually bought a lot of
makeup products in the past few months
more than I ever have in my life like I
put a lot so I'm aside to share them um
the ones that worked at least with you
and my favorite one so these are my
September favorites is strictly beauty
um I'm not doing fashion I gon make up
an 02 on food because I this is a being
a channel that's what I started as and
so I want to focus on the beauty part of
it if you're not interested in my
favorite beauty products click on this
video don't leave me in comment but if
you are interested all the products when
we do listed to end the downbar and
let's get started let me talk about them
so my first favorite is the solid Beauty
Blender cleaner by the beauty wonder
company so I forever struggled with
trying to find something that clean my
Beauty Blender I use like elf shampoo
enough spray and it did the
antibacterial job but it never really
cleaned and got the foundation totally
out of it this though is like a lifer I
didn't want to use this at first but
it's like it smells really good it's
this little soap bar it might be a
little dingy sorry it's cuz my
foundation color um but it's like a
little soap that won't come out you wet
your beauty blender and then or any
brush it works not any mega brush person
which is amazing and you just rub it
around rub it around rope around like
here I'll do an example of it see I wet
this brush and then I do that and then
the soap is on there and then you put
under the water sets form and then you
wash your brush or your baby letter and
all the foundation or makeup comes out
of it I did my eyeshadow brushes i did
my eyeliner gel brushes i did every
powder brush I did every bronzer blush
brush and my beauty blenders so it works
amazing i love this i finally got
something like i should have tried this
twenty times earlier like you think the
view about a company would know how to
clean a Beauty Blender and they do and I
was like I don't want to buy that it's
too much money it's about sixteen
dollars buy it if you need something to
clean your brushes with it's the most
fun way to clean it it's like fun like I
never clean my brushes I never did and
it's not so gross and now I do like
almost every other time because I'm like
they need to be clean so yeah I love
this next I have my favorite lashes ever
which are just simply L flashes like
it's the elf 1713 natural lashes what
they look like they have dramatic ones
but they're almost a little too dramatic
for me they're the most simple day
upside super super easy I just cut a
little off the beginning and then I
plopped them on they look the most
natural I think they blend in with lash
line the natural lash line that is and i
just adore these like love them so L
flushes are my favorite let's just in
case you're wondering next I've been
really into this NYC smooth skin bronzer
I've tried a different NYC runs before
and I've tried you know multiple other
high-end drug store bronzers but
everyone recommended me get that I get
this one this is the shade 720 a sunny
let me swatch of this I have it on right
now I don't know if it might it might
not pick up that much no I think he did
um it's just the most like natural like
gold yellow undertone rather than a
harsh orange brown like I think it's
like a more golden yellowish undertone
that way it looks more natural and I
just like blends seamlessly I loved
putting this on my face I just thought
that it just is such a natural bronzer
everyone recommended that I use this and
I've been loving it no I downfall i have
about this is that packaging is so cheap
like if you open this a few too many
times it will break and I'm just like
what come on NYC come on you can't
package a great product and a crappy
package i love it so so love this love
this love this next oh holy grow
concealer master can seal by maybelline
i saw a lot of PETA grooves and just
other youtubers use this um it it works
perfectly with my favorite foundation as
well of the month which is L'Oreal
infallible I use this in 103 and I use
this in light this is more of a
highlighter under eye is very light and
I apply a crap ton of a ton of my eyes
this is like a jube for like Amazonian
clay bite our foundation just a little
lighter weight um this is to negotiate
for me but I make a work I adore these
two together oh god oh my god oh my god
oh my god these covers every single
thing like you could use a tiny coat of
it or like six coats of it and it will
just blend seamlessly flawlessly into
your skin it doesn't settle like that
easily it is absolutely incredible
dissemination you need to try it it's
worth the few extra bucks you know
because like it is a little more
expensive than other drugstore
foundations but
get it this I most out of in i put this
everywhere my forehead my nose the tip
of my nose my Cupid's bow my chin and
under my eyes as a highlight and I adore
it it covers up everything everything
these that's get those to get those too
if you're gonna get anything at this
video get those two products anyway next
oh my god my voice is going out cuz it's
so late and I've been talking so much
 oh my god anyway next is just an
orange lip gloss or lipstick up but I've
just been obsessed with orange which is
my favorite color of lipstick to wear
you ply seen that in all my recent
videos but yeah this is nick's intense
butter gloss um i like this but it's
super sticky so i wouldn't say NYX
butter gloss is my favorite but I do
like this rather than other ones just
i've been using because this is more of
a true orange rather than a red-orange
this is a orange more like my shirt red
orange this weren't burnt orange like
it's orange it is intense that's for
sure let me do a swatch of it look
pretty oh it is so so buttery like it
says but that also means that it's very
very greasy and wet and sticky like Jim
not if you're gonna wear this have your
hair up please because every other
second you'll be like oh it's so can we
lift it because that will happen with
this and it gets on your teeth to be
easily so do the some finger trick where
you get the excess lip gloss off because
it will get on your teeth but all those
flaws put aside it is a beautiful color
and I'm in love with orange lipstick and
i just thought i would have to share
that with you I've been obsessed since
last year next is another odd color but
I have it on my lower lashes right now
it's blue mascara um the only blue most
here I could find I thought Maybelline
made one but I didn't see it when I went
there so I got benefit they're real I
was never a fan of benefit they're real
like I know sick oh my god what but
better than sex has been so good to me
that I never went and to try another
mascara that's like a high-end that's
expensive but um um so I like this I
don't super love the formula because I'm
so used to putting better than sex on my
lower lashes and just gives them so much
volume and makes them so clumpy and so
many and like they stick out and this
doesn't make my book bottom I should
stick out per se but it's the only blue
mascara can find comment down below if
you know any other blue mice to hear
that you can buy in stores but I love
blue mascara I just I don't know if you
can tell right here that I'm wearing it
but I
i love it i think it just as a pop and
you can make it you can wear it and not
be like trashy like I know what look
like blue mascara like white like wait
let's stick to black mascara but no go
out of your box Twitter comfort zone and
try something new I love this it's
really fun it's been fun for me to do
blue I chose this month with a blue
mascara on the lower lashes speaking of
black shadows LA colors blue eye shadow
palette in the shade supernatural has
been my go-to palette for my eyes
recently I've been loving doing this
Blue Mermaid ash look in LA colors this
palette was a dollar from the dollar
store no joke look at this like
literally 12 shadows for a dollar you
got your like Smokies up there and then
your blues on the bottom I love love
love this color and this color from
blending and this color um as my middle
like color on my lid and then I mean let
me just do some swatches for you here's
the black here's my favorite blue here's
the white creamish and then we'll do one
more will do this blue so there's a
super pigmented I adore these if you
said choose between urban decay or LA
college do and eyeshadow look what I
would probably most likely choose LA
colors because decay are so hard to
blend Eleanor's is still easily
blendable it's just I love it I'm
kissing everything in this video because
I love this product so much next I have
the elf blush palette I've never been a
blush person but I picked this palette
up it's in dark in case you were
wondering and here are they for
beautiful beautiful shades it's like a
red a darker mob a sandy color and then
just a nice pink I am in love with this
salmon color and then this dark one down
here I think you have to be a little
careful because they're super super
highly pigmented and they go on like
that like you just touch the brush to it
and it's like on your cheeks so be
careful but they're super easily
blendable and I just like it's I have to
want to know you can barely tell I've
splendid out with my bronzer they're
beautiful i love the dark palette
because i feel like the lights they're
really similar to this but I just I
don't know I let you I prefer these
colors more so I just pick the dark one
it's only six bucks for these stuffs
forever pick up a blush palette bail
super high quality and the last two
products I have are not necessarily
that's not necessarily the colors but
just to proc themselves which are
l'oreal infallible eyeshadow us there my
go-to eyeshadows i will wear these with
ever with whatever LA Colors pad i'm
using i have a lot of la hoz palettes
and then i'll use these as my pressed
pigments oh my god i have like my favor
wants amber rush go check out amber rush
I also have the Navy one I forgot what
that's called but I also have two more I
slot tank and a turtle black and so I'll
just do a swatch of this so this is what
it looks like it looks like a freaking
foil shadow like look at argument is
over if you had any question about
getting these get them they last
freaking forever and then you pick up so
well they're the most vibrant in your
face shadows and I always have trouble
finding a shadow that will pop in your
inner corner when I put on so much heavy
other creased and transition colors on
my lid then I find it this code is
little disappeared in the commotion but
they stick out and here's the black one
just so vibrant oh it's so pretty I just
am obsessed let me do two swatches for
the other ones for you just for old
times sake like I know I'm just gonna
collect these all because I'm obsessed
but this gold one is amber rush I like a
rose gold I've used it the most i've had
it for so long and it's still going
strong i love that that's what i wore my
senior pictures graduation I think maybe
prom too actually I don't know that
problem but I worried all the time at
navan ones actually called midnight blue
and this is what I've been weighing on
my outer crease just a nice royal
sparkly blue and then which we put this
will put it right over here so there you
go super vibrant they stick out they pop
I put these on over top I shadows that I
apply because these are like more like
pressed pigment spoil shadows and I'll
just do this in case I want a shadow to
start legs turns out and pop like my
outer crease or anything like that then
I'll put these on top or by themselves
and they don't need a prime works a
stick so well so those are my septum her
