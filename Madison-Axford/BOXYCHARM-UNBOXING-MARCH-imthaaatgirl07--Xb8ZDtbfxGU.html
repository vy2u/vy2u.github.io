boxing for Marge yes my febrero was one
is very late so that's why this one's so
close to the last one but I'm not gonna
not do it i love boxy charm so much on
my heart they're just so cute fun
definitely check it out 21 dollars a
month bucks and company it's my favorite
boxing company i said is that beginning
of every video because it's true is the
only boxing company that i do currently
because this is the only one i truly
enjoyed you get five to six full-size
products in each monthly box I guess
whatever their deal is over the box we
don't have a description of how much
these things are anymore in here which
kind of pisses me off I need to look it
up online like the carnage used to say
on the back how much things were it is
now listed online eat for each month but
they don't have it currently in here so
I can't tell you how much these things
are unless I know but yes this box is
called sweet treats to share your sweet
but this box is sweeter yay let's just
get right in okay so the first thing
that I see that I lost my over or
to make a pica sh 0 2 there on six
dollars piece I know because let's see i
have an entire friggin Z palette full of
them and I'll plot these two in I have
these two colors but I adore both of
that manie's and frequently the first
one is cosmopolitan mm-hmm and I'll
swatch the one that i have opened
already cuz i own both of these and this
one is cocoa bear which I adore this one
is more even one this one I love cocoa
bear um so anyway cosmopolitan is a
samedi glitter color I bought it me
because the name in my it's my favorite
magazine let's be real is what it looks
like on my hand and I'll swatch it for
you if you can see that they're so
pigmented it's a glittery sparkly
shimmer shadow of just a nice light
samity pink I love using this just as
overall lid color and using like bitten
light which is a red or cocoa bear which
is a brownish color in the crease to
define it's a great great eyeshadow look
and then here we have cocoa bear which
is amazing it's like a burnt Auburn and
then cocoa bear is right here swatched I
just really really do enjoy makeup geek
so I'm actually gonna pop this out right
now and put them in my sleep palette um
so they look really tiny they're not
they last forever i've had mine for I
don't know if since may be a sober and
let's see it is now March and I have
count any of them i use of every single
day that i use makeup or wear makeup mmm
so that's amazing I'm just gonna plop
these two new babies into my bag yeah
it's getting so full i love it those are
the first two things i thought i heard
that we're gonna make a keep this one
thing i thought it was only one talk to
it I was like haha oh my god next is oh
I love this brand this is Luxy brushes
you can get from lexi beauty calm and it
simple rush I don't have a brush shape
like this so that's amazing and this is
Luxy 512 small contour and yes I love it
look at that just go up the cheekbone
actually going to put this in my
everyday makeup bag because i love this
brush i have actually not like cuz my
kinda live it i've been thinking about
this i haven't but i have seen which was
like this and realize that i don't have
one and I'm just like so yes I have it
now thank you boxy charm I don't have to
go out and buy that now next we have a
chela I love chela I um brow gel I do
not as much yourself but I do like it I
I tried it because it was in my box each
arm but this is a eyebrow pencil mmm
okay the thing i don't like about that I
red pencils as I don't use them and with
his new office this is the in shade
taupe I am NOT taupe I would be ebony or
black those are the two shades that I've
used before from anastacio Beverly Hills
so I don't know why they just automatic
assem taupe let's see how dark this
color is but i don't use eyebrow pencil
i don't fill my eyebrows so this become
pointless to me i guess i could give
them to one of my friends which I guess
we'll have to do because i don't use
this but let's see the color is at least
800 hold on it does look dark i still
wouldn't use it but it doesn't dark so
okay if i were to use it I could I feel
because it is almost like a duplicate
for ebony by and sassy Beverly Hills um
I do like it it's a creamy texture if
you're looking in to fill your eyebrows
look a cello look definite look at chels
other eyebrow products however i don't
think i'll use that I seem to list my
address become very sparse moving on we
have Clarke's botanicals and two puffs
eye cream comes this big bottle let's
see point five flow ounces
I just want to see what is it a soul or
is it like a let's do it comes out no oh
ok it's a white cream I will try this
you know try anything once but I will
have packaging it's right it's a green
just her chic and like clean and
earth-friendly but i don't i don't know
under eye puffiness I under a sag eNOS
what I feel like sinks in under here so
I don't need to do puff it because I
actually wouldn't need it to become more
puffy if anything um my mom always love
stuff like this so i will most likely
give to her she loves always like random
creams and stuff i don't particularly
use these um but you know stop someone
does then last thing we have is style to
Paris um Catherine Melandri no cm what
is this it is you sued it is well what
is this what is in this little box
dropped it ah commode come out what does
that come out come out wherever you are
and me the young lady who fell from a
stuck what is up with robust okay what
is this what is this is this a perfume
it doesn't see what the fuss is it
doesn't say this is style to Paris is it
I don't know what this is I think it's
perfume it smells like a merino
struggling okay this is amazing because
last month they gave us um a perfume if
I got the hunting kind of material on it
like hunting pattern on it if you hadn't
seen my last box uncle watch that but um
I love these like perfume trial sizes
because then they'll like perfect for
travel there just enough but not too
much okay let's smell it okay I like it
I do it smells like what every celebrity
fragrance kind of smells like you know
Justin Bieber Katy Perry ariana grande
touch so they all smell the same to my
mouth that's in my mom I like it I went
in Surrey more than one pump because
it's extremely overpowering but I do
like it I'm not gonna hate on it because
