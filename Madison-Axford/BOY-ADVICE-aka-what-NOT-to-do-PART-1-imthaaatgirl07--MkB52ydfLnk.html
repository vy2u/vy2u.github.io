about boy advice yeah um disclaimer no
I've never had a boyfriend you know I've
never had my first kiss but please girls
and Noel about the boys
um I'm you go to girl for all the things
in a relationship that you shouldn't do
everything that would you like a guy
when you wasn't you want to date him
what you shouldn't do because I pushed
away 18 guys so you think this girl
would know and I'm yes I am your love
grew for everything what not to do
okay so feel like I don't know if I
should do this it's probably hung on the
list
I certainly have three pages of paper
full of stuff
what I've done keep in mind I have done
all these things oh yeah I have
embarrassed myself I I have I have
humiliated myself
and ruined 18 possible relationships and
in a way there wasn't even like I was
like it was hard to find these things
no I was trying these off the top man
because somebody's just thinking
happened I'm 16 and I've had a boyfriend
never had my first kiss but yet I know
all about the boys because I've been
through it so many crushes and and
possible relationships I've just crashed
and burned and exploded with with
embarrassment anger and failure so this
is more of a light and a video because
it's not a beauty video but I hope you
enjoy this I don't any root come and say
I don't know what I'm talking about or
you and you've like that many guys no I
don't need that so it's my advice to you
because I know I someone requested this
even though I've never really had a
boyfriend so this isn't like when you're
in a relationship you should know it's
like before you get a relationship this
is what you shouldn't do let's get
started it keep in mind this entire
video I've done these things I've had my
experience and I know what I'm talking
about okay let's go don't fall for a guy
who you know is trouble insert Joseph
son here
yeah just went there I know some of
these may be a little cliche some of
them may sound like a crazy psycho nut
just stay with me people um
there's a lot of people or a lot of guys
who you know have been around we've done
some stuff up in her and who you just
know have done stuff that maybe you're
not comfortable with or um who will play
you and you know it you know it for a
fact it's not like good play by guys
excuse me
no it's about those guys who you know
you know maybe the cutest friggin guy in
the school but our trouble so you're
just not gonna mess with them please I
mean they're like three of them where
I'm like oh my gosh and I text them and
I get close to them and you know you're
just used yeah okay
next don't tell a guy you okay yeah
don't tell a guy you've loved him in
high school now say yeah I love him like
him I really like him I have a crush you
know you'd say oh that I was talking
about the big l.o.v.e word mm-hmm love
and I'm not saying all high-schoolers
but 99.99% I Explorer's don't really
know what love is I don't know what love
is uh I've done this before where I told
a guy who I really liked thought I had a
chance with him that I loved him
yeah yeah I went there this is my 15
things I hate video because um I text in
this huge text and I got like okay
thanks back yeah like I don't know if I
could have got a worse response back I
didn't know what to do but let's just
say that relationship crashed and burned
in its pretty much all over now don't
know you even talk to him it's just
really awkward so if you want to prevent
any awkwardness um I took I jumped you
know hoping for someone to catch me and
I fell and I broke on concrete
what was that analogy know yeah I wonder
like chunk then I'll take a fist you'll
never know unless you try everything's
worth it all yeah I I gave it all I said
everything I can trust me sad
I just crashed okay next don't laugh
really loud went around other guys to
get his attention to make him jealous
I've done this also um it's really
annoying when people do this I find girl
20 girls do this but I'm I've been a
culprit of it when you see a guy and
you're but some another guy thinks that
funny people and n dice know what you're
faking and they're just like wow that is
okay not ever texting her again you're
just like okay I hope that works and
it's so didn't and you just lost him
okay next don't push it okay don't push
hugging him saying they've liked him
I haven't done this but don't push
kissing him but messin you know medicine
of course feels need junina going
frighten up kisses but go in for hugs
and stay all the feelings and the stuff
first talking a third person oh yeah
anyway um I like sporadically like hug
guys before know that for that long I'm
just like that ain't like in the hallway
and they're like you never talked to me
again I had this one guy text me and say
you're creepy for hugging me please
leave me alone
um don't ever trust anyone who lied
before oh who seems like they would lie
this is kind of like a trouble one again
the guy who's like trouble um especially
when I I would tell people stuff I'd be
like don't tell anyone but and then the
next thing they told stuff no just move
on and leave no they can't be good
next don't act like a fool it's kind of
like when I said I love you um I was
kind of out of my mind I guess um I
don't know what I thought was I was
going to get I really don't know what I
thought I was what response I was gonna
get but now that I look back I look like
a really really stupid young teenager
who didn't know what the heck they were
talking about and the guy thinks I'm
psycho not now so just don't act crazy
cuz it was at night too and in the
morning when I looked back I just kind
of regretted you know sending it but you
can't delete text messages with seven
heads so huh don't say I look so bad oh
my god this is such a better look so
ugly today in front of a guy expecting
response because you will not get one
okay you know most girls like it so
and I like they look good that day um
and they know it too and then they are
talking the guy to be like no get the
most beautiful thing since the stars
were created your hair is like soaking
your eyes are like diamonds
you're beautiful like diamonds in the
sky that's death okay and you
ain't gonna get anything out of the guy
they'll be like yeah and then you're
gonna be like oh my god really too bad
cuz I thought that too I uh I thought
that depends okay I was like oh yeah cuz
I don't know if they understand what I'm
saying or how to respond to that and
then you feel like wow he'd even say
anything
next don't text them 24/7 I do this
freaking every time I meet a guy I'm
like oh my god what if he thinks I'm
annoying but I thinks I don't like him
what if he thinks that that I don't want
to talk to him again eh or if he forgot
about me where he's ready with another
girl the guy likes you he'll text you
every girl does it
I hate when guys are like girls who
texted are annoying because every
frickin girl does I don't know one girl
who's like I'm gonna give them a break I
know they'll text me and yeah it's fine
no girls want to talk girls one two oh
my god with my hair girls want to talk
but just try try to keep your urges and
you and resist yourself from texting him
and making yourself yet again look like
a fool don't send him selfies I don't
know where I thought this was gonna go
um I'd be like Menaul wasn't pictures of
made my friends me it wasn't pictures um
yeah anything else
a dog anything it was just pictures of
me my face face stupid there's not much
if it's mine just don't send freakin
selfies everyone hates selfies girls and
guys hate selfies don't send them to
someone that you possibly like next one
is even more embarrassing don't get
their name as your facebook status can
we have a moment of silence for this
yeah III didn't accidentally try to see
him stuck to my facebook next time I
type in say but in the post status bar
no it was literally I tagged his name
put it as a status and posted it yeah
and something is UPS in eighth grade it
sound like I was in fourth grade it was
in eighth grade you think I'm gonna know
a little better go to high school and
all next year his name nothing else as
my Facebook set its pro 5000 my friends
to see don't say anything too personal
unless you're like freaking out marry
this guy in two days don't say anything
too personal because um they can't
really like spread stuff and you know
pretend like they care and then totally
just blow your head off
so don't fall for someone two or three
years younger than you when you're in
high school in your older age doesn't
matter it's what a number when you're
gonna peak in high school and you're
like a junior or senior and you're
looking at eight hairs in freshman what
does that I stay away from it don't say
you're such a great friend
because then that automatically puts in
the friendzone and they want nothing to
do with you after that because they know
they'll never get any further and and
you feel bad because you're like oh we
know I'm an best friend and they're just
like wow that's all you see yes well you
understand me as and it totally puts a
damper on any possible relationship next
don't flirt with a guy if you have
absolutely no no no intention of dating
hit because guys at me if you give them
a just a little hint some guys will be
like what are you doing they'll be like
deer and headlights they'll have no idea
and other guys will like jump on you
like they're Puma or something just be
careful guys just turn into the annoying
girl texting you and you're just like
don't don't flirt them if you have one
absolutely nothing to you of them you'll
just hurt your feelings and I've been
through that one guy said it to me
don't do it and lastly don't expect too
much from guys now I'm not saying that a
rude way if you have guy viewers woohoo
love you guys
I'm not saying that in a rude way that
may seem like you're like do you say
mushroom guys know I'm saying don't
expect a freakin Nicholas Sparks book or
movie to happen in your life because it
ain't gonna I like I do it sometimes
just don't expect a lot evan has most
eyes are not like Nicholas Versailles
and you know what girl's gotta be
reading this necklace box but love those
sappy movies unless you're freakin in a
nicholas spark like book or he's your
husband you're not like a magic Douglas
sparks with your husband for a second
that's really creepy because you know
look but like what if a young guy was
like that freaking amazing husband
probably um I just don't expect too much
I have had unrealistic fairytale dreams
and daydreams I'm like yes it can happen
and I get married after we like I'm
gonna run and do Chandler in a coffee um
shop in Paris ten years from now and be
like oh my guy and start our
relationship a new hate to break it to
you girls but no so that was my boy
