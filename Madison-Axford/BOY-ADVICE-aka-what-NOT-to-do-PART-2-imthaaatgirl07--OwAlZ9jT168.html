true love it must be it must be I mean
he waved to me wow that is some creepy
AF dude I almost have a first kiss so if
you're wondering I did almost on the
side of boyfriend hey so today I'm doing
my wildly wildly wildly requested boy
advice what not to do part 2 part 2
because apparently I have been through
enough experiences about a boys and and
fails with with like possible
relationships I needed you a part too
excited I just have so much to talk
about
yeah if you guys to my first video
obviously is gonna be the first link in
the downbar thank you anyone who watched
that and liked it gave me so many views
I really appreciate that today however I
had that video was I think in February
spent six or seven months I had like
fourteen new topics to talk about what
not to do and don't think I'm a player I
still haven't had my first kiss still
haven't had a boyfriend you know as
close to it but yet again knowing me
knowing this and knowing the girl I am
I'm gonna you know unconsciously blow
every chance I possibly get and it's
just like it's never I'm just gonna
coming on so if anyone is wondering any
boys know I'm sorry I'm gonna become a
nun I guess you know it's just it's just
not meant to be you know over the past
17 years my life I'm just meant to be a
nun cat lady
anyway jokes aside I'm not you know
going around to have these boys I
haven't hiked first kiss haven't done
anything like that and I haven't had a
boyfriend ever ever in my life so just
because I know these scenarios have been
through these kind of like I don't know
relationship fails well it's not like
relationship fails because I've never
been in relationship but it's like
possible like they were almost right of
ships and then they failed because of
you know me um
beyond she's gonna talk about them today
I hope you enjoyed this video like many
of you did the first and without further
ado let's get started number one don't
believe anyone who says that they've
changed or they're better than their
past like the
self because like I know there's this
guy it was really names me in my past
stripper me and call me names stole this
stuff and she claimed that you know he
had changed she wasn't he wasn't his old
self anymore and it's better than that
he's grown up he's become more mature um
ya don't trust that don't trust that
because it's this one was kind of like a
hard for me to explain where I was
thinking about it I never like know
exactly what I was gonna say just
because like when when you're like I
just think that this person was like my
worst enemy right I just I I hated him I
just couldn't stand him but recently I I
don't know what I thought he changed to
some Prince Charming and it was like I
don't know I thought he like likes me so
I'm not like oh my god it's meant to be
no because literally it's not gonna work
if someone in your past you hated so
much he's not going to turn to someone
like perfect guy and be super duper next
he's gonna have always that little hint
of something like mean towards you and
you're always gonna feel that like
little sense that he was mean towards
you in the past and it's just never
gonna work so move on from being people
you know many people in your past they
haven't changed completely they may have
become better or worse I hope the guy
was better but he obviously wasn't so
yeah number two don't trust guys who
constantly asked you to hang out like
late at night gets me all that was just
a booty call
and it's like just I didn't go out at
you know late at night um like I didn't
do that throughout this video all these
things I talk about I have done I've
done everything that I talked about this
one I almost did but I didn't but
everything else I have have done I've
done all these things if you're like oh
that's made up but she just turned me
funny I was just extra material for the
video no no I wouldn't put saying my
video if you didn't actually have it
like I was asked this I might not went
out and you know done stuff that no late
at night but I was asked it don't trust
that because they're probably up to no
good if they're you know up that late
wanting you to come out like obviously
they probably don't care about your
safety and they don't want you and they
don't really want you they just want you
you know do stuff with them again I
don't know if that's exactly what they
want I never went out but
that's why they're calling you you know
between the hours of 12:00 and 3:00 so
don't trust that um um um don't like
someone because of their popularity I
had trouble with this once I mean I'm
not popular in my school not super
popular you know school Queen you know
queen bee no it's not me
but when you know up up some guys pay
attention ooh you're just gonna you're
just gonna have to unconsciously kind of
fall for her
no no if you're Lee it's really late and
I'm not saying like if you I'm happy
that you can't date a popular person at
all I know that can't kind of came
across like that but for me I know that
may sound Frank but it didn't work for
me and I don't know if you have popular
cliques in some of your school or like
the hierarchy what it is at your school
but there is different like levels of
popularity at my school and somebody's
at the way top is it's not gonna date
like me you know cuz I'm all like
YouTube and in school and you know
someone like who parties and is on that
football team is not gonna get away date
me again this could totally work for you
I know this is seeming really rude if
you like him if he likes you or if you
just like him go for it whatever but in
my experiences it has not worked and
they just don't pay attention to you
because you're not to do the same thing
something like and just in my defense it
didn't work for me so I'm just basically
here just tell you my experiences to say
don't fall for someone who is obviously
not interested in you they might just be
there to make you know to see if you
fall for them to make fun of you that
happened to me don't make things up
about yourself or what you like to like
it I guess attention to make him like
you
I've done this multiple multiple times
where I'd like just like said I like
things that I totally didn't but you
want to give us a good side you want to
make it seem like you have things in
common similar you know likes in
interests I am made up so much stuff
like there's this guy they're like so
much that I like something like so it's
kind of like music I started Facebook
page so I know it would he would like
and then then I would like say that I
liked that stuff Madison oh that was
just this year too like Facebook is
never good with guys like literally
Facebook and me have so many bad guys
stories
um just be true to yourself be who you
are be you and then people like you for
that and obviously it didn't work out
when I am when I said I liked to
everything then you know he liked like
literally you know how it's like music
books movies like that and then there's
like those extra things like random
pages that don't fit into those
categories Facebook provides I like
would look at them and say that I like
those things too so okay we're done
we're done with that list too
embarrassing number five don't get too
clean too fast
literally I met this guy at Auntie
Anne's Pretzels hmm once okay he waved
me when I left I thought it was true
love it must be it must be I mean he
waved to me so it must be true love just
I don't know what I was thinking but
okay he was cute and um and since he
waved at me I thought that we were
mentioning you know be destined forever
together forever and so later that same
day I my back in there again and he's
like oh hi what can I get for you when I
was like nothing and and he was like
okay and I was like I just wanted to say
I'm a hot buy cuz I was like leaving
them all at any ends of sin and I was
like I just want to say bye and he's
like Oh
bye and they like went to the back he
went like to get away from psycho meat I
seriously don't understand why guys even
talk to me after they see this video I
mean if you do Thanks I love you but
that's just my perspective like and I
saw a guy like saying only succeed I'm
gonna be like wow that is some creepy AF
dude and and and I I look like really
creepy right now and really I'm weird
and and you people are like you never
had a boyfriend you never had your first
kiss how I just go to my YouTube channel
and watch my boy advice videos literally
there is your answer um yeah so Indians
do didn't really work out obviously um I
mean I went back in there in the same
day that I met him I was like holy we
got like thought I was gonna get his
number or something
I don't even know what I was thinking I
was in Luna town they like someone back
in there thinking that we were gonna be
married apparently and left with nothing
not even a pretzel don't let your
feelings during you know the nighttime
when you get a lot more like emotional
and I was like dark II just like or uh
when you listening to like some like sad
music don't let the feelings that you
know are created during those times
determine what you're gonna text to like
a guy like I've done this so many times
really I'll be really emotional or
someone I'm in a fight with or something
like just because like I'm Lissa music
and it's like and that'll take them
sometimes to really ramp stuff really
like things that I look back from
morning I'm like oh my god why did I say
that like I guess I loved them before
what I I looked at the morning after I
already texted him that you can't take
next eggs and it's like they're those
moments you just like I don't know I
just say man I'll saw this monster I
just feel like they like do thinks and
they feel like it's so right at the
moment and they look back later and
they're like what the hell is this yeah
I have this lot don't keep fighting
parents something or someone that just
it's not gonna work like something I
mean like a relationship someone
obviously a boy don't keep fighting for
it like there's this guy who we like to
shut their on and off for like 20
billion years and it just wasn't working
I knew it was gonna wear I knew we were
gonna be together some point in our high
school career I just knew it but
obviously I'm still never had a
boyfriend so it didn't work out I tried
way too hard that over the past two
years to get it to work out
never did I just kept fighting I
literally like a month ago I was still
fighting ask someone hang out I someone
talk to him all the time text him it
just wasn't working out if something's
not meant to be over there like a period
of years just you've gotta let it go you
know it was heartbreaking it was sad
I've known so much about him he knows
too much about me and we are like I
don't know I just feel like we were
meant to be something it obviously
wasn't meant to be something and it was
just Madison thinking that everything
was gonna work out in a perfect little
world but um it didn't work out it um
and I've learned over the past few
months just stop fighting let go and
move on because if it was meant to be it
would have happened over
you know the last five years and if it
didn't it's you know it's whatever it's
a loss but you got to move on and and
it's sad knowing someone for that long
and wanting something for that long and
it not working but you honestly have to
let it go
take a breather and know that there's
other good guys in the world don't
respond to Facebook's Gert why did I do
this beats me I'm on this rim friends
spree and friended everyone in the world
and then I got like 29
it was literally 29 um 29 people some of
which I have heard of some which might
my school so much I knew some from like
I don't even know everyone I friend has
mutual friends to me it's just like if
you've be I just said FB is this text
world know if you Facebook message me
I'm probably not gonna respond I'm
usually creepy and if I talk to you
before I just get like so creeped out
and I'm like oh why are you like hey hi
hello hey hi what's up oh god I'm so
many facebook stalkers and I made the
mistake before responding to them away
too many times to count
don't sweet like direct obvious things
to people
um and I'm gonna well don't like tweet
their name obviously and say something
like bad like this is apt your possible
relationship hasn't worked out um and I
say possible because I have never had a
boyfriend relationship like I said 100
thousand times in this video um but
don't you don't be like like something
so obvious like if you like I don't even
know what like if you didn't have a card
or something jumpy like well my next
boyfriend will have a car at least like
obviously like he knows him he knows
that you just like didn't work out
things are really obvious it's not worth
your time somewhere sweet it's not worth
wasting a tweet on and he's gonna know
and it's gonna make him mad so just you
can tweet things but if it's like an
exact example or something that both of
you know is like happen to you and it's
like so obvious it's not just like
abroad in relationship statement it's
like so obvious that it's to that one
person is directed to him you know try
not to do that try to do that no matter
how bad you are kind of so much of the
first ones don't expect any guy who was
known as a player to change or you're
not make an exception for you because
once the guy's a player through high
school or college he's always a player
and
yeah there's this exceptions just some
guys whatever blah blah blah I'm not
talking about them I'm talking about
like if a guy's been around town don't
think that is gonna change for you in
his eyes to him you're no different than
the last girl I mean sure obviously you
are different you're special but to him
he just uses another girl bit that you
can go after so don't fall for the guys
who were everywhere guys who clearly
aren't going for the relationship
boyfriend-girlfriend thing leave them
alone and also move on from them too I
have tried also for this other guy like
so long to get us to like be a
relationship I've like given time gifts
to Christmas and Valentine's Day and
it's just not working out and I finally
gave that one up but it just wasn't
working over the two-year period that I
was trying to make it work this is a
different guy from the other guy I was
talking about over the years um but it's
just not working some guys just really
are looking for relationship in high
school or even college I know why it
wouldn't be but some guys might be weird
but just if it's been like months and
nothing's happened your endless flirting
techniques aren't working move on it's
time to find another guy there's gonna
be a better guy out there for you and
move on to him don't don't like accept
the fact or like a guy if he chooses
alcohol or drugs over you if he chooses
to go to some party or you know there's
gonna be illegal substance oh we're
hanging with you and I haven't quite
cousinly time or whatever mmm that's
never gonna be good he again probably
won't change and don't like someone that
does that if he can't make a difference
and change for like someone he's
supposed to be loving or like liking
I don't even then he's not gonna be get
in the future and if he's not changing
now and making like the effort to hang
out with you rather than do things like
that then it's not worth your time and
lastly when a guy who uh you know seems
seems that
perfect you know good nights kind great
asks to kiss you you're it's gonna be a
first kiss you know to ever ever happen
to you
you know this is a big moment don't say
no and run away oh my god literally do
worse things probably one of the worst
diadem say in this video so it
I know I was made fun of the fact never
had a boyfriend never had my first kiss
it's funny to say people can't believe
it blah blah we move on um and I was so
close to having both of them recently
both of them being crossed off my bucket
list
how did my first boyfriend um but
unconsciously some little thing in my
head said no no it's not gonna happen so
it can't be today it's just it cannot be
I wasn't ready apparently no even though
I've waited me at that time 16 years um
Nev something birthday was the noisiest
um 16 years for this moment I was
waiting for it and and I thought I was
ready I thought I was I was excited I
always you know one day my first kiss I
was ready I'm really wise and um and I
said maybe next time no not saying kiss
every guy who asked you kiss every guy
who tries to kiss you but you know it's
like when something seemed like good
enough or right enough for your first
kissed you know I would try to take that
chance because you know you never know
when you're gonna get another one
um I thought of you know this this thing
that happened to me you know what I did
just sorry times I just replayed it over
and over again and again in my head just
see what I did wrong
if someone seems like you got like Dave
jr. than like you and you Jen like what
you genuinely like them just give it a
chance and and and kiss him if he asks
you don't run away like I did because I
always run away from my fears thinks I'm
scared about I always run away from them
I don't face him head-on her and attack
them or or you know take that and
conquer them I run away for them
literally um and literally I did run
away from this it was one of my it's
kind of like a feels like I'm scared
getting hurt and scared of I haven't my
first kiss and being having a PFA land
in me being embarrassed you know um like
for myself like I'm just embarrassed of
what I just did um and and then I know I
I did it for a reason why I said that
now like why I didn't when I had my
first kiss
um at that point in time now I look back
it was it was stupid for me to do but
you know everything happens for a reason
I believe so if you're granted that
opportunity to try to take it you know
try to leap in and have fun um just kind
of turn to a sad fail video but I look
back on it now I wish I really do wish I
had done things differently I didn't and
I can't change that now I can't change
it because you know God does things for
a reason and everything happens for a
reason and something happened that day
for a reason and it's sad to look the
fact that I almost had it and I once
 up with you guys I danced on my
first kiss but yet again Madison that
girl I am that girl that always fails at
relationships and yeah I almost do have
my first kiss so if you're wondering I
did I lost all my side of boyfriend but
I said no hey Oh bingo
Madison won the room so I hope you
enjoyed this video in short I just won
every girl to me my friend recently did
this but makeup boy criteria and I'm not
saying there's a need this perfect guy
just match all of this criteria on my
list
and if he doesn't end up screwed out
next no don't do that
but make me tear your glist that things
you look for in a guy you want in a guy
you would like this is your perfect I'm
like doing
but I'm pretending like I have a paper
or a list in my hand like make a list of
all these things that you want in a guy
and in in that you hope that you find in
a guy and then choose your top three and
really try to find a guy and look for a
guy who carries those three you know
traits that are so important to you like
I'm not like ridiculous things you're
like thanks me gifts every other day no
no but I'm saying like genuine things
like he genuinely shows they cares about
me
he smells good he just like things right
a whole list of them that you would want
and three that you need or two that you
need you know there's not gonna be a
perfect guy out there but I'm not a
perfect girl and no one's a perfect
person so just choose a few things that
you're really looking for you cannot
live without and you will find that guy
because there are great guys out there
no they're not gonna match your entire
100 thousand page list of standards but
just choose a few that you look for and
don't let your standards slip just
because you're desperate for a guy or a
boyfriend keep your head high and your
standards higher and look for those two
or three things in a perfect guy and you
will find them eventually because
obviously I have right now trust me on
this
love you guys thank you so much for

requested boy advice part 2 sorry take
