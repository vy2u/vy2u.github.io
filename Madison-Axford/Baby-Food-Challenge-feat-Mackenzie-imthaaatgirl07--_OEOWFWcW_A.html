long-awaited baby food challenge and I'm
so excited for this literally I have
been waiting forever to do this I can
find what to do it with me but we
decided to do it today so I'll show you
the flavors that we picked up real quick
we each picked out three we know what
they are but the game that we are gonna
play with the baby food challenge isn't
like to guess the flavors it's to see
like if we can actually swallow this
spoonful or whatever we take and whoever
gets the most points and who's foes that
find will win the game I think you mean
a ovo but listen firstly I picked out is
apples and cinnamon with oatmeal oatmeal
and I thought this looked really okay
not good okay that's good but I thought
it would be a decent flavor but then
it's like one big chunk looking like
mush it's just like a one big like solid
in here I'm kinda disturbed by that but
you know we're having the best with that
one then I picked out peas which there's
literally green and they look so
exciting I'm really excited Chinese
all-natural and last night I got these
at the gross ones yeah is chicken noodle
nutritious is dinner like this is
literally as chunks the bottom of it
it's disgusting but yeah that's what I
think they're okay and then I got
vanina's strawberry and X strawberry
banana smoothie so hopefully this will
be alright
