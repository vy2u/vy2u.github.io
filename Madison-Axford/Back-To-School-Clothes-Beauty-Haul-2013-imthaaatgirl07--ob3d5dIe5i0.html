yesterday I'm kind of doing a back to
school haul um yeah I guess I am I time
do I have I didn't give that much stuff
because I don't really go back so
shopping I kind of buy stuff
sporadically I'm not like saving up
money or waiting to buy stuff until it's
August and back to school so I have a
few things that are necessary for this
we are and a few things that are
definitely definitely not there just
kind of fun clothes and beauty and stuff
like that um so I have quite a haul I
mean I think so so let's get right in
start with Alta first I was Adam oh I
was like I've used all these things so
after like what yeah Houston ball anyway
um I was out of makeup remover pads for
like a week and a half or two weeks um
make him remember talents I mean and so
I just picked up a simple brand oil
balancing I tried the original simple
ones and I didn't really like him going
to give them another chance and try the
Royal balancing cleansing ones yeah just
get those to start and I need a new
foundation so I paid up the foundation
that I heard numerous great things about
and I really wanted to try which was
revlon's 24 hours colorstay foundation
in like the lightest shade i think yeah
which was where is it 110 ivory so I'd
surely want to try this I saw in a lot
of people's videos so I'm hoping now be
a good back to school foundation that
won't make me orange it won't oxidized a
cake and will be a 0 kid go then I got
oh my god I've been wind truths forever
and it's the Maybelline rocket volume
Express mascara and I got a compliment
on my eyelashes the other day when i was
using this so whoo success for this i
know like a hundred thousand people
liked it and then a hundred thousand
people didn't but so far i'm really
loving it i love that packaging to its
really cute and I did run out of my
million lashes l'oreal gold tube one um
so I usually use two mascaras some
sleeves in the great lashing no need to
get rid of it but I love maybe mascaras
they're always the best finally I spurge
dal it'll on something that I've also
wanted for a long time which is a nibble
lip butter and I got it any color or the
flavor raspberry rose a kiss and I
really wanted to try this because I
don't know I just need a new lip product
Iran i'm at us lip balm which i used to
moisturize in the morning so i'm using
this now and
love it love it love it it tastes
amazing next from gap i recently got a
job here so i thought i'd pick up
something to support in my store um and
I just got sweat shook they're obviously
known for denim instead shirts um and I
just thought this was so cute can remind
me of a sorority kind of like colors and
stuff I don't know it sounds really
weird but it says gap and it's pink and
white stripes because you that I don't
know it just remind me of like sorority
letters I don't I don't know it just
reminded me of it and it's navy with
Deeping and white striped at gap and it
has a hood and it's super big and I love
it it's really soft and cozy and warm
and I'm excited to wear it to the school
year it's my job and in the winter and
fall seasons coming up then from
aeropostale I don't really like your
hospital but I need new jeans and
they're always great to go to when
you're looking for jeans and stuff like
that I was like really I'm running I'm
like growing out of my jeans so I need a
new pair or two I only got one though
and also if you tried on a pair of jeans
at aeropostale you got a free iphone
case and just if you tried it on you
even have to buy it but I kind of felt
bad so I got him but anyway i'm using an
iphone face right now to show to you
real quick again it was free um it says
made you look and it's amir and has a
little like lips and i just love this
like look at that it's a mirror it's
amazing and I just if you like want to
check your lipstick or your makeup it's
right there it's awesome I'm super glad
that I you know got to get that for free
anyway aeropostale totally outdid
themselves with these jeans they're like
the greatest things ever okay so you
look at it and it has this black band
and then it's like regular denim jeans
so I was like oh wow it's like black and
blue and so it should blue jeans blue
jeans blue jeans blue jeans blue jeans
and then you turn around and it's black
jeans oh if you can't decide whether to
wear blue or black just where both oh my
god it's blue and then what I'm just in
love with them over the other day i love
them they're so like cool and ba and i
don't know i think two tone jeans or ba
no they're just so cool and i love how
the black comes around in the front and
gives the blue like a stray I don't know
I just I just love the two-tone jeans
they're amazing next from to be baybay I
do necessarily get this for school
because it's way too skimpy for school
just because it's like a summer crop top
thing and I wouldn't wear this to school
or work but um for the summer and like I
don't know on the weekends or whatever I
got this really cute tank which is
floral and freely
and flowy and it's a crop top and it's
just so cute I see a lot of meteors with
this kind of top and looks so amazing on
and I loved it it was twenty dollars and
I'm just so thankful that i found shirt
like this cuz i'm looking for this is
beautiful color like for you know March
April May those months because it's like
floral and pastel pinks and purples and
I just love it so much um so I wouldn't
wear to school I wouldn't recommend you
wear to school but I'll definitely find
tons of use out of it then from what
seal I got new leggings and these are
these are a little different than your
typical leggings from forever 21 or
victoria's secret um what seal these
they're on sale at wet seal for like
five dollars and I was like oh my god
I'm looking for these I'm gonna pick
them up and they're leather leggings I
mean I don't know if I am pretty sure
it's fake leather but oh ma gah oh my
god oh my gosh leather leggings I don't
know if it's real leather I'm highly
doubted but they're freaking amazing i
love them they're five dollars oh my
gosh i just i love leather leggings they
look so good on and i'm so glad i
finally got a pair and finally from
Victoria's Secret I had a coupon for ten
dollars off any purchase so they have
these mini backpacks which a lot of
people have in their $26 i think so i
did get mine for 16 because i had the
coupon I got the pink one because that's
all I had it it's so so cute and just
get dirty easily which kind of makes me
mad but I mean I guess I was kind of
expecting this considering its canvas
look how cute this is I'm using as a
purse right now i don't know if i'll use
it for school because i'm planning on
using a different of your Bradley bag
but I just love it it's so tiny and cute
and I'm glad I picked it up for such a
cheap price considering it was retort
ping so that was my back to school haul
even though I didn't get an excess
amount of things um and some were doing
for school I'm just really glad I got to
do this video and I went shopping over
the past few days and thought I'd do a
collective holla for back to school so
thanks for watching and check back later
for more videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
