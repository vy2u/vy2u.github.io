today I'm doing my oh my gosh this was
requested like a hundred times but I put
it off because I didn't have this stuff
yet but it's my back to school supplies
haul so was all the school supplies that
i got for this year and keep in mind i
don't know if you saw a video when i
said this already but i only have four
classes or four periods this year
because i'm leaving early and i skipped
through periods to go work and i'm doing
a work internship and i work at gap so I
join of the my school slides you're
putting to be like one notebook for one
I don't even need anything really for it
and so yeah it was nice saved a bit of
money so without further ado to get into
this exciting back to school video first
from walmart i got a pencil pouch and I
wasn't going to have pets pass just
because i only have four classes but i
was like i have to have to carry pens
and pencils and highlighters so i might
as well get something cute to carry them
in so from walmart i got this beautiful
um silver sparkly pencil pouch which I
club or mine three like the little
elementary school days when it was so
fun to like pick out a pencil pouch and
I got to do that again this year so it
was exciting and it was only like three
four dollars i think and I'm just really
glad people seven so me it's of sparkly
and I love how it's not like a bright
annoying color it's like subtle it and
an older senior hmm can still use this
in that look politically incorrect then
I got a book cover i'm only gonna have I
think to text books but i only got one
book cover cuz i was like its growth and
I really might just put them on there
anyway so it's just a jumbo stretchable
book cover and this is like a tie-dye
looking one I got it from target for a
dollar and the reason I didn't get this
is just cuz it was really cute and I
thought I might as well put it on one
textbook i actually just don't make us
put them on there they soon like
freshman sophomore year um but yeah not
really sophomore junior year I mean they
did for one sophomore year it wait to be
safe I just got one in kings photos he
chose did fun require it and ya head it
was cute our books drove his jumbo so I
got the Jumbo book cover because the
small ones never ever work or fit my
school's textbooks then I had to get my
favorite thing ever which are my writing
utensils first I just got these dollars
bit tense
mechanical pencils I hate number two
pencils and I know we have to have them
for scantrons tests and like I have you
have for they CT and stuff but um like I
might carry one or two in my pencil
pouch when I do have this test but
otherwise I write with these for math
class only I will never take notes and
pencils I hate pencils so much but I'd
use your dollars so i just had picked
him up for the obvious reasons and then
i get some Sharpie highlighters i
usually love colored ones and the
multicolored packs of you know like pink
orange yellow and blue but they were all
out everywhere i went to water and
target and they were all out of
highlighters so I I got an easy target
but I eventually found these at walmart
i give the very last I'll on the bag it
was so sketchy I was like why do they
not have heathers anywhere but I had to
just hit these um before yellow one so
it's just fun I go through how there's a
lot though when teachers are like
highlight your notes I highlight like
the entire page everything I want to
remember and um yeah I like the skinny
ones i hate the big fat ones so take up
so much room in your pencil pouch and i
think i was most excited about for my
utensils were these big um soft feel
ball pens and it's a huge pack of 18 is
they're all for me and I just really
really wanted um these kind of pens I
don't know if you can see them they're
just really nice and I don't know I just
have my heart set on these big pens
rather than should regular pens now
these were eight dollars which is a
little much I know you get 18 but I just
don't thought that was really expensive
for just freaking pens but I got them in
whatever i'm gonna use these the entire
year obviously i'm not going to you know
have to go run out and get new pens
leasable let me zoom last me I got them
from target and last leaf I have one
notebook and I have one folder thing so
first I got a trapper folder I have my
this in eighth grade and I just loved
them they're so fun so it has this
little um black like plastic thing that
holds it together and then you just open
it up and there's different little
sections so this is first front
compartment and then like little
dividers that you put papers in here um
front and back so there's a red one a
blue one and green one and then another
pink one at the back and I have four
classes first semester so my first class
is a senior literature and then finite
math and then
a business class that you have to take
because I'm doing the internship work
thing and then I'm taking um I should
I'm doing this thing called cadet
teaching which means I go into a class i
already took them got an a an and I help
the teacher kind of teacher and grade
papers and stuff like that so I'm doing
that for geometry and so I don't um that
I'm not going to need a folder a paper
for that because I just you know help
him and I'm not gonna have to actually
do assignments Esterly anyway I had this
for all my classes it's really skinny
and nice to just you know put all my
stuff in and not have to worry about
bringing all her everybody and earn
every folder and forgetting something
I'll have everything I need in here so
in case I need it or if I don't read it
it's skinny it's light i'll just take it
with me and i don't have to worry about
forgetting something in my locker and
then I just have a five-star notebook I
love have store notebooks I wouldn't
have it any other way I always have to
get the five star and this is a free
subject divider because I'm taking
senior literature finite math and um the
business class which i will take notes
in swype three subjects are not going to
need one for the cadet teaching g of
geometry but i have this and um yeah I
take chance of notes and I got it in
college ruled because i love cultural i
know a lot of people hate it but I hate
the wide world it makes me right
ginormous Lee and I waste a lot of paper
because it right so big so that is my
back to school supplies haul and I hope
