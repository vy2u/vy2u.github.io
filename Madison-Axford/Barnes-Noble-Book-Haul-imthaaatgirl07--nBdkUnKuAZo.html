that it seems dead i'm in my old room
again and the thing is i did completely
change rooms that was my new room for
the past I don't know 23 months or
whatever it was four months I don't know
um um but I switched room so i thought
was in my room that i repainted i
switched to a different room in my house
anyway um the main reason i suppose she
was because it was this room was way too
dark with the colors um and there was
just a lot of like childish stuff in it
that's like I couldn't take down with
the wallpaper and stuff and I just
really want to move I talked to my
parents about it long discussions over
it and I finally got them to okay my
switch but it you may think I'm crazy
and I'm really sorry for this but I
really want to switch back just because
I I was in this room for like ten years
and I just really missed it and I did
take the wallpaper down I took some
things that were really childish and
weird off my walls my parents love me to
do that because I really want to switch
rooms again and so much so much so much
has changed but then again so much is
the same like I said I don't know if it
made it clear my video where I switched
rooms that like I didn't intend it make
you think that that was the same sector
image switch colors but that was my
actual room like I slept in it that's
where I lived for the past three months
it was just different colors and
different room scheme and different bed
frame and stuff like that than this room
so start for the confusion but i think
i'm i think i'm back in this room for a
while or forever or until I go to
college next year I thought I'd do a
video today with my friend Mackenzie
chillin in the back you've seen her like
probably house with my videos but we're
hanging today and I needed to record
some videos and we're gonna like ham
with a pool but it's kind of rainy so
just ring some mags and back show me
show me your big pile oh she got a lot
of reading to do but today and doing
kind of nut no one like does this on
like the beauty annum or any channel
really but it's a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble hell
it's just like um I went too far Sonoma
State got a ton of books i'm really
excited to show you i don't want you
some summer reading a lot of it has
related to do with the makeup and
fashion business and entrepreneur ship
industry thing which is you're gonna be
really fun so that further ado let's get
started
the first bike has absolutely nothing to
do with fashion or beauty at all but my
mom found it and I was like oh my god I
knew that book isn't it was actually
written by Bob Marley's draw letter and
it's based on his song one love and it's
just called one love as a picture book
it's really childish but since I have a
love for Bob Marley I thought I would
collect um like movies of him pictures
of him CDs why not get a book about him
and written by his daughter and his just
really cool yeah it's picture book but I
absolutely love it and it's really great
and there's like a little picture of Bob
Marley like in every page like Harry is
like on the student shirt just some a
memorial and I just really love this
book I just think it's really cool and
it was only 499 so I picked this Oh next
I got the book that I'm currently
reading I chose to read this first and
you can see I'm a little bookmark in it
and it's the kardashians book a
dollhouse and I got a non so for 498 so
holla I was about to get the paperback
book which is um hang was like fifteen
twenty dollars for the paper bag with
the hardback was 498 I was like oh my
god think I found this at the last
minute but anyway this book is so cute i
really want to read their book i have
their kardashian confidential book but
that's just about them they actually
wrote this fiction novels so I'm really
excited to read it I'm on page 20 so
hollow for getting me yesterday in
already being on page 20 x i'm slow
reader but i love this this super cute
eyes like hints of pink and his leopard
print and i'm just really excited to
actually read this and hopefully conquer
it and finish it next I got a really
exciting book that I was looking for
when I went there some of the main
reasons i went to Martin oldest The
Great Gatsby and you know a lot of
people doing this for school it's
probably really boring to some people
but I haven't seen the movie yet but i
really liked soundtrack so that made me
want to buy look and I got the cover
with the movie on and not the original
cover just because i really like movie
covers and they make me want to read
books more like I just like maybe covers
they're more interesting and pretty so I
got this book it's really short and thin
so help me I'll get this done quickly
yeah i'm just really i really hope i do
finish reading a lot these books in my
summer which gym i'll have like five
weeks after summer it's like July soon
and then august is like August well for
sir or oxygen OOP having a grand
vacation yet Wow but I mean we're what
about and so I just hope this isn't your
boy I can finishing even though it's
considered like a school kind of reading
literature book thing but
I really hope they finish it and it
looks really cool I saw that like six
times yes it's called summer at
Tiffany's and it's about Tiffany's and
company like the jewelry the amazing
jewelry store and um I just love the
front house Tiffany's blue color on it
and it seems really interesting i read
the back of the book and i just picked
this up and I love books like this okay
I don't know you can see if it's like
really thick pages I don't know I love
books like that next I got the devil
wears prada and I don't know why I
didn't have this book I have like
confessions of a shopaholic in Legally
Blonde and a lot of books that were made
to movies but I didn't have this book
and this is one of my favorite movies
I'm just really glad picked up because I
in Hathaways in the movie her job is
like what I want except I don't want you
all okay which she wanted her job you
that's what I want I know I used to stay
I'm like really late and I brush my hair
like a hundred times I'm excited like
London surgeon did that it's like she's
like when Jim three okay yeah absolutely
so since I loved them maybe so much I
just thought I'd pick up this book and
this was also another reason why I went
to bounce a noble in the first place
next I was super excited to find this
because I've been missing every episode
of the TV show since it premiered and
it's the Carrie Diaries and I don't know
if this is like based off each episode
aerofit this was written and then the
episodes came out I don't know comp
below if you know what's happening with
this series the carrie diaries book
based off the show based off sex and
city based off Carrie Bradshaw blah blah
blah blah she's really glad I picked
this up it has like the TV show movie
cover which you know i love next my dad
made me get this book that i don't
really want to personally read it but he
made me get it old finnerman rules it
doesn't really appeal to me in my taste
since I'm more like girly and fashion
and beauty and it's kind of random about
business and finance which soon I don't
really like reading huge books about but
he made me get it so i think i have to
read it but maybe I won't but and then
also you made me get this English
grammar for dummies like okay I don't
know and finally the main main main main
main recent violet went to noble is to
get lauren conrad style in beauty I got
both of them which is kind of bad
because this one was 12 my name is one
was 2199 fine I really thought I pick
these up because I've been waiting and
dying for these books everyone has them
if your YouTube beauty group and you
don't have Lauren Conrad's beauty and
style books you're cray-cray so I mean
they didn't have style and hard rock
which kind of me max I wanted them both
in like hard copies because i love
hardback books but whatever i haven't
both now they're my home so excited and
I'm definitely
going to read these like as soon as I
finish the Kardashian book and you don't
even have to read these like a books
there's tons pictures and examples and
diagrams and stuff so you just pick and
choose what you want to read when you
want to read it um but I'm just really
excited fan I got these anyway hope you
enjoyed this quick he the little book
hallows really hunt since i got such a
big haul I thought I'd do a fun video
that M hasn't really been seen before by
anyone has no one's really done it and I
haven't done it you know anyway I'm kind
of in the process of moving things back
into this room that was occupied by no
one for like the last three months as
you can see my walls are kind of bear i
don't know if i want to pop the same
tanks but the wallpaper has been taken
down I'm just really excited back in
this room it is a little darker in my
videos of my lighting so I'm not sure
I'll filmmaker tutorials like right in
this spot but you know you gotta do what
you gotta do and I hope you guys aren't
you confused or like what then I moved
