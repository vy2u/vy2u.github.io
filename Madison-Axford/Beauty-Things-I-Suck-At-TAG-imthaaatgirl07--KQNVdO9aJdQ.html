I suck at AG because everyone was doing
this and I was like do things I suck at
I stuck at like everything so I'll do
this tag first thing I suck up making my
foundation flawless now I just changed
my routine so that I have um primer my
all my energy genus concluding
foundation and a Beauty Blender sponge I
used to be really cakey it used to be
all like orangish around my eyes in my
mouth it was like ooh medicine yeah what
an time I wasn't happy at the end of the
day I can't i have ever come home from
school like a lot of people would be
like oh oh oh oh oh my god i love
talking that you know those moments were
you like no one freaking told me that i
had disgusting-looking a disgusting
looking face Vicki yeah so um now that I
changed my routine I can make it look
decent but i'll never have like perfect
porcelain flawless skin um you know even
with blemishes people can cover it up
and make their skin look freaking
amazing me yeah not so much not really
my you know strong point next covering
up dark circles under my eyes now I'll
always have dark circles but the thing
is I can cover those up and you can kind
of see em peeking through I have such
dark circles under my eyes it's like a
problem but also i have this thing it's
like line like it's not a bag saw just a
dark circle because you can see that
grey / blush part of darker circle but
also its line it comes like right here
and ends right there like and what no
matter what I do no matter what a
concealer foundation powder nothing I
any color of concealed nah I don't it
don't it don't cover it up I can cover
the dark circles you know okay but lines
just will not go away so I know a lot of
people have lines and they just they
look like a doll when they pick their
foundation on and I just put it on them
like can still see it just looks like
I'm tired ok next one contouring and put
in blush on I can't forget but blush or
bronzer on like can I just do anything
like no um bronzer contouring I heard
that you're supposed to like dude like
and that line comes from your mouth like
right
right there is this like you know swipe
browser on make it like a high like make
your facebook i has a lot of definition
and stuff when i do it looks like I
seriously drew oh my it seriously it
looks like I drew a line of a brown
marker on my face like it's like uh like
this one looks at you doesn't look
blending doesn't look natural looks
awful i also tried doing bronzer like up
here and it seriously looks like versus
like a like I didn't do this is like see
motion like the letter C it looks like I
drew it on with a brown marker it's so
so dark on me and it's like yeah cuz I
ha um and then blush again I heard it
was like hey Hamilton jinx so I do that
and um yeah maybe I just buy like really
off early super dark like blushes and
don't know how to blend properly but I
just don't know how to make it look so
natural blend in fresh loved on your
face okay and this makes me seem like i
can't forget do anything but okay next
um blending eyeshadow i can do a certain
amount of eye shadow looks but when it
comes to like really natural looks or
like really like I don't know cool
smokey eyes looks i frickin can't do it
like i don't understand how to like
blend like people i don't forget to
blend it blend blend button and blend
and blend and I'm just like like like
people spend seriously five minutes of
tutorials just blending and I like I'm
like a swollen one color slope on
another color you're done and um I guess
I just don't get why there needs to be
how much blending maybe my literally
Kiki and gross or bad but I just I don't
know how to blend it properly I guess it
just I just slap it all next preventing
fallout liner and mess gara whatever I
just sneeze next is preventing a fallout
liner and mascara um I I know you can
use like a setting spray and stuff like
that but i'm not spending thirty dollars
on orbit case setting spray right now
and i find at the end of the day my
eyeliner it's like all under my eye
mascara has always a black specks on my
cheeks and no one freaking challenge me
so I get home and I'm like Lissa and I
see my bed
foundation nest my eyeliners under here
look like a raccoon I scare a little
black specks like somehow get all up on
my face Whitmer there's not even like
fallout like mascara stuffs get up here
like how does meske respects for me I
get on your forehead and then I like
touch it and smear it I seriously look
like a troll at school so if you go to
my school I'm sorry they have to see
that sometimes um today was a good day
but other days not not so good so I just
don't get out at a fixed at I mean I try
to bring q-tips and like constantly like
like you know fix it but I see people
flawless foundation flawless eyeliner an
eye makeup and they don't freaking bring
a q-tip they don't do any retouching or
touching up during the school day and
I'm just like aah there could be worse
problems and lastly I'm really a beauty
one but it's painting my nails I don't
even try anymore because these are just
ugly little nubs we take a moment to say
I had my nails hi ugly nails I just I
don't even buy nail polish anymore it's
just such a waste of time I don't take
care of my nails I should I should I
