video I'm really glad that I chose to do
this and I'm doing a beginner's makeup
kit or what you should get if you're
just starting makeup if you're in middle
school 8th in maybe elementary school I
don't know fifth graders probably not
but i don't know maybe you got into make
up early or even high school if you just
knew to make up you don't know what to
get you don't know what to buy no no
it's good out in the product world so
I'm just here to show you basic things
you don't necessarily need to get this
brand this color whatever just these
basic things um and I'm really really
excited to do this video because I feel
like I have a lot of young yours and
they may not I mean I'm sure it says
them know and have already bought makeup
but some might be like I'm really new to
make up and I I don't know what you get
I don't know what's necessary I will
nothing's necessary but you know if you
want to increase your outer beauty to
enhance your inner beauty I made up that
quote then i'ma show you a few things
now you don't need to necessarily follow
all the stuff I'm some of these things
my dad and be necessary for you you
might already have rose and cheeks you
may already have you know a good lip
color you may not have any zits or
blemishes or under eye circles or
whatever they need to cover up so this
isn't you know not necessary or
mandatory but i just want to show you
what i started with and what I think's s
is very for my ugly skin type so let's
get right into this video I just have
this little nice makeup bag that's like
ombre with a green and blue color that i
got from like best buddy works like a
century ago um i feel that everyone
should i have at least a few makeup bag
so maybe just one or two and they can
ship stuff in you can travel with it you
can just keep it if you need to move
around to different bathrooms if you
don't have a makeup table or you're on
your own bathroom or something and you
can like take it to the bathroom and
bring it back to your room it's just
really nice um to have this and throw
stuff in it anyway the first thing that
I things necessary it's just a nice chap
stick that's maybe tinted it works as a
moisturizer and it could be uses
lipstick lipgloss the one that I have is
just by lip smackers it's really simple
and it was seriously like under two
dollars um it provides awesome color and
great moisturizer and I just really like
this I feel like everyone should have
just like this basic chapstick thing you
go for a lip smacker brand if you don't
have that at your target and walmart
then go for it
just go for sign simple that adds a bit
of color so that you feel ways have that
pop of glimmer in your on your lips the
next thing if you're not too into powder
or if your skin's really you know if
you're new to the whole acne and and
puberty thing and you want to cover up
any you know whatever on your face I
would go with a foundation I really
light color don't overdo it don't put
tons on don't make yourself an orange
make sure you match your color why did I
say light color anyway make sure you
match your color so I was trying to say
and this is just covergirl outlast stay
fabulous threesome I chose this
foundation is because it's very very
airy very light it feels like you're
running nothing I blends seamlessly it
also has sunscreen with SPF 20 which is
great so you don't worry about putting
extra you know shellac and goop on your
face it's about nine or ten dollars so
this may be a little on your price range
if you're just beginning but it
seriously has kind of our foundation and
concealer on this three and one thing
and I really like it i do find that it
works well it covers well so if you're
starting out with makeup I would
definitely check this brand out coveted
maybelline have the cheapest month but
then Neutrogena holds my favorite
foundation which is the skin clearing
one but that's because I've acne but you
guys might not with you're just starting
out with makeup so I just check out this
brand this kind or you know just
validation in general or powder but I
mean I particularly don't like powder so
I wouldn't suggest starting out with
that next thing is just a nice blush I
wouldn't necessarily start out with a
bronzer when you're gonna you know first
start your kit um since like I use
bronzer every day and I don't really use
that much blush but to start a beats
blush because it's easier to work with
it's easier to blend and you're not
gonna be orange and cakey this just adds
a nice healthy looking glow and and
rosiness to cheeks which I love and this
is just my Elks Club pink passion and
its really brightens one other more neon
BAM colors um that and I picked it out
of course cuz i love it they also have
tons of subtle scuitto looking colors
that are easier to blend and it's just
really nice to add a little colored your
face makes you look like you put a
little effort and time into your makeup
and I love adding blush tiny look
exciting eyeliner in mascara if you were
to pick one of these I would definitely
pick mascara because you can't go wrong
with it and I always makes your
eyelashes look great this is my favorite
mascara the Great Lash lots of lashes by
Maybelline and then um eyeliner is
optional most middle schoolers don't
necessarily um once you put eyeliner on
their tight line in water line
like ice cores Jeep but as I knows what
I always thought it was cool to put
eyeliner way you know on your upper lash
line but like way above it and make a
thick line a fit cat eye and that's
definitely not the way to go you um you
don't necessarily look good with that um
and so if you were to pick one of these
I would paint mascara you can go with
both but just be leery of eyeliner
because you can go out of control with
it and it makes you look kind of I don't
know but the word is just really really
dark and and like really just dark heavy
eyes and that's not always a fresh
middle school like or high school face
that you want you know you don't want to
look like really smoky eye every day you
just kind of want a simple look so this
is totally totally totally optional I
wouldn't even include this the only
reason I did is because this is by
essence and it's seriously like a dollar
um and it's great if you're looking for
an eyeliner but otherwise i would just
stick to mascara because it always makes
isaac more dramatic what your face looks
more natural and settling fresh and
finally if you're looking for good
brushes to apply the foundation way
toward for using blush whatever elf
brushes they're really good I wouldn't
necessarily look at the one Center
Dowler but the one set of three dollar
have like this lower black part the
other ones are like silver I think um
this is an eyeshadow brush this is a
kabuki powder brush so it's either like
I don't know face powder mattifying
powder bronzer and then this could be a
flat top kabuki large for either
applying powder or foundation but these
brushes are seriously great they've
lasted so long and since don't three
dollars i'm definitely check these out
they have a wide variety of different
kinds of elf brushes and it just I
wouldn't expect people to spend over
twenty dollars on brushes when they're
just starting out because you don't need
that when you're just starting out if
you're doing this simple light face that
i showed in this video then i would
definitely check out of brushes at
target for the three dollar ones so if
you enjoyed this video is really fun to
do and i hope this helped you obviously
i'm not going to make anyone mad and say
you need these things to be pretty or to
fit in no that's not what I'm saying I'm
just saying that when I start out this
is what i use and this is what i
recommend because i feel like people in
seventh and eighth grade are going to
want to you know start my makeup and
make themselves look you know I don't
know better is not the word but just to
make themselves a little more glam Jap
you know for the boys or whatever your
doing um and this is what i recommend so
