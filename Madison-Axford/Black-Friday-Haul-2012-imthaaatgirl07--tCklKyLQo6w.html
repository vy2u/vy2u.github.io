stuff that my sister actually got this
little sock monkey keychain for me I
named after her and kenzie dancing my
sister taxon agent Mack yeah it's just
super cute like original song with me
yeah I'm gonna put it on my car keys
just like it was one of the most awful
things
I was freaking out and should i bought
me this I'm so sweet so yes disclaimer i
know that i bought a lot of stuff but I
literally haven't gone shopping in four
or five months like ever since school
started I've been so um with school and
I'm not been shopping like I bought like
maybe a pair earrings are shirt here and
there but I have not boughten as much
since like the first week summer maybe
it's been super super super bowl and I
don't mean to brag by showing you any of
this but this this is one of the most
highly like recursive videos everyone
does it and so of course I had to do it
so please don't comment below like I'm
snobby rhyme showing off or I'm like
rich or anything by i'm showing you this
hall because i just want to show you the
deals I got and stuff and I love
watching these holes and I'm not trying
to brag and I'm not trying to show you
how much i got like I'm just showing you
extort you yeah so I hope you enjoyed
this video let's get started
first I went to bestbuy I did find two
movies and I had to wait in an hour long
line but it was worth it i guess so the
first movie i got is something borrowed
so I saw this movie over the summer and
this is a really good movie it was super
cute and cheap and then the second one
I'm very excited about also um this is
kind of a Disney babyish movie but I am
a fanatic of Disney cartoon movies I
like collect them all because I love
them so i got this um collector's
edition pocahontas one and two and this
was a little more expensive wasn't on
sale for black party but I just picked
it up because I was there and I don't go
to bestbuy often so I just got this yeah
I don't have a bag because the cashier
wouldn't give me a bagless secured
laughs and I said and he gave my TV like
I'm bad he was like yo to lumen I don't
really kind of get cake some bad news
have a nice day
what there's like one in the morning and
I wait in that long line so I get it to
movies a need in gimme a friggin bag
whoops now moving on to target please
excuse any bag rattling you here so I'm
apologizing in advance first thing I got
is this unicorn dream lites pillow pet
thing and it's for my sister for
Christmas because this is on her list
and I was like one might as well get it
for her and so um I got this for her it
like lights up in the dark and like a
unicorn on the ceiling I don't know so
she really likes you he'll have had some
unicorn stuff so I got this then just
moving on to me enough stuff I bought
again I wasn't looking for anything
specific this year while I was going
black friday shopping so I kinda just
picked up random random random style as
you will see the next thing I got are
these little gloves and they have this
these things on the ends of your fingers
so when you're using your smartphone I
mean it's cold outside you can still
work your phone because when you're
wearing stretchy women's you cannot like
use your phone you till I take your
finger out he's like heat from your
finger so these allow you to do that
without taking off your gloves and they
were three dollars and it was buy one
get one free so I got these neon yellow
pear and then these white pair and yeah
there by one gun free and it was through
dollar so I was like oh my gosh I need
these these to be super expensive old
navy I never got a pair and now i'm glad
i got these ones the next thing came to
pack of three but i'm only gonna show
you one because i'm not gonna show you
through the same thing um it's just use
peppermint chapstick and i was really
really wanting peppermint chapstick um
so I found this one a target and it
tastes exactly like peppermint is
perfect for the winter and the last
thing I got again it's kind of random
juicy fanatic again like I said and I
got Lady and the Tramp and I've never
seen this movie so I like had to pick it
up because I've heard a lot of people
like it is really cute love story and
i'm not a fan of animals it's like
movies about that but it's a disney
movie cartoon so I know I like it next
moving on to walgreens wet and wild
blush because i do not have blush so I
found this one it's um Wet'n'Wild
heather silk and it's just a pretty pink
i have it on now um it's a little dark
for me personally so I wasn't expecting
it to be that dark but I worked it out
I think it looks good so yes um all
right for my first normal blush because
if you have seen in my other videos you
know on my blush problems and I'm how I
can't really find a blush that works
last thing I got from walgreens um I am
obsessed with oh if you're watching this
Jeff I'm having a shout out for my
friend Jeff um you're probably gonna be
really jealous me but that's okay
as soon as i saw i knew that i wanted it
um I was just like so excited I forget
and this is really big so I'll show you
up like a bigger picture later but this
is just kind of a brief overview this is
so not gonna work anyway it's a taylor
swift red blanket i'm super excited
because I wanted her speak now blanket
when I went to her concert a year ago
ish but I didn't get it and it was
really expensive in this one was way way
way cheaper so I was like oh and I'll
show you like a better view of it now
it's just a very very large blanket of
the cover of her new CD read it says her
name at the bombs little wrinkly so
about that
like soft material and I just really
like only one of my favorite things that
I got moving on to that then buddy were
first I got um for soaps for soaps
because it was for 415 that's pretty
good deal first up I got is winter sice
and vanilla and I'm not even going to
try to attempt to tell you how they
smell because when people do it they're
like this smells like vanilla and um
yeah I think you can kind of guess what
it smells like I don't want to be rude
but I'm not gonna like smell these and
try to explain then I got cranberry
tangerine then I got my absolute
favorite vanilla bean Noel and I have a
vanilla bean Noel candle lit in the back
I am an obsessive vanilla bean a well
person thing whatever I don't even know
I'm so tired I was out from eight last
night until 3pm today and with no sleep
that's my candles are burning because
that's how dedicated I am to archiving
and the last one is sparkling pink
champagne I'm asleep chimpanzee oh well
I oh my goodness i'm tired and i look
like a mess and then i got chu candles
into little holders the first holder I
got is this super adorable snowman lon
he has a red scarf on and you're you're
just supposed to hold them large through
it candles and these so yeah that's
really cute and the first candle i got
is on fresh balsa i just really like it
as smell kind of like christmas tree
it's so Christmasy the next candle
holder I guys one more fancy is this one
and it has like a little stand and I
just thought it was very very pretty
very chic Anna it look right in my room
and then the second candle i got is
white barn number two chestnut and clove
and this is kind of a new one it's just
a really good smell i'm such a good
camera explainer if you spent forty
bucks Agatha motorworks you got this
beautiful silver bag for twenty dollars
then it has a little um pull out sparkly
pouch and then inside it's just a bunch
of stuff has a lot of lotion shower gels
so panicked and
I'm gonna like try to read below so yeah
so I am debating whether or not I want
to keep this for myself even though I
have a lot about body works products or
if I want to give someone as a present
cuz i think this would be an absolutely
wonderful present to give to someone so
yeah so abating probably gonna be a
present then I did go to my mall but
right before I went to my mom my mom
suggested that we go to this crack their
thing and at first I was gonna like I
don't really want include would cry out
for me it's like Black Friday I don't
want to go to a craft fair but I am very
glad she suggested and made us go me and
my sister because it was like amazing
like the guy had never been to a craft
fair before and I just like I'm really
glad I went it was a great experience
and I got four really great things out
of it so um the person for the pepper
maybe this absolutely gianormous bag and
I got like four little things so they're
all like the buns bag but that's okay
the first thing I got I'm wearing and
it's this necklace and it has a monogram
em on it and I just think this is
gorgeous she made it for me there
exactly how I wanted the font and
everything and I think this is just
super cute it doesn't have my middle
name and last name initials but it just
says my first name and from esta and I
loved this it was I mean it was like
five dollars the next thing I got and
look for for a while and it's just like
a little anklet I'm an ankle bracelet
and I found this one it's just um this
like has a cross on it it's just silver
things very simple very cute i just won
an anklet so gut luck then this is kind
of random for me I've never really been
into this until lately but I found these
earrings and there I don't know what
their call it some religion and it has
these little hands um some like creepy
little eyes and then this thing whatever
this is I don't know what that means and
then it just has these orange beaded
tassels to wear a dollar what and um he
cross anklet was two dollars so this
craft fair was super cheap and I was
like obsessed with that and a last thing
I got from the craft fair um it's really
random I don't know if someone made this
I don't think they did but I don't know
where they got it so I needed a new
phone case for my phone I was sick of
the phone cases that I had been using
lately so I was just like
by new phone case so this almost five
dollars and I have just recently become
kind of moderately obsessed with the
Avengers I've never liked supieras
before never even like soon as
superheroes movie until this one so I
really got this case yeah it's an
Avengers case pretty nerdy I know I
really like it ok then I went to the
mall and first I went to Delia I got
this shirt that is like it has cutouts
near your shoulders and it's like a
creamish and if you look closely it's a
skull which I'm obsessed with skulls
made out of flowers yeah you can see
that it's super cute and flowy and I
really like this top I got this silver
uh kind of like sweater thing with a
black sparkly metallic cross on it and
it's kind of a crop sweater it's nothing
mom and I couldn't pass it up because I
love um shirts with crosses I have one
from forever 21 also that's like a tank
top forever 21 first just a plain black
um tank so this one looks like playing
black tank so yeah basics then I got
this sweater that's like all of drab and
has black sleeves and I thought this was
like really um colorblocked and super
super pretty then I got another sweater
X thing is um it's kind of big stealing
size they had left but it's just gray
and it has these cute little button
detailing on it and blue stripes and my
favorite part about this is on the
sleeves it has these like um legal
circles before that elbows are and I've
always why the side like this and the
last thing I got from forever 21 is this
load Skinner like fanti it's kind of
like rugged old boho looking and it has
an eagle on it from his song free bird
