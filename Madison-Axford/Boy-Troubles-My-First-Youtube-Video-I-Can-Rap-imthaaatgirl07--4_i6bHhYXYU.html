today I thought I would do my question
and answer part 2 video that I put up a
I was going to do another one of these
videos and I got a lot of great
responses and questions so I decided
today that I would actually do the video
and answer you guys's questions I'm also
like last time going to take questions
up other videos or questions that i was
in boxed or message some other how some
other way through my email I don't know
it was just I'm gonna do everyone's
questions just so that it's fair and
it's not just whoever put it on that
video cuz people might have seen that
video i don't know i'm going to try to
get every question off the past like 10
to 15 videos that i have put up so
without further ado let's get into these
question okay so starting out on the
actual QA remember to question estimate
questions video um we have katie and i
do not know how to say your last name
nguy en can you do more singing videos
and I get this question a lot because I
do have I sing 24-7 in all my videos
every little clips of me probably
singing like high-pitched voice okay you
know I sing a lot it's inevitable but
doing a soon video is not what I was
going to do this Mesa cuter thing I
don't know if I'm still doing that just
because of time and conflicts have
gotten in the way of the scheduling of
when we were going to do it obviously I
would love to do it I just I just hate
singing videos because people expect
some great voice that I'm supposed to
have and I don't know if I'm going to be
able to pull off two peoples pars I
don't think that I'm some amazing singer
you know and so that's why I have a
beauty channel i'm not a singing or a
music youtube channel and so right now
this point my life no there aren't
really gonna be any singing videos
besides little clips in my beauty videos
already but um I'm sorry I just there
there I don't know if there will be in
the future I just don't wanna dedicate a
whole video to me singing set some of
this channels like meant for and I just
I really don't like singing in front of
people actually putting it up 44 views
and to get to get judged and stuff like
the edge I don't know so no
much in short no next we have mac makeup
junkie 13 we draw a high school advice
video and we do makeup swap my doodoo
high school advice video part 1
frequently asked questions about high
school boy advice and stuff with three
of my friends I have that linked in the
downbar we really wanted to get together
and do another one I think we will
before this summer ends which is in like
a few weeks but um I don't know I just
think it's more fun to do with friends
you get a lot different perspectives and
a lot of different answers rather than
just by yourself and just my advice
because it seems really biased at some
point um so I did do one video um well I
do a makeup swap at this point in my
youtube career no i am not really big
enough I just have so many other things
that are like necessary that I spend
running on right now then spending it on
a makeup swap I got in my car in school
and stuff that I need to spend my own
voice before i spend it on just a random
fun swap so no next this user didn't
want me to mention their username the
video but it says what should i do if i
like a boy and my friend likes the same
guy and and she always talks to him more
than me and I'm kind of jealous please
help I'll try my best cuz I'm the boy
expert I would talk to you best friend
if you like the same guys her be like
okay do you guys that guy cuz i kinda
like him too and just see what you guys
are at and see if she even does like a
merchant's just come along floor
Taoiseach sand and joking around with
him um if she says yes and he's
obviously talking to her more he's
interested in her and you can't really
change in his mind you're not gonna be
able to like make him like you if you
try to like get her out of the picture
like that will just not net never work
with guys tell her your feelings and be
like okay if you like him then I'm gonna
be the good friend I'm gonna be nice i'm
gonna move on and let you guys be and
don't try to mess with their
relationship if he does like her more
flirts with her more jealous i'm always
jealous i know i mean girls we are
jealous were the jealous type but it's
just like you I've been in that place
before what you just gotta gotta move on
and just be like your loss um but don't
try to get in the way of anything that
they have if they really do like each
other if she likes him if I'm JM crown
she has two questions have you ever
heard of the Juno skeans do you like the
Janoskians love
videos thank you but no I've never heard
of them I don't know what they do I
don't know who they are so no and then
what's your favorite type of chips and
your favorite lip product my favorite
type of chips are probably like the
crunchers brand and I can better than
just like original lays and the my
favorite lip product is either Nivea lip
butters or baby lips for sure I love
like the moisturizers I have a little
bit of tinted color in them next from X

stores to shop at um a favorite stores
to shop at are definitely forever 21 and
that's basically it that's like where I
get my stuff that's that's basically it

there or urban outfitters but really
just forever 21 pinkalicious beauty 13
high school advice please um I rented
one again and I'll be linked to the
downbar I am hopefully going to do
another one and will answer more
questions that are frequently asked
about high school and stuff like that
and our opinions in our experiences
stuff like that with Mackenzie Audrey
and Kylie again but we'll see Marie posa
tinoco do you like one direction or Jeff
are just their songs I don't hate them
obviously but I don't like them I don't
think they're that cute and I don't like
their music it's just like boy bands I
don't like that um I like music where I
can actually like sing it and not really
like the whole band thing um so no I do
not like one direction I do not like
their songs either from fo la la do you
have a boyfriend and if not did you ever
and he most embarrassing thing that has
ever happened to you well did i do I
have a boyfriend no did I ever no said
we have been close to it a lot of times
but usually one of us will ruin it or
make things weird or awkward or apology
one away cuz I'm scared of what's gonna
happen between us so no I've never had a
boyfriend yeah sure i will show you at
some times in some points but no I kind
of I don't know I just mess everything
up high the most embarrassing thing
that's ever happened to you oh gosh I
don't know life's just one embarrassing
awkward moment probably getting a bad
grade in Latin class freshman year
because there were guys in my class and
I was constantly
flirting with them that's pretty
humiliating and really makes you look
pathetic I'm Erin McCarley do you find
it awkward feeling on your parents at
home I'm really outgoing lab person who
likes to act and be like what um so no
time really it is sometimes awkward if
you're like talking like this in your
parents know that you're by yourself and
then they're like what they both know
about it they both support me and
they're happy for the success that I've
had so and now in my career no I do not
find it awkward at all at first probably
little if you look back in my very first
video she's my November favorites I was
like like oh gosh so so awkward and
weird but now I'm like laughs and I'm
like whatever I just like a job to me so
it's not it awkward and if it is that
you shouldn't do this this should be
your job from Michaela grandpa she's two
questions also how'd you get so big on
YouTube so fast oh that is so nice I
really don't see myself as big as I
guess big YouTube meeting room um
because i'm not one of the people who
have 500 k subscribers but um really
just part of your videos consistently I
know I've taken a few breaks here and
there where i'm like i can't do those
like too much to do too much work much
school but i always come back to it
because I loved so much and just
seriously keep it up with it and you
will get more views if you just keep
home videos up and you know good
lightning in a good camera always helps
it's not necessary but people who'd
rather watch line you know really good
quality than like a webcam camera which
I did start on I'm like one of my really
old YouTube channels that's deleted so
he can't see ya those videos uh no and
then music video please again if it
works out and I have like two or three
weeks left of summer so I don't know if
I'm going to be able to get the music
video the entire thing mate I already
have the song recorded but if I have the
whole thing like made and creating
edited and put together by the end of
summer I will put it up but I don't know
if that's going to happen sparkly
princess 07 what's your favorite sword
shop at by the way I love your videos
thank you and um fabric 21 forever try
one for shoes what what did I just say
for shoes forever 21 for clothes target
for like everything else and that's
about it X that's just Gabrielle X has
four questions and those are the last
four on this particular question and
answer video she says are you in love
with lana del rey and your music like
I am today's her birthday that was a
month ago so yes I did have is from
post-it wishing a happy birthday she is
the greatest singer ever oh my god I
love Linda race so so so so so much I
can describe her music how much I love
it and I just love her so much favorite
genre of music um pop and rap everyone's
two likelies favorites like when I watch
today is to be like I like everything
but pop and rap I hate country though oh
hey country but pop and rap I can wrap
and I can pop what um and then she says
oh wait the last you are actually the
same thing secret talent nothing I have
no secret talents I can crack my neck
fingers toes and back that cows um I'm
known to really um get huge mosquito
bites and I'm known to always get hurt
I'm really clumsy um I can put lipstick
on without looking in a mirror and I
think I can rap I don't know about you
might be judgmental you might be like no
no you cannot wrap but you know I think
I can my friends to me that I can so
that be my overall super talent I can
rap so now going on to other videos and
looking at people ask me questions yeah
someone asked me do you think the iPhone
5 is worth having and I think it's worth
having if you are like a vlogger and
you're gonna vlog on the bad or if
you're like really into photography or
it's your Java saying you need to take
great pictures um otherwise besides have
an extra row like on your screen not
really it's much better quality and HD
and that's mainly why I got it but it's
expensive so if it's time to get a new
phone yeah i would suggest it rather
than going to an iPhone 4 or 4s again
but just like if you just got an iphone
4 or something I wouldn't just help up
to an iphone 5 it's such a greater cost
and there's you don't get that much more
with it so that's see if I could do a
room tour and I kind of just did in the
whole room switch weird whatever the
heck that was thing um I did just kind
of do it and that much has change of
taking things off my walls and like
nothing is like changed order though so
that chip video took so long still
probably not anytime soon the song in
the beginning of my new videos is the
midnight life um by the white panda
featuring kanye west's remix you can't
get it on itunes it's only off youtube
and
link is in my damn description bar thing
and every one of my videos do I have a
p.o box no not yet i really want to get
one but come below if you'd send me
something like I really want to see I
really want to talk to you guys and I'd
write back to every one of you and if I
got like letters and stuff I just don't
know it's like opening one would be a
mistake right now because it does cost
and I don't really know if anyone would
send me like stuff in and talk to me
like you know so little I'm done Machel
come for a little flesh hold what kind
of car do i drive i drive a blue
chrysler sebring which is a convertible
where do i live i live in missouri so if
you're wondering that is where I live I
said that in my draw my life video but
yeah misery the middle of nowhere
basically what do I used to edit my
videos every single video I've ever done
is off I movie on my macbook I do lost
my phone they go on to my computer and I
transfer them to a movie um seriously
everything's on iMovie I wouldn't just
come swing on my phone and then put it
up um everything's fi movie off my
computer so yeah it's really nice
program it came free with my computer so
it's amazing that is all of my questions
that I have right now I hope you enjoyed
this video I didn't get that many
questions because i think i am kind of
an open book here on youtube so i don't
think that there's really anything that
you don't know about me um but I thank
