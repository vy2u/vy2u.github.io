haul and I am announcing the winners of
my giveaway which was hella about a
month and a half ago I think it was when
I hit two hundred thousand subscribers
and I decide to do a giveaway of an
iPhone 6 for one of the prizes and the
champagne pop highlighter and tour my
dreams card for the second prize I was
really excited to do this because I'm
gonna get back in some way it's not much
and I know it's going to cheer you and I
apologize for that cuz not everyone
could win obviously if we don't win I'm
sorry please don't hold that against me
and I'm excited to announce the giveaway
winners and I'm excited for those two
but for the other ones who did not win
this time I'm sorry but subscribe and
there will be more giveaways in the
future for sure um also I'm doing my
Christmas haul today like I already said
I'm sorry it took me so long to get this
up I feel like it's like it's only been
like three days since Christmas but
that's a really long time in YouTube
world cuz people on Christmas Eve were
like doing the Christmas haul that I was
like oh my god what um my favorite
doesn't open the presents until
Christmas Day night so almost the day
after Christmas really I'm super
thankful for what I got if you think I'm
bragging awesome
you know go click off the video thumbs
it down have a good day everyone dozens
videos it was so so hand across it I
couldn't post an Instagram picture
without it having 9 comments just about
this so I want to do a few guys for sure
for sure for sure but I've been really
lazy after Christmas I will do my
Christmas haul first and then I will
tell you the giveaway winners at the end
of the video so stay tuned for that so
the first thing I got was a surprise and
it is this pink Kate Spade Nita wallet
that is the style I adore this I didn't
know I was getting it I don't have a
wallet it's really ok ratchet I don't
know I don't have a wallet but all the
waltz I have are like little ones which
I adore I love I use him all the time
but I have a little blue one and then
like a little old pink one with a bow
black robe both from Kate Spade yeah I
didn't know I was getting this cuz I
don't really use a purse purse aione or
shopping I imagine you purse but I just
throw in my little like mini wallet card
holder thing and that's what I use for a
wallet but my mom taught me this pink
Kate Spade well like I said and it's
huge on the inside I mean like it's a
grown-up wallet like I think growing up
oh my god
what is let's crap I thought it was
really really adorable I love the color
and I don't have a wallet so it was
needed and I didn't even know I needed
it but yeah I'm very thankful that I got
that and she also got me this beige
purse let's take a moment row beautiful
it is it has two straps right here like
short straps and then a longer crossbody
strap it's very big and stiff and it
doesn't collapse if there's nothing in
it like there's nothing in it holding
its right now yet it's still
perfectly I don't know shaped it's very
stiff but I love it it's very deep too
if you can see that like this is my
whole arm will fit into it and pink
polka dots on the inside and she's like
I got the people that's a minute so just
look out my god so I didn't know I was
getting these things but they will come
into much use in the new year and I'm
very excited for these I think they're
adorable I love this neutral color for
the outside of bag because it goes with
everything I could possibly wear next I
got two candles which I did ask for
these because I always like to burn a
candle in the back of my video like
every other youtuber on this planet I
just think it looks a little more like
homey and relaxing in life and so my
favorite scent and we have one favorite
scent from muddy works and it's mahogany
teak wood so I got two mahogany teak
wood it's mostly got a combi or
Hollister if you don't know what those
are it's just wrong perfume Cologne a
smile I'm gonna adore it it smells like
a zone good and they literally captured
that store and my childhood because all
I wore was ever crummy in Hollister in a
candle and I'm so happy that I got two
of these because these lofts are pretty
dang a long time but I'm filming long
long times like if I'm gonna feel them
off on like nine videos in the day so
this thing is burning for quite some
time many hours so I do need these to
last and these are thick big candles and
they're my favorite kind of candles per
my might wreck site next I got something
I also asked for which is a new SD card
and yet it a new SD card because all
mine are like eight gigabyte and they
hold like half of a video so I'm
constant like pausing what um in the
middle of the video to import to my
computer and then hurry back and hope
that that clip stays in my computer it
unless the final cut crashes which often
happens the night come back onto my
camera and I delete that clip and then
rip over my next 7 to 11 minute clip and
it just isn't
I got a 128 gigabytes that's huge that's
amazing and I knew I wanted a really big
one so my mom got me this is about big
SD card I missed a flash drive an SD
card and somebody comes much-used next I
got a thing that was not expected it's
super cute my family if you didn't know
when to New York about two weeks ago my
mom dad and sister I didn't go because I
had finals and I just could not I was it
wouldn't have been able to like I
couldn't just like leave if I we get and
like go up there and like they were
playing that kind of Tuesday I had
finals like it just wasn't gonna work so
I couldn't go and I accepted that early
on
I'm gonna be there going but my mom
brought me back this Christmas souvenir
thing and it's super cutest she's like
it's for you tree when you grow up like
oh my god cuz like right now I don't
have my own tree besides this little one
which this is too big to hold on that
but when I do is she cut me in this
beautiful beautiful New York ornament
okay so it's a huge bulb and it has a
New York Times Square runway at these
little like theater masks Brooklyn
Manhattan Long Island Keene Bronx
central park big apple Grand Central
Station like all such a Liberty never I
state building on the big key things
about New York and it's red bow in the
top it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful
it's by the very Malita if you know that
contract I was actually wanting to name
I got I got my kids names really early
like I know I'm naming my kids if I have
kids when I have good Charles and Bianca
and I love those means but I was gonna
need my kid like Lolita for a while like
apparently I have kids I don't want kids
right now no don't be scared um like in
the future it's fun for gross premiums
and I was like bolita and the memo was
like no the next day I got it was also a
surprise and it's the smoked over decay
palette not the smoky this is a smoked
that came in a while back but I always
wanted it never got many hands on it I
just don't really purchase helots ever
for myself but oh my god this smoked up
its the zipper palette and it comes with
it came with a full 24/7 glide-on black
eyeliner in perversion perversion so you
just watch this oh so waxy and
incredible I don't really know what the
difference between between perversion
and zero is but this is beautiful in
waxy and
for that that came full-size as well as
a little travel or Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion eyeshadow primer but
there's 10 colors and what I love about
this is they have these two like nice
lip colors but then there's just crazy
dark smoky colors because it is a smoky
palette obviously that's the name I am
in love at least I can't wait to use
like Rockstar evidence loaded like those
are my colors like I use blue greens and
purples all the time doing though
they're very kind of hard to use for
some people I live for them these are
amazing colors and I'm super glad I got
this palette randomly mom is just like
pick this out and I was like okay yes
lay I'm definitely doing a lot more oils
in the upcoming year I hope you guys are
ready and excited for that I have
studied a lot up on my makeup in the
past year because it was a hot-ass mess
I'm not saying I'm amazing at it now but
I've come a long damn way
so more materials will be coming in the
next year because that's really what I
want to move that channel back to is
what I originated with which was made up
and not a lot of other like random
things that I've been doing I said slow
denied setting stuff like that but I
want to do a lot of makeup Turtles my
