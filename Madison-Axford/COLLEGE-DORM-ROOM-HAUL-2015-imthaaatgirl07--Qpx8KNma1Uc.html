reusing some old things that I used for
my freshman year at college

rodeo but I know what you guys need to
bring out if you're about to start
college or you know your routine culture

bring and let me show you a few things
that I have collected for my fall chosen
fittings queer so I got this stuff from
dorm it up calm you don't have a doorman
up cut comments it's an amazing website
that I really wish I knew about before
my freshman year last year because you
can order like different packages of all
your dorm stuff and get every single
thing you could possibly think you need
in like this big box and it just shipped
to your door you don't have to go
running around to Target Walmart Bed
Bath and Beyond I mean it may be fun to
do that but you don't need to especially
if you're like a person who gets like
anxious about this kind of stuff I don't
I love shopping but if you do it all
this stuff is on this list of all the
stuff you need to survive living on your
own it stresses you out definitely go
check out this website doormen
epicondyle be listed down below all the
links I have a discount code if you go

so much time you just click you know
what colors of you know the comforters
or whatever you want you click the
things you want and need you get the
entire package or just some things
everything you possibly need you guys
I'll show you what I got from work on

hump so cute so you open it but it gives
you a from a noodles for one like like
amazing I love that they give you red
bowl which I've never tried red ball so
I'm excited like toddlers necessities
right here they give you a little pair
sunglasses that's a joke huh okay so
this this is the colors I picked out
I'll have the colors that I think that
below out it was called I think it was a
commit wanna maybe this is the stuff
that comes with the mint collection
suffers I got a comforter a new
comforter and it's beautiful it's green
and white I think this pink accents in
it as well
okay so it comes to extra-large fight
that's what most college dorm beds are
there to an extra-large and that twin I
know this 11 misconception confusion
with that I got into an extra-large
comforter from my bed last year at
Mizzou and I worked out fine so I think
you should be fine with each one
extra-large I love it is okay there's
like air being let out of this I feel
like okay flip it up a little bit and
they look stick it with my comforter I
love this I love this pillow then I got
a hamper it's so much bigger than I have
right hats you're into pink so if you
rather than my black one um it's just a
pop-up amber I wrecked my pop of campers
they take a bus room and definite in
your wife's mind unless your bro I broke
it on the way home
this is cubed up it has like six cubes
hanging cubes I'm sorry I painted these
hanging closet things but they literally
put on the website I was like okay it
goes so that you like hang mom broke up
in and I think it's pretty cool
so to try that then I got this little
plate set it comes with one plate two
bowls into Cubs
so they great once I have my own
apartment then I have this little desk
organizer man to hold you know any pens
post-it notes scissors whatever your
little desk utensils are it's a super
cute and it's for little spots here last
but not least I got something I've
always wanted right like this is so
nerdy but I always wanted something like
this and so when you're doing homework
on your bed or you know wherever the
lack desk so a lab does this is a legal
abeyance 11 ticket there's like these
like beans and this is all pouch under
