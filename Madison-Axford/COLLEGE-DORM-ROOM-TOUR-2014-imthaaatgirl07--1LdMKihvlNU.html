right now my name is a giant Taylor most
people call me Teddy apex - that's what
you call me
and I'm pretty cool pretty awesome
I'm also technically my milla names
beast so it's not saying that you guys
are my suspect friends explain to them
what a suspect means but it's obvious
right see I actually know he's trying to
explain to me more oh hey
I don't know I did they know something
you guys know what the suspect means see
write the definition contractor Kyoto to
the bay strolling so casually every
day's date swipe my trots and I do
you threw a late-day I wanna
convey a game so that's another I'm a
maker
hey guys so today I'm June my
long-awaited dorm room tour you know
it's been a few weeks since I've been
living here but I was just trying to get
everything organized nice and neat for
this video you know because when you
live in a place it gets a little messy
every now and then like there's laundry
in the hamper right now but ignore that
because I'm a real person and I live
here so I mean yes I know love you want
to see this so of course I was gonna do
it but yeah without further ado let's
get started okay so starting here is
just the back of my door which has a
command hook on it apparently we're only
allowed to use command hooks at least in
my dorm on our doors can't use it on the
wall for some reason so I've one command
hook I have a robe on it a like little
shower wrap and then my gold towel so
that's just on the back of my door kind
of messy I know I'm my bed but then we
come to this corner and I have a hamper
full of laundry that I need to do so
ignore that but like I said I am a
person so I had the dirty laundry that
needs to be done and then we have my
closet which my roommate Mackenzie her
closets much bigger than mine which I
don't know why I got the small one but I
was totally fine to it cuz I didn't have
that much anyway but I attempted to
color coat as you can see so I have all
my shirts tops tank tops and then
dresses and coats and whatever hung up
and then underneath I have a nice little
shoe rack that keeps everything really
organized and then in front of my closet
I have this bath mat which we have
another matching
in the bathroom what I love about this
is that I can bring my shower caddy
after I take a shower into my room and
it's like still dripping wet and I can
put it on this and it soaks up any
excess water you know that drips out of
the caddy so that's awesome and then we
turn around and here is my bud I love my
bed obviously it's a white comforter I
kind of went with a black and white /
blue theme that I added the blue a
little later but I have some throw
pillows
I have stitch of course and then a
chevron pillow this is from weekends
only this pillow from pbteen and then
this big one is from Target and then
these two little ones this fuzzy one and
this velvet one are from Walmart and
then my favorite part of my room
personally is my photo collage up here I
don't know I just like love this part it
just has all these photos like from over
the past year or two that I love up on
my wall so my friends and family I don't
know this is just definitely my favorite
part sorry for the glare on some of them
but yeah I just love to look at these
and remember the memories and be like oh
so yeah I just did it myself you know as
you can see it just hung up some twine
and then some little clothespins clip me
pictures on the string so pretty easy
and I thought I'd add a cute little
touch to my room then we have my window
which is a nice view of another dorm
across the street and then I have this
three drawer dresser right here and that
right here is my dresser on top I have a
flashlight which I like to use a lot my
Kate Spade perfume my little fan control

light is very nice coming from the
window right there and then I'll do my
videos great here um and then I have
this lamp that my mom got me from Target
and then I have this little stepstool
the first drawer just has some scarves I
have different classes each day so when
it's a day that I don't have certain
classes I will put those notebooks the
books and the folders in this drawer
because I don't want to mess and I don't
want them out
in need of them for that day the second
drawer it just has all my bras and
underwear an edge and then you last
