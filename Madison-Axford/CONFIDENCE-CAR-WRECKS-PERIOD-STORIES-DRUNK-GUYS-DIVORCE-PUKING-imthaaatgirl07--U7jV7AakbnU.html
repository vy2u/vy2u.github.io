not hurt hey so today I am here with my
girls oh gee a McKenzie and weird my
girl talk like so fun to do it with
other people like I did a girl talk I
don't know if you saw it like a month
ago by myself or just awkward I was like
just today we were doing a Q&amp;amp;A our girls
talked to you and I asked you guys men
to come and ask me questions anything
anything you would ask we'll answer but
without further ado let's get started
Oh guys really the last one number one
how do you become more confident in
yourself I feel like you should be
confident um I feel like it kind of
comes with with age and what's to take
surpass a lot of things and realize yeah
certain things that you worry about are
important anymore like I know I worry
about stupid things but like so if I'm
wearing or how I look or whether or not
I'm wearing makeup isn't important
anymore to me it's just like I Know Who
I am and I know that I have friends who
love it's for me and it took a while to
get there because I mean you go through
bed friends and backstabbers and stuff
but when you finally find your group of
friends I feel like that's when you
become more half in yourself because
they accept and support you and then
you're just like I don't need to wear
makeup I don't need to wear heels like I
can be confident in whatever and be
happy with it so I think it does take a
little while I'm not just gonna be like
I'm confident but you start to love
yourself more when you get a good
support for everything that's key you
have to fake it till you make it all of
them in the video before so true it is
if you just pretend you're confident and
you a clear confident person then you
will become so true oh my god yeah
that's literally the best thing cuz if
you're gonna be like walking around
school like a shame then nothing's ever
gonna work out but if you're just like
okay like I'm the best then you
eventually be like girl I got this going
up what Madison said I think it's like
if you surround yourself with your
friends like if you have a confident
group of friends you're just gonna be
good on a more confident you feel like
try to kill yourself yeah
what's the most embarrassing thing
you've ever done in front of a guy oh my
gosh I'm the best one first time I met
my current boyfriend's parents I like
went to his house we only had dinner
itself it was super fun you know what
sue
nervous I was really nervous and so I
was like getting in my car was like oh
it's perfect it went perfectly is fine I
back out and I crashed into the
neighbors across the streets mailbox I
didn't know is the mailbox person
thought it was just like I knows a trash
can or something so I drove away and
then it's negative mom called me and
they're like oh what to do you go and
straighten it back out and they're like
well let you know if the neighbors never
let you know no okay it was fine the
footage left a little dent in my car I
was like wow what a great first
impression
he's got your car on that fire hydrant
and I've enjoyed month about right and I
would and I was like my rent was so
close to the driveway that their fire
had it's like nine miles away really no
it's like and I had somehow stretch the
entire side my car from which
firefighter like that yeah but that was
like maybe or something I'm not the guy
who probably I just helped make an exact
like that's awkward like just be like oh
like swapna be like oh my god like it's
embarrassing because that you break down
and I've done that in front of like a
few people where I'm just like I gotta
go for sayin I got to walk outside yeah
because I mean it's awkward I don't know
I don't know you're just like perfect so
how do you walk in heels fell on pay its
time good question I'm doing somebody
else's I think 13 hours street 13 hours
I mean I've been in them for butylene by
long but um I think once your feet just
become numb there's just no turning back
you got it no no um I read Manda's I
know I've won over heels I choose to
wear heels
yeah if I'm gonna choose to wear heels
that I have to choose all right - no
other team customized feet are gonna
hurt so bring band-aids and like if you
want to be fierce and wear the heels
then you just have to toughen up and
like beat up your Siva and where the
freaking heels like three minutes me
like no one must be around someone who
wears heels just to complain that their
feet hurt like I hate you or like like
not after like five hours but like after
an hour like we get skin to dinner like
you just kind of get used him after a
while like take I mean are you standing
for like 12 hours and don't wear heels
but like if you're
sitting standing singing like Christmas
parties will be like six hours or
whatever like that Christmas I wore
heels and I was sitting for a lot so if
you take breaks like yeah it's not I
don't think it's hard I don't know maybe
it's just me like I don't know I like I
like actions I met you like everyone
heals like like like for one of our
social it's me where he had like a
Christmas sweater party and he will
write in boots and I was right he's like
that was like the only one and like I
think um yeah yeah I mean I don't know
like it's just like oh my god is your to
wear a little like tight lipped body
contrasts and heels you're like you can
work my off but if you were like flats
it's like would yeah everything though
truce done so I made you work space so I
think that's about it it's just like I
feel like maybe you have to be like more
grown-up cuz like okay it's gonna be
wearing you guys for my good side but if
you're like 16 plus and she's good
you just if you want to wear the heels
they will not bother you yeah I mean
it's everybody taking time for me yeah I
guess you'd build abhorrence - yeah like
these ugly-ass toes they like I'm broken
like all my feets
all my toes all might be had like like I
don't know bitch like built up like
sorry like I danced so they're like a
hot-ass mess so I just throw heels I'm
all the time if you were like my bunions
and I'm like bitch way what would you
say the craziest thing that's happened
to you at college so far is I'd say go
into a frat and then laning up an yard
with Robert that'd be pretty bad yeah
yeah because literally it was before I
didn't want to go out I was like I don't
know why I don't to go out the in
everyone to go out I was going to go out
and then I was you were somewhere I
don't remember what the hell you were
you I was in my room because you already
Oh was that itís like you were dying I
think you ever yeah yeah I was gonna go
out and then I was like okay well like
I'm being convinced okay maybe I will
and it was I was finally convinced over
to go out and then he drops like this
for TMI football because he and I were
to the ER till 3:00 a.m. on a school
night and it's just like that only like
it would happen to me like I'm words
this would happen the first time I tried
to go out so nothing to happen to me but
it was just like that's great what is
happening yeah every night so much 7:00
to me so I go to Mizzou and
okay so our homecoming is like huge like
top in the country like people go all
outs and millions of dollars on
homecoming okay so I don't know I mean I
don't know what a pop board is it's like
if I was like 16
yeah but anyways okay so we make these
huge like wooden boards all right 10
feet tall and they're like over 100
pound son like you decorate them and
like make them on cute like sidewall
piece of paper yeah okay with little
pieces of paper and my glitter and stuff
you made by you guys yeah yeah okay yeah
and so oh my god okay so it was like up
on this scaffolding which I don't think

falling and it fell on me and broke my
ankle and literally I was walking around

pet name for you and I was not answering
it's like oh I think everyone has a soul
mate like one special person I don't
either
no like I base my answer outfit ups for
friends like monitoring they were like I
don't think you're my soul mate but I
think they we fell in love and like the
right time and now we want to live like
the rest of our life together I
like oh my god what does my guys mean
right now see and college lot of people
out there that you got grout with and
you could bomb up with potentially if
you like explode relationship with them
but there's a lot of people that you
would never be compatible with so it's
like if we have soul mates
