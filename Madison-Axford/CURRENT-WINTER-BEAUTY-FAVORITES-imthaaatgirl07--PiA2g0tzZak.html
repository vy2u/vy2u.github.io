beauty favorites its products that I
have currently been loving I just wanted
throw up a quick video to tell you about
them before I forget because I don't
really do favorites videos anymore I
don't think really anyone in the beauty
community does anymore I feel like
they've just kind of died out like tags
like they've kind of gone um so I'm
surely a current favorite for beauty
products to tell you things I've been
loving over the past I think months
month and a half I'm in a new background
this is the problem I cannot find a
background that I like if you couldn't
tell I'm from my windows my bed my corn
like my room corner by my desk this is
like my bookshelf area and I can't find
a place that I like like it's like like
like it's so hard to find a place in my
room especially cuz it's not really
right I hate these wall color I hate
this wall color it's like a brown tan
gray and I hate it it's not white so
therefore everything this looks kind of
dirty and dingy it just pisses me off so
i will have i will like to film videos a
lot more once i get my own apartment um
because the way I am now is not foaming
worthy at all so it's why thumb so much
at home but once i get like my new
apartment then hopefully everything will
be back to normal but the walls aren't
white okay it's just a lot of problems
going on but this is my bookshelf hello
welcome welcome to the bookshelf and
anyway it's a favorites video so let's
get started my first two favorites are
brushes from royal and langnickel i love
Romanichal brushes they're my favorite
brush Brandon Knight with the only ones
I'll really use except from one or two
from here and there a makeup geek Mac
out stuff like that but it's mainly
Berlin lay Nicole uh so these two in
particular are both their dirty is crab
if you can see that but I thought about
cleaning them i did and i wasn't you
lazy i have my stuff out and i was like
no I want to show people that actually
use these because people always show
like clean brushes and I'm like how do I
actually know that you're using those so
i want to show you that i use these
every single day in my life and I clean
them once a week and does probably not
enough oh well but yeah sunday is my day
to clean up but I thought I would feel
first um I love these two it I love
album but i love these two in particular
so i recently who's what was on them i
recently walked away from a beauty
blender for a little bit you know i love
them to death and tried it to apply my
foundation with a flat top kabuki brush
as you can see here i always did a
Beauty Blender and before that I use
this stippling brush so this was very
rare for me to do a flat top kabuki this
is the row and then nicole revolution
set b x 20 brush i love it it it applies
my foundation amazingly and i just
picked this up one day i was like let me
try this and i used in a tutorial i use
it all day every day now to apply my
liquid foundation and it just goes on so
beautifully and blend so wonderfully and
i love the beauty blender to dance but I
felt like I was missing a lot of spots
and there were less blotchiness with
that even though it usually is
seamlessly perfect this is my new son
love and I love to open a liquid
foundation it's like my favorite part
again um when i get to apply my liquid
foundation them it's so fun my second
brush is real and Nicole also from the
revelation said bx 45 if you can see
that it's just a nice fluffy brush that
it's small so it gets in perfectly to
blend powders in like the tight little
spots like around on your eyes eye
sockets in a corner stuff like that
places that are a little hard to often
reach with a beauty editor or any other
bigger brush and you wouldn't use an
eyeshadow brush so then this is next in
line i love love of this brush so much i
baked my face and powder almost every
day when i do if i wake up and then i'll
let it set for about 10 15 20 minutes
and then go in with this all around my
face not even just the little spots but
blend everything all the UM face powder
out with this brush so i have been
loving these two definite check them out
again this is the x 20 + bx 45 they work
wonderful you can use powders and
liquids for both of them doesn't matter
next I have a lipstick and this took me
a long time to get used to is the kat
von d lipstick lipstick in Lolita it's
not liquid lipstick I have both this is
the kat von d lips
dick and lowly died probably as my
foundation I'm sorry here let me swatch
it this is the color I currently have it
on I use Mac's lip liner in whirl and
then I apply this all over the lip first
of all it's just a matter for the
packaging for you see that's like a
rigid love it this color is a lot
different than liquid lipstick Lolita I
hate liquid lipstick Lolita and I feel
like that's so controversial to say it's
an amazing texture yes it's an amazing
this amazing that because I love Kat Von
D's beauty line with that color I don't
really understand why it's the number
one selling because I look so many other
liquid lipsticks from the kat von d line
before Jacqueline and that's always the
number one selling one I had to order a
flying so it wasn't even in stores ever
and I was like I got it and I was like I
don't like this color but i think i know
why i think it's my skin tones to pale
and i think people with more olive or
darker skin tones would be able to rock
that better so this is Lolita but it's
like a lighter more orangi reddish shade
and I dull it down this little powder
over top to mattify it and I really been
enjoying this I've run it like for the
past three to four days and I've one
before that but the past four days like
I've chosen this over mech angel so I'm
like okay I need to put this in a
favorite because i have been loving this
book recently next I have a house of
lashes lashes they've none none of these
are sponsored I don't know these people
really know who I am but I wish they did
the video tonight what are two guys
lashes all passive lashes I were to
Bambi which I have on right now and then
I have iconic and I am in love with
these lashes first of all they come so
nicely formed I don't even have to like
trim them or cut them to fit my I
perfectly and they're shaped to just
plop right on like with elf love them to
death but you have to kind of bend them
and like twist them in order to get a
light kind of eye shape because
otherwise it won't just go on it's like
a straight line then you're like
struggling for an hour gives a pendant
in order to fit it on like an eye curve
and these two come pre-curved I didn't
know that so they should pop right on
their amazing i love that their natural
looking and i guess the key thing for me
when I just put on I was like oh my god
I love these I love how dramatic they
are and i want to buy more they are a
bit expensive like Alfred dollar these
were 12 I think these were nine I
sure I might be wrong but I think that's
it but I actually love them and you can
get obviously of many more than just one
use out of them I was about a little
traveling case because I don't want to
lose them and I never really had a case
from ashes before so I got that also off
half lashes again they don't know who I
am but I adore this company and i'm so
excited or more lashes and i am just in
love with them like they're so natural
looking but they're so so dramatic next
is an oldie but a goodie too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer yes you can eat
this why would you I don't know um I
love NYC bronzers I love hoola bronzer I
love blow a lot all these other bronzers
but i keep going back to this one and i
finally know why cuz i never knew why i
liked it so much before it's because
it's the most natural looking bronzer
the other ones are great but they're a
little more orangi this one is like
brown like nude skin tone it blends so
seamlessly in and it kind of looks like
a cheekbone rather than I mean no runs
ever looks like a cheekbone but you know
that's what you try to create with this
like I'm you try to create this illusion
of a cheekbone with bronzer and this one
provides me with the most
natural-looking bronzer application
rather than the other ones I like the
other ones and the formulas but this one
is just amazing so definitely check out
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer the
original one and I have mine in medium I
think that's what they all come in I'm
not sure if there's different shades but
yes mines and medium deep matte bronzer
and it is math there's no sparkle in it
I just love it I don't don't find much
and like look how deep dark contour
strong that is that was with once whip
up a slanted kabuki brush like well and
yes I love to face broad search I think
my sister gave it to me for Christmas
I'm so glad I have it and you should you
guys should pick this up to and all this
stuff if you are looking for any of the
stuff or bronzer in particular my last
your beauty favorites have a month or
whatever have the next few months our
skin dinnae via setting sprays so this
is a makeup primer spray and this is a
makeup finishing spray but they're both
setting makeup setting sprays that you
apply before like I said an after your
makeup application Scandinavia in the
past pair it up with urban decay and
created all of their missed I think
there's three or four like all nighter
spray blah blah spray bulova but then I
don't figure because pair partnered with
Scandinavia
more but Scandinavia is the reason that
every case raise or so slick perfect and
amazing mac fix+ is great for wedding a
brush and applying glitter or foil
shadows and stuff like that and for you
know dampening your face but I always
sprayed fix+ after I've done my makeup
and mattified it and set it all and it
just made it a greasy slick mess again I
was confused on what I was doing wrong
it's because it wasn't a finishing
sprite so I have these stone this is the
makeup primer spray so you apply this to
24 times on before you apply any makeup
so I do like 12 before I apply my makeup
what you do first and then 2 times again
before I apply my face foundation and
powder concealer and everything because
I feel like my facebook so little dry
after I do the eye I just want to wet it
again and then the makeup finishing
spray really holds it all in place and
you apply this to four times um on your
makeup I'll do it right now because my
makeups finish so like this is literally
the third time I apply that today it
smells so fresh and clean but I love it
so do ii it just refreshes your skin
because it's like after a while even
melt the day my makeups already been on
for a while I'll still go up and spray a
little this on my face because it just
makes my skin feel so much like ah like
I can move it again and like it's not as
stiff so I hope you enjoyed this beauty
favorites current video if you have a
raise you want to subscribe to my
