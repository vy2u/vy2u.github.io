look like tag and I really wanted to do
this video because I kinda not recently
but just over the past you're having
compared numerous times to mckayla
maroney she's not necessarily a singer
or TV or movie celebrity but I think
she's a celebrity and a lot of others do
too so I thought I'd do this video
because I never thought I looked like
any celebrity before she went to the
Olympics and so I'm really excited to
this video a lot of people said that
looks like her like in real life but it
often happened on YouTube a lot and it
was in my iphone case collection I think
this because i had a button and I kept
doing face that kind of looks like her
like infamous mark and I didn't intend
to look like her or anything and I'm not
saying that I am her I look I heard
nothing but I've gotten comments I look
at her so don't take this the wrong way
I think she's beautiful and thank you
for the comment so let's get right to
the tags not very long but I really
wanted to do it question 1 who do you
get compared to mckayla maroney question
2 who are they and where they known for
and she went to the Olympics with the
Olympic team last year that one gold but
I swear watch all the Olympics the
gymnastics but she was a gymnast so yeah
um and she's like amazing with Paul and
stuff question 3 if you think its
complement or disgraced obviously its
complement she's really young and pretty
and I think she's my age actually and um
I know I think she's really pretty so it
is a compliment um when I wear my hair
in a bun and I complimented on someone
who's really pretty then that's nice
because I don't think I look good in
buns but I wear them a lot so question
for it what do you think about this
person I think she's very very cool
because she could hold her nerves down
and go to the freakin Olympics I just
think she's really cool out the way she
represent the United States in the
olympic games in 2012 and I don't know
I'm proud of her for winning first with
the group yeah um what I mean I'm not
like best friends with her so I don't
know hopefully she's nice should five do
you like their fashion sense well she
always wore every time I saw her she
wears like gymnastics outfits so i can't
really same thing so um this question I
answer was not applicable because I
don't really know um sure question 6
pick five fellow youtubers who you think
look like a celebrity uh was not
prepared oh my god oh my god oh my god
um obviously VT baby 44 it looks like um
bridgit mendler from your luck charlie I
think macbarbie 07 looks like kendall
Jenner I think hands down that's the CCO
looks like Raven Symone and I think
blonde said all for MJ kind of looks
like I'm even know like Pamela Anderson
or like Marilyn Monroe I think makeup
katie 95 kind of looks like jennette
mccurdy from icarly I don't know that's
just kind of I can really think of
