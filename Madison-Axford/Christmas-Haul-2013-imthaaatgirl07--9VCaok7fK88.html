don't want that oh yes heyo so you
couldn't tell by the title this is a
very exciting video because it's gonna
be my Christmas haul for 2013 and yeah I
know I didn't do a Black Friday haul and
I said I would and I said I would do it
cyber monday haul and I didn't and
that's because I literally got like two
things okay she thinks like on Black
Friday and like a few thinks on Cyber
Monday and then a lot of them got
canceled or like um they were
backordered and then they got canceled
so I like didn't get you in half of it
so I was like I'm not gonna do like a
two-minute haul it's kind of pointless
so I'll just wait to do my Christmas
haul and you know I I love Hull's I love
watching them and I don't do them often
because I don't buy like a lot of things
in one time I'll buy like when I make a
product here few weeks later another
makeup product and it's never enough to
do a haul or a collective haul or a
holiday halt you know so I never really
do a whole set off a comp below if you'd
like to see more hauls anyway before I
get on with this Christmas haul I okay
I'm gonna say the obvious I'm not doing
this video to brag obviously it's been
requested or I wouldn't be doing it I
didn't do a Black Friday haul you know
and I'm not trying to brag by this and I
just don't get those people that go on
there because I have seen it happen
they'll go on there should be like oh my
god you're only doing this to brag about
what you got like I could be doing a lot
of other videos right now but I'm just
need to do this video because I like to
see what people got I think it's
interesting fun cool and I hope that you
guys you know that especially the ones
that requested this video I want to see
it so without further ado let's get into
my Christmas haul
I'm so so over Duru thankful for
everything that I got I I again I'm like
flabbergasted every time Christmas comes
around my family just goes always above
and beyond and I love all of them and
I'm just showing you things from like my
immediate family so my mom dad and
sister so I'll just start out with what
my sister got me we like to just get
each other a few small things and it's
always really nice to see what we like
thought that each other but like you
know so the first thing she got me is a
color riche lip balm by L'Oreal because
she knows that I adore these adore these
and they're the only lipsticks that work
for your lips I love them and this is a
clue
I never tried before it's 118 pink satin
the latest color they have it's like the
lightest baby pink shade but I really
really have been enjoying it any color
by this is perfect and it's just amazing
I'm so glad she got me another one these
because I was out and I was out of my
sugar rubs day one so I'm really glad
that she got me a new color riche I love
these and thank you at McKenzie for that
and then she also got me the Britney
Jean CDs the new Britney Spears TV and I
I just I love this I really didn't want
this because I love Britney Spears and I
have like all her CDs and I really
really was looking forward to this one
and I was just gonna purchase it on
iTunes but no I have this so yes I'm
very excited so thank you Mackenzie love
you sissy okay I'm gonna start with the
clothing items that I got first thing I
got is a the choice you could sports bra
I'm not gonna like I didn't get this
just because it might be awkward but I
mean I don't think it is so if you think
it's weird to show a brawl at excellents
video but it's a pink yoga one so it's
for when I go to college next year and
workout and I just think it's amazing
like look at this print it's beautiful
it's literally looks like I don't know
like I don't even know like shimmery
lights or I don't know anyway it says
love pink on the max it is from
Victoria's Secret which is great you
can't really see it because it's all
metallic II but it says love pink
Detroit secret I love love love it I am
so so happy that I got this because I've
been wanting a sports bra that's like
really good and you know really durable
in it you can use for a really long time
and the Victoria Secret ones are amazing
so I finally have my own so yay next us
is also from a trade secret and it's one
of their spirit jerseys I am wearing a
southern shirt company sweet Jersey
right now I adore them and my mom dad
got me a love pink by Victoria's Secret
spiritually as well and when I first
opened it it was like this I was like
hot nice a sweatshirt and then I saw the
spirit jersey line it was like the
special line that goes across tit that's
when you know this one you know it's
good and so it just says love pink on
the back like spirit jersey and i adore
this it's super super duper cute and i'm
very very excited to wear it it's nice
and soft and super warm and I was very
happy when I opened those any last
clothing item that I got my parents
realized that I wear leggings everyday
like I'm wearing leggings right now
so they decided to splurge and get me
Lulu Lemon leggings that's right
Lululemon leggings and these are known
to be super uber uber extensive it's a
ridiculous house but so they are but
apparently they are amazing and the last
forever cuz on my favorite I'm one ones
get holes in them are super super like
thick durable materials so I'm hoping
these will last me like forever I mean
they're just really really soft and just
amazing I'm so glad that I got things I
would do not expect to get these any
that's for any of this stuff but I just
this was so unexpected oh yes I am ready
to use these quite a bit and if you saw
my um Christmas Day blog I have it
linked in the down bar you would know
that I got a new vlogging camera because
I want to do more vlogs soon and so I'm
really excited um that I got the power
shot just Canon 1080 HD and I'm vlogging
digital camera and I got an in pink of
course because Pink's my favorite color
so I'm definitely gonna be doing a lot
more vlogs I got a lot of positive
feedback on my um my summer vlogs that I
do it's like Mackenzie and stuff and
then my Christmas vlog is doing pretty
good too with feedback so I'm really
excited I love logs I love like having
you guys come with me along do this ride
called life and I'm just really excited
that I got this I did ask for this as my
big Maine presents the only thing I
wanted so yes I'm super excited I
thought that it so I can further pursue
my youtube career then my mom and dad
surprised me with this little house and
of course it's from lush it's adorable
and if you know me you know I love lush
and there's full-size products in this
like a door of a little Christmas house
thing so and there's a little flap that
tells you what's in there so there's a
full-size bush shower jelly a full-size
rocket um bubble bar at full size this
Bangor bath bomb and in full-sized
Northern Lights soap and that's
incredible this thing is so heavy and I
was like smells like lush even though it
says it right here but I didn't see the
little flappy thing it's so cute I'm so
excited and I do an updated like how to
use a bath film or something cuz that
video got a lot of views but I'm so
excited I got this and it's super duper
cute just like sitting on the tree like
a little too
little hats I was like oh what is that
so if you don't know I tweeted it and I
don't know if I've sent in a video but
my mom does work at Kate's face just for
fun like she doesn't need the job but
she just wanted to go back there and
because she works there it was a cake
Christmas for sure first I got this
little wallet thing and it's like a Kate
Spade like quilting wallet and this is
for when you have like little crossbody
bag purses and you don't know you know
you can't fit your whole wallet in it so
you put a few cars in there some cash in
the middle and it's just really really
cute and she has this so I was like oh
so that's a good idea that's so awesome
and then she got me one so yay for that
and then she got me this bling bling
bling clutch
it's very skinny but like look at just
look just take a moment for the sparkles
please it's like rainbow sparkle it's
like super date a New Year's
party just be like the BAM and I love
this it's incredible and I'm definitely
excited to use it and this would be
perfect to put in it with my money cuz
they're both flat and everything would
work out in the end then she got me this
keychain thing which I am already using
with my keys but it's super kids just
says case by New York and it just holds
your keys and I needed a new one because
mine was like Hello Kitty so I need a
new one is pink and I also got this
beautiful necklace which is has all
these little squares with like spades
cut out like all along the gold chain
and it's really really pretty and I'm in
love with it and then I got a crossbody
bag from Kate Spade and it says pop is
this not perfect because he's saying
phrase things are so in and it's just a
mess at the top and you can put little
things in it just the cutest thing ever
like it's like such a statement like
you'll be wearing an outfit and your bag
which is crossbody it's just like up I
am in love with this it's so funny it's
just it's great it's great the last
thing I got from Kate Spade was this
huge duffel bag which I love and on the
front it's yellow and white stripes and
it says break your resolution catch a
double feature run in tandem and learn
to ChaCha
I love thanks my mama says I love things
I have words on them like the pop like
that like this like I don't just like
plain things and so when things have
words all over them that makes them a
hundred times better it has a polka dot
inside and look how big this is it's
just general its general it has sparkles
in the bottom because the clutch thing
was in it
anyway and lastly this was totally
totally unexpected I had mentioned that
I wanted this like the day after
Christmas last year but then I was like
no I don't want that anymore that's no I
don't want that because I wanted the
camera you know so I can ask for two big
things find my mom and dad had to
surprise me to see Nicki Minaj beats by
dre pill the beats pill the pink speaker
I love Nicki Minaj a lot of people Jones
sorry I do but uh-huh

eating this on camera oh my gosh like

pretty freakin cool just thanks amazing
