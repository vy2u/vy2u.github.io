like now
James
God
feel like yeah
I'm
hang out so today I'm going to do a
really fun tag and I've seen a lot of
people doing it must be going around
because it's the closet confidential tag
and this looks really really cute and I
love talking about more things fashion
so I do tons and tons of beauty tags but
I've never really done like a fashion
taga may I probably have but I mean like
a straight fashion you know closet tag
um so there's only seven questions it's
really short and I'm just really excited
to do it so without further ado let's
get started the first question is what
is the oldest item in your wardrobe or
closet ever you want to call it I call
it my closet even though wardrobe does
sound a lot more chic the oldest thing
that I own is this victoria secret pink
tank top it's one of the really long
skinny ones I feel like all of their
clothes are really really really long
and skinny but um this I got in about
sixth grade I think me and my friend
Emily got the matching ones at the same
time but we had matching ones and it was
like the coolest thing ever um and it
just says perfect amazing you are
amazing secrets love love love pain
perfect amazing yeah yeah so anyway this
M you can like literally see the wear on
this shirt I wanted so so much I don't
really wear it anymore just because I
mean I like to try secret but I'm not
really into like these kind of like
little teacups anymore I don't really
know where I'd wear them besides at home
lounging around but you know I still
have it just for what I'm saying and it
is the oldest thing I have that still
fits me that is cute but I mean I really
where they won but I still have it in my
closet number two is what is the newest
item that you have and that is my j.crew
chip dress with a nice and be cut right
here um I wore this to my friend
Mackenzie's birthday dinner absolutely
love it um it's from j.crew factory
stores so if you looking forward to
j.crew store will not be there it's at
the factory store I wear size extra
small because things run really really
big it's usually if i'm a smaller medium
i would wear an extra small at j crew or
j.crew factory and so sorry there's a
little lint on it but it's just a shift
dress so it doesn't have any shape or
like form-fitting parts which I actually
really like
and it looks really cute with a nice
pair of tall heels and I absolutely love
this deep-sea it's a deep deep plunge so
if you're not ready to wear something
like this stay away from it but it's the
newest thing I have and I don't know I
thought it was really great price so I
picked it up and I absolutely love it
i've won it twice already number three
what is your most expensive item and
this is it really that expensive like
people on here have saline bags and
leave it on bags but mine are just some
necklaces and open to I don't know why I
just like one of them both to be in this
video the first necklace of the two is
the less expensive one but it was still
seventy dollars or eighty dollars did
you can't remember I can't remember but
anyway it is my Rose diamond-studded I'm
state my necklace from j.crew factoring
it's like a nice pink East Andy color
the roses are diamonds in the middle of
each one and there's only five roses
because it is a factory store necklace
it's not the Rose the studded rose one
from the j.crew regular stores so
doesn't have seven roses it has five
anyway I love it so much it goes
everything and I love wearing it all the
time is literally like my favorite thing
that I own ever and then the most
expensive thing that i own at this point
in time is my bubble necklace that i got
from etsy was 110 dollars they can get
similar ones at i'm michelle Bruce from
Charlie's and stuff like that I got it
in black so it was very first time to go
with everything and I adore this so much
i wear it a lot and i love the noise it
makes number four what is the cheapest
most affordable thing you have and this
isn't necessarily the cheapest thing i
have by any means but it is the most
affordable thing that I wear a lot and
that's another part of question it's
like that you have you know it's
something that you were a lot and um I
have a lot of cheap tank tops of stuff
like that but I don't necessarily wear
them all that much however I do wear
these luck I thought these were very
cheap for once they are and they are my
black high waisted jeans from refuge
refugee what um from the Charlotte the
Bruce brand and normally I don't like
Charlotte Russe pants cuz they don't fit
me very well but these are black
skinnies and I got in size your
00 and the fact the highways to make
them fit a lot better I love these so
much they're only 25 dollars i got them
when they denim was on the sale and i
got them in black because i prefer black
jeans to blue any day and I just really
really really love these I enjoy wearing
them tons and i think twenty twenty-five
dollars is really cheap verdad amor
jeans or whatever you want to call it
and it's like mess they're high-waisted
great jeans good I will get less crap
for wearing leggings yes you know these
were a really great Buy and i'm glad i
pick these up when there are twenty-five
dollars like that's not that much for
jeans you go get tons of use Adam and a
lot of benefits come along with them so
I'm very happy that I picked these up
and they may not be the cheapest thing i
have like I said but I do get like the
most you said I think number five what
was your biggest bargain and okay so i
wanted a wild Fox jumpers sweatshirt
something like that for a while now and
I finally got one um and I'm super happy
with it and I got a really great bargain
on it however this seems kind of like
sketch but I don't remember how much it
was I got it a while ago um I've never
really worn it in a video I don't think
or shown in a video but i did get it
like quite a while ago um so I don't
know how much it was but it was on sale
or discounted or whatever you want to
call it I can never like hood but I
would never buy a two-hundred-dollar
like shirt from wildfox so I wait till
they go on sale or you know I find other
ways to get them like eBay or something
like that and so this is my wildfox
little sweatshirt um pullover with a
lightning bolt on the front and if
that's not cute enough for you I don't
know it is it's this lovely pink color
and it's super super salt on the inside
you can see the material I really really
love this and it's super comfy has a
hood and it's just super nice and cozy
and warm and I love it and this is a
really great bargain considering its the
what pucks brand number 6 what is your
biggest waste of money and a lot of
people have like hundreds and hundreds
of dollars that they wasted on things
but mine's $30 it might not be a lot to
you but it is to me when you spend
thirty dollars on
freaking ugly sweater okay so i went to
new york in november i think it was a
last year 2013 and i wasn't finding
anything i was just so hot i went to
time square i didn't i didn't really
find anything to buy I don't they need
to buy something and splurge on
something that I definitely didn't need
is this supposed to be cute thirty
dollars it's yellow and black for
somebody to reminded me of like if
you're single it's like the opening
scene where Claire Claire share pics out
her clothes on that little computer
closet and it's like a yellow and black
plaid off and she picks out for some
reason i hope that looked like this but
now this is literally disgusting I hate
it I'll never wear it again I'm sorry
I'm sorry I hate wasting money I you eat
and they hate the return policy from
Thailand how you can't return stuff and
it's just so ugly but I can't do
anything about it took ages and the last
question is a bonus question is show us
your three favorite items right now so
my three favorite items right now are
kind of random then the first is
definitely not winter related but I had
you included because it's like my
favorite story shirt and it's this like
turquoise greenish and white chevron
little sheer on tank top with a bow in
the back I love this so much it's super
comfy and you just wait a little white
tank or banjo endhiran is perfect for
summer for concerts for hanging out with
friends I got it at rue21 and I just
really really like this shirt so I
thought I'd include something summer is
my next favorite item that I have right
now is my forever 21 mustache sweater my
favorite women never had this but then I
guess someone returned it um after like
Christmas or something and it was my
size I was just calling I just had to
get it and I love it so much has
mustaches all over it and I'm not a
mustache girl I hate mustache is
actually on guys and just like mustache
prints I'm not a huge fan I never got on
that mustache boss that everyone else
student like 2011 but I love this but
shirt sweater whatever want to call it
is more of a sweatshirt this is like a
pullover but i love the mustaches
there's literally literally larry and
sparkly and it's super comfy and I wear
this way too much and talking about
things I we're way too much tougher best
this one's my favorite is my white
pepper vest from gap and i love how gap
ones like cinch in the back right there
anyways beside the point I wear this way
too much at least once a week but I
literally love this thing to death I
just love this thing it goes over top
everything perfectly it I can wear with
everything and I just love it love with
love it it's literally my most prized
possession at this point of my life this
in my needed rose necklace from j.crew
literally the best things anyway I hope

really cute and really fun I loved even
