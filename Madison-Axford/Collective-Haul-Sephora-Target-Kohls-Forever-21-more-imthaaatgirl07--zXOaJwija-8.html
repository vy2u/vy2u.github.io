haul and I'm very excited to do this
obviously I didn't just give this in
like one or two days this has been like
I guess about two weeks am I knew I kind
of just did my Christmas haul and that
was kind of like very you know of a
large Hall I got a lot elaborate but um
this is stuff that I bought on my own I
do work so I make my own money I'm not
like ice my parents divides for me and
this is stuff that I either I needed or
I just fell in love with most I found
love with that it really need much of
this but um as you'll see but yeah this
is my hostel let's get started a feeling
it might be a tad on the longer side
first we'll start out with target and I
got one little thing here and it's this
little owl tea light holder and I just
love this so much this looks like it's
from urban outfitters or something it's
so modern and chic and very very like I
don't know me I just like love how this
looks and I'm in love with Alice also um
so yeah it's just white I just got a
little too late for my house I didn't
buy this or anything so I was just
looking like this um and then you put
that in the back and doesn't have a
smell obviously it's an unscented black
candle and you just light it and it kind
of puts light out through these holes in
the AL so I just absolutely love this it
was super cute and it I need some new
like decorations for my night stand over
there um so I needed this to spice up my
room I just love it then I want you
forever silent but I haven't worn it yet
first thing I have one coat and it's
just this beautiful ring it was on sale
for 199 and it just has its in a the
shape of a heart and it's like the
United Kingdom flag so just put on my
finger and I look super cute yes I got
that which I'll wear now and then the
only other thing i got is this really
really cute tank i had a gift card to
from toilet so i used to own these
things it's just this great like slouchy
tank with large cutouts in the arms it
just says wherefore art thou and I
really love it it's like so Shakespeare
obviously it was hiding a little not the
bottom when it was distorted and take it
out i certainly loved the writing it's
for the look majestical and you know
kind of old looking i really like it and
it's for everyone bits from the brand um
the h8 one thing I don't really know
what that is but yep that's the brand
hey whatz walmart today for really
really really really random crap first I
got this spider-man cop it was like 50
Cent's then I got the new peanut dark
chocolate
so there's our topic emptiness and
lastly for my job I had to get some
tread safe slip resistant footwear and I
know these aren't the cutest of shoes I
just got these playing back ones with
ties it kinda look like tennis shoes and
they were twenty-five dollars um I
needed them for work like I said foreign
yeah I mean they were on sale but what I
heard I needed a movie on to Bath and
Body Works and I only got one thing cuz
they had a gift card from like a long
long time ago and I've been wanting one
of these for my large three white candle
back there and it is a three-way candle
holder and this is what I got it's like
it's like a dark silver color and just
has this beautiful design on it if you
can see ya i really liked it and it'll
make my you know candle look more
fashionable alongside my owl and i went
to kohls and about like five billion
things from here not really but kind of
first thing i have on in it it is these
earrings these diamond ones out here
like swear pyramid things made out of
diamonds if you can see that it's from
the jennifer lopez brand so yeah it's by
the jennifer lopez brand if you can see
that they're eighteen dollars and it may
seem a little pricey but i think they're
um very good quality and I love Jennifer
Lopez's clothing in her accessories
stuff like that so I had to pick this up
then I found this oh my god I like
freaked out because I don't have one of
these and i'm absolutely in love with
dream catchers and I don't have one and
this one's very like native um in like
tribal ish and so this is just like I
don't know it kind of represents my
heritage new tribe and stuff and this
was nine dollars but whatever I
absolutely love this I'm going to put it
above my bed or on my wall or something
then I got this shirt which was thirty
four dollars from the princess vera wang
born to rule collection and I love your
Wang stuff that they have at um Cole's
is just so pretty I just love it so this
shirt I'm go ahead and size large but I
loved it so I had to get it um it's a
changeup obviously i wear with a black
cardigan or something it has this little
dog down here with a rose if you can see
that's like has blue ear and he's
dreaming of a shoe and i just think
that's so gorgeous it's like rhinestone
and i love this so yeah then i have this
shirt from mud I guess is that what it's
called it's kind of like a really old
brand and it was twenty four dollars and
it just says keep in touch and I need a
longer shirts like leggings and stuff
and I think this is very very pretty
icky in touch I just really
like it so yes long warm soft then like
I said before I love owls and this was
sixteen dollars and it's just this
jeweled owl necklace it's kind of tiny
but I love it his eyes are jewels and
he's all made out of diamonds and I just
love this so much it's so cute and the
last thing I got from kohls I've been in
a post I need so badly because like I've
said other videos my north face is like
don't fit me once huge one small and so
I got this nice ki kote which is just
black and it has buttons and I just want
them in love with it and it's just plain
like I said it's from the brand so uh
yeah I guess so i guess that's what's
called let's see it was sixty dollars a
little much i know but um like i don't
know i just i felt like i needed it i
had some extra money saved up for a nice
jacket and this what it kind of looks
like overview if you can see that has
nice hood is it's like light to carry um
and its really soft but it's like also
very warm so this is great and it
actually fits me holla that I don't have
a bag for this because I'm wearing both
the items of guy but I went to a local
booty first I got this necklace and it's
just golden like hangs and says love me
I thought this was super pretty and I
just like really like how big in like
goddian looks and this was five dollars
and the last thing i got was twenty
dollars does this gene ish them shirt
