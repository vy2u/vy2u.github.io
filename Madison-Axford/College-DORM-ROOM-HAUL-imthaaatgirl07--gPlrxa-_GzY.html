friend Aaron my eyes and we are doing a
back to school video it's like my first
one in my little series so I'm gonna be
doing and since we are going to be
freshmen in college I thought it would
be great to start this series because I
know a lot of you guys are going to
college as well as us we are doing a
college dorm room hall so it's all the
stuff that we've gotten so far this is
only like half my stuff so I might do a
part two video but yeah we get we gotta
love stuff especially me not really or
not really me I am so behind
she's like stressing me out a whole my
mom helps me get all this stuff she like
got in this box she's like okay miss and
you're all ready and I was like wow I
don't really need to get anything so I'm
going to be showing you all the
toiletries that I have for college in my
college dorm room um in this video just
because I have way too much stuff to
show you all in one video and yeah we're
not roomies but and I know we're gonna
see each other but we're gonna see each
other and I had to do this video with
her so without further ado let's get
started so the first thing that I have
for my college dorm are q-tips and my
mom got me totally stocked oh don't you
- yeah yeah so I bought an umbrella with
Madison actually and it's really cute
it's like got pink hearts all over it
and stuff and I got at H&amp;amp;M and I saw it
and I was like I'm gonna buy this on
relic like what you need one for school
on your lap so I bought it
you're walking around campus you don't
let me get drenched the next thing I
have isn't obvious it's tampons yeah
you've got to have whatever you use
whether they're de penser tampons when
you're going away when you're living by
yourself because you don't want to be
caught without them so it's a definite
month so next thing I have is my shower
basket that my mom got and I haven't
even taken off the times yeah but well
I've got it for me and it is filled with
my graduation present for my
cousin who works at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so
I got a ton of Bath &amp;amp; Body Works stuff
this is this is glitter spray obviously
really gonna need that but I have like a
lotion and stuff in here I have like
that air freshener times that's about it
I have like this like foot file or I
don't know I don't even have a shoot -
or anything guys oh my gosh okay so next
I have all the stuff that I'm gonna need
four of my shower first I have my two
shampoos they're huge so hopefully this
will last me for the first semester or
both semesters I don't know but I have
my shampoo and then I have my two huge
bottles of conditioner that's just by
Tresemme and you got to have that as
well then I have three at large caresse
body washes we go seriously smelling
good I like ten of everything okay then
I have this golden sugar scrub from Beth
my t-rex
amber fresh scent don't know why I'll
leave that but okay then I have to face
washes these are my favorite these
horses really my gosh they make your
face smell like the great yeah they make
your face melt like grapefruit it's so
good and they work really well too
Neutrogena is my favorite face brand so
yes they have two shaving creams or so
you're so pretty nice skin that I have
for ninja Tina basically because I wear
a lot of makeup and have to remove it
every day so I have four these which is
25 in a pack so I have set for a hundred
days yes then I have ten razors pack of
ten razors a loofah I'm in my contact
solution because I wear contacts and we
gotta keep them moist and fascinating
isn't it so I got it um no I have
another thing okay
oh where did it go I think I left it at
my house
no I think
some of the stuff there it was like the
song okay so it was like these like
wires so you can like wrap around your
bed and you can pin little pictures on
yeah it was really cute I mom also got
me this this is a magnetic memo board
that comes with these they're kind of
ugly but they're swirly magnets I'm
gonna put pictures all over it
next I have two toothpastes the sequest
3d white but when I use I have neosporin
it's the Walmart grandia Soren because
if we get a boo-boo we want to make sure
it's clean my mom gonna be mostly all
this stuff I got these though these are
some hair ties because I run out a Stoke
with me I leave everywhere and they
break and I'm running out of them at
home so I got two packs events for
college that I got some deodorant this
is the secret gel kind I have a mini
first aid kit really like a sewing kit -
oh it has bian aids God and cleansing
wipes in this durable plastic kicks oh
my gosh I told my mom about your pink
pepper spray right and she's getting me
something I'm like yes we're gonna have
matching peppers yeah you've got to have
your pepper spray I have pepper spray on
my keys because we never came up to your
car and stuff at night whether it be at
home at college at work wherever you are
you need to have pepper spray make sure
you guys are safe and the last thing I
have are these medications which is a
headache and I have the Walmart brand of
mighdal we dealt with this crap those
are the toiletries that I have for
college so far um I don't really know
what else I'll have to get but I'll be
sure to it will help you guys and show
you later I'm gonna get more stuff for
college so her best thing yeah I'll see
well first notice how you guys but my
mom is buying me and my roommate these
like packs of nail polish and it paints
on clear but if you stir your drink with
your finger nail it well um if there's a
date-rape drug in it it will react with
the drug and I'll turn your nail polish
red so keep us safe at uh those frat
parties yeah be careful so what I mostly
spent all my money on
for a college is my longboard I just got
