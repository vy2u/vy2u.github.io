the rainbow attached means that each
color of the rainbow which if you
remember from grade school is roy g biv
red orange yet what red orange yellow
green blue and gold violet and then the
carson rambo tag added something extra
and they added multi-coloured thing like
thing at the end however indigo and
violet are you freaking off know what I
can i couldnt find i think that so my
colors are a little in not really indigo
violet but you know they kind of they
work they work they work so even though
they may not be perfectly indigo and
violet we're gonna go with it pretend
they're undergoing violet so first we
have obviously read and stuff for my red
product I'm actually wearing right now
it's on my lips and even though this
color oh my gosh it looks like a mac
lipstick or something it's from elf from
target and it's just a matte lip color
you can see this and it's in the shade
rich red ok I mean I love it because
it's really mad and it doesn't crease
which is amazing it was three dollars
and this is the beautiful color tints
like a pencil oh so you can easily draw
in points and fill in your lips it could
be lip liner can do multiple amount of
things and I am absolutely in love with
it seriously under five dollars and it
takes on forever I just ate and drank
with this and it stayed on I didn't have
to reapply it I really really really
love this you should definitely check it
out it's more of an exclusive elf
product so your target may or may not
have it because it's not just like an
eyeshadow or a brush it's something like
really really you know legit and special
so your target may or may not have it
hopefully it does you should definitely
check it out if it does extra orange now
that you may not think this is
necessarily lunch but I think it is and
it's obviously bronze Brewster which is
the greatest products ever I hit Payton
the other day which is really sad but I
do feel that this is an orange color
bronze booster by physicians formula is
hands-down most amazing not just bronzer
but product I've ever tried it blends
seamlessly just make you orange it
doesn't make you look streaky or crazy
um it's really nice and makes it look
natural like a natural glow and tan on
your face I absolutely love everything
about it and I'll definitely definitely
there's no doubt in the world that I
have I will be repurchasing this win
it is completely gone and I have scraped
out all the edges because i'm going to
use every little last bit of this i love
it to death and i take it everywhere
that i go you know you made run sister
then for yellow another favorite of mine
is benefits lemonade on this porch for
boy because it's working yellow like
lemonade and this is supposed to be like
look how much I've hit pan on that like
this kind of that looks kind of gross
but this is supposed to be an eyelid
correcting primer Sophia veins that
stick out and I shows don't necessarily
hide it you can put this on before and I
showed a primer our baser and eye shadow
just to cover up any veins that may
stick out or cause discoloration like
purple or brown and whatever me out red
whatever your bank or maybe and um if I
got it over with him here oh well um but
the thing that I love about this is I
use as an under-eye concealer and it
works just the same it covers up dark
circles and any light discoloration I do
have under my eyes and I really love
this it also covers up zits in redness
and white you know pimples you might
have and I really really really love
this product I was only twenty dollars
was just pretty cheap for a benefit
high-end support product and i
absolutely love us it had to include it
next from roy g biv we go into the Jeep
art and I have my Maybelline cover stick
corrector concealer in the shade of
green um they have to shade green yellow
purple in and I think skin color and i
went with green just because i want to
try something new and different and see
if it did anything you know better than
just a skin tone cuz you ever do and
this is just kind of like the lemonade
because it's a correcting concealer and
so it gets rid of any you know
discoloration or dark circles under your
eyes and it's not just like a concealer
to cover up zits or something it does
more than just cover up blemishes it
covers up all the discoloration and
hyperpigmentation which i absolutely
love because i have a lot of and i'm
just i'm in love with this product I use
it a lot it looks kind of nasty this is
really good if you have dark dark
circles on your eyes or it lines and
wrinkles on your face that you want to
try to attempt to cover and conceal next
we go on to blue and this isn't
necessarily my favorite out of this
brand but it was the color blue so I
used it and basically it's just new
Jeana facial wipes to get your makeup
off at night these are the hydrating
cleansing towelettes and it was the blue
package that i had so i use this I think
I've one left but I mean I love everyone
I love the purple night calming one I
love the original blue one I love
the teal one and I just absolutely love
any Neutrogena product for the face that
cleanser toner that makeup remover I
makeup remover the clubs and face wipes
every single thing that Neutrogena puts
out bye-bye I love it to death they're
one of my favorite absolute favorite
brands they do so much good for your
skin and they have cells so the acid in
them and stuff from your you notice it's
inflammation so they're cleansing
toilets are the greatest ones i found
I've tried so many I tried ones from the
target up and up brand I've tried
supporters brand I've tried an
elf-friend I've tried the simple brand
and these are the ones that I found that
I love the most so definitely had to
include these Nexus indigo if you know
indigo is kind of like a purpley blue
dark midnight color but I couldn't find
one single product but instead I decided
to include great lash lots of lashes
mascara thats pink and green because
this is the hands-down greatest mr. I've
ever tried in I continue to repurchase
this over and over again I absolutely
love it it's the UM lots of lashes
version not the original great lash and
it's the comb brush I I've had this in
so many videos it's just amazing you and
I use an extra large CIL's booster
eyelash primer by Lancome before even on
my mascara but you definitely do not
with this mascara it lengthens it
separates it darkens it does everything
you want it volumizes I'm freaking love
this mascara everyone on YouTube looks
less Oscar I'd definitely definitely
check it out if you have not is four
dollars from Maybelline for violet again
I couldn't really find anything close to
it but I do have my Tarte Amazonian clay
um lip stain and this is in the shade
playful I picked this up because I saw
beautybaby 44 had it and it doesn't come
up much product which is disappointing
because when I rolled it up it's like
this ginormous Lee long tube and this is
how much products and I've only used it
about a handful of times because it is a
really bold color and um I know I have
to lip stains and lip colors in this
video but i'm not a huge lipstick girl
however i found this one in the elfin
that i really love and they stay on
forever this is like a 24-hour lip stain
it's part of the Amazonian clay line so
you know it's going to give good color
and stay on forever and I really like
this color it looks like really light
pink like a baby pink almost but it's
actually really really dark plum so I
wouldn't necessarily recommend you
getting this particular shape for the
summer and spring but um is a nice dark
shape for the plumbing full days you
know and so I decide to include
so I couldn't find anything for violet
and I remember just absolutely loving
this and I hadn't might have ever
favorites so I'm done with the colors of
the rainbow but like I said in this tag
the multi color section was added so I
have two things the first thing isn't
necessarily multi color but it's
Neutrogena skin clearing oil free makeup
and this is my third or fourth bottle of
it it's love a 99 which is a little bit
on the pricey side for foundation but
then again I could be getting stuff at
sephora through this you know isn't that
expensive and it's the greatest addition
I've ever found it gives me a nice like
tan kind of tint even though it is the
lightest shade in 10 classic ivory that
making me orange and crazy and I just
love this it has salicylic acid in it to
you know get rid of blemishes and zits
and anything you may have in your skin
and I just love everything about this
it's small bottle which I go through it
pretty fast I would recommend this so
much it's better than any of you Gina
foundation is better than any foundation
I found except for a few you know in
like Sephora and stuff like that but I
freaking love this more than any other
drug store brand um foundation and you I
should definitely check it out because
it treats your zits and it helps get rid
of them and fight them while giving
great coverage and its earthly laughs
forever does not come off easily a very
less product is continuing on with the
multicolored um section and excuses
absolute disgusting that I got it for
Christmas it's been ever decay naked
palette you can see I've got some grunge
on it and right there but okay i have
used pallet for so many different looks
as you can see I've hit pan on the color
sin and I also use these colors to
follow my eyebrows to give great you
know definition of my creases you can
use the black to line your eyeliner that
you put on and I just love all these
colors I love how natural they are yet
they're really bold and sparkly you can
use them as a fun night out or just a
natural school look this is definitely
better than that Naked 2 palette I think
and I prefer this one over the other one
but you know everyone has their own
opinions I love this and I had to
include it it's yes six fifty dollars
seriously you never have to buy like
another single eyeshadow because unless
you use a look one lot like I you sinned
a lot and I hit pan quite a bit on it
but seriously you could use these a lot
before hitting pan like that like every
day of school second semester so so if
you want to splurge a little get a
high-end product and these are great
they also go great with Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer those two together are
the greatest combination
for eyeshadows and they stay on forever
twenty-four thousand hours here's some
people so that was my colors the rainbow
tag was really fun i was really looking
forward to this because i love bright
colors and i love just finding products
that i can fit into these different
color categories so thank you for
