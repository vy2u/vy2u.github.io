doing the confessions of a beauty guru
tag and John this tie just looks super
fun and since I'm new to this beauty
guru community I thought I would do it
of course and so my computer is over
there so I'm looking there you know what
I'm looking at so let's get started
question one how many hours a week do
you spend editing and filming your
videos now typically I film every other
day of the week or when I have time and
like it takes me to 24 hours each time I
do it so i'd say probably like nine to
12 hours depending on if i have a lot of
homework if I my job to go to blah blah
blah blah like that's what it depends on
so yeah usually I'm 9 to 12 hours max a
week but there's not like a moment where
I go you gotta go filming like no I love
it it's such great Oasis and I get away
Shinto are you a spender or her saver
I'm typically a spender just because I'm
a Shopaholic I love shopping buy stuff
but I really want to become a saver
because I want to save up for an
apartment so yeah um I say that I'm a
spender going to become a saber question
thingy what is the easiest for you to
film it's never hard for me to film so
whenever I usually film in like the mid
afternoon like around like forward a six
ish this one I film and then I edit all
night long um I love to do it so it's
never like a so like I said should for
what makes talking in front of me I'm
camera comfortable to you well I've
always loved acting and stuff like that
so it never was a problem for me I
wasn't shy or quieter I wasn't like I
medicine like no like I'm open I'm going
I'm loud in them a lot of people don't
like my personality but that's what
makes it easy for me to talk I just kind
of look in the film and I'm like Bosch
or yeah question 5 is the worst what's
your worst makeup and hair habit my
worst makeup habit is probably that um i
put x ms qur'an and then I curl my
lashes afterwards and I heard that
breaks off your lashes or something um I
don't think it's bad you know because I
like doing it makes them look longer and
like lucious or whatever and people like
that breaks off your lashes if you put
on that that mascara like you curl them
and i'm like sorry and then my worst
hair habits probably i do straighten my
hair a lot and don't use a heating
protectant spray
into each other in the hope in the
circle name number 61 quote that you
wish the world would Lou invite and this
was so easy for me indus by Mark Twain I
love him and it says get your faxed Bert
get your facts first and then you can
distort them people think they know
things about me and then they just make
up stuff and they change the truth and
it's like no the back question 7 how
long do you spend getting ready every
day and usually I'll straighten my hair
but now I'm kind of not doing that as
much anymore because I know it's bad for
your hair so I'd say I'm 20 minutes max
I'm pretty fast like I'm not that slow
anymore you are you still like do it
full I shadow now just like no let's go
question 8 your favorite video here on
YouTube obviously it has to be um pogos
bloom it's this Disney video where I
guess I think it's a boy I'm pretty sure
girl I don't know thanks boy where he
uses all these like syllables and sounds
from random disney movies lets them
together to make this like amazing song
definitely check that was the greatest
long ever created wow that link to the
down bar and just host check it out cuz
it's like my fav IDEO ever on YouTube it
has over three million views obviously
few million of them are mine Stan push a
9 a youtuber that you watch who deserves
more views subscribers than they have
obviously that is my best friend on
YouTube call me Jada she has definitely
worked her way up through hard work and
effort and she's so funny and sweet and
you should definitely check her out also
have her linked in the down bar on a
thangka number 10 one thing you're
excited about in the upcoming year 2013
probably just a fresh new start never
love in your most Awkward filming moment
um probably that awkward moment went
like my personality like I said it's
very loud um I do not try to be funny on
purpose like I'm not like okay this
video I'm gonna be funny 6 times go like
no like I come across I'm kind of like
just like bubbly and outgoing and stuff
and some people think is funny and I'm
like okay thanks um but when people
think I'm like trying to be funny and
I'm not that just kind of awkward like I
don't want to be mean to them but it's
like I'm not trying to be funny all the
time and they criticize me for it so
it's like I'm not trying to be funny and
they're like you're not funny in ox okay
okay okay never 12 how long does it take
you to prep for a video usually 30 to 45
minutes I usually do it when I get home
from school or my job for 13 are you
wearing pants jeans skirt right now are
you actually wearing pajama bottoms look
at that so you ready piss look at that
does it for my homecoming shoes me feel
like scarred over all those scabs anyway
I'm wearing leggings if you couldn't see
them show you blah so can see that by
swearing wearing black leggings and
number 14 the last question what are you
most proud of in your life um probably
the fact that I've grown so much I've
got my own job I'm like banking account
my own YouTube channel um I just I
really come a long way and I'm very
proud of myself for doing you know all
