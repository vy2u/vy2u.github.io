Q&amp;amp;A is that what we're doing i think so
i asked you guys I think a week or two
ago it's only me questions in my
Instagram what TV shows are you
currently watching on Netflix right now
i'm actually watching how i met your
mother it took me a long time to get
there because i'm such a friends person
but I always just chose watch friends
over the pad and like my sister watch
how i met your mother and all these
people were like trying to commence me
to watch as well i finally decided watch
it and i really do like it I like it a
lot so I'm on season two right now and I
don't know I really enjoy it where do
you imagine yourself living in 10 years
Wow oh man I really thought too far into
the future like more than like a year so
10 years I would be 29 I'm thinking hmm
i don't like the west coast too much
I've never spent in a shocking amount of
time over there or over there on that
site of the United States so I probably
either still be living in Missouri or I
would be living in like Florida I think
that would be really fun it's just a
nice it's a nice place um New York's
really crowded kind of scary I used to
want to do that like thing that's going
on like um Cape Cod though like
someplace like that like some ways with
a beach but I probably took a bit and
then quickly move back to here do you
prefer christmas or new year's Christmas
oh my god not even because christmas is
an amazing holiday um but like new years
is just a let down every single year
like I'm like this year I'm gonna go to
partying get amazing news you've kiss
and about a bit of a and late every year
it's like what should I love doing this
I love any Chinese food my family but
I'm like is a way like are there big
parties like two things happened like
what probably just my sad life and when
is there couple and then I'm just like
well I'm gonna have to watch our minds
so if you could go back to high school
and relive one moment what would it be
oh um I guess senior homecoming with
Jeff who I went with I don't really
remember it I think it's because prom
was such a bad experience for me but
that kinda should go over senior year
and then I was like what was homecoming
again but I just remember having the
greatest time like laughing so much just
living it up with Jeff
and I don't really just miss him
favorite holiday song move it was my
favorite like Christmas song um I know
that's okay oh holy night the stars are
brightly shining it is an eye of a do
you save his food long lay the world in
turn and never
timing to ear peed in the sauce and it's
worth a thrill of hope a weary world
rejoices for yonder breaks a new low yes
more I'm not getting our song but I love
love love love that song um people can
ask me how like pasty positive and stop
being depressed I have never dealt with
depression so I cannot answer that um
for sexual reasons I don't know I've
never had a fresher so I can't say how
to deal with Hicks I am filled with it
I'm anxiety is totally different um and
there's different symptoms signs and
like wasted to go with it so I'm sorry I
can't answer depression questions though
whose last person you texted and what
did it say who it was my mom and I sent
her fat ? she did respond explain the
story of you and Jeff to all the new
fans guys think your fans I think of my
friends but if you don't know Jeff is my
best friend we've been best friends for
five years we met trash from your
biology as a freshman year he didn't
like me then he liked me sophomore year
at in like ham we both did different
people we never have dated we had a lot
of fights when I realized how important
we are to each other we want to senior
homecoming together India he's on his
Mormon mission now that's a Jeff story
do you like one sees I loved one sees I
love my one piece from onepiece com I'll
have a link in the description bar I'm
not sponsored by them they do not know I
exist but I literally live mine and
sleep in line every day I mean I wash it
obviously but like oh my god mr.
comfiest most coziest most perfect thing
and mines in pink and I love it and one
pieces from Norway and I'm from Norway

kissed so I hope you enjoyed my December
