and today I need to go to Trader Joe's
and I think that's it
yes so today this is just a shirt that I
wore on Christmas actually but it's from
JCPenney like random right but so cute
and then these are my high-waisted show
truth jeans I can think of what these
were there's buzz on them so yes I just
pick out shoes and then I am good to go
I did my makeup I put a little eye
shadow on today just to balance out the
yeah that guy the rest I makeup um but
yeah I just need to go get some
groceries okay I just put my shoes on I
just ended up going with these vintage
wedges from my mom she said wear them
and she was like my age or no a bit
older but they just wrap up your heel so
I rolled it in cups at my jeans I think
they look really cute in summary their
little summer flare to this outfit but
yes so I'm about to leave so let's go
okay so I just tried a Trader Joe's so
I'm gonna go in I don't know if there's
a lot of people here so I'll try to vlog
is much like handbag might be a little
awkward so I will do a hollow when I get
back but yes let's go
hey guys so I just got out of Trader
Joe's I hope you enjoyed like the two
seconds of footage I got it was hard to
do except tell the workers were like
like you could tell the sign was up and
they're really confused okay there's my
bags okay first thing I got are these
enterpise I have about these before I
love them
there's like crunchy little like dried
peas snaps they're amazing I definitely
recommend them they're so cheap I love
them so much then I got something that I
don't really like popcorn at all but I
want to try the bacon desktop Corinth
it's like way to the popcorn with a
bacon seasoning on it so I know that's
kind of cool
hopefully it tastes good bacon it's cute
again Cheerios is a lot cheaper than I
thought was gonna be it's not cheaper
than buying like a bag of chips or
something from a grocery store normally
like this is literally like a doll or
something then I got I just grabbed a
bottle of water this is on a dollar and
it was huge and it's like alkaline water
with electrolytes like they probably
taste the same as water but I just
wanted to have a water and this one's
cute so I just picked this up because I
always like to have a water with me and
it didn't have one today so fix that big
water up then I got these sour gummies
lemon grapefruit and lime tangerine so
they look good
I love sour candy I used to I go on and
off with that actually as I sometimes I
love it sometimes I hate it um yeah
these were again cheap and I just picked
them up and the last thing I got is
saying that I'm a little like about but
I hope it's good it's chicken and
vegetable wonton soup now like I saw a
lot of people eating this on YouTube and
stuff so I'm hoping it's good I'm kind
of scared it's not going to be okay
we're gonna try that when I get hold on
a little bit yeah hey guys okay so we're
back now from door I'm back now from
Trader Joe's we're going to try the few
things like I like not the water at the
suit like the other snack things and
she's gonna help me it this way sort of
properly bacon flavoring
it's really good he's weird
she's like begging weird is like bacon
fat dude I didn't like it oh I was just
a little more white cheddar though I
always eat these so I know that I love
these in your piece you ready okay so my
soup is almost done
it's Trader Joe's wonton soup this one
there is hope it's good I don't want to
waste it oh yeah okay so leave it sit
here for a minute oh my god have you
ever had one good I was a fail I'm
making revenues now and then I'll eat
ramen noodles is it just me
let's move it up um the one time soon
just chillin over there me my sister has
tried like a Spence on the broth and it
was just like really gross so we were
like not today so
yeah it was just really sweet I'm gonna
go the salon first I'm just going me off
and you not like it um so yeah if I have
like five and a half six minutes oh I
got no I cooked a long enough but like
it had the thoughts right and put in
there for a little longer to thaw that
Mike Whibley
just go ahead so make revenue is now
cooking the nests in I've never actually
made my own ramen noodles so it's time
to grow up and make my own put two cups
of water in the stove waiting for it to
boil and I'm breaking up my little ramen
noodles come on break
so let's see this could either be good
or a disaster I needed to grow up or
fail to the head
my mama I just makes her my nose I
didn't make them in college
honey a big girl might can't yell Rome
knows for this water boil a watched pot
never boils
must be steaming before boils is that a
thing I'm like so so paranoid
okay come on thing she's gonna eat all
these noodles were you ready
I think we're ready we're steaming or
bubbling yeah I'm a big girl now I'm a
big girl now
oh my god so much steaming too much
doing this let's begin 12 minutes to
steam that water that's good I was in a
rush
water break
okay not too big chunk of big chunk
okay I'm so proud
who does anyone just put the huge block
of ramen noodles in here cuz every memo
so those I wouldn't fit that well if
you're lucky I'm on time to tell you
what I did wrong
