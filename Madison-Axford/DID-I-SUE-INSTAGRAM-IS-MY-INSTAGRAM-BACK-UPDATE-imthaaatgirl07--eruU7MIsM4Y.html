uh yeah okay um if you didn't know you
haven't watched the previous video it's
I got made for Instagram I woke up five
days ago or six days ago I remember now
but my screams totally gone it it was it
didn't exist so everyone's like oh that
says using just not exist for your name
what are you what happened and and I
didn't know and everyone keeps everyone
kept and keeps asking me if I sued
Instagram no like there would be nothing
to sue for it I mean yeah they didn't a
bad thing
I just leave my account for no reason
but nothing legal worthy no no no so if
you wanted to know the answer no I
didn't sue Instagram I remember things
that I did though I don't know what I
would have against them though to sue
them for um you can watch my own video
I'll keep it up I'm a hot-ass mess in it
my lashes are up to here and so was my
level of anger oh my god I was pissed
off pissed off you can watch it it's
kind of a laugh now that I have it my
account back um I got smashed maxford it
forever and always will be unless it
gets deleted again and maybe is one egg
Sephora D if you wonder why it's gonna
happen to you old account I debated
whether or not I want to keep the newer
to the old one and and I think I'm gonna
keep my original account just because it
was the original one I love my name
which is just my name um and this new
one which comes thrown together as
something to do while I waited and to
find out was gonna have my old account
so I am keeping my old one and the other
one I don't know if I'm gonna keep it
yet um that is an account but just as
the backup needs his happens again or if
I'm gonna delete it I don't know yet
um when I heard that I got my account
back actually my friend Audrey texted me
she's first person that noticed and I
didn't know I was on Instagram I was
like getting rich to videos and I wasn't
excited I guess you could say I was like
I can't I had been dealing with my
account being taken away from me for the
past five days emailing contacting and
every way shape and form possible
Instagram to try to get my account
back over the course of five days yeah
it's not that long but like room in New
Year's I was pissed off about it and and
they never got back to me and so it was
a little not a little a lot annoying and
aggravating and unprofessional because I
was waiting for them to get back to me
and I do thank you Instagram forgiving
me account back my account back I will
say that but I was not hacked I thought
it was and my account was not getting
down because of the baby picture
everyone commented that oh your account
code shaking down because of the baby
picture that showed your Butchie that's
not why I might have got taken down I
finally did get in contact with
Instagram and that's not why so if you
think that's why by it wasn't and and I
know that it can be a big deal like
child pornography and stuff like that
but that picture was of me and I didn't
see anything wrong with it and if you
did I'm sorry I have personally taken it
off my Instagram because of so many
complaints I got for it but contacting
the Instagram that is not when my
account was hanging down
my account was taking down because of a
glitch because it was going through and
deleting before the new year many robot
accounts what I assumed happened many
bad accounts that had been active or
were spam or fake and mine got tangled
in with that and was taking down and it
was so aggravating to have my account
just taken away from me um for no reason
and I was just confused because I was
given no reason or explanation but yeah
so I might come back it was a long
deliberation with my team of what I want
to do which I can't have I to keep but I
will be keeping the old accountant as
Max right so if you're not running it
please go follow me on that I will be
posting a lot of pictures that is my
account my old pictures will be on there
but I will be going through and just
clearing it out a little bit to get rid
of any maybe for two personal pictures
um so no one gets butthurt again yeah so
mess x4 this is my account now thank you
to everyone who followed massive dealer
expert I can Instagram I how I get into
a little over 5,000 followers on that
account in five days so thank you so so
much for that I want to be diminishing
my following account like I will not be
following I could lighten my old account
because they do not give a crap to come
to menu account but the people that did
that you so much like people that I know
or people that have know me through
YouTube either way thank you so much it
meant a lot to me to see all the support
that I got and the overwhelming love I
got from most of you some people were
like it's the bank it's the bad picture
oh my god you don't need to describe is
just Instagram so you know if you buy
two people who were supportive thank you
I know it's just Instagram but it this
is my job so thank you so much for
supporting me and please please please
go follow the account which is Madison
Axford me I'm the one and only okay but
thank you so much like I can't even
thank you enough for it just tweeting
histogram and all this stuff to get my
comp back I really think that if I was
just a just a person without a youtube
account I don't think I would've got it
back but because I have the overwhelming
support from you guys I did get it back
thank you everyone who did go through
new accountant follow me but come back
to my old account and follow me if you
don't already follow that one um and yes
thank you for the support along the way
mr. greenback I I'm happy about it I
wasn't super happy about it though as I
thought I wouldn't be because it
should've been taking down the first
place but you know it's over it's done
with and I am back bitches so thank you
