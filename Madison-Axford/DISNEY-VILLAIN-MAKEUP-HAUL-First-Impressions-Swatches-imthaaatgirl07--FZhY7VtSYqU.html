different video I usually don't do first
first opinions that was clogged know
what I don't know um okay literally I
just didn't even think about what this
video was I just started the video um
but it's like I'm trying things for the
first time first impressions die you
idiot Madison and it's kind of a haul of
new products that I bought and I'm very
excited it's only villain themed if you
don't know what kraines has all these
Disney themed makeup lines that are
through the company Wet n Wild and they
have like Little Mermaid Beauty the
Beast like Ariel Belle Cinderella
Jasmine and I think that was it and I
have like the Jasmine Aladdin makeup
case thing I got it a while ago like
about a year ago I think but I went in
twelve minutes a few days ago and I saw
they had a villain Wet n Wild Disney
make slime and my walgreens had been
like ransacked that goes nothing really
left from this line but I salvaged and
bought anything I could find or um yeah
really find from this line because it
was all gone and I purchase everything
that I could find I'm really excited to
share with you what I got and we can try
out together and without further ado
let's get into this villain makeup haul
so I guess that it came from what
Walgreens and like I also said I didn't
get that much because everything is
going but the first thing I got were
make white and I can always use makeup
waves I love makeup wipes and look how
cool these are right okay so we have
Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty or
salaat from Little Mermaid and the evil
cleaner ever at from Snow White so I got
to back to these because they're 25
wipes in each those 50 the last about a
month and Neutrogena and simple and all
those other brands also come 25 and a
packs for folks like wow and it's a lot
cheaper than those so I'm just gonna
test one out I'm not gonna pull it all
the way out cuz I don't wanna waste if I
don't want to how moist these are cuz
that's like a big thing with me they
have to be wet so I'm in that like
constantly like scrubbing my face check
them and makeup off cuz that's not gonna
my skin
so I like one's gonna wet that I can
just like run over and it removes the
makeup oh yes I got it oh my god what
like it literally didn't open like this
break we're gonna come back to this and
the gun should open the other one okay
they feel very wet oh yes they're like
really soaked okay I'm living for it I
love it
check this out if you they have these
still at your Walgreens they're very wet
and that's a good sign I got you this um
Ursula villains Leviathan ship Leviathan
let me get hot with shimmering powder
I'm so excited I just like look at the
packaging like I think that's so cool so
just me probably but I love Disney okay
so it comes like a little salt and
pepper shaker top oh very specific Silas
you just like throw it on yourself
well you kinda need a brush to dust it
okay let's find a brush let's get my fan
brush and then let's should I use this
as like oh I guess highlighter should I
try how's it look
I hope it looks good smells look like
vanilla or like hot chocolate
wait I'm like living for this this is an
amazing a highlight wait I'm like living
what it smells like hot chocolate okay
go Ursula highlight oh my god if you
need a good a highlight though um this
is amazing Wow I love that but I just
use the highlighter in like okay yes
well okay next I got this spellbound
sculpting contour palette and it's
maleficence it's not it's less than she
created it spellbound sculpting palette
okay so goes with a highlighter blush
and a bronze are so let's swatch these
okay I'm excited I mean should I do it I
think I'm gonna do it on my arm
so let's do the highlighter first mmm or
should I do it unless you have my hand
actually okay hold up this highlighter
is it's just like color hold like
vanilla it's not really picking up I
think I might just be like a powder a
setting powder okay let's try the
bronzer and see if this picks up
Omega six this could be like a nice
light bronzer is it picking up sitting
doing my honours no it's not beating up
okay last attempt for the blush it's
very very bright blush so let's see if
it's pigmented okay there we go
Wow okay that's very light all of these
are very light and they didn't pick up
much um they transfer well like that's
totally off my finger you could use this
as a face powder if that's your skin
tone that's a very light blush which is
good as blendable and buildable I guess
and that bronzer could be like a nice to
carve out the line you want before you
apply a deep heavy bronzer so maybe this
is just like it before you apply your
actual products product I don't really
like this I think I am in love with this
and so this really let me down but
that's okay okay last thing I've got
less things are thankfully I didn't know
this existed this villain climbed before
I went in there but thankfully they had
all 3 of the villains that are in this
line lipsticks left so I was like oh my
god so we have Maleficent and her
lipstick is dragon's lair I'll swatch
these in a second we have Ursula and her
lipstick is majestic and actually looks
like the famous lipstick she wears some
make the movie I think should I put it
on the movie or saying I always wanted
that lipstick and I have it hat and then
we have Evil Queen is that her name sees
me as her name because if it's like
Rebecca or something and I'm calling
people Queens can be really awkward to
do the shade potion so let's do it in
that order first we have the lip ascent
i'm so excited he's like I'd be so upset
if they only have like one or two or
none I'm so excited oh they had all
three so this is called your Agins lair
oh it's like a brown I don't have a
color like this though all right okay so
Stuart here
oh I love that I don't have any color
like that Wow it's like a brown with red
and maroon undertones I hope that's
focused next we have Ursula Ursula is
majestic okay it's like a red orange it
looks like yeah no it's more of a true
red I love it but those gonna be a lot
more orange er than that that is a
beautiful beautiful red no not sponsored
walking some Disney don't know exists
but I think these are pretty cool if
you're a Disney fan go get them here we
have the less one Evil Queen in the
shade potion alright this books the same
as Ursula's wouldn't you make it look a
different okay anyway let's see if it
transfers the same hold up they look
like the exact same color no that looks
a little more orange on camera but in
person these look like the exact same
color I hope you guys enjoyed this video
