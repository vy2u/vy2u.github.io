how long we've been out there and these
nights I can't sing shut up like a bad
night gee I'll conquer in my soul this
is real
these mics
in shorts
but that bought this Kansas City Star
route they gave me a road because about
nine and ten when they started that and
I thought of him from the first as a
distinct individual I did the voice
vicki was simply a little personality
assigned to the purposes of laughter I
saw the handwriting at the wall there
maybe short something with just a filler
on any program now I can crack the
feature field that I just do things
different very tales of life do and so
it was woman my father was a perfect
story I had the heavy magic for she had
the prince the liberal Romans wondered
whether he can thank of where he can
have a little fun with him too
parking lot to me is it something will
never be finished something that I can
keep developing an attitude
everything in this room may change time
and time again as we move ahead but the
basic philosophy of what we're planning
for Disney World is going to remain very
much as it is right now we know what our
goals are we know what we hope to
accomplish and believe me it's the most
exciting and challenging assignment
we've ever tackled at Walt Disney
Productions well after 40 some odd years
of the business my greatest reward I
think is that I have the the public
appreciate and accept what I've done all
these years that is a great reward and I
think by this time I have my group of
executives are convinced that what is
right the quality will I think they'll
hang on after it but after Disney
Walt Disney once said I hope that we
never lose sight of one thing but it was
all started by a mouse who but we know
it was really all started by a man a man
with
and mouse
Hey
because we're about to film that on the
sounds right understand oi now the scene
is small the balcony scene yeah all
right in my stroll
this is real
in short
in
everyone
yeah
thank you everyone avoids if I can't
realize the driver we are clear for this
match
okay I have been in the room since I'm
sure since I was 2 you guys I was
claimed Jim still ruined this trip by
trying to get it done almost done my
teachers has the insert email I had um
about a question by was done and then if
we went to downtown Disney tonight was
really fun or the club Disney springs
Nordling away we was all these name
changes but it's happening just trying
to finish the same work was test
actually
if energy I'll conquer
this is real
in my god
we just reported thousand and it's like
insane to me it's so surreal it's like
crazy like I hate a hundred thousand
last summer twenty thousand around
November and then throw in two thousand
hourly er this summer I know that's like
40 thousand already in five weeks and
I'm just like it means the absolute
world to me I mean I know everyone says
that it means a lot to me but like I'm
like no one so it's really that means so
much to me that you guys support me
