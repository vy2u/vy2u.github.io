expand homework we're friends to the
pool if you're going on vacations and
you know it do not take summer classes
it's like I knew this too I didn't think
it's gonna be just such work though oh
my god when what anyway and those we're
doing today we're going to Epcot later
my favorite part because I love Norway
and so I'm very very excited to go that
um but that's later in the day we made
all our past fests for later so we could
have like like early part of the day for
like pool and stuff just fine great in
whatever but I can't go cuz I do
homework so I guess we save this part of
the day for my homework as well but I
will see when we're going to a park bye
oh yeah
here we go
so we're taking a little sitting break
and we've done all of us all the
countries and the three Cafiero ride and
Finding Nemo ride which is not good
I like the Mexican ride though and now
we're going to Sauron see if that passes
but we're just chillin in France
and yeah
there's plenty of reason it feels super
does it not so good okay
so my family went on Soren we have
fastpasses visits 35-minute wait so it's
like noon and I mean by not sitting that
for a Fastpass that's not a fast pass so
I'm just like staring at the countries
in the water so beautiful probably gonna
go back to Norway let's go
they were walking by this car it's a
little creepy oh yeah don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
