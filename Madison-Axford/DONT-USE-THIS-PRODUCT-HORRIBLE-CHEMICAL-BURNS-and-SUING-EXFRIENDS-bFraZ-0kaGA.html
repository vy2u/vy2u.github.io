never been so annoyed no I have
nevermind but my skin has never been in
such worse shape okay if you watched my
video from yesterday I did a face mask I
never do face masks they're just not my
thing because my skin usually does fine
with the previous measurement I've been
doing which was like basically nothing
um and everything was fine I never got
that many zits whatever okay
this monster it's Kate Somerville some
girl whatever
exfoliate intensive exfoliating
treatment it's called Hollywood's to
knit facial it's green it smells like
ass and yeah it says that I married you
the directions okay because I read that
really quickly yesterday
I didn't pay attention so partes is my
fault but part of it is also who the
 makes this intense of a exfoliator
or whatever and that leaves chemical
burns on a person's skin I'll get there
okay how to use AM or PM use once or
twice a week apply a thin even layer to
a clean wet face and sashing in a
circular motion for 30 seconds leave on
for up to two minutes that's all I had
read but I was like mmm I'm sure it'll
be fine like I that's what face masks to
say because they want you to use a lot
of product so don't one should keep it
on three long they don't you like keep
using it and stuff so I was like
whatever um like I think leave however
long because I've gotten these nests
from like mint julep to lush to
Nordstrom brands and like like high-end
brands and low-end brands and all trends
in between but when I used to use face
masculine high school and they were
fighting they don't for however long
didn't matter right so I didn't really
think too much about this then really
reading further down says this product
may cause the skin to tingle and flush
slightly for a short time it's now been
24 hours and yeah my skin is still very
flushed and we have a lot of other side
effects going on from this mess of a
product for sensitive skin leave on for
less than one minute or use exfoliate
gentle instead now I was sent this as a
trial size so I couldn't like pink
between exfoliator exfoliate gentle but
my skin I would deem it sensitive
extremely sensitive something you look
at in and turns red but it is sensitive
because of my heritage and so that's
just kind of the skin type that I was
born with right so granted I should have
read a little farther down and not maybe
you have left it on so long or follow
the directions a little more but it who
makes a company first of all you look
this up this is using some sort of
chemical or plastic or something that
like it's found in the sea or something
that affects animals and it's bad for
our skin and like this is like one of
the only products that's still in the
market that uses this like harsh
chemical I was reading about this
afterwards so many people there are over
like hundreds of batteries on Sephora
and on Kate Somerville that common stuff
about this product I should have read
before I used it grant him I thought
being sent product it would be at least
usable okay on my skin but no so I like
I said when I put this on to film a
video yesterday literally put it on
because I wanted II bougie and like do a
face mask oh yeah sorry I took out of
the shower so I'm here's what I
shouldn't said that sorry um I put on
this face mask and I've have face masks
before that are stinging and when that
sting or burn when you first put them on
and I just like to sit in front of a fan
which I did yesterday to kind of cool it
off because they are supposed to be
intensive and and tingling like it's the
dirt or whatever the hell it supposed to
do out of your skin and this was one of
the strongest stinging sensations I
never felt it wasn't even stinging
though it was burning it literally felt
like I was my face is on fire but I was
pushing through excite this is what it
was supposed to be like it said may
tingle may cause some flushing in the
cheeks no my face was a beet red ass
tomato Akhtar took this off and what I
showed at the end of yesterday's ranch
clip or vlog whatever we're in call this
medicine talks medicine chats whatever
um that was nothing how about it God
right after that I started eat dinner
with my family
my face got red ER and redder and redder
in the chemical burns that I now have on
my face sunk in it looks like I've what
as it's but I only have two zits that I
had prior to face mask the rest is
actual chemical burns and discoloration
from this product exfoli Kate Kate
Somerville do not use this I'm sure
a great brand I'm sure that they have
great skin care whatever normally but
this does have a lot of better of you so
I'm noting one that thinks this and it's
not just my skin type if you have this
and warning you either they don't for a
minute or don't use it at all because it
will really damage your skin and I don't
know how permanent this will last for it
but I'm just praying and using long
moisturizer um so anyway moving on I
take it off after about 30 minutes way
too long I know and and I know every
minute it's your fault it's everyone's
your fault but this product is so harsh
two minutes we've done the same amount
of damage but I just wanna blasted a
song but people were talking about how
they got chemical runs to and I was like
oh my god like what is this for sure
what is this like toxic as product in
the market that's like not safe for any
skin type really um so I took it off and
like I said I was eating dinner and then
my family was like okay it's getting
worse I had ice on my face because my
cheeks were actually numb It was as if
the like cells or the nerve endings my
cheeks were just gone and this still
kind of is I can't feel it it's very dry
now around here um and yeah I'm gonna
show you up close I guess my chemical
burns now from this product okay
so I don't know if you can see this but
um I'll show you this this is gross I'll
show you the zits I had before yesterday
I had one right here so this was a zip
that is now going down it's like flat
and then I had this this was this it
so those tours it's I can't leave those
on the product these are things that are
not sits they look like it's because
they're dots but they're they're flat
it's just redness come to the surface
because of the chemical burn so these
two right here look like little zetsu in
my mouth those are chemical burns this
right here um kind of under my eye
chemical burn chemical burn oh yeah I
also add this it so ignore that this is
a chemical burn my nose is even redder
and then this is my biggest chemical
burn it and don't anyone in the comments
try to be like oh that's not a chemical
mark I went to the dermatologist today
and this literally like examined my skin
tell me what to do to fix it and stuff
and it's there chemical burns so I had
three sets I forgot about this one and
then this is all chemical burns and it's
just so scary that a product can do that
to your face do not used that this isn't
meant to like bash brand but that was
one of the worst experience I've ever
had it was it was really scary it was
really really scary um so yeah my face
burning it burns like all night it gave
me a headache it was really rough so
last night I was like okay I'm Edison
you don't take care of your skin maybe
this was a sign or like something from
Gaza that's like you need to take better
care of your skin
first of all problems I know but still I
don't treat my skin as nicely as it
should be treated and never ever
moisturize I wash my face but very like
once a day maybe and I know you're
supposed to do like two or three times a
day like my sister does have two times a
day or whatever and so I was like okay
I've always wanted Clinique skin care so
it's like why don't I go on and like
just buy something like yeah it's gonna
be a little pricey but let's try to fix
this burn that's like on my face down so
actually let me pull up on my phone what
products I got I'm really excited I
think they're being shipped to my house
on the Friday and I'm really excited to
start using them and get into a very
routine like skincare regimen so that my
skin is now used to it and it's like
okay like it gets in the routine with
the clinic products and can better
itself get rid of acne being moisturize
to be like glowing because it's
definitely not currently just I returned
from the email
okay yeah here we go okay so I got five
Clinic products I got Clinique
dramatically different moisturizing
lotion it was $26 I got clean liquid
facial soap in the mild one and it's $17
I thought these were all really
reasonable I thought seemed like $50 for
these products because I always was like
I can't get camee it's too expensive and
I won't like stick to it not just waste
it so I'll just get like News Regina but
now I'm like actually taking care my
skin and so it wasn't as pricey I
thought it was gonna be then I got
Clinique acne solutions cleansing foam
for $20 clinic acne solutions clinical
clearing gel which is like an award
winning thing from like Allure magazine
or whatever 26 dollars and then Clinique
acne solutions all over clearing
treatment oil $23 um which are treatment
oil free so I got treatment oil
treatment oil free and I heard that is
like amazing for like acne um so what's
on your face so I go this is coming to
my house which sometime this weekend and
I'm really excited for that I go back to
school next Tuesday so I still about a
week off from break I hope you're
enjoying these kind of talking videos um
because they're really fun for me to do
like I said to god the shower it's like
late in the afternoon but I woke up ran
errands with my mom and so I didn't have
time to take a shower and I didn't want
to do it through my skin because I have
percale sheets is this type of like
sheet and I just changed all my bedding
today because of what happen last I had
to mine all clean um for my skin and the
brighella
was very very like rough on my skin and
and every like pillow heard it just like
the little like pores whatever my skin
were just aching last night not anything
like a headache but a taking it away
that was like sharp pains I'm and
stinging I'm still like six seven eight
hours ago I went to bed listening at
4:00 I go to bed every night at like
4:00 yeah and so it was still burning um
not like just sitting here but like
laying on the pillow rubbing it's like
ow
I'm gonna put a lot of CeraVe like
moisture and lotion on my face until I
can get my Clinique stuff in the mail
it's just a very like gentle for
sensitive skin kind of lotion I can rub
every where because it is like I said
very dry now at some of these lower
places were more product was that
applied than others and it was just a
mess a mess an absolute catastrophe
trying to do a video trying to be bushi
like I said and then just it was ruined
so I'm sorry for
parents today uh not that I should
apologize I love wearing no makeup I
rarely wear makeup as much as I'm
posting pictures on Instagram with
makeup or whatever like and that's
usually taken on one day like I can show
you this I think it's kind of funny okay
so you go to my Instagram and these
three pictures you can see like this
second row was all taken on the same day
just to mine out for changes in
different lipsticks um
because I don't wear makeup every day I
love letting my skin breed I love being
employed rubbing my nose and not having
because when I'm makeup on I like tap a
niche I don't rub it because I don't
want my makeup to come up and it's just
like a hassle I love makeup at the same
time it's like uh so um yeah I don't
wear makeup a lot so I don't know why I
was excluded no makeup on but I was
planning on doing me go today before the
whole skin rash burn happened but
yeah I'm just letting it breathe and I'm
sorry you have to see all these these
burns and it's like red dots in my few
sets but that's the way life is and I
hope it's not too gross um but police
will be fixed I guess I went to the germ
and they seemed to have a positive
mindset about getting better but I was
literally thought assuming that
permanent scarring for those my life
anyway yeah so that happened happened
there are a few things I want to talk
about I love doing these videos like I
said like this is so fun I was thinking
of all this stuff and I want to talk
about yesterday and writing it down and
I don't mind listen i % serious but I'm
trying to recall um certain things I'm
gonna talk about one was okay so I
literally have given my phone number at
which like no one okay this is the thing
since I graduated high school I've
changed my phone number about four times
because um people leaking my phone
number and people thinking it's funny to
leak my personal information on social
media and I've had it happen so many
times it's really disgusting and I
usually know who does it I can tell from
the IP address linked to a YouTube
channel that links it so people who
think they're cool they're just really
assholes and I know who you are so I
could keep consistently changing my
number one because we do people get it
not you guys but like weird people will
get it and send me threats and death
threats and try to look me up my address
and which is just scary at that
point
and so nothing it's a big deal but it is
a hassle I have to consistently pay
money to get my phone number changed and
I have to tell the people that I am
close to my friends hey it's me again I
changed my number but then again I I
kind of like that I've changed my number
because I don't like to have a lot of
people having it I don't like it being
out there I think I have like a count
how many people have it right now
because it's not many
I'll count that people aren't in my
family because obviously my mom dad and
sister have it um so one two three four
five six I think like seven people have
it right now outside of my family and
granted that shows that I don't have
many close friends but also I just know
who I can and cannot trust and if I
can't trust you or if something has
happened in the past that has led me to
believe that you would get my number I
will not give it to you again
and so if and it's not it like a mean
thing like if you don't have my number
it doesn't mean that I don't want to
talk to you it doesn't mean that I don't
like you or don't trust you per se it
just means like but you've given my
number out before and now I'm scared
it's gonna happen again because bad
things have happened from it before and
that's the thing I want to talk about I
hate when people just freely give my
number out because I'm not a celebrity
I'm not a star but I do have a following
and so people do want my number and I
don't want it out there for everyone to
have and see this is just respectful I
think it's personal information I
wouldn't give out your phone number or
address no matter who you were if you're
Kylie Jenner or someone who goes to my
college and so I think you should be
respectful and do the same to me and
it's not like oh is that important it's
just a phone number I know but it can be
linked to so many other things that many
persons like and so like I said I've
changed it so many times since I
graduate high school and I want to do it
again now because I'm so pissed
because this number that I got from AT&amp;amp;T
literally I think a previous person was
like a drug dealer that had it because I
get calls non-stop and texts um asking
me if I have that good whatever and I'm
like what is happening literally what is
happening and I have gotten four no was
it four or five calls just today okay I
got this number for a month now
for five balls just today from men
asking me for drugs I'm like and then
see me they're like hey I don't know who
the previous like guys name is I'm not
gonna say it just for privacy reasons um
but they keep saying like a blank do you
have it or can we meet here or like you
where are you like I'm like oh my god
like Annie go back to AT&amp;amp;T and get this
fixed and and like do I pay for another
number again like it's so aggravating
but I got a number for privacy and for
no random calls and yet this was someone
who's probably in jail now knows I
deactivated folks those phone numbers
back up for grabs that I got it's a it
was like a drug dealer or something and
now I I'm getting all these calls and
it's just really really frustrating as
you know I'm like very very against
drugs and so if he says me I said of
course I would be in this predicament
um but yeah so just if you have some
phone number whether there have a
following or not but if there's like a
normal grandma ask them first if it's
okay to give out their number be like
hey can I give this number this person's
asking you know blah blah and if they
say yeah yeah sure why are you asking be
like I just want to make sure it's okay
with you and people will really respect
that and be thankful for that um if they
say no respect their decision and be
like okay we like things fasting but no
I'd rather you not give it to them
because I have every right to give you
my number or not and I have it marked
now that like the people that have my
phone number the few people that have my
phone number
um I have marked with like emojis so I
know if I get a text message from
someone with out an emoji one of those
seven people had to have given it out
and I actually have lawyers and stuff
like I have a legal team that um well
fight a case against leaking personal
information so like I'm not trying to be
threatening per se but it's a very
serious matter that I've dealt with many
times before that has led to threats and
like attacks and I don't need that
happen again so like I have a team like
I said and I'm not afraid to like yes
it's minor but I'm not afraid to like
press charges on the case of leaking
personal information because that's
that's not okay it's not okay it's like
you know I don't know it's just mmm it's
just really scary to me and it's not
okay um and so yeah I have gotten texts
from people without emojis because they
think it's the stupidest persons
previous phone number and that's really
frustrating and I block their numbers
but if I get someone that's okay Madison
they know who I am and you know that
that's my number and they don't have oh
geez by their name I'll know to call
someone out and they'll figure it out
very very easily because like I said I
can count it on barely two hands um like
basically one hand who has my phone
number and um yeah and I'll be able to
narrow it down who knows who and there
we go and I don't want to have to do
that but also like I said I've every
right you it's happened so many times
before and it's scary and it's gotten
dangerous and I've gotten um just like
so many threats scary threat so people
who live by me or her close to me um
actually this like personal attack in
public before that Mohini knows about
that was like linked to my location and
I think it was really scary so yeah
that's in with that anymore and I might
change it again
so Haiti two friends if I change again
you know what's happening
um but yeah so the last thing I want to
talk about today okay was my or is my
obsession with old movies oh my god I
said this before there's four things I
love and we all know them
jazz music my favorite genre I
absolutely adore jazz whether it's
lyrical or instrumental love them both I
just think it's a beautiful Jean ray and
you have to have a kind of certain taste
and appreciation for old classic music
because a lot of people can't just sit
there and listen to it but God I adore
it um I love old movies so much I'd
rather watch an old movie than any other
type of movie or genre or modern or
cartoon or anything especially black and
white there's just something so
perfectly classic and beautiful about
black and white original theatrics and
filmmaking in cinema and then be like
forgetting what I like classic poetry
absolutely adore it like Emily Dickinson
is one of my favorite poets I love
poetry so much and as you propose a
class this semester and wrote my own
poems and like they're really weird and
but like I adore it I keep saying adore
that's really annoying adore delano drag
love it uh and then the last one is
politics
ah no politics I can talk about politics
like till I die because it's just so fun
um and yeah so those are the four things
I love and I've been loving watching old
movies so much more recently because I'm
not really a movie buff alright I never
I literally haven't seen any classic
we're gonna be like The Godfather
Shawshank Redemption uh Casablanca like
don't think I've seen it's like gone
with the wind
um with duck soup and um more flowery
Cuckoo's Nest like there's only like
Classic Movies I feel like I've seen and
can speak on but now I've been watching
more like I've watched dial M for murder
Jezebel with Betty Davis um The Postman
Always Rings Twice um
the birds I wasn't a huge fan about I
thought seemed a lot scarier granted old
movies aren't that scary but I thought
something else here it was okay so I'm
here oh my favorite apps
it became an absolute favorite movie
letting out whatever happened to Baby
Jane okay I gotta get this for you it is
my favorite movie now okay
this is the community if you're gonna
watch one own movie let it be this it's
with Betty Davis and Joan Crawford I
love Joan Crawford granted there's that
whole Mommy Dearest thing but I adore
her and I think she's okay can i freakin
stop saying the door I love her and she
was so talented and beautiful and icon
and she's virtually takes the lesser
role in this because Betty Davis play
some more crazy one but still I think
she was very impressive in this film and
I know it's not ranked as her like
greatest piece because that would be
Mildred Pierce which I'm watching
tonight so I'm really excited or but
this is just such a classic because they
were enemies in real life and and then
they're like now forced to be with each
other in the scene and they're enemies
in this movie as well so it's just great
to see play out and it's long it's not
rated but 133 minutes but aware every
second of your time like definitely
gonna watch one old movie just let go
watch this it's not like a big classic
like not that many people know about it
but if you like old movies you do know
about it and it's just incredible
yeah so that's all I guess I'm gonna
talk about for today I hope you enjoyed
this videos again I love coming on here
and talking oh yeah I've also seen some
like at Hunt and Breakfast at Tiffany's
I thought I would just put those in
there I forgot about those chick movies
anyway unnecessary information Madison
but um I hope you enjoyed this video
again if like this video and comment

ratchet face but you know should happens
