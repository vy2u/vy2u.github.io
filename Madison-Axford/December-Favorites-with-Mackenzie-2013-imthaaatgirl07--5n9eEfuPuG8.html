school seriously we start over okay okay
hey nes new route excited ed whole time
yet heyo so today i am with mackenzie
again oh and we're doing our december
favorites because december is over and
it's the new year we're bringing in the
new year uh uh 2014 okay anyway what was
that I don't know we can't believe in
this monster like over already it kind
of flew by and our first semester over
senior years over but I way today we're
doing our December favorites like I said
and we both have quite a few favorites
and I thought it'd be fun to do a
favorites video with a friend this time
so yeah without further ado let's get
started so I'll do one product then
she'll do one kind of like that you know
so I first product I mentioned in my
November favorites and I hate being a
repeat offender on favorite products but
this product needs a second shout out
and it's my Rimmel London which is all
scratched off but it's the natural
bronzer in 0-20 sunshine it's the
lightest shade a bronze earth they have
I've totally hit pan in the center
however I just love love love this
bronzer sorry the Lighting's really
weird on there but i love this month I
love this bronzer it's the greatest one
ever it's a total dupe for the bronze
booster by physicians formula um it
works great with my pale skin because it
does make me you know have a nice like
tannish glow look without making me look
orange and cakey I absolutely love this
one it's amazing it's literally like
three dollars which is why I like it
even more and I just suggest this to
anyone who has you know even light to
medium skin tones just really really
look for this bronzer by Rimmel I'm not
a huge fan of normal skin products but
this product this bronzer is just
absolutely incredible and I love it i'll
definitely be repurchasing this over and
over again well my first product is also
from Rimmel and it's the stay matte
powder and I've also had p.m. dissing
masses hey again she she recommended to
this for me to like try this out and I
really like it put it on after my
foundation and it makes it stay on like
all day without what my face King shiny
and um I right I get in it's also the
right of shade it's actually my first
but i actually bought another one when i
finish this up so um yeah I really this
product my next product I think I had
this and another one of my favorites my
bad this is my third bottle of kinase BB
cream in light to medium skin tones skin
renewal miracle skin Perfector
combination to oily skin SPF salon c and
i love this stuff so much i recommended
it to her she used it i still use it
it's the only bad thing is it becomes a
mess like around of a wig yeah a little
runny so sometimes it'll make a mess but
it is the greatest thing it doesn't
crease on me it's it's just it's one of
the best face makeup things that I've
ever found because I have such trouble
with my skin is so sensitive and I have
so much redness that I try to cover it
up and even with expensive fifty-dollar
foundations they never do the job
however this $12 one from the drugstore
walmart target whatever did do the job
and i just love it so so so much so
definitely check this out and I do get
the SPF 21 not 15 gives me more
protection and it's just amazing amazing
amazing I joining up to where Prime with
this I love it to death my next product
is essence stay on matter what
waterproof eyeliner pen so I put this on
my waterline and um this is like what
the penalty Ike and I had a different
one um from essence before this and the
pen was like a little flimsy I guess and
um it kind of made me messed up a little
bit sometimes so I guess not because is
more firm and it stays on for a while so
and then my next product is also a
liquid eyeliner but it's Maybelline
slime stiletto i had heard numerous
great reviews about this from fellow
videos here on YouTube and I finally got
it I try to let from essence and NYC cuz
I want to get a cheaper one rather than
spending seven six seven dollars on this
one I think it was but I decided to just
go with it and eventually I did buy it
and I love it because it sounds really
firm and I'm it's really long and pointy
which you can pretty much cover half of
your eyelid or almost all of your eyelid
in one stroke enough to keep going over
it it's really nice it's not like dried
out which I found in a lot of ones by
NYC like the island the liquid eyeliner
pens my NYC we're often dried out and I
have to push really hard this one glides
all
and it's really really like witty and
great but I drive super fast also which
was a downside to NYC ones um thing did
not dry fast and like if I would like
just look up or something i would have
liquid eyeliner all on my eyelid like
upper eyelid so anyway this one is great
it's really easy to put on liquid
eyeliner and do a good job at it so my
next one is the Maybelline maracas
valium express mascara i actually bought
this with before like Madison even I
told me about it cuz she was talking
about these new products she gets in huh
yeah I go around the same time and I
really like it and I like how it like
separates them but then it also I makes
them really long and then i pair with
the maybelline one by one mascara which
separates them even more so um i had
parent I'm appearing to max Kruse
together and I ride the Maybelline
mascaras and I have a l'oreal mascara
was just kind of like weird i was
looking for this i think i said this in
a different video i was looking for the
million lashes one which this one is is
the voluminous million lashes by l'oreal
mascara but I picked up like the other
gold tube one so I failed it's a little
good experience with it and it lasted
forever I had two balls of it I think
but then I finally found the voluminous
million lashes one and I really really
am enjoying this it's actually quite a
small little bottle from mascara but i
love the wand and i only have to do like
two three coats of this which is not a
lot considering i used to put on like
18,000 but i just do a few coats i curl
them after this has dried and i'm good
to go with my mascara which saves a lot
of time it's really nice and this is
actually pretty cheap l'oreal ones i
found are really great and also very
affordable my next product is from
Maybelline and it's 0151 with it and
it's kind of like a lipstick and I could
look bomb because the most moisturizes
my lips and so this is the color what it
looks like and I'm not as bold as like
what madsen where's cuz she can pull off
like red and dark colors but um I have
it on my lips right now and you can't
really tell but like it kind of had some
shine and like it has a little bit of
sparkle in it and next on to when my
random favourites plans just the candy
sour patch kids I never used to like
sour candies or like sour skittles right
like that but i just recently picked
these up there like a dollar I think and
I've been loving them and they're
actually really good they're like really
sour though so I'm like oh just I really
like Lisa yeah have you had the water
hon one um there was like watermelon no
I'm allergic to watermelon would you
like the flavor watermelon have you ever
lay my burden oh I realized the flavor
watermelon so I like the watermelon star
watch kids because like I don't want the
yellow yeah I don't like the green
yellow I don't remember what the green
was he sick I don't remember what the
green let seasick no I don't remember
what degree of let's say sight Myron and
favorite is um extra polar ice gum I
don't know my crystals in this I get
mixed I growing above all yeah nodal
crystal ball things um yeah I just worry
like this in my last random favorite in
favorite like overall before we do music
is the vanilla bean Noel whipped shimmer
body cream I love it so much it's
literally like whipped cream for your
body and that sounds weird but anyway so
it's like a little like pump squeeze
tube thingy like regular whipped cream
is and so it just comes out like whip
cream oh cool it's literally so cool and
so fun and it's yeah try some is
shimmery it's like a lotion yeah and
it's feels like lotion is shimmery and
and I love them because it has too much
like glitter to your body and you're all
sparkly and I really really like it
really moisturizing if you don't put too
much on oh my last rain and favorite um
is twisted peppermint lotion from
athumani works and I really love the
smell of peppermint and I just don't
love it like it just makes me want to
have candy cane it's so yummy and mi
Aquino like this nice guys burning a
night that ah and next we're going to
