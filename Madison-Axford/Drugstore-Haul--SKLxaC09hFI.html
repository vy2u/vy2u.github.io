Hershey I hate when people say charge a
target and they literally feature - iris
I'm the cover like every other time they
print a magazine oh I already used it
and open it Ellis well what as well hey
so I'm doing kind of a different video
for me today because I normally don't do
hauls and today I am going to do a
drugstore haul and I'm really excited to
do this because I like watching hauls I
just feel like I never do them and I
really don't like last one was the G
cream Kate Spade I think or the
Christmas mom I can't remember but like
I do not do hollows and it's not that I
don't buy things but it's that I don't
really buy things in bulk enough to do
like a haul and so I like one makeup
product here one mega product there but
I never really buy like a bunch of
things like I did this time so I went to
I'm target in Ulta I only got one thing
at Ulta but the majority is from Target
um but I am really excited to show you
what a guy I thought I would do this
video cuz halls have been requested
since I do a very very minimum of them
on you know my channel so without
further ado let's get into my drugstore
haul so I'll just start with old
distance I've only got one thing here
the thing I got here I was not planning
on getting when I went there I plan on
getting dry shampoo when I originally
went to Ulta that I left with something
amazing and um I am known about in loved
not your mother's whatever brand for a
while now I really like their sea salt
spray that and like kinky moves are the
only products that I like have buy them
but I picked up one that is definitely a
must and it's not your mother's not a
nice conditioning detangler and I've
never really had it to tangler since I
was like little so this is a big step
for me my hair is very very long if you
can see and it's also it's really
naughty like after showers and
when I brush my hair and stuff like that
so you can spray this on wet or dry hair
which is amazing because I'm constantly
spraying this now it's really healthy
and like all-natural for your hair which
is great I'm obsessing this brand and
all other products no matter how big or
small are literally 5.99 and it's just
it's great it's amazing six bucks this
is just it's great but yeah like I said
you can apply this on wet or dry hair so
if you get a shower or if you just get
home from school and you want to brush
your hair like me this is really really
great I just recommend looking at this
brand in this product in particular if
you're looking for any new hair products
that are very affordable because I don't
I love that it's my hair so so smooth is
to make it greasy or sticky err like
bulk clumped together disgusting or
anything like that because I'm very
particular with my face products and
with my hair products and I don't use
that many on my hair and that one I
really love so I definitely check that
one out they don't sell that brand at
Target that I know of I don't think they
do but they haven't it um ladies Urban
Outfitters
surprisingly in Ulta so yeah yeah and
next movie on shipping bigger the tour
today
actually I don't know why I just said
her she I hate what people say target a
target um I went here thinking of
getting a few of these products and I
just love it so much it was a grand old
time you're like I had so much for me
like I usually don't buy this much in
one trip but anyway let's just you know
look at the first thing that I picked
out and it is a magazine and it's like
in style which is one of my favorites
because thoroughly $2.99 and they
literally feature by the side or
something to cover like every other time
they for a magazine oh and so of course
if she's only covered it will be but if
my sizes on the cover she will be bought
and I have like a whole collection if
you can see this little thing right here
is my magazine holder and I have like
literally automatic things have Miley
Cyrus on the cover so I did another one
to my collection and I just love it I
haven't read it yet but I I love these I
love this
next thing in my bag is my favorite BB
cream which is the Garnier BB cream with
SPF 20 which is in the shade light to
medium this is what it looks like it's
also very kind of like watery and like
runny but I like the Xmas Games super
dry is the fact that it is really liquid
makes my skin just so happy and some
moisturized and guess so it's very very
great this is my favorite I'm using
right now is literally out and I can
probably use this two or three more
times so I just picked up a new one so
that I wasn't like out and I didn't have
it be in payment and prepare next all
right God Oh a new eyeliner because I
always have the essence long-lasting eye
pencil and this one was about the same
price so I heard a lot about Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner so I want to try
one and of course I always do black on
my waterline and ever do white or they
use your anything I always do black and
so I've used a lot of these products
ready but um so you just want to kind of
open but it's just the black and it's
scutum eyes Rimmel London waterproof
well gets already done a little nob but
I already have to sharpen it and I've
only had it for a little while but I'm
really been liking it it does sit on
quite a while I mean it's just a really
vibrating black color I'm really really
enjoying this so definitely check out
brim on eyeliners cause they're very
cheap and this is actually really
good-quality it's really waxy and it's
easy to apply
it's just groovy next thing is really
random it's a I already used it and open
it else well what as well and it's a
Texas Instruments on TI 30x scientific
calculator I have a graphing calculator
but we can use that for the math class
I'm in because like we could have like
programs on it that could help us cheat
or something now that I or any of my
classmates would but you know there's
always that one person that might cheat
so the teachers can't take a risk so we
have to use scientific and I did not
have a scientific I had a hold one it
was like Navy or something my sister I'd
have it for her her school um because
she's in sixth grade so I've done a new
one it's really really pretty blue color
I really really um it's calculator but I
really really like
it's cute makes me wanna do homework not
really but I'm gonna pretend that makes
me want to do homework that thing I see
is a little travel deodorant because I
feel like this is a must and I didn't
know that had this I can my purse or my
school bag I just feel like if you're
out and about and like you're just like
I don't know if it's hot that day or
something and you are like sweating or
if you just need more cure it and like
definitely carry a little one around
this is actually a big travel size one
but it was a 97 cents so it's sweet pea
and violent swab I just picked one up
and yeah I really not needed it because
I always put you out or not everyday
obviously but I just wanted it in case
they were like an emergency or something
then I got a new rebel bronzer this
isn't a different color I did not get
the zero to zero such anyone again
because I really wanted to start
contouring more and focusing a lot more
on that some wind a little bit darker
color because my BB cream is kind of
dark or than my skin tone I wanted an
even darker bronzer just a contour not
but all over my face but to contour
because you do need a darker color so I
got 0 to 2 Sun bronze and this time I
didn't get this sparkly glittery one
because I got a lot of crap for not mine
there was literally sparkles all over my
face with the zero to zero sunshine but
I still love it and this one's just like
I said some bronze and I have used this
a lot already and it's not too dark but
it is dark enough where I can contour
great with it collapse beauty products I
got is a new coloration lip balm by
L'Oreal and it's in the shade 218 rose
elixir I love trying new color riche lip
balms each time I get one because
they're all amazing and it's just a
really nice pink color I have it on
right now and yeah I like it Sinai I
love wearing nearly bright red lipstick
but sometimes but a lot of the times I
don't want to wear that every day you
know it's too much and yeah I just don't
know where that so I just get it like to
have a nice like little light color that
I put on every day and this is a great
great choice great option and the last
and sadly we're coming to an end the
last thing I got from Target something
at that I have been wanting for so long
tons of meteors that I watch on YouTube
haven't my sister has it the wet brush
like oh my goodness and of course
pink I wanted to get pink from the
minute I saw it I went to Ulta for the
dry shampoo and for the wet brush but
they didn't have the one person I had to
go back to Target and get the wet brush
and this is literally amazing I didn't
think it would really work if you want
me to do like a demonstration or a
review on it a separate video I will but
I'm just not gonna am I gonna talking
about it for like ten hours in this
video I love it though you can use it on
wet or dry hair it works amazingly with
my detangling spray and I just love
those two together and I just really
really love this brush I needed a new
hair brush anyway and this one just
works so so Wow like ahhh I really
honestly thought it would suck and
thought it would hurt but everyone raved
Nevada and loved it through my own
sister so I had to get it and I do
really really really truly love it
so yes that was my drugstore target in
Ulta haul and I hope you enjoyed it
because I don't really do these so it's
kind of rare occasion that I'm actually
doing a haul but I hope you enjoy this
video if you're not already take a
