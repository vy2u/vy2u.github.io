three of my friends but you can only see
two of them but the other ones on the
floor
and she's going to help us um today
we're taking a frequently asked
questions about high school and boy
advice video and I have my help and it's
my friend Audrey hi my friend Mackenzie
obviously then I also find Kylie's on
the floor
she'd really warm in the video but
that's okay we still love her and she's
going to be asking the questions that we
have written down and brainstormed and
somebody even gotten from you guys so
I'm really excited for this video and
without further ado let's get start with
the first question what do you wear on a
typical day of high school
we're each gonna tell you basically what
we wear so it's not what you should wear
it's just our ideas and what we choose
to wear each day so I never really bum
it to school I love to dress up and I
feel like it's an opportunity for me not
to just like your Christmas personality
yes like I'm not trying to show off but
I'm not going to wear some pants every
day at school I really don't like doing
that and since I have nice like cute
clothes I'm going to wear them and put
cute outfits together so I mean that's
just my opinion eyes yeah I mean if you
swipe it yeah if you remember what pants
is totally fine I just don't like to do
that well I don't for me I usually start
out here and I dress really cute I just
want to impress all the people in my new
classes like over your friends and stuff
and then by you know the timer October
I'm like you know what I'm just gonna
wear some jeans first pants so I
mean it's whatever you're comfortable
wearing cuz Madison loves dressing up I
like you know splashing around and I
don't really care what people think of
me you know whatever you want to wear
yeah you know yeah and I'm not judging
people if they do wear I like half my
friends were self ANSYS yeah like worse
I don't like how I look so yeah I'm kind
of a mess and I wear um Roy he close
most of the time unless I have like
finals I don't really dress up that much
our finals freshmen sophomore year even
I had already done freshman year I was
so nervous I was like crazy I was like I
have just study hours on and I just like
months to prepare like a surgical
material I need to start like meeting
study guys okay like the first week back
from afraid
something and really they're not that
pad it's just I think tests are harder
than I'm sore in the middle because
there's because it's in learning new
stuff and you already have finalists you
already learned everything you just have
to review it so teachers are always
telling you do not do not wait till the
last minute to study do it
Everett do like a little bit each night
you know honestly no one does that
no no but it's like I would forget the
material is so much Naomi this is so
much you know over but after you like
start reviewing it
you actually know you remember it and
it's really not that bad and the topics
are more bra and on the final so you
don't have to know every single detail
and you're always like at our schools
they can be study guides I know for me I
started with math a lot and that was
something I started with the whole
semester and my big mistake that I made
with that especially with finals is that
I didn't get any help until right before
finals and that totally into me over
yeah because I ended up getting some
better test grades you know toward the
end of the year but like the terrible
you know grades that I got at the
beginning of the year just totally
weighed me down so I would say asked for
help when you need it if even you know
the first week at school if you know
you're struggling it's not gonna just
get easier all of a sudden you need to
ask for help and it's not embarrassing
to go in it doesn't mean you're dumb or
anything what is your favorite or like
most used school supplies planners yeah
they helped me like oh you need a
planner if you want to be organized and
do not forget but you don't want to
forget like your homework or like what
tests you have yeah especially in high
school since he has so many classes is
very nice heaven and like an agenda yeah
that's no I couldn't live without a
planner I have to read every single
thing I did that night everything I have
to do it
what do you think about having a date
for prom at homecoming oh my gosh you do
not need them that is yes the one thing
that my stressed out so much going to
get high school I was like I'm never
gonna find a date for homecoming
freshman year I didn't have a date for
homecoming and it was fine because I got
to spend the whole night with my
girlfriend he was spending it with your
girls then I went to homecoming with who
those weird I was like weird flashback a
great freshman year and junior I didn't
go to homecoming with a guy I'm with my
friends and I seriously had the greatest
time ever sure going with a guy is great
I went with one of my best guy friends
me party it's fun to go with either you
know at my school basically dates you if
it's just somebody that you're going
with his a friend it only matters for a
picture he's like people take pictures
you post on Facebook with the boys but
you're not like obligated to you know
slow dance with your day or like I did
that oh oh yeah okay so I'm on Austin Oh
oh my god no no you know there are you
and then you watch me slow dance with
them I was like you know how like
everyone like then doesn't have a couple
yes thing I could get off the dance
floor well it was a hero by Enrique
Iglesias it was and you were to stay
there and I liked you right now you
liked what you were doing I was like no
way boys are I've never had a boyfriend
Jimmy it's a fun thing to have I had my
first boyfriend this year and it was fun
for a little while but it's the only cat
a photo of stressful boys are so odd
like I'm sorry boy viewers but some of
you are very very dumb oh yeah be
pressured to do anything you know I know
you girls to be watching um I don't know
like gossiper own stuff um just don't do
what they do I mean I don't know some
people might have difficulty yeah I just
be really careful I accurately
any relationship last I mean sound like
back in the olden days I feel like high
school sometimes nowadays with all the
new like electronic things we have is
yes so hard it made so easy to meet new
people so it's so hard to just stay in
touch with yeah like old sweethearts
don't always spend all your time with
your boyfriend cuz if you guys break up
and you haven't spent any of time any of
your time with your friends they're not
gonna really want to pull you back in
and like try to befriend you again you
shouldn't you should if I kind of even
at your time I mean yeah you can yeah
