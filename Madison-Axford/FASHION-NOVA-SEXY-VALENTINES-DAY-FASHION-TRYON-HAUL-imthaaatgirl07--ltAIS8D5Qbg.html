it's fine
I want you
we better show me how you
if you are
hey guys so today I am doing a try on
haul I love doing try on hauls they're
kind of pain in the butt to film
sometimes cuz you gotta like change into
19 outfits in like two seconds but it's
fine because I love you guys and I love
doing them and I know I love watching
these um when other people do them
rather than just regular hauls like this
is what I got no bitch let me see how it
looks on you so that's what I'm doing
today it's all from fashion OVA my
favorite store of life I love fashion
OVA because their clothes like what you
see is what you get like it's not like
oh it's amazingly cute and looks perfect
on the model and then you get it looks
like a sack no that's not fashion over
fashion OVA looks exactly like it does
on the model I love their clothes it's
right in my alley right like right up my
style and my aesthetic that I try to
pursue is what fashion OVA provides me
with so I don't know I love them anyway
without further ado let's get into the
trial it's quite big so I'm excited I've
been saving em I did two rounds of
shopping there so I didn't just do like
it is online so I didn't just do like
one shipment like I waited until I got
more things in something more
interesting but y'all you know what I
mean without further ado let's get
started first what I got is this pink
suede one it's like this pink it is a
deep V yeah we get it next pink suede
halter top and it is a there we go
leotard okay so it's like down your
crotch like it's like legit like a
bathing suit thing but it's gonna look
so cute I'm so excited where this is the
softest thing ever all these things will
be linked to the downbar list which
they're sold out or they don't sell them
anymore I will try to link in the
downbar so you get similar things or the
same exactly as me and we can be twins
oh my god
anyway I love is it Chris causes in the
back feet to that you'll be able to see
it on me better and yeah I just love
this it isn't deep plunge but I'm at the
age where it's like I'm looking for by
um I really really like this it's
backless besides the crisscross and I
just love the rose color roses are my
favorite things blind and so this is the
rose color that I love you next thing no
man I'm ordered by the way you press
this and Instagram pictures it is my
lace romper adore it didn't think I'd
like it so much because I'm not a huge
lace person but I adore it it's more of
an ivory color it is quite short that's
one of the downfalls I wear size small
and everything but this is by the brand
double zero so my
different than fashion Nova um fish
Nova's normal Brinks the small was quite
short but if I just make sure it's
pulled down or L Gucci to go okay it
doesn't pockets I love dresses and
robbers with pockets
it's just specifically more easy and I
just love the floral nice girly lace
prints very like a nice and innocent
little outfit love it love it living for
it next we have my favorite thing of
life which I've worn it every Instagram
picture I've ever taken ever which is my
infamous black jumpsuit okay well if I
can get it right there we go the
backless crisscross strap to the back
and long pants I was too literally every
party every event everything I did at
this winter and I still am wearing it I
adore it it's just the perfect shiny
black and it just makes you look so like
good like it's like a very very
flattering outfit and I'm in love with
it you know what I'm talking about
you've seen this in every grand picture
that I posted recently and that's month
I adore this I'm so glad I got this then
we got my as a favorite thing over which
I wear these literally every day are
these like legging kind of like sweater
material um legging tights I guess you
could say like they have an elastic
waistband they're pants you know and and
they don't they're nice tight leggings
but they do form to your like butt in
your skin so they do form so they do
look good and they make it you know
they're flattering but they're not super
tight like Lululemon legs or stuff like
that so I adore you so much there's a
drawstring the drawstring does not work
there's no elastic and it's like fake
but I love this so so much I love this
gray tone so yes I got these pants and I
got the matching cropped hoodie which I
do like it but it is so crop of tiny
that is go what go what I do like it
it's just very small see better be sure
that you better make sure all your boobs
are covered in a way all your boobs
because you look parently of 10 now you
know what I mean that you make you only
make sure you know under burn thinks is
very short but I do like how it goes of
the hood it's a nice little like like
matching said I couldn't not get both I
love those like me so much that I also
went ahead and got it the pink rose
colored ones here they are in the rose
color is the same exact material same
exact format length they're stretchy
enough where they can fit any size
really I got a small
I think is it one size fits only is it
small I think it small
um but like they would fit anyone like
they formed figure bodies here and then
I got the meshing hoody with that as
well again it's cropped the rows hoody
there we go long sleeve yes I had you
the matching set again next I got
another deep plunge neckline this is I
was really looking for one of these I'm
so glad I found it it's another onesie
there we go there's the bottom I adore
this it's a total backless no straps
nothing on the back it's just like your
back and then whatever pants you wear
with it and I love this is a pretty
going out top with your friends well
whatever I it's a halter and I adore
entanglement so much I'm really excited
to wear this then I got the shirt that
looks like it fits an American Girl doll
but I promise it stretches like a mother
look at this I'm dead look at this top
look at this top it's smaller than my
face I died when I opened it I was like
oh it's fine it's fine it's fine it
works I tried on today it's an Instagram
picture of mine and this strap is
actually super super long and stretchy
so like anybody type or any like boob
size can fit this like it just cuz it
looks tiny do not be scared it is so
stretchy oh my god that's amazing thing
about fashion Nova too is the clothes
stretch so if you're not necessarily a
small or medium or large if you're kind
of in between sizes you can pick one of
them and most likely fit into it because
the stretch of materials that form to
fit your size so I got the hot chopped
again just for summer going out whatever
I thought it was cute and it's like I
like this pleated material so yeah next
is another leech heart I've got a lot of
these deep plunge eggs I don't know why
I need to stop my knees and I probably
good name works I just bought a thousand
of them this is another black wax my
favorite color to wear then here's the
back is amazing crisscross and like you
can see that and then leash hurt again
this is just a nice one
again I don't know why I got a hundred
of these tops I for sure don't need any
more cuz they're kind of like five of
them no but you know what I don't have
any time so I feel the need to buy all
of them less clothing item I got is this
dress which is adorable
it looks a little big or did when I took
it out of the box but it fits again
perfectly against my body shape it forms
to fit tightly if you know it's not like
I don't know I just have a look kind of
long and big but it's not
oh it has this gold hardware going down
the front with a drawstring tie
crisscross design and it is just a kind
of stop G black bodycon dress and I
really liked I definitely the material
it's thick it is not a thin dress which
is very nice especially for winter time
going out so yes don't be scared to you
know pick a size because they will most
likely fit you no matter what these
clothes are incredible then I got two
pairs of shoes one you've probably seen
every picture ever I call these my
Christmas shoes because I wear these for
like every Christmas event they're my
favorite
ivory heels from fashion Nova IRA size 7
if you were wondering but these are just
Omega these are like fashion Nova's top
shoes like they have them every color I
love these so much I'm so glad I have
them and I like love the ivory color did
you get a little dirty I don't know if
you can see on the side they're kind of
dirty but I don't care I wear them all
the time I love them they're a little
hard to walk in at first but then I
broke them in and we're all Gucci now
there's like total netting down here if
you can see that and just like a
honeycomb bee hive style adore these if
you even find my Instagram for a while
you know I have these great thigh high
boots that I love if you know already
