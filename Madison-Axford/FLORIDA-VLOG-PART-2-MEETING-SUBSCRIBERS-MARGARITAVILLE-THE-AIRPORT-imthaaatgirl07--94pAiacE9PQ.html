my love culture jeans that have been
washed so I can rewear them and then

really like it's like I work out
material feeling and then it's like this
fake snakeskin and then I love these
cutouts but I better do my makeup so I
will show you that when I am done and on
my parents room because there's like a
mirror and natural lighting and it's
just easier to do my makeup here okay so
I finished my makeup my everyday with an
extra dramatic wing and yes I guess I
will see you at the restaurant so we're
going to Margaritaville again

Cardinals game I mean go cards but like
kinda awkward
it's like Brandi doesn't come in on our
TV this is a mess

me in on a TV here or something so they
like staying there for two seconds and
then be up in 30 seconds and then we'll
hear what happens at the Cardinals yeah
we leave tomorrow to go on a plane again
but yeah so I guess decide for you
tonight but I will see you tomorrow at
the airport this weird this little tiny
airport shifted some into the airport
but dad got stuck in the security line
like five times cuz he brought these
ripped through pocket and they didn't
know what it was and they're like what
is that in your pocket he's like that's
good so we're waiting here and dad also
made us get up early so we could be in
the airport two and half hours early but
nothing to do that very tiny error
