sleazy so I'm really excited to do my
first my hair's crazy but my first fall
look really ever on this channel this is
just a dark nice maybe lip and a dark
purple eye if you want to see how I got
this using all drugstore products and I
first time ever using my infallible
L'Oreal foundation and keep on watching
hey guys I'm started I just got the
shower and so like I'm all fresh and
ready to do a face full base tutorial
helmet here but I am starting with my
talent my hair just because I'm kind of
like towel wrapping and then I'll air
try but I don't use a blow dryer so this
is happening right now sorry about that
so just personally I don't have a big
yellow towel wrapped around my head
anyway today I'm doing it all drugstore
tutorial like I already said in the
intro but yes let's get started I don't
use primer ever I think they just had
another layer of greasy that's under
your skin personally and I don't like it
for my skin but Shea I'm trying it this
is a first impression of L'Oreal Paris's
infallible Pro matte is a foundation
yeah it's foundation not BB cream okay
foundation so excited to try this
um when it still has the seal on it I've
never trusted forever great great great
great things that's why I finally picked
it up and I was a big sense of for the
amount you get okay so much guys squeeze
a little onto my Beauty Blender oh let's
just try this out oh okay
and within the first few seconds you can
see what kind of foundation this is
gonna be it's gonna be amazing
you can tell this look how much that
covers like look at that redness gone
wow okay good see with me in fact I love
this the thing about me and foundations
colors is that I usually just watch the
one on the YouTube who liked this or
something if they have some more skin
shown to me or try to fight a little
sooner
similar skin tone to me then I will just
go out and get that color that they hide
I don't try to match in the store I
don't like to use the ones in the store
the open ones in the store obviously
it's rude so I'll just turn me back so
that's usually why behind are always
really mismatched wow that was so smooth
it just went on so so smooth I love that
let me click this mole it's so big and I
don't know why he isn't rolling but it's
not
anyway random um Wow impressive that was
amazing
I'm going with my new Maybelline master
conceal concealer and I believe this
one's very lucky because I got the
lighter shade so it's more of a
brightening under my eyes I always screw
up guys screw up everything no I always
screw up my under eye concealer color I
always get like way to oranjee and it's
supposed to be you know lighter to be
used as a highlight so that's what I'm
doing with this finally can finally try
to get a good color rather than orange
cuz like I love mate lean fit me but I
always got way too orange so cool taking
my beam under this pointy side going in
under the eyes and blending it all in
out this is gonna be like um a fall kind
of makeup tutorial look
but it's eating oil production the drug
source is amazing because they're all
quite affordable but I do have to say I
do say um that a lot of drugstore is
getting quite expensive and I know like
twenty dollars so I guess a lot more
outside
I know twenty dollars might not be a lot
to a lot of people but me being only
well I just turned 19 and not having
like a total study and coming in like a
happy YouTube but I wouldn't consider
this I can come like I'm lucky enough
enough to pay bills yet because um I
would never be able to pay to buy makeup
I feel like like it's getting kind of
expensive like an eyeliner or mascara is
like always six to seven dollars which
isn't bad if you think by hoeing you'll
have it but I don't know I'm just kind
of getting like ticked off with that I'm
like like drugstore it's supposed to be
the cheap stuff doesn't mean chic
quality it's affordable so it's like a
random talking ranch apparently and then
I'm going to set this all even though it
is a matte foundation um so I'm gonna
side with my favorite covergirl powder
like might go to I don't trust any other
powder it's just it has to be this loose
amazing powder
really said that around the eyes and all
of that concealer because this will help
prevent any creasing so spend the most
time around there again sorry for this
towel I just like I was like over it I
was like I went from a video and if they
don't watch it then they can click off
like this towel should not be bothering
you I'm just trying to show you how I'm
doing my makeup for fall
tell jokester products and the towel is
just mix this rate that's kind of in my
way now I really only use high-end
bronzers but I did find this one from
ELF it's like the teal or sunkissed glow
bronzer in Sunkist and so I'm just gonna
use this because I will not leave my
like high-end bronzers for anything I
don't try any drugstore runs this book
so I'm so cheap and I used it for an elf
tutorial but I'll just use this again
because I do want to keep it all
drugstore and not stray from that this
is a pretty very light light from zoar
like it doesn't give you a lot of great
bronze color but it's good for two
dollars I mean Chewbacca scum and I'm
taking another elf products because I've
been obsessed with up recently if
they're elf blush palette and I'm using
the same color I used in my alpha
tutorial this one right here just a
nightlife school nice light Corley color
that's easily blendable and very
pigmented so you don't even much just
kind of blend that right where I put the
bronzer on and then go back and with my
bronzer brush kind of blend it all out
so nothing is too in-your-face there's
not too much blush and there's not too
much bronzer they're just evenly blended
and colors look beautiful my my hair is
falling out hold on okay we're back in
business
okay okay so since I want to use a
highlighter I'm in love in highlighter
recently but I don't want to use my
expensive Becca one so I'm just gonna
use this L'Oreal I shut up pigments dip
my brush in it rich is from ELF and just
dab it on my got my cheeks I'll put it
in a little V formation
okay then I'm using my ugly colors
eyeshadow palette this is from the
dollar store it's a dollar and it's one
of my favorite brands they're the most
pigmented colors like ever so here's
just a look at all of them and then I'm
going to use this dark color I just my
entire lid color and if I put it on I'm
going to give it a little extra like
primer by putting on this black Rimmel
scandaleyes liner all over the lid just
as a kind of like something forward to
grab onto
you want to keep it below your crease
don't go above the crease okay that's
good enough for now then I'm just going
to take a brush and eye shadow brush
from ELF and just kind of smear it all
in and blend it in and rub it out and
then the same brush I'm just going to
take the color right here in my little
palette and just pack it on top of that
already applied gel eyeliner
okay then once you have it pretty much
even on both sides you are good to go
further on with the eyeliner and lashes
so if the liner I'm just taking elfs
expert liquid liner black and I'm gonna
do a thin line before I apply the lashes
I don't want to overdo with liner
because the eyeshadow is so heavy
so what that is darling I'll show you
the last time you'll be using today
which are my are gel natural lashes in
109 black I love our del lashes they're
just the highest quality lashes I've
ever found so the natural ones they're
not too crazy because I don't want to go
overboard but I do want you to see
lashes and sometimes natural lashes
don't stick out that well when you're
wearing super dark eyeliner like eye
shadow like I am because they just kind
of get lost in the fiasco so I
definitely want you to see lashes so
this doesn't look like an overwhelming
eye look
so that's why I am choosing to with
falsies you don't need to but that's
what I'm doing if you have like with
you're blessed with long lashes then
rock those but I was not or moving the
fact that I cut them off my junior year
on accident so you can put some duo glue
on here and let it dry and get tacky
also well my eyeliners drying I'm gonna
go in with the lashes
I actually don't know if I like these
style bar delicious like they're kind of
pissing me off they kind of look don't
look that cute on let me just go ahead
and apply the other one and I'll deal
with it later and see if I want to keep
these on cuz they're actually really
ugly right now
so fish the eyes and I add mascara but
now I'm just gonna go in with Revlon's
old lipstick called brazen berry which
is a dark purple let's finish this nice
fall look
