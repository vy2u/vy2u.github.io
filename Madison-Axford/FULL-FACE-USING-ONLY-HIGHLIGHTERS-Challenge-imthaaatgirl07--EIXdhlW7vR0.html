hey guys if you want to know how I got
this beautiful highlighted Facebook
using all highlighters keep on watching
just start off I'm going to use my Becca
backlight priming filter I love this
primer I just think it adds such a like
hydrated look already to your skin
without any product so definitely want
to start with this primer for this
challenge I usually just apply it with
fingers because lazy so putting it
everywhere it's also very hydrating for
a primer so I was very happy when I
picked this up rubbing it in
and you can see how much I have a glow
that already gave my face and then
before I go in with just a base which
will be my foundation I'm before the
highlight I'm just gonna use some
Charlotte Tilbury moisturizer because
like my under eyes can get very dry and
cracked and I just want to prep this for
the makeup as well a little bit on my
forehead I love this stuff smells so
good it's very very thick and hydrating
for sure just blending that in as well
usually tapping just so the warmth of my
finger really melts that in so it really
hydrates under my eyes next I'm going to
go in with my foundation is just
Maybelline do we smooth fit me I want to
find I love this foundation but I want
to find one that did specify and being
dewy and that kind of highlighting and
wet looking for at this tutorial so a
little bit on my hand and taking my
morphe M 439 brush I love this for
buffing and foundation it really goes a
long way with a little bit of product
and just taking that and blending it on
off my face such a good coverage
foundation for it like literally five
dollars the direct star
and for anyone who thinks I you fill in
my eyebrows let's just do that
um you couldn't do that if I had filled
them in so thank you they're concerned
but they're real where I consider I
would normally use my Maybelline master
conceal but for the highlighting
challenge I'll be using L'Oreal magic
Lumi highlighter which is a concealer
and it's a little bristle top brush
applicator and just going in with this
heavily under my eyes down bridge my
nose and then to highlight on my Cupid's
bow chin and forehead
of course I would choose to do a makeup
tutorial which is rare for me on days
that I'm like breaking out super oh well
hey wait taking a clean beauty blender
and just going to buff this into my skin
it's not gonna look normal I'm not gonna
wear this out but this is the
highlighting challenge so that's why I'm
sticking with all products that are
either deemed highlighter or dewy at
least so that I've got I see a gleam
glow kit it's my favorite kit ever let
it have everything you could possibly
need you have blushes highlighters and
bronzers all that are under the
highlighter family I'll also be using
some strobe cream from Mac this is just
a trial sight I don't want to put any
primer my eyes because I'll just mattify
those shadows but I am going to be
taking my morphe m4 for one and all like
sparkly shadows I don't wanna go in with
any mattes that'll really distract and
take away from what this it's actually
supposed to be you this challenge so I
guess I'll just start out with makeup
geeks prom night right there my favorite
switch brushes Terrell and manacle
master Pro for this it's gonna be kind
of a masterpiece I'm not using any
transition colors but I just want to go
in right link first off at the heavy
hand of a dark highlighting glimmer
shimmer shadow
so we're just really taking that on
we're not trying to be a perfect beauty
guru right now I just want to kind of
get the essence of a smoky eye on my lid
okay yeah I'm gonna take my Mac 242
brush and spray it with some mac fix+
so it is more dewy and then going in
with and socia
crushed pearl highlighter as my overall
lid shadow just because I feel like this
will show up the most and it looks
beautiful always wear this dozen eye
shadow so it looks very beautiful on
um I would not really not probably wear
this makeup look because I would wear
you know a lot of more matte shades go
this challenge how many times can I say
that but that's why this makeup look
isn't gonna be perfect because I'm not
trying to be perfect right now I'm just
trying to get this on I'm more focused
on the face I feel like this I look okay
now I'm gonna go back in with the morphe
brush that I originally was talking
about just to kind of blend this
together
it's actually not that bad I mean it's
it okay I look freezing to colors that
are both hell of shimmer to make the
highlighter on my lid pop no more I'm
gonna take a two-faced glitter glue and
just pop a little on and then put
eyeliner on top just to make it stick up
that much further
the neck litter glue is just making it
that much more vibrant and like that
much longer lasting because I didn't use
any primer that would mattify the
shadows
it would crease otherwise if I didn't
put this down okay this isn't that bad
we're just like literally not having a
plan with eyeshadow I'm going to use my
girl optic liner because I feel like
it's a little more gleam ear and then
just come on D even though I love it and
I'm going to just draw a thin little
line I don't want a cat eye this I never
do makeup tutorials anymore and this is
why
okay when you have to kind of similar
lines you move on to lashes first on
lash prep I'm taking just my favorite
Urban Decay a black eyeliner to line my
tight line which is in perversion
going in with Too Faced better than sex
waterproof to just kind of give my
lashes a little coat for preparation
before I put on falsies I decided to use
the waterproof one um instead of just
regular better than text because we're
going to be very dewy and spring are
faced with liquids later and we can't
have runny mascara I'm taking my duo
lash adhesive and dark just because this
is one of my favorite lash glue is
personally to use if it works the best
for me and just taking some Ayler things
my lashes and plopping and them on
okay trying to get them on the best you
can
I'm going to go back in and just set my
face and apply all of the highlighting
powders which is my favorite part
because I love highlighter highlighters
like my favorite part of makeup anyway
and now I get to go overboard with us
taking like an elf brush I love this
brush it's like a small tapered brush
and it's just one of my favorites I
found for highlighting I'm going to take
max nylon I would go in with crush
program in my eye but I think this is a
little more of a yellow skin tone
highlighter so I think this will be good
for setting my under eye because I don't
want it to be too highlighted under
there but oh well
you can see that gleam
then I'm going to go in with my ass I
see a clean Kent and just go in with
extreme high lighting up in here I'm
gonna take this net my main g84 fan
brush was just huge and take mimosa
which is just the bronzing color pack a
ton of this on contour and then up in my
temples around my jaw bone in chin as
well just obnoxious just would never
wear this out but I'm going to do it for
the video
there's no right way to do this video
therefore I'm doing it however I want to
yeah then I'm taking my mac emphasized
powder and just putting some in the
middle of my forehead to bring back some
light to my face from all this bronze
iron this looks so obnoxious I'm taking
a rolling Nichole Master Pro brush and
going in with my starburst shade and
saucy palette and brushing this on my
cheeks for that blushed highlight
bringing back some color then going in
with the elf small tapered again and
going on with crushed pearl my favorite
I'm first doing the exclamation point on
my nose putting a toad on my nose we
should see it from space and then
Cupid's bow the arch of my brow right
above that my chin my forehead draw
attention to that though
okay and then I'm going to go back on
with a smaller brush to highlight
contour my nose this is way too big I
can't find a smaller brush right now so
we're just kind of going with this
yes nose contour
clip it Wow look at me go okay I'm
singing a little bit of max strobe cream
just put on my high points of my face
which is definitely Matt cheekbones you
supposed to put this I'm pretty sure as
a primer but this is already hot mess so
let's just put it on top of it the mess
okay I am dead boy I may be better just
to blend that out I'm kind of using it
as a base for like a primer for my
highlight that I'm about to go in with
taking it this one's more the star of
the show and going in with crushed pearl
and just packing that on overtop the
strobe cream that I just laid and then
packing it on right here
I love highlight like right on the
apples of my cheeks man doing a little
more there because I lost a lot of face
when I contoured so heavily I am living
for this look like if I went out would
people think it was weird or would they
be like okay it's like number one rule
in the beauty book - not quite a light
shimmer shadow under your eyes cuz it
make sure I look really tired and like
they're like sickly so I'm gonna do it
mmm yes which I do shy to do this shader
here shimma shimma shimma shimma from
makeup geek it's not really gonna pick
up much but I will put that on there to
start so have to bring a little bit of
color back to this under eyes I guess I
will just take on Grand Stand from
makeup geek and go in under my thighs to
finish this look so cut has the same
similar color tones as my eye look so
right here I've hit pan on it quite a
bit
whoops
yes for Madison we're doing good
I'm taking my better than sex two-faced
waterproof again on my lower lashes
I love how I'm technically take this
major wheel so serious and still when I
look worse than clowns I'm actually a
little Mac give me Sun bronzer to put on
top of the assessee when I use just
because I love this I've never got to
use it and it's very dark so mm-hmm
bring back a light to the cheeks just
casual okay lipstick I'm using myth by
Mac but it's so nude and kind of a
washes away my lips
okay then I'm going to put on two
members this covergirl melted toffee my
favorite lip gloss ever and Pink's on
this on for that gleam that we need
sleep I love this brush it's my blush
brush from Real Techniques and I just
love to set it real quick down here with
a little powder that I put on there
because this student highlight and it's
gonna crease like a mother if I don't
set it I think
ladies and gentlemen we were done it's
quite you take my do is spray ever which
is Mac prep and prime fix plus setting
spray and just say bath
