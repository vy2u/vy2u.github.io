try on haul of these are really fun to
do I never used to do hauls and I feel
like it's my prominent video on my
channel as a whole it's like always a
haul I've always doing a haul but um I
do you enjoy watching them and I do hope
you like the try an aspect of them I
think it's more fun to see what I
actually got
on how it fits if you want to buy it you
can see whether or not it's worth it
stuff like dad because just holding
something up you don't really do the
shape form or the fit from it so that is
why I do with the try um house in
fashion house when my favorite online
websites a link down below if you don't
know who they are I'm sure you do
there's over like two million followers
Instagram and like it's just a huge
amazing website with clothes that are
true to what the picture is on the
website that's what you get so um yeah
I'm really excited so Kay in the u.s. in
case you're wondering so shipping is
pretty fast within a week to week and a
half they usually arrest my house or
sooner but um yeah so the further ado
let's get into the try on haul first I
got these shoes at work size seven if
you didn't know look at them look at
this turquoise beautifulness oh my god
they're chunky heel um they're like
wedges almost like your toes show it has
the double straps that have crossed over
and links in the buckles I think they're
just adorable like they are so me so
beautiful and agree it's like statement
piece if you want to stick it with black
and white for clothing and then a pop of
color for shoes so I really really enjoy
these they are a little snug I'm just
gonna warn you I do or say someone and
everything but not that I would get into
some and a half but these were a little
snug and I whether the first time so
they will stretch but just be careful of
that when purchasing but yes I really
really um love these they're by the
brand Cape rubbin so there you go next I
have what I have on this is a matching
set kind of like the leggings that I
always get I love those leggings it's a
short set as with a crop top um tank top
hooded so the top matching top is a
hooded crap top and then these are the
shorts so we able to see how they fit
better in the Tryon hole I really enjoy
these because they're super stretchy
they're kind of like in the leggings the
Wanderlust leggings and I always wear
because of the fit they're very
form-fitting and stretchy so pretty much
any butt size or any like hip waist size
or whatever can fit into these shorts no
matter really what size you get
they're very stretchy material and
they're very forgiving and I really love
them for that and when I saw these they
looked like the leggings I have the pink
and pink and grey so as I have to get
those so I did then I got a bad rep
jacket it's like a black with a gold
zipper detailing down the entire front
with a peplum bottom I did think this
was gonna be a little more sturdy of
material I love it it's very lightweight
but I didn't think I was gonna be like
that I thought it's going to be very
like thick and I don't know just heavy
coat like material and this is more of a
shirt almost so I do still like it and I
actually do like lightweight things
better because I find myself choosing to
wear them more often than heavy duty
well lighting then heavy duty jackets
but um yeah so this one thing to be
careful with this it's not a jacket
jacket even though it says better up
jacket it's more like almost like a
sweater um
shirt then I was really into pants the
shipment so I just kept choosing pants
first I got these black ones
super super adorable and super stretchy
that's another great thing about this it
feels almost like it's not a jegging
it's not a legging what it feels like
that so don't be like oh it's a fake
Jean jeggings no they are jeans for sure
but they feel so soft and stretchy and
again very easy to wear and bend around
in and walk in so when one leg has this
huge huge cutout on by the knee and then
the other side is just like little rips
all the way down I just really like
these very edgy not a normal chain
choice for me but I do enjoy wearing
them the next thing is very weird thing
for me cuz I'm not indeed boyfriend
jeans shorts usually but you try seeing
to my Instagram here they are they're
big all the way down I thought they
would be shorter so I'm very happy that
they actually go all the way down
there's rips on the front and back I am
amazed with that I love I've never seen
jeans to have rips on both sides I
really do enjoy wearing these they're a
little big they're by the brand machine
but they are a little bit big so I
didn't have to pair a belt with it just
to hold it up on my waist to make them
more high-waisted then low-rise I do
really like these their size ones so be
careful they do run quite big in my
opinion I love the ribs they're a little
tricky to put on because there's holes
on both sides but once you get them on
you look so so cool and badass and I was
living in this see I'm telling I got all
these jeans then just blue jeans with no
ribs I didn't have a pair of jeans
without grips and I was a girl you get
your together when you get your
wardrobe all packed full with actual G
the doing of ropes you know I didn't
have like genes that could be worn fancy
or dressed up because they all have rips
therefore making them casual and not
professional but these are just a nice
blue dark washed denim jean with kind of
stretchy feel again I love that about
fresh ANOVA's jeans and clothing in
general and it's by fashion of a brand
and they're just no rips totally just a
staple piece of anyone's wardrobe that I
didn't have so I had to get that last
Jean thing I got my goodness is these
high-waisted black shorts I have a lot
of pairs of shorts that are high waisted
and acid wash but I didn't have any just
again plain colored shorts that were
high waisted I had low-rise blue ones
and the high-waisted black jeans shorts
that I did have we're getting way too
short in my butt was hanging out I was
not cute so these look a little longer
for it a short which I'm very happy with
I'm hoping it'll like kind of cover my
entire about this side because I don't
want to see that walking around that's
not cute not classy not good so I got
these and I hope for the best that
they'll still fit me for many summers to
come then I got this romper my friend
Mohini actually was me get this excited
know was to like get and she's like if
they kidding in it and I'm like I'm not
a huge fan of rompers naturally um but
you know what this one was very cute I
like this topi like tan color and it's
not the shoulder I love the cold
shoulder trend that's going on right now
I have a lot of stuff like that and I
love how my shoulder she can be like hey
um I get I love the color that's what
made me fall for it and then I love the
robbers from Kesha Nova because the legs
of the robbers aren't super wide I hate
when robbers have legs are like this
long it makes it look like a skirt dress
almost no this is a proven romper and I
really really enjoy this as a cinched
waist kind of a peasant look and I
really like this um and the color is
just everything I love brown nudes
um tan colors the last thing I got I'm
super excited about this Clint
inspiration dress size small and it's a
black and white just beautifully
geometric almost shape design on the
stress very very um squishy almost
material very stretchy as have a deep
v-neck plunge I love those about fashion
Nova they do provide the best mood
iPhone shorts and dresses if you know
what I mean this is super all the way
down in the back to make sure you can
get in okay and I just really really
love this I think it's very fancy
yet you can dress it down if you want to
wear
I have rode with Ruth's heels and I have
a lot of events coming up that I would
love to wear this to so I'm glad I
picked that out I'm glad I got all this
I'll just go on there even if I'm not
gonna buy anything just look there new
look at the new arrivals or just shop
that Instagram and it's so fun because
their clothes are incredible and exactly
my style which is like the type odd calm
thing that is kind of my style I you
know I'm classy but like I like wearing
stuff that's form-fitting and that's a
fashion Nova prides me and millions
other people with so definitely check
that whether or not you're gonna buy
anything to check it out it's really
fine go time to on some music online
shop is great but yes it's not ready to
subscribe my channel become a fierce
cover to do like me and the rest of us
