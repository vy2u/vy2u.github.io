favorites I can't believe I'm already
doing another favorites video I know I
just put up my January one and I was
sick you believe February's over now
like crazy I know now mega products is
definitely definitely dominated this
month I have six makeup products in one
hair product and then like just a random
favourites you know you got to have your
music and apps in there and I'm really
excited to show you guys this so without
further ado let's get into my favorites
video sorry it's a little late okay
let's go I'm going to start with the
hair product first and I just recently
got it if you follow my instagram you'd
see that I got it um in I guess it was
februari 28 there's last name febuary
and I put a picture a little later
because I just I'm bad my Instagram
pictures I don't like Instagram them
right away like I'm not like to picture
Instagram it's like two days three days
or four days later I'll be like oh yeah
that picture yeah I guess I could put it
up now so it's like that's not like
instantly what I got that day but I did
get it anyway um sorry for that long
explanation if this was in a picture I
posted on Instagram from a target haul i
got i didn't do a whole video just
because I feel like I put too many halls
and I didn't want to like show you guys
another whole video anyway this is
tresemme fresh start dry shampoo for
oily straight to normal hair and I don't
use this as a dry shampoo particularly
because I don't know I'm just I haven't
kind of freak when it comes to this I
should wash my hair every day or I know
it strips the nutrients blah blah blah
but i feel gross my body feels
disgusting and it's really refreshes and
replenishes me when I do take a shower
so I feel the need to take one every
night um but this is item use it for a
dry shampoo obviously because I brushed
my hair every day so there's no need
there's no like Greece I need to hide
but I use this for extra volume and
sometimes it even works as like um like
a serum to put your hair or a hair
spread yet calm your hair down and it
covers up any Gracie may have but I mean
I take showers so um quite often so I
don't frankly need this for dry shampoo
I use this just to add extra volume lift
not make your hair so flat and make it
you know very polished and purty I'm
really enjoying it for the few days I've
had it but I thought
put it in this video because I can wait
that long to put it in my March even
though i got it in five you yeah okay
next pirata its benefits lemonade now
this is like a love hate relationship
with this thing I loved it when I first
got it in New York which I feel like
I've gotten everything that I ever had
in New York because L my video is my
kind of from New York I loved it at
first then I didn't like it was making
me like really yellow cuz it is a yellow
color and I was just making me really
yellow and like leader and because i was
using BB cream that's when i went to BB
cream and I wasn't BB cameras covering a
trikes this is a in color correcting
primer stuff and I do use this under my
eyes in this month I have just been like
really sick of these dark circles under
my eyes so I started using this again
and I absolutely love it it seriously
works amazing guys if you have a heavy
duty foundation that you put over top of
like primer a concealer then I would
definitely recommend this is only twenty
dollars it's one of the cheaper benefit
products and I love benefits my favorite
ion product company thing and so yes
again this is lemonade and it says
eyelid primer but I don't use it for
that you can buy sit underneath my eyes
because it works super great to hide
dark circles and gives you a nice yellow
a huge is bright and makes your eyelids
look quite ok it's just a really great
product you should definitely check out
super cheap for high-end product what is
this video next product expert is baby
lips I've tried a lot of these but this
one is really appealing to me it's fit
number 15 cherry me this is a really
nice like red color band it's kind of
more pink I don't know it's not you know
bright red or bright pink oh my leg just
cracked it too huh it's really really
nice it's not too dark knight 299 at
drugstore and they're just amazing
they're great moisturizing lip balm they
give your lips color and attend to but
not too dramatic of a look but I have it
on right now you can see that I'm like
it looks like I'm wearing something
that's not to like Oh what she wear it
my next product is my ulta Beauty
Blender sponge and this is covers my
foundation on the top so it's originally
like this pinky samedi color but my
foundations on the top so excuse that my
foundation looks really dark on this but
I promise it's not like that it looks
like really dark I went to choice
because I saw a lot of beauty gurus put
this on and they said give them really
nice natural precise looking foundation
and I'm when saying other than my
stippling and foundation pointer brushes
so I got this and it
is really nice apparently are supposed
to use a flat end but I used to like
pointy end to get out of my eyes and
around the hard spots and spun so nicely
I've noticed my foundation doesn't look
as cakey it really blends in and it's
just super soft and squishy and spongy
and I just really like this um it's good
to always switch it up and give you
brushes a break eventually give this a
break in Washington stuff like that but
um the only bad thing is i had washed
this and it's still left to the
foundation residue color it there's
nothing there's no residue on it but
like the color of its kind of stained it
so if you're one that just like stained
things I wouldn't recommend it but I
don't really care cuz this is my
foundation it doesn't like give off that
color because it is wash I just turned
that color feel like this video is
trying to like a vivacious blog like
seriously it's just like Oh Sees that
beeping it's my door um it's just like a
put your band playing next week have
great lash lots of no not lots of watch
this medicine oh great lash clear
translucent transparent I read you um
yeah tons people tried this um recently
in there like January favorites video so
I was like having a good i just love
maybelline in general this is this is
just it's so good to tame them it's just
a nice little brush I'm just kind of
like brushing on like that okay the last
two products the first one is something
that is just amazing that I found this
because I've always have trouble finding
primers and blushes but this is an
almost smart shade perfect correct
primer now at first I didn't really like
it because I thought it was weird this
like it has purple and green like DNA
looking things in here and it comes out
purple and green like a mixture of them
comes out because if you don't know like
the colors that you're supposed to use
its concealers are like purple and green
like I have a green concealer because
you're not was supposed to use skin tone
because this is like color correcting
green and purple you i gotthis i used it
for a week and it absolutely fell in
love with its I've been using it
everyday it's a little more expensive
because it is all my which is a
higher-up drugstore brand like
physicians formula and stuff well I
consider it to be one but it really does
make my foundation stay on longer I've
changed my foundation routine again and
I need to put up an update every day and
make sure looks have changed it a lot so
on new products but I use the primer of
the PD blending sponge in the next
product you just give a super flawless
look um I think a foundation which is
different from my usual cake eNOS which
I hated and I needed some definite
changes so I spent a little extra dough
and got some
good results from my face the last
makeup product is near to Gia's skin
clearing oil free makeup I mean
obviously makeup like was that necessary
meza know anyway it's just foundation in
the shade classic ivory number 10 is the
lightest shade of course and it's still
like really tan on me sound like huh
it's like Shay died I couldn't like
because like people be like ye trying to
look so tan I'm like it's the lightest
shade I'm not trying to look tan oh come
at me bro this has definitely done what
it says skin clearing oil-free my skin
has cleared up because it was getting a
little bad um for a while they're kind
of scaring me but I got this it was like
twelve thirteen dollars at target I got
it and it's seriously amazing like baby
baby 44 had this of course I had to get
it she's one of my favorites beauty
group so I had to get it and it just it
has the most amazing coverage it
seriously look so like real and natural
it doesn't look like you had foundation
or cake eNOS or anything on it seriously
the most amazing condition I've ever
tried i definitely recommend it um if
you're one who has like a lot of you
know accident acne acne scarring um
redness dark circles this seriously
covers everything it blends so nicely
I'm very happy with what i found this
month so those are my makeup products so
um this aranda this is this the most
random thing ever so if you look really
scared by this I'm sorry but I had to
put it in here okay so when I went to
New York huh what did you wreck again
uh-huh sing them to get oh no much in
New York in September of 2012 um I just
picked this up because I thought it was
really inspirational and I didn't know
much about Bob Marley but I just kind of
like this I'd heard about him and I want
kind of one to do like some research
about in stuff like that so this is an
actual poster I got off a street vendor
I freaking love street vendors because
they like sell everything I got so many
like poachers um so this is like a
three-tier poster and it just says one
good thing about music when it hits you
feel no pain and so has that one now I'm
can in this with a little signature on
the bottom this was ten dollars and I'm
just so happy I got this i love the
colors that are in this and um I need a
much bab him at the time so i got this
and i really like it now because I
this month a Fabio airy Oh new phone
case by the way huh um the month of
heavy worry I've just become obsessed
with it I loved the person he was and
what he stood for and I'm not gonna get
into like some super like like long
speech about him and stuff and his like
legit and all that stuff I'm not gonna
get into that because it'll be a lot of
controversy but I really like his music
is absolutely incredible and these
quotes and what he said and I like about
life and just oh my god i have one of
his quotes written on my arm right now
and I really want to get a tattoo it's
also on my phone um screen it says you
never know how strong you are until
being strong is your only choice I just
love that I just think that explains me
so well I just I just love it so moving
on to why I randomly showed that poster

him I got his whole album legend deluxe
version audition these music is just so
inspiring I can't even tell you like you
need to let's do it if you have a list
