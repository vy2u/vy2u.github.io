stand away there's an honest but your
baby's bday party hey girl wait I can
shop in our department get my money
planet Felucia to get that Lana hey so
today I'm doing my in February favorites
because it's such a nice day outside I
just had to come out here because it's
March and it's beautiful so why not come
outside the winds probably blowing it's
probably crooked cuz i'm filming on a
hill but you know despite all that we're
just it it's a good day we're not gonna
let this negativity bring us down we're
gonna look at the positive things in
life so anyway I know it's a week into
March uh-huh but who can forget
February's a great month love but I
didn't find that many favorites during
februari so I thought it wouldn't be a
big deal to do this video because it's
just like some products that I've been
liking you know and even though it's
like nine days past when februari ended
we can still do this it'll be all fine
and dandy and I have some really great
products that i want to show you that i
just loved loved loved during this month
so that further ado let's get into my
febuary favorites the first favorite up
februari for me is I think it's a repeat
offender I don't know if I've had it in
a favorites video before but I know
talked about it before I used it in my
homecoming to make up tutorial it's my
Tarte Amazonian clay foundation and I do
have a decently darker than my skin tone
shade it's in light medium sand three
words so if you're looking for it in the
store that's the color i have um but the
thing that I love about this it's so
thick and i know tons people would hate
that especially for spring break or
summer but i just really like it because
my cheeks are so red and i want
everything to be covered on my blemishes
and my acne if i have any at the moment
or just really my eggs but my red cheeks
it really bothers me i know some people
like it but I don't like how it looks on
me and I like to
my skin tone all even and not so
discolored and red so I do use this and
I love it because full coverage it lasts
forever it's like a 12-hour thing for
the last so long and it's better than
any foundation I've ever tried it is
expensive it's like 38 forty dollars at
melchester forever ever but i love the
tart brand that products seem to last
and stay on a nut crease or smudge or
wear off so I do love that I really been
loving this and I just know I drew put a
lot on but I mean it makes me feel
confident so people often say like it's
your makeup looks cakey you were too
much foundation but you know if it makes
you feel good if it makes me feel good
I'm gonna do it that's what I like to do
this would I feel strong proud and
confident so you know that's what I'm
gonna wear but anyway I love this if you
have a lot of acne or you just want
really good coverage definitely check
out the Tarte Amazonian clay foundation
it's like some weird whistling bird out
he wrote anyway the next favorite is a
new neutrogena face wash I love
neutrogena face products but I tried a
different face wash this time rather
than the foaming face cleanser blue
container one I tried the Neutrogena
naturals and i didn't think i would like
it but i really love it it's a foaming
scrub and it's so exfoliating and grainy
and I love grainy textures because you
just I don't know I just feel like it
cleans my skin so much more it gets rid
of dead skin and dead particles and this
helps ask me because there's so much
cells so like acid and it's great I've
noticed a lot of clearing up in my skin
and it just gets rid of so much like
gross stuff on your face your face just
feels so smooth clean and like new and
natural like after you're done using
this I use it every day in the shower
and it's just amazing I really want to
check out more of the Neutrogena and
naturals products because I've always
just used you know regular products by
neutrogena and I never checked the this
like natural little side brand by them
but um yeah I really really been
enjoying this the next minute they have
I was very conflicted whether or not I
shouldn't buy it and I finally did cuz
baby lips they've always been okay I
haven't been a huge fan of the colors
that like the colors add to offer with
the original baby lips like
I didn't really like that much there
were two dark and bright and me on and I
was just like not really into any of
that but then the doctor rescue Baby
Lips came out and I was so like I said
conflicted weather and I should I should
buy this because a huge ingredient in
these days menthol and I hate the taste
of menthol I just hate that and I knew I
wouldn't like it if I bought this but I
finally picked it up in the color coral
crepe I love coral colors it was between
this one in a pink one but I decided on
the coral because it was kind of more me
and it's just like an everyday little
lipstick I put on its so moisturizing
and I did not think I would like it like
I said cuz the menthol flavor but you
can barely taste it at all I smelt it
and I was like okay oh I smell Mendel
and then I put on my lips and it's like
not even there and it really just makes
me love so moisturize and adds color I
love tinted moisturizer lip balm things
I don't like lipsticks that much and I
don't like just chapstick so these I
kind of like my color reach lip balms
but these are more like moisturizing
almost like more to save your chapped
lips and I haven't I chapped lips this
entire winter because my great lip
products this year so i'm very happy i
found a lot of them this year check out
the dr rescue again i did not think I
would like it at all but I really have
been enjoying it provides amazing color
and it doesn't taste like menthol
whatsoever and I would notice if it did
in the last product I told you I didn't
have that many is my wet brush excuse
this there's probably hair we're gonna
cover that up so that's kind of gross
but okay the wet brush I used to dread
because I take a shower every day you
don't owe you really should cuz I mean I
know it's like good for your hair
whatever but I literally cannot go a day
without taking a shower I feel
disgusting greasy gross sweaty whatever
so I take a shower every day and I used
to dread when my hair cuz it's so plump
and there's to be so many tangles and
knots and I hated it but yours that's
right now um but I finally picked up a
wet brush which I was also like I didn't
know if I want to try it or not I heard
mixed reviews about it but so many
people were trying it and loving at my
sister even had it but i think that the
pink Lanka's pink is my favorite color
and i love this it literally makes
brushing your hair and not bad at all
Wow

month of februari but quickly I'm going
to move on to my four favorite songs

I have to give a shout out so I can't
wait a whole month to tell you about
this song oh my god fancy by Iggy Azalea
featuring Charli XCX oh my god this song
is literally life it's really some
people would think it's really annoying
it's literally me though so it's such a
jam it's like my music in wrapped in one
song it's a rap pop you know that kind
of stuff and um the music video it's
just incredible its base top clueless
which is my favorite movie obviously if
you didn't know that it is I have two
copies of it two copies of the movie
it's my favorite and it's like a hope
not a parody cuz it's not making fun of
clueless but it's just like clueless

Iggy Azalea and it's amazing this song
is so so so good you should definitely
check it out I just love it I can't wait
