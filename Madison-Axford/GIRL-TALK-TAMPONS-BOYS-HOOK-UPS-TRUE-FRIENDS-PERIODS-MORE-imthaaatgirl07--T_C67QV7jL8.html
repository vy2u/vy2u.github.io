these are so fun to do because while
usually I'm with my girls like Audrey
Mackenzie but they're not here today so
it's just me but that's okay
I can still answer questions from just
my point of view my perspective my
answers my opinions so have further ado
let's get into your questions I left
this really awkward picture on me oh
yeah this menu iPad Mini by the way I
got it on Black Friday
I'll car that's all that bottom Black
Friday so I don't needed to do a black
head at all because this is it okay
black firehall in and Girl Talk in one I
love this really awkward picture of me
on Instagram it's the only one I had my
picture role that I live it hadn't
posted yet because I want to do a girl
child Q&amp;amp;A kind of thing that really Q&amp;amp;A
but like any questions you have about
growing up being a girl and I got a lot
of questions so I'm excited to answer
these because like I said I wish I said
this is like my post I wish I had I mean
I asked my mom some and of course but
like just some really awkward questions
and like some of you might not be
comfortable with your mom or not even
have a mom and I'm very sorry for that
and so that's why I'm here I'm gonna try
answer your questions to the best of my
ability my ex and I are fighting and he
is with another girl I still a feelings
from what joy do you move on you need to
move on you are better than that come on
girl come on girl I know what you mean I
know well actually no cuz I've never had
feelings for my exes cuz things and
pretty bad for me I don't know what that
is it's just me I add things bad like
nobody know what I mean it's like I
would never be friends with my ex so I
would never still be talking to him but
you say you an extra fighting you're
done is he's your extra reason move on
he's move on stop all communication with
him if you're fighting cuz that's not
what's supposed to happen is either your
friends uh or you're not you don't speak
you know I mean you can't really you
know you either are on good terms or on
bad terms not fighting that's why the
relationship probably ended so there
should not be fighting still happening
because you are not dating anymore um
he's with another girl then he needs to
move on she'll probably see that he's
kind of an asshole apparently um you
shouldn't have feelings from I know you
can't help feeling his girl and I love
you but think about what it's doing to
you and what he here's another girl
ready so you need to pick yourself up
take a shower eat some food and find a
new guy
you don't need him he's dirty laundry
and he needs to be washed this is a
great question what is the best way to
sleep when you are on your period
without making a mess I think a lot of
guys do - I think this is such a good
question but it's not because as girls
we know that it's it's a show it's
just so annoying when we're on our
periods but we have to do it I don't
sleep in a tampon I think that's too
dangerous
I wear tampons all the time but sleeping
there's just something about it I feel
like I might not wake up and then get
toxic shock syndrome and die so I choose
not to do it you can if you only sleep
eight hours or less but then again
you're risking it so why would you do
that the best thing to do is just always
put a towel down like it's literally not
that big of a deal just put a child out
in case something were to happen in the
Swart huge pad like they have big pads
you don't need to wear like tiny panty
liners like get a big-ass frickin pad
looks like a diaper I usually only wear
that for one or two nights because my
flow is not heavy the hole is 670 days
but where for the you know one to seven
whatever honey nights you need it where
that and then put a tag on is the best
way I've never had used the towel a the
towels never been had blood on it from
me but it happens all the time to
everyone so that's just a security
blanket just in case God would not have
given us periods if the award meant to
happen they're supposed to happen
they're not gross or natural in a
beautiful because they allow us to have
babies okay next should you forgive a
guy he says he's going to change it
depends what he did cheated on you know
by if he did something like he talked
back or he like said you're being moody
or you're a bitch I guess you could I
think that's with anyone even a
friendship or anyone really I'm gonna
change don't believe it until you
actually see it and it sticks because
someone could lie someone could change
for a day
things happen happens but if you
see a change genuine change in a person
then yeah sure forgive a guy girl
whichever we float or a girl or a guy in
a friendship but if it's something
serious the point where you were crying
or you're so upset about it no I
wouldn't forgive them you can find
someone so much better who won't wronged
you but it depends how severe whatever
they did to you was how can you tell
someone is a fake friend when they don't
look out for your best interests I
always knew that we can't change F for
good friends
I don't know I just felt like when I was
around them I didn't have to pretend to
be someone I wasn't I could go in and be
like hey guys are my best friends and
they would accept me and they wouldn't
be like I'm sorry your makeup was a
little on today or am i guys like what
like they weren't fake and they wouldn't
go run around and tell other people
stuff about me or stuff I told them and
so you know a fake friend when they
spread rumors about you when they talk
about you because you shouldn't be
talking about me unless I am there and
you're talking about me to me like what
the hell is my name in your mouth when
I'm not there
cuz it's one girl always had my name in
her mouth and I was like hi could you
kindly remove my name because it doesn't
like being in your mouth
oh and that's how I quickly found out
she was a fake friend it very very fake
backstabbing bitch of a friend
um but yeah literally the way I feel
around McKenzie in the way real
I feel round chef I don't have to try
and that's what it is just an amazing
feeling where it's kind of like almost
like family because you're just like you
can act like a goofball I can act like a
weirdo you can fail you can succeed you
can do whatever and they still love you
and accept you we want to be friends
with you and and and I have found a
friend it's LUMO honey and I love her
and and it's wonderful because I can act
like a goofball in front of a reckon act
like my YouTube self which is more put
together or not like no in class in
front of her and she accepts both and
she loves both I hope so I love you girl
and I'm glad that I found someone up to
the standards I set my friends because I
have Mackenzie and Jef and I look at new
friends and see if they meet the
standards of my old friends because I
have lost so many friends I've had so
many backstabber friends and somebody
fake friends so many friends for the
wrong reasons and so when I found my
honey it was like another friend I've
sent some friends but friends who I can
count on how do you get over next
boyfriend okay he's an ex for a reason
he is an ex for a raise then move on if
you broke up with them and then you
should already be moved on because
you're over it if you broke up with you
like what the heck douchebag move on oh
my god I know it can be hard if he's
loving girls like
but I'm just like people you both either
you can you either Road knows him or
here they brought it with you like hmm
you gotta be pissed you're gonna be sad
and then you move on I hate these feel
like a be good take me back no not take
me back and I was that girl once I wrote
a freaking novel okay hold on story time
I wrote okay and written this book just
like stapled I think naturally I like
tied together with yarn book for one of
my ex people trying to get his
friendship his trust his relationship
that he had with my back because I care
so much about it when really it just
crashed and burned for the 80th time and
I should have moved on a hell of a lot
earlier than I did from that
relationship but I just kept me back
into it it just kept becoming more and
more of a Mets and what with toxic
relationship in friendship and and into
my relationship and so I just need to
move on you need to move on if things
crash and burn a few times it should be
a sign what do I do if a guy no what do
I do if I like guy but he is always too
shy to open up about his feelings um I
have liked and a nut dated per se of a
lights a lot of guys that were shy and
when make the first move which can be
kind of irritating sometimes but you
just got to be the bigger person that if
you really want this relationship to
work you want to date him or her you
know which every float go up to them and
be like doing it is what this is the key
this is what I always say okay I hear me
up here okay okay we're chillin if you
like him and you want to see things go
somewhere say hey you wanna hang out
sometime if he says okay there you go
let's see where things go okay one step
at a time one such time slow it steady
wins the race if you say anyone a half
some time he says no I haven't a view
for it with this guy I tried numerous
times to get with and he was like no and
I was like bye why am I wasting my time
do not waste your time you should tell
him especially if he's trying he's not
gonna make the first move because
otherwise you are just wasting your time
girl you have software stuff to do it so
many better guys to see if he doesn't
wanting out with you okay so if he says
yes hang out um then see where things go
from there and then maybe express your
feelings a few dates in or a few hangout
sessions in she says no move on
is it okay and date your best friend's
boyfriend after the breakup okay um if
Mackenzie dated mum one of my exes
would be like the flow at the same time
I wouldn't really care about the I
wouldn't care about the fact that they
were dating I would be scared the same
things that went down with me and him
what happened with her now and and I
care about my best friend so the only
reason I would say no to that is because
I care about her and don't wanna get her
don't want her to get hurt I know it's
always like girl car like Mean Girls and
stuff like oh my god you can't date next
but I personally don't see a problem
with it I just wouldn't want my friend
to get hurt because I know I broke up
with them or they broke up with me for a
reason so I didn't work out and I know
that I've got sucked about it to her
before and stuff so it would just be
weird I think would be the word not like
bad or anything but I think it would
just be really awkward and I wouldn't
want her to have to go through the same
thing how to let people go when you know
they're bad for you aka toxic friend um
when I started you would start to ignore
their calls and I subtweet them that's
so bad but that's what I that's how I
honestly got rid of these people in my
life that I didn't want anymore
uh you should I guess you couldn't rent
them but I'm like they don't even
deserve that from me so I'm gonna hope
you get the message from this because I
know you stalked my Twitter and then um
yeah bye
how to deal with parents I love my mom
but you can get annoying sometimes what
can I do when she gets on my nerves also
I'm a freshman in high school you are
going to miss your mom more than
anything when you leave as a freshman in
college so I know I know parents can
seem irritating at the time being but
they're really not they're looking out
for your best interest and they care
about you and whatever little thing your
mom I do that annoys you just know your
boy knowing the hell out of her - so it
goes both ways probably and um I mean
yeah pants are always annoying sometimes
with so our kids and I think I took so
long for me rose on my coming on my
pants are brewed no they're not at all
they're trying to give everything they
can for you and to help you so thank
just like one second before you go off
on your mom the next time or you off on
your dad or whatever like think like
also they don't for you it's not worth
that parents are so much more special
than I think we deem them out to be what
is your type of guy I like to think my
guy is like dark mysterious Oh bad boy
but I always somehow fall for like tiny
little like nerd guys I don't know what
it is but I always have crushes on bad
guys
and then I like date do not bad guys but
nothing has ever worked out to Mandy or
flip them apparently do you think that
every person has the one that's meant
for them or do you think there's a few
people that you could be happy with them
that's a great question I don't think
there's one person for everyone um I
think that would just be kind of
ridiculous I don't know I just don't
believe and I don't think like my one
special person is out there right now I
think once you're happy with her
comfortable with her you're confident
with we're just in love with and I think
you can be in love with many people I
mean you know some people go through
many breakups in their life before they
find the person they end up with I don't
think it's the one I think it's whoever
you feel most comfortable with in that
Pony life and then you just grow them
there and you get to live life together
and love that my best friend says she
likes my boyfriend and wants me to break
up with him but I really like him what
should I do I'm sorry that's not a best
friend that's not even an acquaintance
who the hell says that a best friend
should be supportive and should not try
to tell you to break up the women so
that they can get together I'm sorry no
bye our periods really as bad as they
sound no you get used to it I've had
mine for two years now what do I have to
tampon in your Gucci do you think that
you can date some of that is four years
older than you age 16 me okay you're 16
he's 20 I think once you get past 18
it's fine I think 16 is a little it I
think 17 is the legal age actually is it
is it not so near 18 I don't know I
don't think that's legal but I think
once you get past like 18 19 I think
it's really matter number wise unless
it's like 20 years even like 10 years
little yeah but it becomes less
important and less serious and like less
law dealing with the law after 18 and 19
I think that's a little young honey I'm
sorry but I think that's low young how
can you get over a guy that you like
asking someone else our just know that
it's not your guys's time if it's gonna
happen it will happen God will make it
happen if it's supposed to happen with
him and he supposed to ask you out it
was not in the mean too
you know don't dwell on it literally
just pick yourself back up and live the
happy single life or try to find someone
else to dedicate time to you know is it
good on your boyfriend tells you he's
not going to tell anyone else that
you're dating I'd say no I think that's
a bad thing you should be proud happy
and want to show you off to his friends
you should not be hiding it or saying
these not gonna tell anyone like was he
embarrassed then you combined someone
else better for you like that's that
shouldn't be a secret relationship that
no what is the worst thing a fake friend
has done to hurt you broke up a
relationship I was in with a guy because
I don't know why because she's a psycho
and she tried to ruin me so many times
and it didn't work so which is you get a
bra I think we should get a bra when you
can see like your nipples through your
shirt like if if there is like some
boobage forming I think you should ask
your mom politely if you could go
shopping - mom's bra maybe a sports bra
a little flat broad let thing something
because no one's seen nipples that's not
cute and when you're little they don't
like just a guy as much but when your
boob starts to grow then I push it
against the shirt shows the nipple and
that's not cute so therefore ask your
mom nicely and see if she'll let you or
you could do is you could put like if
she doesn't let you for some reason I
don't know why is she one that's weird
um put like pieces of tape over every
nipple I done that before like when I
didn't have a bra just to like tape the
NIP down so it's nut saying hi and
everyone I just take a patter tampon to
the bathroom I don't have problem with
this cuz I don't give a crap I literally
walked out in my classroom the other
last shoe I think was two weeks ago I
think when I was my period and I grabbed
a tampon and just like walked a class
like with it right here like I was like
like I'm not embarrassed I think it's
just my self-confidence though um but
what you can do is just like slip it
under your shirt and like kind of into
your pants skirt jeans leggings sweat
whatever you're wearing it should kind
of like hold your arm by and just walk
by you know it's not that big easy like
we're gonna be like okay I don't even so
