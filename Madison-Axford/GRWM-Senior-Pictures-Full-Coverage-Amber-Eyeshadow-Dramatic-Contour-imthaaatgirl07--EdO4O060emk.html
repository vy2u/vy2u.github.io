hey so today I'm doing a very exciting
video it's a makeup tutorial but it's
for senior pictures I already had my
senior pictures done but I'm doing the
exact look that I used in put on myself
the day of my senior pictures we love
doing makeup tutorials so I thought it
would show you what I wore when I
thought you seen your pictures and when
I thought of what I like to wear and do
for my senior pictures I knew I wanted
to stick to very natural this eye shadow
is not really natural but what I mean by
that is I don't want to get all big
poofy hair all really big curls I didn't
wanna do a deep smoky eye I want to kind
of stick to things that I kind of did
every day as a senior it made me look
like my senior year because some I think
I've seen your pictures I list in my
mind I want to think back and look back
and be like oh that's what it looks like
when I was a senior oh I just didn't
want to get super super super glam dark
makeup you know I wanted to keep it kind
of simple natural fresh-faced teenage
area senior you know
so let's look I'm gonna do for you today
this is a great senior picture look for
you know anyone really this doesn't
matter your skin tone your eye color
whatever my hair Cinnabon right now it's
drying just got at the shower but I
couldn't just sit around and wait for my
hair to air dry I need to film a video
so without further ado let's get started
I'm going to talk during this makeup
tutorial which may be annoying I didn't
want to do it this way but then again I
thought I would just talk and explain
and tell you what I was doing rather
than just leaving the products down in
the downbar but anyway I'm gonna start
out with a little oyster I want to make
sure that our lips are not looking
chapped and nasty and gross and ratchet
when we're taking the pictures I just
have a little iOS spa don't know the
flavor don't care um and I'm just gonna
moisturize my lips alright so once
that's done that's always my first step
no matter what I'm doing
so the first actual makeup product I'm
using is my maybelline baby skin instant
pore eraser um I think this is a primer
but I'm not necessarily positive if it's
a primer I just put this on my nose
where my biggest pores are I don't think
really does anything but blow up let's
hope for the best with this product next
I'm taking a Smashbox primer this is the
one with SPF 50
in Annecy photo-finish once was like the
kind of orange e colored one I'm almost
out of it but I just think a primer is a
must when you're taking pictures I
usually don't even wear a primer when
I'm just doing my makeup on like a
regular basis on a regular day but for
pictures I think it is a must and this
one is great it's really expensive
because it's like 40 bucks for the
Smashbox one but um guys I'm pretty sure
Revlon or I think Revlon has like a
photo one because you'll see obvious
differences when taking the photos if
you have a primer on that's like four
photos and first like no primer I put
this all over my face then taking the
best concealer I've ever found which is
the instant age rewind dark circle a
baster by Maybelline I feel like every
beauty guru on YouTube says like oh and
my dark sorrows gotta convert my dark
circles but I actually do have really
deep purple of the circles under my eyes
and I don't have a lot of redness around
my nose and blemishes it's so we gotta
cover those up because we don't goes on
our pictures so when putting it your
concealer under your eyes on make sure
you put an interview like formation do
not just swirl it and you're on it a
little like you Formation know it's
gotta be a B triangle whatever you want
to call it because this will highlight
your face after you put on your
foundation and just blot it with you
through your middle finger your ring
finger very very lightly the warmth from
your finger will warming into your skin
very naturally if you have purplish or
veiny eyelids like I do also bring up a
little under-eye concealer onto your
eyelids and do it on the other eye this
concealer is great this is so thick and
creamy it's just provide some amazing
amazing coverage without looking cakey
or creasing so I really really haven't
enjoyed this Maybelline concealer then
I'm putting it around my nose and on top
of my nose you don't have to do this but
I have a very very red nose all the time
so I feel like it's a must for my skin
in my nose maybe you don't think that
but I do
so no you don't want to do this but I'm
just putting it on my blemishes so if
you have blemishes elsewhere but the
concealer on yours or maybe you don't
even need to use concealer but I would
recommend it for pictures but I also
have a few zits on my forehead so now
that the concealer is done we're moving
on to a foundation make sure you use a
foundation that you trust and you've
been using for a while I'm using my
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundation and it also has SPF in it
which I love because I have my pictures
outside so I want to make sure that I
wasn't getting you know sunburned I'm a
face but because you do not want to use
punishing they're not too familiar with
how it works how your skin reacts to it
because if it's the first time you're
using it and it looks awful it increases
it doesn't match your skin you have a
reaction you know that's not gonna be
good on the day of your senior pictures
so make sure it's one that you trust you
love and even using for at least two
weeks just because I know I have
reactions to different foundations and I
would never want to use those before my
senior pictures so this one I knew was
great grand traffic from me in my skin
and yeah and make sure you carry little
down your neck especially be doing your
pictures outside because the natural
lighting will pick up and if you have a
different foundation color on than your
actual skin tone like on your neck when
you're blending in your friend you
should make sure you're blotting it do
not rub because it'll just move the
foundation everywhere and what actually
sink into your skin poses
make sure you always put a little on
your lips as well because you don't want
too harsh like line of where you missed
your foundation around your lips
especially on pictures that look very
very bad you can always cover up and
pick the foundation on your lips with um
lipstick later and make sure you're also
putting foundation on your eyelid so
that everything matches and if you do
have really bad acne or you're you know
you just your skin's not doing too well
right now like I just had a really
really rough patch of a breakdown patch
like last week in the week before make
sure you're doing that area on your skin
last so what I mean by that is all my
acne is always on my forehead so I'm
gonna do that blast I do not want to do
my forehead first or in the middle of my
rubbing in my foundation because then
the acne will get on your sponge and
then you can spread that around and
create acne you know all over your face
I can have some acne so that's on my
forehead right now so that's why I'm
doing that last because I want to try my
best to not maybe actually spread
elsewhere rubbing it down your neck make
sure you go pretty far if you do have a
different color foundation than your
skin tone like me I can never find a
great foundation to match my skin tone
my neck so he's different depending on
whether or not I've been tanning
recently so yeah so now I'm going to my
forehead which is my last spot because I
have acne up there and then once you W
Foundation make sure you have a pressed
powder do not go to your senior pictures
or any pictures of your Tatum family or
whatever without pressed powder because
you'll be the shiny Queen so I love this
pressed powder because it's very cheap
in a lasts forever and I'm just applying
this on my eyelids and under my eyes
because that's where I applied the most
of my concealer also put a little around
my nose just to make sure these spots
really set because I've noticed some
creasing before and yeah we just don't
want them to crease in our pictures so
just lightly brushing this on make sure
any crease lines if any already formed
are gone so pressed powder really does
press your foundation into your skin it
keeps it in place it keeps you you know
not shiny it keeps you not creasing and
then it also prevents your bronzer and
your blush from moving your foundation
around and just making you look like a
mess so once I have finished putting
press powder around my eyes and my nose
I just go in on the rest of my face you
gotta make sure that your face is
shining free for the pictures especially
if like me I did mine during sunset
that's when we did my pictures and um so
some of the pictures we did a few splash
so just be aware that flash um like that
was really late in the photo shoot
though so that flame was dark we're just
kind of testing to see if any pictures
would actually turn out but when using
flash it doesn't make your face very
shiny and so be warned that you do have
a press powder on and blotting sheets if
you have really oily skin I don't but if
you're saying it's very oily or you're
doing it during a hot day and you get
sweaty make sure that you are plotting
for your skin and making sure that you
don't look shiny and greasy and gross on
pictures if you do use flash or even if
you just look shiny on normal pictures
make sure you're pressing your skin and
making sure you don't look like a greasy
mess huh then once that is done I'm
going in with my favorite part which is
my contouring my bronzer and putting on
blush to the apples of my cheeks okay so
the breasts that I've been using for the
past like month and a half is my cooler
bronzer by benefit I love this stuff so
much and it really does not if you look
like you have brown marker interface
which is like I look for when picking
out a bronzer because you don't want
something that looks cheap or I've gone
through like sparkly bronzers you don't
want that especially in pictures so I'm
going in with this little brush you are
not going to put your under in that
little hollow when you make a fish face
do not put it there I used to do that
it's a mess that's not where it goes
that's not how your face or a contour at
your face at all or give your face
definition it just looks nasty and let
you feel about putting a bronzer so I
always had to start with this fine kind
of a line like you
you can have a natural contour give your
face it's kind of a little darker spot
right here right above or right on your
cheekbone and so there's you can take
your runs are kind of finding that
little hollow place in your cheekbone
and then put it on there and do not be
scared if your bronzer comes out super
super dark the first time I used Michael
the bronzer wasn't prom and I thought I
had ruined my entire face of makeup when
I was paying this on because it came out
like this and I was like oh my gosh if
you just blend it you're gonna be a-ok
so do it on the other side as well
I love it very very dramatic contour you
obviously don't have to put even half of
this amount on but I do love my contour
to be very very in-your-face and I think
I do kind of have a bit of a round face
so ideal I just limit down with the
contour oh my goodness so much talking
residues then going up my Real
Techniques powder brush you can use any
really big powder brush your going to
blend a new crap out of this contour
you're still gonna see a dark brown line
but it's going to look like you know
what you're doing with makeup you can
see that's so so light and faded so
don't worry if it comes on really strong
at first and don't be alarmed or scared
next thing I'm applying is my NARS blush
in orgasm and make sure your blush is
not an obnoxious color make sure it's
very natural I like a kind of rose gold
peachy tannish blush I don't like a big
bright pink blush that's just not me if
you like to rock that then you
definitely do but just be careful you
don't put too much blush on your face
like I already Sykes will pick up in
photos and you look very very very rosy
so anyway this is this color it's just a
kind of natural salmony color and it
does have little grains of like brown
bronze are almost in it so it's very
natural pink color and then but it's
right above where you put your bronzer
you can put it on the opposite of cheeks
but I don't like how that looks on me
because I do have naturally pink cheeks
so I just like to kind of almost contour
with this up a little higher by my eye
and I say this is a good look for me so
depending on if your a blush girl or not
I'm usually not I don't put too much on
but you can put you know different
levels of bronzer and blush on depending
on your skin and your preferences so
once the blush is done moving on to one
of my favorite parts which is eyebrows
make sure you brush them out with a
spoolie first just to get their natural
shape then you'll see your problem areas
where you need to put them in I'm not
going to use my brow pencil for this
because I didn't use that for my senior
pictures I used my benefit gimme brow
eyebrow gel gloss wax whatever you want
to call this it's just a little nice
little wand my problem areas are right
here at the front my brows I don't ever
pluck them so I don't know why they're
kind of sparing and a little balding
right here but I just need to fill the
minute with a little color and then
she filled in your eyebrows you are
going to want to brush my mouth with a
spooly again just to disperse the color
all the way throughout your brows and
make them look very very natural next I
am using my amber rush infallible
24-hour eyeshadow by L'Oreal I love this
eyeshadow it's a beautiful beautiful
color it just a sparkle in it which I
wouldn't normally recommend anyone do
doing senior pictures just cuz it's
sparkly but I don't know it worked too
fabulous for my senior pictures and you
don't need an eyeshadow primer because
this is a 24 hour and you don't need a
base for this kind of eyeshadow you just
put this directly on your lid take your
bronzer that you use and put that in
your crease what this sounds crazy
using your bronze or as eyeshadows yep
it's a trick that everyone should know
up because it's it's just so awesome I
mean bronzer is actually a great shade
and just a big fluffy brush - from Mac
it's my 217 se brush that's good for
letting out colors and I'm just taking
my bronzer my Cooper bronzer and adding
in the crease these colors go so well
together because it is like an amber
color on my face and then this is like a
deep brownish color kind of tan color
because it is bronzer and I just love
using these together so I'm just going
to slapping it on the crease first and
then I blend it out and blend them
together in a second
next I'm going to tightline and
waterline my eyes just to give them
extra definition and for so I'm going to
tightline which is just a little line
under your lash line it's not above your
lash line it kind of may feel weird
tickles feels uncomfortable but I'm used
to a size I can barely feel it anymore
but I couldn't imagine not doing this
because I love tight lining and water
lining and the waterline is just your a
little line by your cured uh then I'm
going in my Maybelline lights to let out
liquid liner because I think this left
us hell of a lot longer than pencil
liner I know you may be scared to use
liquid liner you may not be good at it
yet or you may just not like how it
looks on you I don't know then go for
gel outline or play I just wouldn't
recommend pencil just cuz it does not
stay it smears and if you sweat it goes
off very easily I just
applying a very very tiny line remember
to not pull your eyelid that will cause
premature wrinkles and stretch marks by
your eyes like I said in my makeup do
some dentists video next we're going
onto lashes I'm using my extra-large
CIL's booster ice eyelash primer and
bite Lancome
you don't have to do this at all I don't
use this every day I just use it for
special events and since it's my senior
pictures I thought I would get my lashes
a little extra volume so you love like
seeing my lashes are other people's
lashes and pictures so I'm using my
better than sex
toothpaste masca need you have to apply
about two to three coats of this because
if you just to play one it will not do
anything for you if you play more though
great you're doing that you're doing
good that's what you're supposed to do
with this mascara and then I learned
that after the first time I used it I
was like what is this look like crap
what I paid $25 for this it's because I
only played one one coat and it was just
not working but if you apply more it
builds it up and it separates them
amazingly so yeah that's what you got to
do pull okay so going in Oh
Barnes you don't want to do this this
will ruin your entire look I don't want
people to get on Matty be like white
seeing if you like that or why are you
saying if you do me like that you can do
makeup anyway you want
because you can't this is just what I
did and the tips that I used and once
you share with you but you can really do
your makeup anyway you can use different
colors whatever suits you different
products obviously just really what you
want but these are some tips and maybe
you were confused on what makeup looks
to use maybe that's what helps cuz I
feel like it's very versatile so moving
on to the last step which is lips if
your lips are very dry like mine you may
want to apply a little more of your EOS
lip on because the key to having your
lipstick not crease and look disgusting
like a fungus on your lips is making
sure they're moisturize before you apply
this and don't even worry about any
foundation on your lips just lightly
block this on
any lipstick color this is just a light
rosy pink color that I chose and I'm not
just happening it's not orange it's not
purple it's not red
I don't want anything too dramatic but
you do want lipstick and you do want a
little something on your lips just to
draw the entire look together
otherwise your Facebook account lets a
naked and like you forgot something and
I used to never wear lipstick but it
always looked like I was not done with
my makeup and that was just rushed this
technique together it's really hard to
talk while applying lipstick I found out
right now so this is my finished makeup
look I really like it I think it's
natural yet it kind of looks like I
spend time on makeup and it does look
good like you put a lot of effort into
it
hair wise I've never been a hair guru I
suck at doing hair is that we just hang
in there you know on my shoulders um
anyway I wouldn't recommend wearing a
ponytail or bun just because certain
angles are gonna look like you're bald
and like you don't have very much hair I
do use your hair to your advantage
whether that be curly crimped natural
wavy straight whatever it is like I said
just for me I liked and I recommend
doing natural just cuz it's what you
look like this is your senior pictures
what you look like as a senior but then
again it is your senior pictures so
whatever you want to do is fine like I
know my friend Mackenzie she did her
hair curly and it looks beautiful
because that's like her like her hair is
I don't know she just always spends a
lot of time on it she always Jesus is
she always curls it she puts a lot of
time into it and so what she did that it
wasn't like out of the norm it wasn't
like opened on your hair I mean it
wasn't my got your hair it was beautiful
but it wasn't like oh my god what do you
what's your hair is it looks good and it
fit her it suited her for me my hair was
just kind of naturally a little wavy
whatever kinda you know happened to her
to get out of a bun cuz I always put my
hair and a bun after I get out of the
shower
anyway my hair is still wet right now so
don't think it's like greasy or anything
I which I just took a shower but it's
still wet right now so obviously I
wouldn't go to my senior pictures of wet
hair but this is kind of what it looks
like it was just if you can see it's
just a little bit wavy it's not curly it
just has some texture to it and that's
what I love about my hair I'm it is nice
mainly straight but you know if you want
to crimp it and do a crimp I'm not a
hair guru I suck at giving hair advice
on what you should do for
but just make sure it's what you love
don't let anyone tell you what you
should do to your hair
be like but you need to do it curly oh
you need do it straight no you do what
you feel like you're gonna be happy with
when you look back at these pictures 10
20 30 years from now but anyway I hope
