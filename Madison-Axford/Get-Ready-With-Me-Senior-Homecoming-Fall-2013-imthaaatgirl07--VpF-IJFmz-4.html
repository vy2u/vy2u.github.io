with me as my homecoming was last night
and I'm going to show you what I did to
get ready for my homecoming dance and I
went with my friend Jeff you haven't
seen my draw my life video where we were
like in a fight we did make up and ended
up with him to the dance together so
first I'm gonna put on my almost much
head perfect and correction primer and
this primer is amazing it's shaped by
like DNA's and it's a couple of greens I
just love it you can buy it at any
drugstore and I'm just thinking on
before I juiced on my foundation
and then I'm taking an EOS lip-balm I
don't know what flavor this is up the
top of my head but it tastes great and
it's literally like two or three dollars
and it's a great lip moisturizer then
I'm taking my newfound favorites
favorites favorites foundation from tard
the Amazonian clay 12-hour full coverage
foundation with SPF and I just love this
it lasted the entire night which was
great
and it's a great color I have mine in
late medium sand and yes it was $40 but
I don't know I felt like it was worth it
I absolutely love this and it should
last me a long last
do wear my same dance they call a
Pocahontas I do when that rain -
 dope I got it so make it rain
man
like someone Simmons I'm blending all
that Foundation and I'm taking my
Garnier skin renew anti dark circle
roller because I do have very very
distinct circles underneath my eyes and
this just kind of helps blend it in and
it matches pretty well and then I'm
taking my Rimmel stay matte long-lasting
pressed powder in the shade zero one one
clean natural I will have this stomach
sanitized my favorites videos and it's
great to just mattify your face and you
know keep it not oily and non shiny for
the whole night and I'm just taking any
ordinary eye brow comb and just comb
through my eyebrows to get them ready
before I fill them in and put our gel on
them
even though you can't really see what
I'm doing I am filling in my eyebrows
with a shade from the Naked palette it
is called a dark horse and I love it and
matches perfectly then I'm taking my
great lash clear eyebrow gel just making
sure that my eyebrows stay in place
through the whole night and then I'm
taking the amazing Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer in the shade is called reread I
think there's four shades that this is
full and I chose to use full tonight
seems it literally makes your eyeshadows
stay on forever and not crease which is
always great when you're going to a
dance
then I'm taking my Stila pellet in my
Naked palette and from my steel in the
moment palette I'm first taking the
color instinct cover my entire lid and
be sort of the base for this light smoky
eye look that I
I myself created and then from the Naked
palette I'm using a bluish grayish
silvery ish um color called gunmetal in
my creases to define those lines and
then finally to finish off the look I'm
using the color version from The Naked
palette to highlight my brow bone
say yes
and watch them hit the ground then bring
it back up she bring it back put them in
that black truck so many girl they left
and then I'm taking my NYC liquid
eyeliner in black my extra large stones
mr. eyelash primer my pocket value
Maybelline mascara and my ELF
three-in-one mascara and all these shots
kind of got cut off I went down to close
to the mirror and it cut it off so
basically I'm just kind of fat sporting
that purse you don't just leave it on my
head then I used a lip balm from L'Oreal
&amp;amp; D yacht carry I'm taking out my lashes
to separate them and that's the final
look
then I curled my hair and it's really
bouncy and I had a lot of fun playing
with it
and now it's time to get out of these
ugly and change into my beautiful
dress that I found at Dillard's I
absolutely love it I love the
rhinestones and the colors and it just
it describes me perfectly and I'm so
happy that I found it and now it's time
for some pictures they call a polka
honey-do when that rain - oh I
got it so make it rain
sort of like that Rain Man
and I'ma change
trying to get a smack
every
rolling
that's what's up on my dogs up in
anything English now
that money
yeah
I got my juicy
chicken
though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
