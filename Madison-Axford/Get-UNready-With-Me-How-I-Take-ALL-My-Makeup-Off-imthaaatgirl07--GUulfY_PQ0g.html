front of a shower curtain oh good thing
you asked is because I'm doing a get
unready video with me today which is
basically me showing you how I take off
my cake face and all my makeup after a
long day of filming or going out or
whatever I'm doing I'm gonna show you
all the products I use and then there
were some in the bathroom which is very
unattractive I know is because I need
water and a sink so I don't make it a
complete mess but yes I just got back so
the first thing that I do is take off
this mess okay so the first thing I had
to do was just change into a pajama top
because I didn't want to get my next
outfit all dirty in like wet from the
water so that is why I changed second
taking the lashes off the best part of
the day love those love these to death
but they can be a pain and so then she
can take up the glue and yeah typically
I would say clean them if you're going
to rewear them like I do for a few days
I would tell you to clean them at night
but I get too lazy and typically I
sanitize them the next day which for
tease them which will be tomorrow or
whenever I put makeup on again so yeah
bad medicine but sorry then I take my
Burt's Bees cleansing oil or any
cleansing oil I was using Pocius for a
while it's just nice because easy to
make wipes but they don't really get as
much makeup and dirt and grime off I
feel as like a cleansing one of those
and I never use these two a month or two
ago so love them you just squirt it on
your hand or just go in and it melts
make away from the highlight is going um
you can put it over your mouth and put
in by your eyes like it's safe and
gentle and then bomb gone isn't it so
cool I think it's so cool so I'm just
going to go in and you dress my face it
gets everything off waterproof um makeup
for eyes everything loose stick eyelash
glue really rub it all in once you have
gotten your entire face covered with it
go rinse off once that is done know it's
at everything off absolutely not but
that's just had the base area to break a
lot of the big makeup down because
sometimes foundation can be hard to
break down with just a wipe or just a
cleanser so next thing I'm going in with
my bushka which is just a mini travel
though um it's a detoxifying black
cleanser so I just squirts on my hand
and I'm over my face and then I go in
with a spin brush it doesn't matter if
you have a Clarisonic for rail whatever
I'm using my old lenguin right now
because this is black I thought it would
chain it doesn't says great you know but
I thought I might see in the brush so I
didn't want to use any of my expensive
ones I just chose a cheap you lay one
which works just the same it works
amazingly actually and I just wet the
bristles and then go in and it's
actually a warming cleanser so when you
first go in with it like heats of your
face that's fun to buy these products
just let you know so that is what my
next step is ah women relaxing trying to
add to lose your eyes but if you do have
great control over it because I've done
it many times where it'll go out of
control and spin right into my eye and
then it stings for like an hour looks so
unattractive oh well I love getting ripe
on my ears and like my temples in upper
forehead because those are places weapon
forget we put makeup especially we use a
lot like I do and then under my chin in
my neck because those places can get
acne as well and you want to make sure
they don't and don't forget to clean
them eyebrows also I put a gel on mine I
don't put like a color on them to film
in but if you do or use I brother like I
do clean them as well
once you have cleaned your whole face go
ahead and rinse out as well and rinse
off your bristle brush so you don't keep
it this color it won't stain if you
clean it properly but it is this boscia
is great but it's very sticky to wash
off oh and as you can still see I have
eyebrows I don't fill them in cognitive
and understand that these Mariel brows
so whether or not you like them I don't
give a but stop saying that I feel
the mint because you know bitch Adam
anyway you can see my face is still
messy does not where we end next to
moving on to just in oil free I make
it's just from Target and I just put
some on a cotton swab and then go in
heavy on my eyes because you have to get
all that off tight line waterline liquid
liner waterproof mascara like eyelash
glue everything needs to come off with
this because most the eyeshadow comes
off from the cleansing oil but the other
air doesn't come off as easily so don't
be too rough but look at all that that
you would have went to bed with if you
would have just used the makeup I just
can't I used to do that all the time and
I'm like oh my god mess and do your
routine see look at this oh my god
so sometimes you were a lot like I did
today apparently you need to go in with
a second one just make sure you really
get everything off and then I am taking
another cotton swab in my Garnier skin
active micellar cleansing water I've
used a lot of this I love this lip it's
just like a really nice toner and
there's a pink one which i think is
waterproof maybe I don't know the blue
ones waterproof which I have anything
was just regular I don't really wear any
waterproof makeup that I'm aware of but
just nice to get that is duty toner I
love this stuff and it just is like the
last layer of scent look it's like dingy
and brown okay
and with that I think we are done so
moving on to the next step you should
have to do a poor strip every three to
four days and not every day so make your
skin dry and so rough I did it last
night and it was great so I won when I'm
doing that tonight I'm just telling my
nightly routine
I'm usually they recommend doing it
after you wash your face and then
wetting your nose and put it on and then
run for 15 to 30 minutes that's what I
do but I go to bed later tonight I will
have on my acne topical cream um but I
want to doing that now to my own bed yet
but I will be using my ultra Repair
Cream paste moisturizer I used to have
problems with this but like I thought I
was allergic but I think I'm good now I
just put this on my problem areas I
don't put it all around my face because
I am prone to acne and I am Gracie
normally so I don't need to put this
everywhere just and spots that get very
dry which is right here by my nose which
is cracked right now and then under here
like done mother because so dry it
really
shows because I do wear a lot of
foundation and I'm proud of it um it'll
show this stuff burns me about although
like Barnes um I put a lot of foundation
and concealer and stuff and so this part
are on my eye which is such a thin piece
of skin and up to here where I do like
cat eye and like eyeshadow it gets very
very dry and cracked and burns and like
sheds which is disgusting but like to
make sure that around the tip of my nose
and the bridge of my nose and under my
eyes and up to like most my eyebrow it's
covered with moisturizer and with that
we are done with my get and ready with
me if you're not reaching I want to
subscribe to my channel if you're scum
and do not like me in the rest of us on
here and should be late for new videos I
post new videos every week I still I
browse thanks for watching bye
