with my girls is very fun and we had
kind of a rocky relationship toward the
end and it was just it was really sad I
have had this problem a lot that I found
like I don't know why it's probably cuz
I'm loud and I like like nice and you
guys have to be a confident diva subject
like drinking and my drugs hey so today
I am back with my friends
McKenzie obviously and her cousin Audrey
you saw her and our first boy advice
high school advice whatever video I'm
like the 4th of July I think it was but
anyway we're back today to do another
one part two with some more questions
that were requested or that we saw I'm
going to answer or we thought up and so
we thought it'd be really fun we're all
hanging out and we're gonna do a video
so we decided to do this one we're on
our bed and it's kind of just like Girl
Talk with all of us so without further
ado let's get on to our topic
so the first topic we have that we are
requested to talk about is following out
with friends and what happens when you
get into fights because well I know on
first hand I get in fights with a lot of
people often which sucks but you know it
does happen and you do get into
arguments so I'll begin with my response
and all of our responses are gonna be
you know our own things so we don't want
to offend anyone but these are gonna be
our separate opinions so anyway to begin
um when I personally got in fights with
friends I believe you that I needed and
like we needed like me and whoever I was
friends with our friendship like we
needed time to cool down and cool off
and we need to just step away like if we
got into a fight I wasn't gonna text
them like an hour later and be like oh
let's make up especially with my friend
Jeff who you guys know we always need
time to cool off whether it was a mom I
think the longest I went was like three
months I'm not talking but we need that
time especially me to like reflect on
what happened and and realized that it
wasn't a big deal and and just with
anyone not just my friend Jeff but with
anyone I think you do need time to think
about what happened and when you do fall
out with friends make sure you're going
back to them for the right reasons and
you're not just going back to them to be
popular again in order to be cool in fit
in make sure you really want value their
friendship and want them as a friend and
that's why you're going back and yeah
yeah I totally agree with that I it was
kind of fun
pressure to stay friends with the school
yeah who I had been friends with since
like sixth grade and we had kind of a
rocky relationship before the I and then
it was just it was really sad I really
liked her as a person but we just didn't
agree on a lot of stuff and I felt like
I needed to stay friends with her
because we had this friend group that
was gonna be kind of ruined if we didn't
stay friends and I realized that if I
kept being friends with her it was just
gonna be toxic and I was not gonna be a
better person from it so I just sort of
you have to just sort of let it go
realize when a friendship is over
yeah exactly oh yeah I agree with both
of them that um well in my situation
that if why this my friend she would
always take advantage of me and my other
friends and put me against other people
and um it wasn't like what his true
friend is and that um like in high
school you very worn hey you turbans are
so when you're with your friends and if
you're always fighting and you don't get
along and if you don't really agree on
certain topics um I know that I people
would say that opposites attract but
like if you're not gonna always agree on
everything and you're not gonna if
you're always gonna fight with your
friends I don't think that's like really
would like the friendships all about so
I think that Mikey should reflect on
like who your true friends are and that
like if people like you know different
opinions but people always like put you
down for what you believe in obviously
it's not good to stay with them yeah and
be friends with them because they like
degree in your opinion our next topic is
kind of funny amazing weird but a lot of
people you know have this question and
even I think about it sometimes it's
like it ensured how to make friends and
it's not I'm not saying this like just
sounds to be like oh you say hi and then
you talk to a person but how to make
relationships with the right people and
how to make them like really last so
when you want to talk to you like some
of that you want to be your friend for
the first time the way that I do it is I
just simply introduce myself and it
sounds so cheesy and so like obvious but
just introduce yourself and kind of get
to know them and ask those geeky
questions when I start like texting
someone for a first time whether it be a
girl that I want to be my friend or a
boy that maybe want something new and
you know I don't know how to say that
but um I always like wanna play the
questioning name especially with boys
cuz you get to know what they like and
they get
you like and just you get to see like
certain things about them are you
talking to a girl just talk about things
you like and and maybe you'll bond over
something and create a friendship add
that or maybe you'll go to the mall and
see that you like some more things it's
so hard to describe how to be how to
make a friend of a summer like that's
actually such a hard topper to describe
everyone thinks it's simple but there's
so much like it goes so much deeper than
that because the relationships that I
have with people like you can't explain
how they were formed they just are
formed so I'm trying to like put it into
words but just introduce yourself and
try to get on the same level I talk
about common interests and you'll know
whether or not like the first time you
hang out but first time you text or the
first time you talk to you you know a
girl or a boy you can kind of see
whether or not you want to like create a
lasting relationship with them whether
it be a boy that you like or a girl that
you want to be friends with or a boy are
you friends with I feel like a lot of my
friendships start with people that have
some more interest in these it sounds
kind of obvious but I have a lot of
friends who are my choir with me and
there's people that I see every single
day and you have that to bond with
already that makes it so easy way to
make a friend is to compliment them on
something they're wearing that's so yeah
so easy it sounds cheesy but it's
amazing and it's like outcomes like oh I
love your sweatshirt from a college
they're going to something like that and
you just start talking to them about
that like they already love it they're
wearing it in sniffles so um yeah pretty
much my mass and said like I think you
just pretty much introduce yourself and
then you like start talking about some
more interest and like I feel like you
just find things to talk about whenever
you're right
I don't know it's so it's hard right I
feel like you you just like
unconsciously know that you're gonna
like this person yeah um whether it
happen for a girl it does and like if
you said slang weird then you're gonna
move on but those people that you really
want to make a friendship with or a
relationship with you like try harder
and then real relationships do form I
don't know how to describe it so all
right like Madison you always have to be
a confident Deena and yeah you really do
have to be confident within yourself I
feel like to be friends you have to know
who you are and like you don't want to
like introduce yourself as being fake so
that's
likes you because if you're not
confident within yourself people won't
really like you for your true self and
then you won't make lasting friendships
from that or lasting relationships
boyfriend-girlfriend like from that like
you have to be coming in yourself
believe in yourself and be like this is
who I am so if you don't like it then
you're obviously not the friend or
boyfriend for me so the next time we're
gonna talk about scan abroad but it's
just study tips and how to study how to
memorize things because through the
course of four years in high school or
in college or even a middle school
you'll learn how you learn best and how
do you memorize things best and how you
need to study because it's obviously
different for every person so well your
accent yeah you totally had an accent I
don't recruit voice but if I say it like
that's like no my second mic down but
then when I start talking about
something like a like video if you've
noticed everyone learns differently and
I feel like everyone has has different
ways that they need to like study like
some people have to study hours on end
and then other people don't even need to
study for I get tests I know for me when
I started high school like freshman
sophomore year I thought I had to study
like she said hours on end I thought
that was the only way that I can do it
and I'm not saying that now I'm just
like yeah whatever I'll get a DS but
I've realized that I know what helps and
how I learned quicker and so it doesn't
take me as long and I had to learn that
the hard way by studying hours on end
wasting time I got the same grade as I
did back then as I do now and I study a
lot less because I know it helps and
quicker ways to get the job done
and so I usually just like read over my
notes and I don't really yeah I don't
know I feel like bringing the book helps
in some classes I don't know I'm talking
about this but I always thought like is
reading a book really helped should I
read the textbook and in like a history
class or something it does like in
chemistry or in math obviously it
doesn't and people are always like in
chemistry you need to read the book
never did that I was fine got a name
yeah I agreed with Mackenzie that doing
the homework totally huxley throughout
the entire semester even like in my math
class homework was optional which kind
of killed me because I'm yeah oh I'm not
gonna do that it's not gonna count for
anything
it totally helps do the homework it's
gonna help you get it in your brain so
that you won't have to study as much
when finals come on
the next topic is what to do when a
teacher just obviously does not just not
favor you I have had this problem a lot
that I found like I don't know why it's
probably cuz I'm loud and I like when I
walk into the classroom but I'll let you
just think it's funny a lot of people
like that and think I'm enthusiastic but
I've come across a lot that do not favor
me they don't like hate me or just like
me but they just don't really favor my I
don't know maybe like personality and
they don't say it obviously but you can
kind of get that's you know sense that
they're not really you know warm and
fuzzy towards you so what I do is I try
to get going for help for that subject
and just kind of give a sense of how
they feel for you and I try to make a
difference I'm not like hi I feel like
you don't like me like obviously don't
have sex I'd be weird but I'm going for
help and it sounds bad but try to kiss
up to them a little bit be like have a
great afternoon or something then
they'll see that you actually you know
maybe are nice if they didn't think you
were something I just have a lot of
teachers that think that because I'm
like loud and like ah they think that I
don't necessarily care for school and I
have a little ease in their class but
I've come across a lot of teachers that
think that I don't care but I'm like no
obviously I do all my homework and stuff
but by going in you show them that you
really do care and want to try and I
feel like teachers like seeing that like
that's my experience with it yeah and
it's not embarrassing to get help I know
we said this in the last high school
advice video but um yeah going in for
help the teachers do really see that you
do care about getting a degree in their
class yeah she's exciting another thing
to kind of be mindful of is just be
respectful of that teacher like I had a
teacher didn't I kind of got weird vibes
from where I don't think she liked me
that much
and I realized because I was talking in
her class a lot okay I realized halfway
through the semester I was like oh my
gosh I'm being so rude I'm always
talking to my friends and I realized I
was like I need to stop I need to show
her that I actually care about what
she's telling me because it is something
I need to care about it's cool it's
important yeah so show them respect
they will yeah definitely notice it's
our next topic is about like what is
popular and like what the crowd does
doing something in particular that you
don't very third you don't really feel
comfortable with and um if you should
just stay out of it or if you should get
involved and so
like subjects like drinking and my drugs
people who do drink and do do drugs
think that they're popular and think
that they're amazing and the people that
look up they're in their own world world
oh I know that all of us we don't look
up to them but I know that people do and
I feel bad for the people that do look
up to them because that's not a good
thing to put on a pedestal and look up
to you because that's not a good example
and we're not necessarily popular but
those people that do drugs and stuff
even though they may think that the
coolest cats in school aren't popular
either just because you drank it that
one party in high school and put some
awesome picture on Instagram awesome
picture yeah doesn't mean that in
college you're gonna still be that cool
kid that you think you are popular
doesn't last obviously after high
schools so just because people are doing
this thing doesn't mean that you need to
and you need to fall under the influence
and we I don't want to brag or trying to
sound you know cool but we haven't
fallen under the influence and I do
believe that there's very few people and
there's a very real chance that you'll
actually find someone nowadays that
hasn't tried that which is really sad
but we haven't and I'm proud to say that
I'm proud to say like we haven't gone
under the influence and follow people
because it's what people are doing and
it's the new norm we're different and
we're proud of it and we're just trying
to prove that you know you don't do
follow what everyone else is doing to be
popular to be cool and to conclude our
video about high school and a boy I
think the time when over boy a little
bit advice we're just gonna sum all of
this advice up into like one sentence
and say what we wished we would have
been totally certain high score we were
a freshman or gonna sophomore or
whatever just what we wish we could have
told her younger self to warn ourselves
or just to tell herself what our future
was gonna be like okay so something that
I wish I pitted I've told my younger
self going into high school was that
it's only for your past that um doesn't
really mean that much um I mean
obviously you're gonna have to make some
choices and like do some things that you
are gonna need to be like responsible
for for the future but it's not that
and if things don't work out as he
planned
it wasn't like your time to shine it's
like it you didn't really um enjoy high
school I think that and there is a
better like it's kind of a lot for our
last question but I wish I could have
told my younger self that what is
popular is not always what's right and
what's right is not always what's
popular but it makes a lot of sense and
it kind of hits hard you just need to
realize that just because everybody's
doing something doesn't make it right
and just because no one seems to agree
with something that you think doesn't
mean it's wrong and to conclude this
video what I would tell my younger self
is basically that things are going to
change so much what happened in middle
school or it happened you know
previously with friends or just in life
everything is gonna be different and
you're gonna go through such bad times
and such good times in times where
you're crying and crying in time some
you're laughing into your stomach hurts
and and you're gonna go through so many
friends and I know this does sound
cheesy but you're gonna come out so much
stronger no matter what you go through
no matter what happens to you or anyone
else in your life and you're gonna come
out so much wiser and you're gonna learn
so much more and you're gonna become
more mature and you may feel like oh no
I'm not or some people I know are gonna
become more mature but in some way shape
or form you will become older and wiser
and more mature and you'll be ready to
take on the world no matter what you had
previously been through so high school
changes you for the better and I wish
that I I don't know why I feel like I
wanted to tell myself that but I just
feel like going in I was sentenced on
what I wanted to do I told everyone that
was gonna be on Broadway you know and
and though I love musicals though I love
to sing things change and and I wish I
would have told myself that so I would
have been prepared to be let down and
and be brought up and let down and and
just you know you go through things and
I wish I would have been prepared for
that you obviously can't it's called
life but you know it would be nice to
tell my little nuts itself so anyway I
hope you enjoyed this long video is
really fun and I always love doing
