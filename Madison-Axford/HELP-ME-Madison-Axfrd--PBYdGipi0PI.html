okay so I'm wearing a wig
hello I would never just dye my hair
blonde even though I'm living oh this is
from everyday wigs and you should
definitely check them out have them
linked down below they are just
incredible oh my god they're lace front
synthetic wigs too like the heavy-duty
like you know you're getting a bang for
your buck because they are used like a
little more pricey than like Halloween
wigs obviously but they're like shows
IgG so smooth feeling real hair love it
I've always wanted to be a blonde and I
can finally try it out but it's just
like honestly so fun like I've just been
playing with it all day I know I'm not
the only one that is wanted to just like
try to inherit color but like you just
can't just like dye your hair because
like what if it sucks I've been there I
did red and black it didn't work I've
never done Blanc's it's too hard to go
from Brown where I match to blond and I
never thought want to look good my dark
eyebrows but like I'm sort of living
with these roots and like yeah this
video is just a quick announcement I
really really really need you guys to
follow me on Instagram I don't know why
a lot of my numbers from YouTube don't
go to my Instagram and Twitter but
Instagram is where I really need your
help if you could just go follow Mattson
axe for right now that would mean the
world to me and if we get to a certain
number I'm having a giveaway on my
Instagram so I suggest to go follow me
it'll just be really fun especially
around Christmas you can see what I'm
doing because if I go onto YouTube leave
or you don't know where I'm at or what
I'm doing or what I'm wearing you can go
on there and see my outfit see my life
see my friends and just kind of I don't
know it's just fine I don't have a theme
I'm not a theme kind of girl but I'm a
real-ass bitch and you can see what I'm
doing on there so Masson Axford go
follow me on there Twitter's messin
Axford Spotify slash maxford snapchats
I'm so mad zero one zero one and
musically is the medicine experts so
following in all those you can come up
to my life with what I'm doing besides
YouTube because I feel like I'm a lot
more interesting than just what's on a
camera um but yes definitely follow the
math snacks write on Instagram so we can
just get our numbers up can add more
members to the first cabinet diva family
and the giveaway will be coming soon I
promise
