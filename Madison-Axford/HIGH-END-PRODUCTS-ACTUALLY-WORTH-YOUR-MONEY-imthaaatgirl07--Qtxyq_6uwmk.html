was like the best drugstore products of
all time and today I'm kind of doing
some other thing for high-end products
and you are interested if you're not if
you think oh she's just a snobby girl
who like buys these high-end products
leave I don't buy that many high-end
products because I don't honestly I
don't want to spend the money and so I
have bought a few things though that
I've researched and then I loved and I
want to share with you so it's kind of
like the best high-end products but also
high impacts that are worth your money
and are truly in the bank for the book
I'm not gonna preach these products to
you if they suck like I would not do
that I'm not sponsored by any of these
companies I feel like I feel I have to
say that nowadays because a lot of
people are sponsored some of these
companies
I'm not they don't know I exist so I
would not be giving these company
shoutouts if I didn't truly love them
these are strictly just my opinions
about those products and I love them so
much stuff so I'm gonna share them with
you okay I forgot about also this
disclaimer before I start a video I'm a
girl so I talk fast no it's not a
stereotype or feminist comment about
girls talking fast but I do talk fast
because I'm a girl I have a lot of
to say and I've loved to get
through so I'm not gonna make this video
in 20 minutes
because I we all got lives so I'm gonna
give you the product names and then move
on so if you were pumping me talking
fast X to this video find someone who
talks two words per minute thank you
let's get started I'm like run em run no
more I'm just gonna start with bronzers
because I'm too so these friends herbs
are actually worth the hype the first
one is two faced chocolate soleil this
does take and that tastes I haven't
tasted it but you can taste it but just
smell like chocolate apparently it's
like edible or something I don't know
why you'd eat a bronzer but yeah so it
comes through this like little gold case
in the openness and you have a mirror
here that's actually filthy we're gonna
cover that up and then this beautiful
beautiful brown color which is also
beautiful for both the bronzes aren't
for an eyeshadow color actually but this
one the chocolate smells like
overwhelming it smells good but you know
um this is just like a kind of orange e
undertone brown and I love this it's
very dark you do not need much of it I
don't have it on right now but I switch
off between these two bronzers but I
always choose a high-end bronzers
because I've found too that I love I
don't I don't really prefer um drugstore
ones like I have one good drugstore one
but I prefer these because they're just
a lot higher quality um yeah this is
Chaves Soleil it's in the medium color
and it's a deep matte bronze yes
Matt there's no sparkle in s but I
absolutely adore this bronzer so that's
to face
I'll have the price like right here up
so you guys know whether or not you want
to check it out because I know a lot of
people purchase things depending on the
price like me next bouncer is an obvious
hoola benefit so this one is a lot less
orangie it's actually brown I've hit
total panic it also has a little mirror
why I have it on right now and you can
see that it is very dark but I love it
it looks natural I think for the most
part yes this is just the hoola it comes
with a little like NARS in a knockoff
brush it looks like ice a very flat top
it's perfect lines get that contoured
look what you want from this so I
absolutely adore this is the first
high-end bronzer I popped gave it to me
analyze it next time to face foundation
powders and I was never a huge fan of
foundation powders or powder foundations
until last winter break when my skin is
really dry and I didn't want to put in
and I got really lazy at college and did
not want to put on tons of foundation
every day and powdered shreya the matter
obviously does not do the job because
like pressed powder does not do the job
to cover this mess so I want to run this
I have a few breakouts and I have dark
circles on my eyes in this Mac Studio
Fix um foundation it's a condition but
it's powder so it's not liquid it's a
powder foundation this cat broke off
because I dropped it so let's check this
off it comes with like a little sponge
thing I use this once and I was like
yeah that's okay I don't like it I'd
much prefer a flat top kabuki to apply
this with you just need a little bit and
it is so freakin pigmented and it covers
everything on your face like my I've
preached this to my friends they have it
now I absolutely do our Studio Fix
foundation powder by Mac oh my god I
can't even call this Canadian know what
color I was so I was like yeah we'll
just give these like I bought one and
then my sister bought me the other one
for Christmas this other ones like a
little horn G yellow undertones and I've
these are picking up I'm probably
squashing for like no one because move
this because probably not picking up my
lights oh right but I love these they
cover up when I say to cover up they
cover up every thing I feels like really
really bad acne
I wouldn't recommend this but if you
just have like a few of these coloration
things you want to cover up these are
amazing they take two seconds to just
swipe it all over your face and you're
good to go it looks like you put time
and effort into your makeup when you
didn't do crap so I love these powders
especially like second semester and I'm
over it X I have a lipstick which I'm
wearing right now I wear it like every
video now and I finally found a great
matte lipstick matte lipsticks which I
need to reapply sorry about that
like when they say 24-hour long-lasting
matte lipsticks they like dry lips out
this does dry but it's not next s the
amount of dry like I'm not like oh my
god I just want my lips moist again like
it's come it's a comfortable amount of
dryness like you know the 24 hour ones
usually dry the lips out that's how the
colored locks in and stays but this one
just feels like comfortable like I'm not
like reaching from moisture I don't know
it's the NARS Velvet Matte lip pencil in
Cruella they give a tiny one of this
trial sample size in the birthday
Sephora gift from NARS it's like two
colors the karela and then a pink one
that I hate it was like shiny and I was
like not today but this one I bought the
full size up cuz I love it and I'm used
a bunch it's it you're able to sharpen
it and I use it everyday it's less of a
like bright red in your face and really
really like a matte deep color I love it
it it's matte it's gonna be dry but not
as dry as you think next is the most
infamous mascara on this channel
Too Faced better than sex mascara if you
haven't tried this what are you doing
this is worth every penny that you pay
for it it's actually not as expensive as
I thought like when I went to buy
another tube this one it like what some
excess I was expecting you to be more
expensive and then I got there and I was
like oh Kenny yeah it's a metallic tube
and it's very heavy this is the wand it
looks like any ordinary thing but I
can't preach just enough all my friends
family use this it's the greatest
mascara you will ever try I don't know
why more people don't talk about it but
maybe they just don't want some of the
money drugstore mascaras can only go so
far this gives me extra oomph to me like
I really have any on and it still looks
like I put a lot of effort to my makeup
when I didn't I absolutely adore this
mascara it's the only one I will
continuously buy and use - so - yes next
I have an eyeshadow primer I do not like
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer so much
anymore I'd much prefer in Mac Paint Pot
the met Paint Pots don't go on oily like
urban decay primers do they go on as a
clay so it's very thick interrupts hold
on to the colors if I show you that
you're putting on this is so amazing
does not only does it make the
eyeshadows look vibrant and last longer
but it's also like a skin color clay
because it is in the color painterly
there's other ones but this is painterly
paint-pot by Mac and it covers up any
veins or any discoloration you have on
your eyelids or underneath your eye you
know right underneath here that and then
it puts the shadows over top so like no
vein or no gross discoloration is poking
through your shadows this gives you the
cover-up and then the amazing primer
that you need for your eyeshadows I
absolutely adore this any Mac Paint Pot
is wonderful but Panama is my favorite
and a lot of people stay right here on
YouTube
because it just grabs hold on the
shadows and make them look amazing and I
like to ever TV promise for a while but
after a while they just like get really
greasy and slick and they just like my
show slid off like I guess you need to
let it dry and get tacky before you
apply the shadows with this you can just
apply them and you're good to go
next time I all-time favorite eyeshadow
it's a single from Stila it is the most
beautiful like lid color
um I'm not wearing right now because I
just didn't like nothing kind of on a
day like this took two seconds but this
is when I'm doing an intense eye I will
use this for a base color literally look
at that do you see that shine could
probably use this as a highlighter I
adore it oh my god this just works with
any shade you're doing it for you in
green black blue red pink brown any
eyeshadow look you could think um this
would be the perfect base for it and it
just because of everything it's like a
nice Oh Polly color I don't know I love
it still a kitten get it it's worth it
baby and the last product that I have
for you today is really any Becca
highlighter because they are such high
quality highlighters but this one in
particular champagne pop by Jacqueline
Hill I'm not sponsored by the students I
mean that's just know who I am I wish we
can be friends but she's never cam I'm
writing this right now and I love it I
love this color because it's in between
all of the other moonstone opal it's in
between all of them and it's a great
peachy skin tone color that gives you
that dewy glow look that I crave and so
many others do I've used so much of this
ready and it's like literally about to
hit pan I've had full Sun three weeks
maybe um any Becca highlighter is
amazing though because they're so
pigmented and they give you that shine
that no other companies highlighter
really does they're just amazing the
powder they're incredible like look one
swipe look at all that from one touch
one touch ready I'll do one touch oh
look at all that from one touch it's
incredible definitely check this out
Ivan on my face right now I probably
have too much but I'm obsessed and I
overdo it with the highlighter so I love
