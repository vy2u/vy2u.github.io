regret buying video under done when they
seem quite a while because I usually
know the products that I buy before I
buy them if you don't know what it mean
like it's either I researched them a lot
or I already hadn't before but these are
products that either I was sent or that
I bought that I really don't love I
doesn't mean that I don't love the brand
because most these brands I absolutely
adore some of the products just don't
work for me and my skintone my skin type
they just personally weren't what I
expected it doesn't mean the products I
hate no no it's just practice I would
never buy again and I wouldn't recommend
to a friend or family member all right
you guys my love's so without further
ado let's get started the first thing is
the biggest disappointment cause this is
hella expensive what steal a kitten
eyeshadow but it's the Magnificent
metalized jeffree star always used this
so I was like yes I'm gonna pick it up I
love steal kitten eyeshadow and this was
supposed to be more vibrant like last
all day kind of eye shadow pigment and
they came with this is all like I'm
primer drops okay I have tried a just
once and I gave up so it's like this
beautiful metallic foil and I was like
oh yes but it's like gooey and I don't
know if that's what it's supposed to be
there's no hardly any product in here
like how many flow islands 0.07 uh it's
very very splotchy and you put it on and
it just kind of like disintegrates like
it's not really like a straight streak
it's just kind of like there I don't
know I was really upset about this
because yes it's shiny but this still
kitten eyeshadow just the basic cheaper
one is so much better and so much more
pigmented than this this is very
expensive for what it is I've never been
able to successfully just it once on my
eyes and it pissed me off because I was
so excited use this it was brilliantly
beautiful on Geoffrey star and then I
got it and was just tremendously
disappointed so yeah it has an OK
pigment maybe as a like light highlight
on the cheek but not and overall lid
shadow which is very just winning a wish
is what I wanted from it when I bought
it
moving on I have this Terry cellular
cellular rose hydrate girl hydrating
serum and it's a row smelling face serum
and I personally believe I got like some
sort of rash from
see am i but like my mommy says my mom
uses this every day I gave to her after
I didn't it didn't work for me and she
love says she's never had problem with
it so I think it was just my skin type
and why I would never write this again
it smells beautiful it smells like roses
it's just gorgeous but it may be such an
itchy rash around like my lower face and
like jawline and I just could never use
this again this was so itchy and like
went up in red welts so I can't use this
anymore but it did make my skin
moisturized and it did help my
foundation want smooth until I let go
dry and itchy
um but yeah so my mom likes it and maybe
it is for older skin types but mine
being very acne prone and oily that
wasn't good for it it just went crazy
moving on I have Milani Bella cappuccino
satin matte gel powder eye shadow and I
absolutely love the formula of these
Milani eyeshadows I was sent this as
well as the RO serum and I was like yes
it was beautiful and then I got thick
but what got the the swatch on my finger
to put it on here and it's like nothing
shows up it's right there do you see
anything no and that's after like 20
hours of swatching and then I don't
understand it has no color payoff I know
it's a new taupe I get that but it's not
even that like enough of a color to use
as a transition color like that's how
bad it is like it just there's no color
there's no color payoff I don't know
so no disappointing I wouldn't make that
color that formula is incredible super
super creamy and satiny but no the color
is awful then I have this L'Oreal of
magic lumi highlighter and i deemed this
to be a concealer highlighter like i
thought it was a brightener of under-eye
but I guess it's just a highlighter
either way I don't like this I was so
excited to try it cuz it was like an old
product but still a great one and okay
so like this is what it comes out as
it's a very very clay like and it comes
out in a nude form like a concealer but
blending it in it feels like um I don't
know what the word is kind of like a
clay I guess like a clay based concealer
and you can see
every piece of skin under this is not
good coverage it's not easily blendable
it's very very cakey about like sheds
the more you blend it in so this is not
good I try to put this under my eyes
once her makeup look and it basically
ruin the whole thing I would not
recommend that says in the shade light
862
I used it once and then it was like nope
take all the makeup off because it was
ruin mix I have a bite lipstick this is
hard for me to say because I absolutely
adore the color and all my friends and
people around me love bite lipsticks and
it's nothing about formula it's in the
color meringue such a beautiful color I
love this pinky nude kind of a comeback
angel color here it is absolutely
gorgeous the smell of this is why I
would never buy one again no it smells
like I can never find anything right I
smell like Pixy Stix sweet tarts and
mint a little bit I really can't I love
the color but it is so strong the scent
I'm nauseous every time I wear this
which was twice too good I literally
can't handle it next I have Ariel
mascara in blue I do like the black one
I do think the original their real is
good I bought this about a year ago and
maybe used it once for tutorial because
I really wanted blue mascara I just it's
it's such an ugly blue I'm sorry I love
benefit but I don't like this blue it is
such a like cerulean and I was thinking
it was gonna be like a navy or a cobalt
really close to black are really rich
blue and this is literally like a light
blue crayon and so I really didn't like
it it didn't add any pigment or make my
up aisle I should just pop out when I
put it just on my lower lashes it didn't
do anything for me I just think it's not
that cute of color and I wouldn't buy
this again it's a great formula and it
really does a good job at lengthening
separating and of aluminized your lashes
they're real is great but really what it
light has blue no no next I have a Mac
product matches my favorite brand ever
but this is the bronzer give me son I'm
Jacqueline Hill had this and I was like
okay my skin tone is similar to hers if
I put on like orange or foundation but
this okay this is a very expensive
ronster it's one of the mineralized
skinfinish bronzers because very creamy
smooth but holy this is show orange
of a bronzer I mean that's the
and I usually like to go for a more
Brown runs or so I don't appear fake tan
or orange but this is such a like muted
orange undertone as well as yellow it
looked awful on my skin because I
already have kind of slightly more
engine power from Mac the fix but the
Mac fix the foundation powder and then
this point on top just looks awful it
appears almost red on the skin
especially on film when I am filming
with this on I've worn it a few times it
just looks awful and it's very expensive
and yeah I find it a little hard to
blend out I know it's must be like one
of the creamier you know skin
mineralized but like it's really
hard to blend it once you put it on um
hoola bronzer is the only bronzer I've
actually successfully found to be able
to blend out you can put on a freaking
like black line of hoola bronzer and
still buff it out and it look great but
most bronzers like give me Sun a hard to
blend out once applied to the skin
next time another bronzer I was sent its
shimmer bronzer by temptu in the shade I
guess it's just one shade this is a
liquid bronzer which is very dangerous
because if you put on more than like
half a half a half half a size of a pea
it's gonna ruin your makeup look and
what happened with this is I would put
it right here so I got very high almost
by my temple to blend then down in my
normal like contour line but it melted
down almost throughout the day to form
like it looked a guy had contoured on a
beard I didn't set it so I think that
might have had a kind of contribute to
the problem but like it was like driven
down for I could get time I had time to
buff it in we take what it's so so oily
and it doesn't blend it doesn't blend it
stays in that line formation so I was
blending that was like a squared off
brush and it looks like I had just taken
a square like stamp basically and like
drug it oh it looked really really
really bad next I have a DLS matte
lipstick I was sent it's in the shade
phantom a beautiful deep dark red color
with almost Malhar undertones but the
prompt this is I really I'm gonna regret
putting this on but it doesn't come off
the skin it's stained so when you wear a
surface look how beautiful it is but no
it's not worth it there's a million
you can find that don't stain your lips
with the skin around your lips or your
hands I have a makeup wipe and this is
what happens when you try to take it off
it just like spreads it's like a
bacterial infection and you never coast
oh my god so that's the only reason I
would never recommend this because it'll
stain your face for about a week
next I have matte crest pigment in blue
Brown I love this color I love Mac press
pigments but like while this color is
brown blue beautiful let me put a little
on look at that holy Brown blue
beautiful I found it very hard to wear
um Mac press pigments are very easy for
me to use when using them as a lid color
but since this is so dark it's very
overpowering and hard to do often times
this as a lid color so I just have never
found more than liquid I use for this
more than like one time it's just the
color and the quality it's oh my god
like I can marry this it's beautiful but
it's just very hard to wear I didn't
realize how dark of a color it is
especially on my initial Mormo blue so I
was like Oh blue eye but it's hard to
use these in the crease because they're
pressed pigment you need to put glue in
the crease for these to stick well she's
the fiasco so I wouldn't totally
recommend buying that color unless you
can free and rock it in your makeup
artists then go for it
next day the Hausa lashes eyelash glue
this was like everyone's so I had
to buy it and I adore um duo lash glue
that's what I use every day and so I was
like let me try this one cuz everyone
seems to love it all the makeup crews
just okay comes in this little wand and
it's the smell was kind of perfumey and
it's easy to apply but the thing with
this is it ruins the lashes duo glue is
very rubbery and once it dries you can
just peel it right off of any surface
and the eyelash is included to rewear
them and reuse them this like it's just
using a super glue it does not peel off
it does not rub off it does not melt off
this does not come off your lashes and
it's very hard to get off your eyelashes
eyelid in skin so I would have like
these like chunks of this all over my
eyes my regions throughout the week of
after using this and I couldn't get it
off my eyelashes would be ruined after
one or two times because this does not
remove from my
and I feel like it's just so you can buy
more because I hate this stuff next I
was sent this malli um ice blue eyeliner
and it's just not a pretty color like I
mean it is a pretty color but putting it
on it's very like like oh when can I
wear that though it's beautiful but I
try to write on my waterline and it just
kind of melted away and it's not a
darkness with a blue to stick out and
pop from your like whites of your eyes
it's just so light it just kind of like
blended in and like you do have to heat
this under like a fire or something so
like a lighter you need to light it so
that it does become more milk Co formula
because it can get very very pencil and
chalky so it's a beautiful color but not
for my makeup it style in my eyes at
least I have this green marble setting
spray which all like big theatre
companies Broadway drag queens Jeffrey
Stark look who's those and then Jeffrey
starts down there um
they use this and oh this just brings
that nightmares because this thing's
like a mother oh my god this stuff is
like it makes your your face like not
move like it's like Botox and spray
bottle so you spray this on it shoots
out like darts at you and it oh oh I
just hate this stuff I really eat it was
expensive for this type of thing and
this little green marble and you shake
it up it darts out because I don't know
if I got a weird like sprayer but and it
went to my eyes and it stings it's like
pure rubbing alcohol basically and it
stings so bad it smells so strong I feel
like I'm suffocating and breathing and
all these and Halen's that are bad for
you and it just like ruined my makeup
every time because I would either blink
and then I would have black mascara all
under here or it just like kind of puts
a little like darts and palette looking
dots into my foundation and what I had
just set and spent hours setting my
makeup then it would like ruin it was
like what looks like rain um so this is
just oh no Unni I needed to find a
lighter setting 3 that was way too thick
wait you having way too dense I'll be
like alcohol base material that it just
made my makeup look awful
and so I don't know got for me next I
have this mac prolongwear concealer they
think for our personal reason because I
know this is for everyone well first of
all it's most strongly a paint but
second all it's super thick
she's better people out of acne but for
me I was just using it under my eyes oh
my god it smells like paint like i
sweared its paint huh girl
but anyway pump with this is I was
putting on my eyes which I don't have a
commune in my eyes so it stung I don't
know if I got to close my eyes or if
it's because they thin skin and this is
really really really like heavy-duty
makeup applications but I just didn't
work from under my eyes and it you could
tell where I put this like it was like
clear that it was right there even if
ex-ante but still see where I can see
LaRon because it's so hard to button and
so thick so I used a lot of it but then
I was realizing in videos that I watched
back you could see me exactly where I
had applied concealer and it just didn't
look good if you have like really bad
acne or acne scarring hyperpigmentation
wrinkles I would suggest this because it
covers up everything but also if you
don't really have that each one a light
concealer to cover up some like little
bags or little dark circles in your eyes
that's not the one and the last thing I
have today for products I regret buying
is sadly my naked palettes um I love
Urban Decay I love their eyeliners but
for some reason their eyes shadow is to
me are not up to par or not is up to par
as other brands and maybe it's cuz I've
become more interested in a shadows
recently I love makeup geek I just I see
Beverly Hills stuff like that that these
aren't as pigmented to me they're not
bad quality they're not bad colors but
they're just not pigmented like okay so
like I'm blending this out and it's like
already gone like I expect it to be like
maybe cuz it just makes I'd love to pack
on like tons of makeup like really
vibrant eyes that I expect my colors to
be like really vibrant in your face like
that's a brown I just put right there
you can't even see it like buck and this
is half-baked and like their beautiful
colors their beautiful names packaging
brand I love it but the colors don't
show up on my eyes I just do I don't
just like them per se I wouldn't buy
them again once I'm right out of the
pallets even the Urban Decay smoked
it's a lot more of a mentioned than that
I don't know if super formula but like
girl look that same company I think it's
just those pallets so that was my
products I regret buying video I hope
you enjoyed this
me I don't dislike the brands definitely
check out these products still and see
if they work for you I can already take
them home to subscribe my channel become
a fierce coven to do me like me in the
rest of us on here and ship for there

week
