fun of it funny not fun funny video I'm
about how I kind of hold my lashes my
junior year of high school now this was
a highly requested video after I
mentioned it in one of my previous
videos I remember which one it was but
it was in one of my recent ones where I
was like oh yeah my lashes are short
cause I cut them off in junior year oh
I'm getting some like just an idiot in
this video which is kind of true I'm not
an idiot but like this video I was an
idiot junior year I was 16
yes I turned 16 in August homecoming
those in October September October I
think yeah um junior year I went alone
freshman year I went alone sophomore and
senior Ian dates
Junior I went alone and I looked like
this first off everything is a mess
everything is mess we'll get to that my
mom let me do my own makeup and my own
hair and that's what happened I recently
got a really short haircut like I did
last October um but I did like this my
sophomore year or actually might yeah I
saw more year and then my junior year
was so short cuz I got cut in May
sophomore year and then three months
later no like six support five six
months later was homecoming and my hair
still short hand grown much so it's just
a big mess like not sure hair so
gorgeous it looks great but like not on
me personally I don't like it hey this
is this is a lashes story I was doing my
makeup didn't really know how to do it I
just kind of started doing heavier
makeup and I did not know how to do it
correctly let's just say that I didn't
like let's be honest I didn't my smoky
eye was just one gray color up to my
breath I was like oh my god I have to do
a dark heavy smoke yet because it's
homecoming it's a dance
so gotta stick out so it was literally
all pretty much up to my brow of just
the only dark eyeshadow that I own at
the time which is this gray color from
Mac that I had had forever I think my
mom had a first when she gave it to me
and yeah it's like a metallic grape like
navy undertones and it was pretty but
you have to know how to use it right so
I didn't tell you I was doing this and I
was like oh my gosh I need to apply
falsies I'd never have had policies
before stupid right like you're the
first time you guys do all this is the
night of homecoming where you have like
an hour to get ready okay so did my
messy makeup it was a mess let's be real
and um I somehow don't know how but I
managed to glue the lashes on I didn't
have duo glue at the time which
most amaz'n lash glue and just use the
their elf lashes which elf lashes are
honestly my favorite lashes I'm on right
now they're my favorite lashes of all
the time better than our gel better than
a freakin anything's whore has anything
I don't know why the hell I didn't put
them in my favorite elf products but elf
lashes are my favorite lashes and my
favorite one of my favorite elf products
so I was doing that and I was like oh my
god such a heavy dramatic I have to do
her dramatic lashes otherwise much fun
I'm gonna stick out I a decent length
lashes before this whole incident but
anyway so I put the coats of mascara on
and then I've got the glue ready with
the crappy elf any any any eyelash glue
that comes with eyelash is any eyelash
glue that comes to the eyelashes oh it's
not good glue just get eyelash glue
whether that's duo or Ardell get eyelash
glue do not use the crappy stuff they
give you with the lashes it's not high
quality stuff that's just something that
because they don't expect people who buy
lashes for the first time to have glue
so then they just give them this crappy
said that's not tacky at all doesn't
stick they just slide it off okay I put
that on somehow managed to just stick
them in my like they stuck I don't know
how I got that but anyway they're on
there and they were they were too long
they were too long for the makeup I had
done it just looks really off
proportion-wise and looks bad and I was
just like oh okay
too much too much because I was sixteen
and like now it would be okay cuz I'm
like older and more mature looking but
then when I will show I did look quite
young I think I don't think that long of
lashes would've been the best choice for
me so I knew what I was watching than
that and I was like okay I'm going to
trim them but no I didn't trim them
before I put them on I trimmed them for
getting apparently that humans have
eyelashes before they have fake
eyelashes on like I was like oh I just
need a cousin eat like as I've seen you
had these lashes so I literally took
little scissors like little trimming
scissors and just clip clip clip clip
clip because the fig lashes were too
long for getting that all my real lashes
were under the lashes how stupid can a
person be literally all my real lashes
were under there like obviously no I
took off my real lashes first I can I
put these fake ones on like oh my god
stupid oh my god after I realize that I
cut them will even links like they
should be shorter than and longer I just
cut them all straight so they're all
saying like how's it going it's not good
no I should just do my real lashes so
after all that I took the fake lashes
off because I didn't like how they
looked took him off my just worked
literally gone there were little nubs
and I was like so upset I didn't cry and
I didn't tell him on the time or
anything but I was like cuz I cut off
all my real lashes I would I didn't
think they'd ever grow back
they have gone Mac um they're not
definitely not as long as they used to
be I tend to wear fake lashes a lot and
really big long big lashes to make up
for the lashes that are non-existent
that you know that I don't have but um
yeah so that's the reason why I wear
fake lashes left they're not necessary
obviously but I love to work more like
like what I did everyday makeups are
like you're an action every day but no I
don't but I do a lot of the time because
my real lashes look like I don't want
anything and what I do have a dramatic
eyes with a heavy dramatic eyeshadow you
need the lashes to fit and if you have
long lashes you're lucky if you have
eyelash extensions that's fine but like
I need a long eyelashes because my
lashes will not do the job and like if I
do a cat eye the lashes just get drowned
they get hit and you can't see them and
so he was saying to pop and they go home
dramatic look like fierce and great and
I can't really do that because I cut
them off and they're still not up to par
with where one's like I need freaky
lettuce up in here or something that's
the last story that's what happened I
didn't even look good but it wasn't even
like well after all that at least I look
good no my point I was a freaking mess a
mom cut my hair because I didn't know
how to cool hair at the time and so I
won't curl it I didn't like how it looks
if it's so short and then it made even
shorter when it cold in the Little Crow
let's just put it in like a side pony in
my dress my boobs are big enough to hold
up the strapless dress it was strapless
recently my mom had to show these
sparkly straps we got from Michael's
craft store on it was just a hot-ass
mess no I don't know what to ask me so
it looks like a freaking Google but so
yeah that was the homecoming story of
how I cut off my lash and I hope you
enjoyed this funny story
remember when you do want to cut your
fake lashes cut them beforehand that you
put them on otherwise you will get your
real lashes tangled up in there and
don't ever forget guys that you have
real lashes apparently under accurate
fake lashes like mind blown yes thank
you so much for watching if you're not
already to a moment so subscribe to my
channel I think I'm a fierce of covenant
diva I don't know why I did that like I
was kissing yes thank you so much
watching subscribe I really said that so
should we look for new videos I post new
videos every week and don't come
your lashes because it won't ever be
back to what they used to be lengthwise
I love you as much my bite
