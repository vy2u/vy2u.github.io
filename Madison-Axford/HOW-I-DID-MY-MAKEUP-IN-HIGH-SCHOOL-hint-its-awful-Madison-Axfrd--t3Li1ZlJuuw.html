never thought I would do it's the how I
did my makeup in high school video and
the reason why I'm doing this show much
later than everyone else and I feel like
it's like this trend is already past on
YouTube I still want to do it um I
originally like I said put it off
because my height I graduate isn't 14
that's not that long ago at all um sorry
what is up with my eyebrows okay um it's
not long ago it's barely two years I
didn't do this video because my makeup
in high school was awful I mean like
Kelly okay medicine like look everyone
was know not everyone was bad mine was
horrendous and I didn't you two at the
same time and so people thought that I
should be good at makeup and I can
barely to makeup now I like just learn
how to do it I guess like I don't know a
day ago I'm kind of embarrassed to do
this like who ever be like well you got
to rise to a year ago now you're doing
this video but it's I decide sign oh so
yeah it's a bit a little bit
I definitely grown in the makeup
artistry area but this is how I do my
makeup at high school not good
I'm going to try to do the best of my
ability I'm not going to do it like well
because I know how to do it better now
I'm so annoyed how I did it but like
this is it this is not me faking but
okay listen happenin so starting off the
foundation I always do this first
instead of like eye makeup and I always
used a baby crib whether that was
Garnier or Maybelline and I use this one
for a while especially when I started
YouTube so I'm just gonna put a little
with this on my face my foundation was
always too tan for me um because I hate
my red cheeks but okay so I just I put
it on my fingers too so I need some more
this like wasn't even freaking enough I
was put in hell a glob on my nose
because it was always so red oh look so
bad
this already looks so bad Oh oh my god
okay so I'm just going to go in now and
blend this in with my hands because
that's what I did
oh it's not as bad as I thought it was
going to be putting like this kind of my
nation my taste for first-timer forever
I never put any on my eyelids stupidly
so that was like a different color I
never set my face with like how utterly
my husband always be equated where's
your powder look in your makeup and I
was like oh I just use bronzer and
they're like no no no but like your
setting powder and I was like no really
I just ease bronzer and it's good you
should put like pitch here make a person
okay that's what I clearly found out I
was never and will never be a makeup
beauty guru person also I never blended
it down my neck so it was always a
different color and people would really
roast me for that in high school but
it's fine so after I did that I went in
with a concealer now you know or we know
now that it concealer supposed to be a
little bit lighter under your eyes to
highlight the face but no I went in with
a orange concealer and if not darker
color and I just went and did this like
you thing like I did not go past really
where my eyelid ended I didn't go up to
highlight I didn't go in the fee that
you're supposed to do try to say to you
and like did this I didn't even tap it I
just like rolled it around my fingers
again and oh my god this is Britney PEC
boobie bad bends so it just like stayed
right here to really like highlight and
emphasize even more that I had under-eye
bags
um so yeah moving on I just went in with
contour um and I used hoola I love hula
it's been one of my hair about this
forever and I use the brush that came
with it so I'm like true I'm like these
are all the same products I used um and
so I just went I went in on this brush
and then I learned how to contour my
senior year high school I'm ish like I
didn't really know how to properly talk
to our totals like college but I learned
work a contour fricking went on your
face in my senior high school and so I
thought you had to like draw
I know you bitches are laughing because
you're lying bitch but this is what I
did this is what I thought a contour was
it was just a round line we're not God
yeah that's not as much like what I put
on more I'm legit gave myself sideburns
and I didn't set under-eye I didn't set
anything oh my god okay then I took this
brush by Real Techniques and I blended
this move s out but I didn't really
blend because first of all there was
nothing set underneath it um it was just
like on top of the Foundation's it was
hard to blend out because it's sticking
to the foundation that's wet there was
no setting powder so it was already kind
of stuck and I just kind of like blended
this out and it just looks like a
sideburn and I genuinely thought the
contour was and I thought it was good
and like you can look back on past
videos with homecoming prom senior year
I did this like insert the frickin prom
clip right now
told you that's what I did
I didn't blend up and blend down just
right here that's all that mattered and
that was it
so yeah moving on to eyebrows oh my god
I feel my arms anymore I'm very very
fortunate that I do have very big
natural eyebrows but girl I took a
brough like this like a thick top brush
okay and my Naked palette that's
freaking been through a hurricane in
back and I took the shade dark horse you
can see knowing well that I'm like a pan
on really um and I filled in just god
this is so bad I don't know what I cook
it anyway
and just filled in right here like no
down here I didn't draw them in it just
I filled in the front area of my
eyebrows with a brush this thing oh it
looks like a Tyler I don't know why I
thought I needed to make the front of my
brow so thick and dark and big
okay
this is why people made fun of me in big
sense now okay I got it
I glue them down I don't I used Oh mush
I'm just using any browser right now
musing and sassy I obviously didn't have
an associative accent I just had Lee I
think was the Maybelline one at the time
and that one works fine but I just glued
them down because I was like I've got to
keep my good-ass brows that stain it off
leaked in place so then moving on to
eyeliner I took any black eyeliner in
line to my tightline and waterline and I
lined my waterline major like tons put
on my tight line and I water on it so I
want to make sure you can see that was
wearing eye like so um and then I'll do
my arch I look right in my top liner
raised Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion as my face like throw act when
this was the oh um so I just put
this all over the reason this is so
horrendous and scared it means is
because like it looked like this like
this is what my makeup looks like oh
there's a smeared eyeliner that was
always a classic for Madison and I never
know why it was like purple to minimize
because I didn't set and I just put like
eyeliner on it it all smudge
I used naked for everything and I never
blended my eyeshadow so I used sin you
can see right here hit pan quite a bit
as my overall lid color so I just packed
this on top of the primer I didn't know
what blending was and you'll see that in
a second
and then for my outer crease i used
gunmetal I always use this blue for any
really any event I didn't wear this to
school per se every day but it seems
like it and um yeah it's just I didn't
blend okay so I just put this on here we
go blue gunmetal here we go outer crease
and then what I thought blending was was
literally just blending it right here so
here we go just right here not taking it
in just kind of like circular motions on
where I had just placed it and moving on
um for eyeliner I used any kind of like
a liquid liner and I just got I just
lined the outer half of my eye my upper
eyelid and so I didn't come to the
corner with it I didn't wing it out just
just the end okay and I wouldn't pull
because that was like that so like I
would literally like it be the most
wonky line just on the outer half like I
gotta make it worse there we go it was
like really bad like putting the
screenshot right now like it wasn't even
a straight line I don't understand how I
went to spoil you that mascara i always
use any drugstore mascara so i'm uses
l'oreal one and I would just like enough
for that much on I would never curl my
lashes because I cut them off
accidentally my junior year of high
school high school was a great time and
so I don't really want to break them off
with curling them so I just put on a
little mascara this was never a huge
part for me I never wore lashes I put a
little on my bottom
I used like any pink lipstick I'm going
to use Mac angel today because um I
don't have it I used to use like totally
gone
I'm thankfully so I have a lilac angel
I'm pretty sure I got this me or start
wearing this made senior year um and
then yeah I think this is it that color
and eyebrows and everything is just too
good like it's too on point um yeah so
and you can see that like I even dress
up at like high schooler because what
was cool back then was wearing like one
of these like zip up things with up no
shirt under it just a bra and that was
like the quotient so like and I was wore
a button so like I'm I swim Edison Henry
fences mean I wouldn't either phenom
