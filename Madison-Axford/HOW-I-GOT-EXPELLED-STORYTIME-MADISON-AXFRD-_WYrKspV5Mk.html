what am i doing a video alibi the time I
was expelled I was pretty good girl I've
always been but like something happens
or what let's talk about that okay so
it's like fifth grade year I was 9 or 10
okay just adjust to things it's always
been like myself but like a little
quieter I only got louder with age and
with confidence um but okay so you get
what's happening so if this is grade
year I had like about one or two friends
and for my class which there was except
for classes there's like four different
classes along whole fifth great planet
hundred people maybe a whole fifth grade
in my school and there's like 20 you
know 230 people in each class okay so my
class you can either bring lunch or by
lunch it's like that's how it is in most
schools and I always brought because I
never ate what they served at lunch you
know God bless the lunch ladies and
lunch people but I just like oh we
became our daily to this day so I should
have that every day okay or Lunchables
oh that was a good day though so if you
brought lunch here to put your lunchbox
in a bucket raised like this little like
a normal Rubbermaid bucket that the
people who are on lunchbox carrying duty
that day carried it down through dug
cafeteria like Rick for recess it's a
little like movement like they carried
it down the guys go out to recess while
we all just watch watch a recess so we
all have to take turns of doing that job
okay so I always brought rights when
Linda saw that bucket he blows carried
it down the buyers don't give a bugger
to disco and I got lunch okay so we go
to recess bah bah bah it was not my day
to take bucket down but whoever's it was
I thought for you taken it down but they
hadn't they didn't take the less volume
down at the cafeteria okay to the lunch
boxes all the people who brought which
is like 10:50 be able to say we're still
in the room but we realize recess was
the playground in the teachers position
both have lunch so I have a set room it
gets locked right so now we are
nine and starving even though we rated
three snap times we are hungry we want
our lunch but we don't have it because
the forgot to bring it down
today okay so me and whoever it is 10 12
to 15 people but a lot of us wants to
get our lunches in the cafeteria wasn't
there there mother okay let's go
together
and back in the room we didn't sink over
to be locked we all walk back there in
this little like ten person huddle and
I'm leading the pack ranks I'm like
let's go to the room and do we get there
I'm like by the door and it's not it's
not opening so we're like opening
opening giggling giggling pushing
kicking trying to twist with our nails
nothing is working with Salafis our
teacher locked it and rightfully so our
 was in there but it's like damn
okay and keep in mind this is a keypad
or a teacher she was pregnant the time
granted so I'm not going to limit on
that but like she literally hold a stick
if you I tried to bring the lunch down
that you're falling and do not come get
me in the teachers lounge it's not
appropriate so basically she was saying
if some nine-year-old forgot to bring
everyone else's lunch down all the other
people who did nothing couldn't eat
because she couldn't be bothered once
the door had not wood into a second for
you to come and unlock the door but no
she said do not come under me in in the
imitation by design appropriate for you
to go in there obviously we have gone
and we just would not but we couldn't go
in so genius master was leading this
pack nine-year-old that I was like okay
guys for some reason the teachers room
next door was unlocked
so I'm like a middle-aged high finding
the paper clips scissors something and
we're going to get this door and left
and they were like and I was like be
right back this is would really like
sway will Madison so I go in his room
look a paper clip so I found scissors
because I knew that would work there
with the skinny little kid scissors so
took the mountain I was like hey guys
guess what I got and everyone knew that
that would be able to open the door
because they were skinny they fit just
enough in this like a lot hole so I'm
like saying well I do it I don't really
know how to open a lot cuz I didn't want
to get in trouble if something were to
happen every ghost is like maybe you can
do okay right we're all 9 and idiots so
I'm like fine I'll just do it I'm doing
it for like 3 minutes nothing is really
happening and I finally just jam it in
there all the way ok so idea of scissors
into a keyhole to take a moment to make
doesn't work but manual meth and knew
this would work and we all knew it would
work but what didn't work but it
actually worked so damn it in there and
like you know those doors at school
they're like silver and they just like
kind of like once you like moving down
and like prospect oh but it's a handled
or you know that ok so once I like
jammed it in there the handle just
dropped but it opened okay so bitch you
know like I I lunged but the door
handles broke okay it is myself so it
didn't like papa
up it didn't work you couldn't read lock
it because I had to jam this and they're
not some little like lock whatever was
happening inside off to cause it to
break but also open and ever I was like
okay so we all going get our lunches we
don't take the bucket down because if
anyone who didn't come with us
we don't take your lunch now you can get
it yourself and break another doorknob
so yeah I broke the doorknob but I mean
I was kind of all of us it was all of us
together you know I mean I came up the
plan and executed if you notice all this
together we just want our lunch I don't
think we don't really is it wrong like I
was like I'm gonna break this the
teacher like no you're hungry and like
the our teacher couldn't be bothered so
like I had to get at something else we
had to get our lunch somehow because
it's like a long day right okay 9:00 to
4:00 you know elementary school so you
know it's just like from home with our
little things and we go eat okay so
after lunch it's time to go into the
classroom and our teachers in there and
she looks good so I'm like oh damn oh oh
oh god oh god make it felt like whoo
what little bitch is gonna rat me out
for this because it was a group effort
it was a group of her so me my best
friend the time we're in this group and
we all go back in there la dee da dee da
and she's like okay we have a situation
we should ride up to her she's like
someone I know who it was I don't know
pointing there's a point blame but
someone broke the doorknob I don't know
why I don't have anything stolen but
like does anyone have any leads on this
does anyone know what would happened and
me me typing were like no one said
anything okay
no anything and then later I think she
your house is those delicious were gone
because she's really so much a lot they
were delicious were still in there and I
delicious were gone so she calls the
people who marked that they were
bringing their lunch this date up one by
one during reading time swirled quietly
exactly single corner and like to be
like Jimmy and then up were like okay
good lecture a chill it's because we're
night and we're looking to happen we're
going to principles with us we're gonna
store finger you ever happened is go the
trenches officers doing nothing really
wrong get this bitch one in light of the
door she's calling people up whatever
whatever and then I'm called up and like
every has already told her like she's
like Madison like I know what you did
Madison I'm sorry
and she's like okay in that she sent me
like five or six other people out a lot
of those four bitches got out of the
situation but they did he can Ellis to
the principal's office so I never been
in trouble never do anything wrong
there's so much we're all II didn't cry
we're like
okay so we're going to principal's
office like towards the end of the day
she's make you have a meeting with Miss
blank who you know who are the principal
was - her name
and we're like be serious for what
getting our lunch is you this is putting
you in a bad situation because we're
going to write your eyes out because you
said don't disturb me that should have
been said you're a teacher for
elementary school kids this isn't like a
college kid for dinner lunch we're
little so sorry that some idiot forgot
to bring it down and then I'm being
punished for a thing with it huh
okay so later the day we go to Princeton
office and she like talked to us by
Allah in a group when I won whatever all
the people get to go except me I don't
know people bitches what medicine data
to get on but I'm like damn so here I am
and I'm like yeah I did it and I told
her story not like okay we couldn't get
our lunch because someone forgot to
bring down whoever's job it was and
she's like well that's not okay to break
in or now I'm like I know but the
teacher said that recording there and
she just lost because that wouldn't be
nice or appropriate to bother her during
the lunch hour so like what I don't have
money in my cafeteria account because I
bring every day so like I didn't have
lunch and she's like you should have
come as a teacher I was like I know but
being a nine-year-old I'm going to try
to follow the rules and she said do not
come and get me and like I went on back
in back to back a minor fourth of a
principal and vice-principal and they
end up excelling nearly suspending me
until further notice from my parent so
they had to call my mom down it had to
like them talk to each other make sure I
wasn't like some violent ratchet child
so I can still be in the classroom
because I broke to Nora Roberts is there
because base one arming my lunch so I
Malcolm sounds tales at all she's like
