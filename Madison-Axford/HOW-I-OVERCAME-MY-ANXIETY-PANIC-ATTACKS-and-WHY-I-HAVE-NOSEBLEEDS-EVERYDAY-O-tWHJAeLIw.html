another talking video these have been so
fun thank you guys tremendously they
gotta support you've given me and these
new this new series basically it's
literally me talking in fact that anyone
enjoys it is just amazing to me so thank
you so much for condition we could
usually watching it and commenting and
liking the videos that means oh so much
to me before I go on can you please
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already there you know we all know the
YouTube glitch we were constantly losing
subscribers every time we upload and I
don't want to not upload because this is
literally my life and I love it but I'm
losing so many subscribers each time
granted they're probably robot accounts
but some of them are real people so if
you could just subscribe and pass on the
word they meet great and tremendous help
I also follow my social media links that
be linked in the down bar and the
further ado let's get into this talking
we get today today I had to have the
dentist because I got braces I got my
braces off five years 16 go away six
years ago no five
I don't even know Matt I was once a math
major huh what no not me I was doing it
anyway five years going up my braces off
and ever since then I've had these
built-in retainers to keep my teeth
straight right put my top teeth you're
like bitch what happened in there with
your big-ass gap okay right so that
broke when I was my first year at
college and I was away from home so I
couldn't get it fixed so I never got it
fixed I went in to get a fix and they
were like mmm it's kind of too late to
get it fixed cuz you'll see the bracket
wire hanging um from the belt and
retainer so like you're just gonna have
to deal with that maybe get like adult
braces later and I'm like bitch I ain't
doing that and like maybe the design I'm
like bitch I ain't doing that so yeah
let some gaps on my top teeth until
forever or maybe I'll change it outta my
bottom teeth cowboys entertainer on it
recently it did break them and so I had
to get it replaced today it was
literally five hundred dollars for us
freakin metal bracket thing anyway
move it on got to keep these teeth
straight right so I go in today and I
don't think it you can't probably okay
so it's just like a metal wire those
little brackets but they're smaller than
braces and so they're on there they had
to rip the old one off not like Ripley
like ferociously like
like drill it off and I was like huh
okay also I'm really bad with flossing I
don't floss mainly because I can't get
in between its front teeth because they
have like brackets wires come behind my
teeth so I can't get up in their food
though therefore never really gets up in
there because the breath is blocking it
so it's not like I've endless meat stuck
in my teeth but it's still kinda gross
ii cant floss okay so yeah after heat my
dentist took off my old brackets that
I've had him for five years he was
plastic like it's very grisly Furman was
way vigorously okay right so much that
you know if you don't floss your gums
are very sensitive and they get
irritated easily with any foreign thing
coming in and they start bleeding like
gushing blood right just all of them are
like and they're leaving it I was just
like in the chair like huh
okay so he gets these cotton swabs cuz
he's like goddamn and he's like shoving
cotton sauce in under my tongue for some
reason of in here like I have five
cotton swabs like that are like maybe
like that size okay they're kind of like
a cylinder size in my guns and I'm just
like and so then he had to wait some
glue tacky or something something was
had to be waiting for the brackets so he
they set me back up so I could like
chill with my bloody gums and I was like
and I couldn't show us in this tool I'm
I just like to rip me on my mouth and I
don't like this is like oh here
she's like wiping it I was like okay
yeah so that was happening and I like
I'm kind of like free to swallow and
they put like gum in my art gum glue in
my mouth or like fluoride or anything I
don't want to swallow so I just have all
this slide we've built up with my
clothes look throat and I'm just like
does I'm like drowning in my slide but
it's really gross but oh well and so
that was happening and then they finally
got it on whatever it was skin like
rough so I filed it down and fixed it
whatever and I was good to go okay so
that's what I did today
and then um but I came home did make up
for the first time in forever usually
I'll just use a little Mac powder and do
my normal winged eyeliner and lashes but
the ended freaking eye shadow in my
contour and and and liquid
foundation I haven't used in 20 years
but it did cover up I think my chemical
burns
nicely so I'm very happy with how this
turned out for the most part but at Mesa
first times got a full-face since like
September so very proud for trying new
things anyway um and I you speak
lipsticks everyone's up my asshole about
freaking nude lipstick it's my favorite
color and before like yo la godly and
I'm like okay you know I like this color
so I'm using Mac and I went back to an
oldie that I like hate it for a second
there but I went back to today so hope I
made everyone proud um yes so I'm gonna
talk about a few things first of all
nosebleeds tell me if I've had this
problem since I was like 0 and a half
but tell me if anyone else has had this
problem where they get no sweets
especially in the winter months from
late November December or whatever to
March you know more doesn't really
winter I still give them no sweets every
day bitch you not every day no every day
at least three times a day I get a
nosebleed
it happens anywhere everywhere I drop to
touch my nose I can just look at my nose
in the mirror it's like huh gushing
blood and it's not like a little
spotting you there's like a little blood
no like dripping down
I literally tweeted about this I had
nose weights in my sleep two nights in a
row and it got on my sheets and my
pillow in the wall so I was trying to
turn the light and there's like bloody
handprints looks like someone was like
shot or something and there's blood all
dripping to my back throw it on the
floor and just let me sink everywhere
and it's obviously it's cleaned up but
it's just like everywhere and if that's
how much it's bleeding it's not like I'm
like oh no it's like I has problems
since forever I can remember in high
school what happened during classes I've
been lucky knock on wood that it hasn't
really happened in too many cup of my
college classes that happen all the time
in high school and it's like I'm like
I'm picking my nose like I'm just
sitting there like like on a date or
some it's like huh like that I mean
I know that it's not like rope i means
gross faces blood but I don't recruit
from blood so it's not gross to me it's
not like um I'm like puking or something
so like yeah it's a nosebleed but get
over it and I used to stick tampons on
my nose all the time if it doesn't make
it clot at all I just kind of hold it in
there and soaks up the blood but I would
never like would walk in public with the
tampon I might know it's being like but
now I do hold it and that's it you up
there and you're supposed to turn your
head down if any ho tries to tell you
no no it is not touch hard excellent
that blood ran down your throat no you
don't its tilt your head down and hold
up here the bridge of your nose so a
clot form so it's pressure okay it's not
this I don't know what person created
this so that blood is going down your
throat and you're spitting on plots it's
not cute
it's not cute okay but I have no sweets
at least three times a day it's so like
it's a real act hassle I don't know if
anyone else has this I put in this stuff
called air Ayr it's like gel nasal gel
or nasal spray that helps moisten up
your nose and your nasal passageways so
they're not so hard and crispy and
crunchy and dried I'm constantly putting
that in with a q-tip it's gross but like
it does soften up the tissue and you
know I don't know its cartilage I don't
know
it's awesome whatever it's often set up
so that I do give me those plates less
or it's more likely I'll be okay but if
I don't use that it's just constant
constant flow coming down my nose and
what's gross is when they're really bad
it'll start running down my throat even
like this because it just like overflows
and goes down my throat and it makes me
a klutz calm down TMI sorry it's it's a
lot it's a lot and another thing that
sucks is I am like a hypochondriac like
I am a hypochondriac because I always
think I'm dying and I know those people
you see in like shows whatever and
they're annoying but like if I have a
headache it's not a headache it's like
I'm starting to think I have like a
brain tumor site and I'm not trying
funny this place like this is actually
what I think of and one of those Google
goes on like WebMD and thinks I'm dying
like like Oh always wrong like by the
stomach ache it's not Stunna gig it's
like intestinal problems or cancer again
or appendix or something and if I have
blurry vision for a second it's like and
I tumors that like you know it's never
just oh I just have blurred vision
blurred lines no if somebody's always
wrong and so when I have like these cons
of bloody noses it's not just like oh I
have a dry nose it's a winter no it's
like something has to be wrong though
that's right thinking over over in my
mind and stuff and it sucks but that's
like part of I don't know being a
worrywart and that's another thing I
want to talk about I know you guys know
I have anxiety but I'm I'm just sorry
I'm like so so proud of myself
because it's
literally almost like I don't have it
anymore I've never seen a psychiatrist
or I've never seen a therapist or anyone
for it
I've never taken medicine which I'm so
thankful for cuz I medicines another
thing kind of scares me
I don't like altering my persona in any
way shape or form or like I'll take an
advil every now and again for a headache
but I notice and I don't like it scares
me okay so I never saw anything never
took anything my anxiety
came in really really strong my
sophomore year of high school junior it
was their senior it was their freshman
year of college got the worse that had
ever been I never had depression it was
just anxiety I was just worried to the
point of myself making myself sick you
know um it was just exciting exciting
xiety oh I'm gonna little anxiety my
name is mess and I anxiety that's all I
could think about talk about that's how
I left my life um sophomore year of
college
still preb prevalent prevalent yeah
prevalently there um very very much so
junior college where I'm at now not
saying I'm like the most carefree
go-with-the-flow ho no it's still there
but so much less the point where I'm so
proud of myself I could cry and I would
used to do videos about things I didn't
need any text and updates on it and it's
like it never really got better then and
now I can officially say like I'm doing
pretty good like I'm doing amazing and
it's like something I've never been able
to I never thought could be possible
because when you're in anxiety or any
mental illness you're like I'm in a
slump I'll never get out of this my life
sucks this is awful why can't I be
normal why can't I be like them having
fun why can't I be a normal college kid
why can't I just be an adult why is this
happening to me and I can't have fun I
can't let go I can't be carefree why am
I worried about everything Bubba Bubba
but that's how you feel and there's it's
not like oh but if I think about in a
little lesser if I exercise it'll go
away there's no one out for us sometimes
and it feels like there's no way that
anything can change but it did for me
and I don't know what ticked or what
went off but I started to give just a
little bit less of a in my life has
never been better my life has never been
better I've never been prouder I've
never been happier I've never been
stronger I've never been more confident
or empowered or independent or success
or excited for life and it's just the
most incredible feeling and I want you
to know that I have been where you were
at I have had my low days and in my low
months in my low years where life just
is awful and yes granted it could be so
much worse we could be dying of a
disease or we could be you know not live
in a country that's free you know there
could be things that are so so much
worse but what we have is justifiable
and it is it is back it can be bent
until let anyone tell you that just
because they can't see it that it's not
important that it doesn't matter and
then it's not there it's just as
important as physical disability I
mention disability is but know that me
Madison with makeup and the hair my butt
has been where you are at and you can
get through you can get through never
ever ever think that you can't because
I've been there how am I gonna go on
life is just inevitably bad I worry
about everything I can't even go to bed
I can take a shower I can't even leave
my house I can't even go to the grocery
store without having a panic attack know
you can get through it if you need to
take medicine if you need to see someone
talk about it with someone you trust
whether that's your parents an older
brother or sister a younger brother or
sister who will understand this a
counselor a guardian a grandma a teacher
a professor a manager work talk to
someone that you trust fully if you need
to get the help and have them help you
because I never did that because I
always wanted to handle it on my own
that was just something in my mind I
wanted to handle on my own right now
my junior at third year in college I've
never been happier in my entire life
and I started to top it with that like I
can go to restaurants I can go to
grocery stores I can go to malls and go
on vacations I can go on these things
that used to freak me out
without panic attacks without worried
without stress I can hang out with
people without saying oh I don't know if
I can do that tonight I can do that now
and this one was incredible feeling
because finally I feel like Madison no
longer Madison with anxiety I'm Madison
and you can do that to police if you
need to help get the help it's not
embarrassing you're saving yourself
you're saving your life and trying to
make it as great and as amazing as it
can be bees don't get one chance on this
earth so either you're gonna suffer and
live each day horribly or you're gonna
try to make an effort to make a
difference and it can be hard and I can
seem like it can't be done I did that
but it can be because I am proof no I
didn't take anything no I didn't see
anyone but I drilled and drilled and
drill myself and worked myself to the
bone to feel better to get better
whatever that was I tried to make myself
see that this is my one shot what if I
died tomorrow what would I be happy
about how I lived today would I be happy
with what I did all I did today was
worry so let's change that let's make it
conscious effort to try and be happier
just stop worrying just stop thinking
about that but you have to try you're
not trying and that hearing that makes
you want to give up it does it makes you
want to stop trying and just lay in bed
and worry slave it lay in bed and to
worry all day well if you were like
you're not trying no I am trying and you
may not see it but I know that I am
trying and I am never I feel like
I represent better like I feel like
waves have been lifted off me I'm ready
to tackle any task that comes my way and
do it happily and and and ready and I
don't know if it's because I I
transferred or I just put myself first
and stop trying to please others or I
realized that I only get my chances
earth or whatever it was that made my
mind switch but I switched the way I
think and maybe my maturity was aged and
turning 21 this year maybe that's
something to do with it but I'm just so
happy because this is the only shot I
get on this earth and I'm either gonna
make it great or I'm gonna die trying to
make it great I'm no longer going to sit
around and complain I feel sorry for
myself and whine and just be so unhappy
and nervous and think everyone's judging
me I'm going to live my life for myself
and you if you don't like it get out of
my perfect life so I hope this taught
you something today but it's just that
you can succeed you can become a
completely different person that you
were happy with and that you love and
adore because that's what I did I didn't
like who I was two years ago but I
changed myself to be someone that I'm so
proud of and would want to be friends
with now and
um exciting no longer defines me and no
longer ruins my life and I no longer
controls me or runs my life and just
know if you have anything whether it's a
mental or physical disability you can
use it to your benefit and or you can
get over it like if isn't a disability
you can't just you know get over it and
I feel bad for that but you can use it
to your benefit and you can live with it
and and work it and and a mental
disability you know people don't see it
and so you can either hide it and live
with the suffering or you can find a way
to to make it less sir make it lesser or
get over it it's not should I woke up
one day and I was cured because you know
you live with it your whole life unless
something magically happens but it's
like it feels like I don't have anything
wrong anymore and it's the most
incredible feeling so know what it gets
better never give up please people care
about you people love you people want
you to succeed and know that know that
your life can be amazing to just know
that and whether it's through prayer or
through skill and practice or whatever
it is that that makes you better know
that you can get there trust me I never
thought it could but here I am so thank
