about my personal story of facial hair
and I permanently got rid of it without
bleaching laser waxing or threating so
you want to know how I got rid of it my
struggle and how you can to keep on
watching so I have dark hair dark
eyebrows okay so we know my upper lip
hair was always there during high school
I suppose I can get more make fun of it
but yeah it was there I would get it
waxed a lot my friends we would go and
like get it waxed you know get it
threaded I would try to like cut it with
little scissors because you can't shave
it and so I was just like you know
and I would have like a unibrow so I
gotta like do this and then I would have
like these hair down here look like sad
birds up in here I know it was so
annoying cuz I would look at other girls
migrator girls the magazine girls on TV
and they didn't have it doesn't matter
if they're blonde or not they didn't
have it but don't worry they did as well
you just couldn't see this much of mine
but ladies I'm not here to be a bitch
but if you're a lady you have hair too
just because you're not a man doesn't
mean you don't have facial hair it's
little it's thin it's it's it's soft but
it's there so whether or not you would
take care of it put it to you you like
rock the moustache but you might have a
moustache so I was sick of it I would
have a little like you know here's my
chin here is under my lip TMI gross I
know oh well hairs above my lip like I'm
gonna up to my nose my unibrow good
sideburns I know okay it's a very hairy
face in my makeup application was
definitely showing the flaws so I was
like I don't know how people can look
like they don't have hair in their face
or don't have hair in my face
what is the freaking secret that I don't
know I was so pissed looking up every
remedy looking eye I mean I've got my
lip waxed mr. netted you know cut I
haven't changed it but I've done
everything and bleaching lasering was
way too scary but I was gonna rule is
ring next with this bitch dang comments
ticked I have the remedy I have the
magic cure now this didn't work for you
or if this doesn't work for you I'm
sorry like tests on your hand or
something first or your arm finger
knuckle toe whatever you have else you
have hair on to make sure you don't have
a weird reaction to it if your hair
grows back early course me and my
friends use this it has like my family
it has been all too
we find and amazing for us unless you
have signed different or different skin
type different hair type be careful it
might work definitely for every person
but everyone I know is worked amazingly
for and I'm so thankful that I finally
figured this out okay this little device
will save your life and you are Harry
you ain't gonna be here no more gloom
beauty I love it I've had it for about
three or four months and battery's still
going strong you can see here it's
slowing down a little bit but still
going strong I love it this thing to
death there's about a ton dollars from
Walmart and this is from the brand Clio
I think CLI oh the color sells at
Panasonic sells that every brand sells
these Amazon you know Target Walmart but
literally they sell like reach angel
little blades go out and get one of
these if you're struggling with body
hair I've done this for four months my
hair has never come back my face I never
have hair my face anymore thank the Lord
in heaven above and has a girl met
course which I'm so thankful for because
I took a selfie once and I saw hair on
my chin and I was like this has gotta
change now and so anyway I make a bump
so it's kind of hard for me to do and I
don't have any on my face because like I
just I do this almost every day but the
areas I'll do like I said are around my
upper lip because that was a bitch under
here because you do have hair under your
lip as well as thin um even if you dark
hair it is light but it's still there I
do like right here I'm a chin um like if
it's a big s day I'm done well like my
entire face um but like I did
the sideburns cuz that ain't cute I also
do right in between my brows I don't
want to shape my brows yet because I
feel like I will Nick them so um they're
fine I really don't need to do anything
for them but I do like get a unibrow
occasionally so I'll just go in a bit
now today and yes that's pretty much it
I would also do like to hop my hand
because like hair on arms fine but like
right here I was like oh so yes that's
coming there anyway that's the Santa
makes it buzzes it can't really cut you
unless you're like a spaz with it um but
you just feel like I just kind of go up
like that and I guess the hairs off yeah
and then I would just take it like this
and wipe off and then later I would just
run a little alcohol swab over it and
that's literally it
girls I'm not saying you get rid of your
facial hair I'm not the bitch just gonna
be like shave everything
no you out what you in a rock if you
want to have hair have hair if you don't
have hair here is your secret don't pay
any more than you need to I was paying
literally $50 a month to keep this tamed
so now get this little machine little
amazing thing and then get all that gone
so you never to be like who let me put
like Jeff would always tell me like hey
you I can see her mustache in the Sun
and I'd be like you kidding me I just at
the SWAC three years ago and it was
already coming back never ever have to
deal with that again I'm not sponsored
by that they don't know I exist I was
just looking for a cure for facial hair
and I found it so yes
buh-buh-buh I'm good to go so little if
I see like one poking through I'll be
like mmm that's a day well and you're
growing real quick okay so in my dad's
my video I'm just like so excited about
this I found this I can share with all
you love the girls and boys I guess good
news is go ahead anyway if you're not
reaching home to subscribe my channel to
become first covenant people that mean
there is Sun here and should be there
for newbies posting videos every week
