hot dog and so we have a whopping ninety
one-percent our female viewers but then
about ten percent of my viewers are male
which is actually kind of weird and
creepy if you think about you know what
my videos are now it may look in the the
most men are you just 45 54 so let's
just have that on my first teach you how
to make a good quality youtube video and
I know a lot of you probably aren't
going to make a video ever or don't
already but I just thought it'd be
interesting for you to know what
youtubers go through if you didn't know
I'll tell you a little bit about my
experience with YouTube I am a blogger
and it's picture of me um if you don't
know what a blogger is there's like a
definition um it's not get a dictionary
put online it's just like a blogger the
be where you post your feelings thoughts
opinions things like that online on the
online post or a blog however a blogger
like me and hundreds of other people on
YouTube record ourselves doing videos
and then put them online for everyone to
watch so if you wanted to know a little
bit about my demographics this is the
people who watch my videos all my videos
either about makeup beauty fashion or
like boy advice and so we have a
whopping ninety one-percent our female
viewers but then about ten percent of my
viewers are male which is actually kind
of weird and creepy if you think about
you know what my videos are now it now
look in the most men are you just wait
554 so let's just have them on my first
okay anyway moving on to the beginnings
of YouTube YouTube began because of
three men that originally worked for
paypal in 2005 then a year later in 2006
google bought youtube for 1.65 billion
dollars and then if you after that in
2007 google or no yet google adsense
partnered with youtube and that's how
youtubers like myself and everyone else
the uploaders get paid for our videos it
is like a job and since they connected
with people absence that's how it all
works so when I started in my videos I
didn't know how to do you know good
quality videos I didn't know what it
took and I tried hard but they just
weren't up to par with where they are
now and my videos are amazing now but I
do think that I gradually get better and
learn new things each time I upload so
with the first step to having a decently
good quality video is an HD camera and I
hate saying this because it sounds
really cocky and it sounds like oh you
can only make a video if you have an HD
camera which is not true but especially
for the types of videos that I do which
are like fashion oriented or makeup
tutorial where i show you make up
products in the steps that i take and HD
camera is definitely necessary now I
knew I want to take you to very
seriously and have it as a possible
career or job so I did save up my money
and I bought this for I bought this for
two thousand dollars which seems like a
lot but yeah so no one wants to watch a
blurry webcam video so HD cameras are
differently necessary because it's
better quality and this is the best
quality you can have however when i
started my videos i didn't upload the
best quality even though i had that okay
so the second step is good lighting this
is why I have this chair here so good
lighting can make or break your videos
and you can either have artificial
lighting which I have it's like filming
lights or you can have natural lighting
like sitting in front of a window so if
you're sitting in your chair filming and
you have your tripod or camera right in
front of you you want to make sure
whatever you have that you're using for
lighting is behind the camera facing you
so whether you be sitting in front of a
window and it's facing you or thought I
have filming lights that I bought so if
those are facing me make sure that the
lights are not behind your chair or
wherever you're sitting because that
will put a dark shadowy castle
and I used to do that the first like
year i had my youtube channel which i've
had over a year and half but the first
like year i didn't understand what to do
i didn't understand why my videos were
so dark and blurry and it looked like it
was on a webcam even though it was worth
this expensive camera and it was because
i only used my room lights that i have
just like a little shade and was at the
back behind me which cast into shadow
over my face so make sure your light is
in front of you and your quality will
improve tremendously and the last step
is a bit broad it's just good editing
skills so once you take your video and
then you've recorded and upload it to
your computer you know via USB cord this
is what i'm going to set you apart from
everyone else and it's what's going to
make people remember you so this is like
your music intro song self-promotion
transitions pictures lights whatever you
add to your videos to make it really
special and you don't make people
remember you on people will see the
obvious time and effort that you've
spent on your videos when you're editing
so um that's what's going to help get
more views and better quality overall so
we have my first video ever right there
and one of my more recent ones right
there so you can see your to your time
difference but i'm going to show you two
of my videos and i think i can see
obvious differences and i hope you can
too otherwise if you haven't seen any
differences that's kind of embarrassing
on my part but ok so this is the first
video that i ever did november i think
yep 16 2012 and i didn't understand
really what was wrong with it at the
time as you can see like half my heads
cut off um this is the only light I have
and it's not in full HD and I try to
have cute little music so people would
remember me but as you can tell them the
second it like overpowers nice hey my
name is Madison this is my very first
video like ever and i want to start
being a youtube beauty group even though
i know there are hundreds of them out
there feeling like some fresh and new
tips that i'm going to share with you
had hope you enjoy
very first video which is going to be
angered by my favorite disclaimer i know
it's only like the real november this is
all the holidays so much comes along
like am I thought I did okay so you can
hear that when the beat kicks in it's
like I'm just rambling on and on and no
one even cares about what I'm saying and
you can barely hear me anyway so besides
you can tell how it's really dark on my
face is not illuminated whatsoever and
they don't really have anything that you
guys would remember me by because it's
just kind of boring and I'm just kind of
talking with an instrumental karaoke
over my voice so this is one of my more
recent ones as you can see in the first
like 15 seconds I have a little intro
theme song so that it catches people
attention people's attention and
hopefully they will remember me and when
i say i don't know why i sent her she i
hate when people say charge a target and
they literally feature when cyrus on the
cover like every other time they pretty
much am i already used it nothing else
when what as well hey so be kind of a
different video for me today because i
normally don't do pulse today i am going
to interrupt store haul and I relate i
do this because i like watching holes
and just feel it's not that but um yeah
you couldn't see because of I guess the
brightness is too high or something but
it does say I'm that girl 07 it's my
channel name on the intro so it catches
your attention is loud obnoxious rap
music and you'll remember me for that
and i also have a little ukulele music
playing behind my voice and it's just
all these little things that will make
the difference now it doesn't matter if
any of you ever want to make a youtube
video or not but I wanted to tell you
what the key points are and what the
things that youtubers have to go through
and what makes the quality of a video
better you can see my face is
illuminated I'm more comfortable
confident in front of the camera then
the first video is very awkward and
embarrassing and I do think I've come a
long way so I hope this helped you with
you you know cared at all but up these
are the steps that I believe help
increase the quality of your YouTube
videos and generally help increase the
channel traffic subscribers and views
overall so thank you
