kohls targets and warm at you can give
it a lot of places a lot of random
places as well but my no sephora it's
from the Beauty Blender branch hey on
such a day I'm doing kind of a short
video but it's a how-to video and I feel
like I haven't done to have to video in
like literally forever since like my
backbone probably but today it's how to
use a Beauty Blender this is a real
beauty blender you can get one from from
21 oh it's uh um Cole's targets um well
Matt you can give it a lot of places a
lot of random places as well but mine's
from Sephora it's from the Beauty
Blender Brandt so this is the original
I'm doing how to use the original i'm
sure you can use these tips on the other
ones but i'm not a how-to % sure they'll
work as well or just the same since this
is the original one and not a knockoff
but it's totally fine if you have that i
hope that these work for you cuz i'm
sure they well they're both sponges but
you never know but anyway i'm going to
teach you how to use one correctly
because i got a lot of questions on this
and I didn't like this when I first
started using it as I hated it cuz I
didn't understand how it worked and how
to keep it clean and how to make it put
on makeup well because everybody who has
this and they gloves it but no one
really teaches you how to use it so
that's what I'm here to do and really
all you have to learn about this is how
to wash it and then it grows bigger and
that's how you use it so I'm going to
show you how to do that easy every day I
clean this with my elf brush shampoo
every day to keep it clean germ free and
acne free and yes I'm going to bring you
into the bathroom so I can show you hi
cleanness it's really really short and
you'll learn in no time how to use this
because you might be confused on how to
make it apply your makeup because the
number one thing about beauty blender is
why I love it so much is it because it
has so much moisture in it after you
wash it never puts on your makeup
flawlessly seamlessly it doesn't make it
look cakey or dryer anything it makes
your skin look perfect and i love it for
that reason i was having trouble with
applying with brushes and now that i
have a Beauty Blender I've had it for
about almost a year I just love it I
really want to get a new one though
because mine is ok so I have a makeup
bag and I you zip the zipper over top of
this and it took
a little chunk of my poor beauty
blenders I might pick up another one
they're only twenty dollars at sephora
or veto boner calm and yes i love it to
death it's pink um you can't probably
telex of all my makeup but it is pink
and yeah let's go into my bathroom so i
can show you how to use it ok so now
that we are in my bathroom here is my
Beauty Blender closer up you can see I
took out a chunk right there and right
here as well bigger one and it does suck
and does and then I'm going to use my
elf brush shampoo like I said and here's
just a closer look at it and so um when
you use a beauty butter each day each
morning each night whenever you're
putting your makeup on it's going to get
really really tiny even smaller than
this and really hard firm tight and
you're going to be like how am I
supposed to put on makeup with this you
know but you want to bathe in nice and
squishy and you know firm but not the
card is a rock you want it kind of
squishing it easy to apply to your face
the number i thing you should remember
when using a beauty blender is washing
it with water every you put it under
water every day it seems excessive but
you do to clean it and to get into its
full potential you get your brush
shampoo ready ah so you turn the water
on we're going to hold your feet on your
unread for a little bit so with its
water all over it
then kind of squish it a little bit
pushes like little motion that I'm doing
then again make sure water is getting
all upon it everywhere touches
everywhere squish it again to get excess
water out and keep doing that for a
while just a little bit couple seconds
then get your brush shampoo and squeeze
this on it just a little bit you don't
need too much and then rinse that off
really good and make sure you're
squeezing should try to get a lot of
makeup out of it you don't want um any
makeup left on it I mean it's yqg we
don't want that much and then stop the
faucet and you're going to have it full
of water it's gonna be really heavy she
was just going to give it a nice squeeze
and get all that water out you might see
some foundation colored water come out
as well and now it's he think it's good
enough you might want to rub it off on a
towel or washcloth idea on a hand towel
each day just to get any excess water
and makeup off and then you get to go
it's super large now and it applies
makeup so well because it has such a
huge like applicator point tip that you
can use Nash put on your makeup and it
puts it on so well make sure you're
blending and not like da Tings if your
dotting it will leave weird dots on your
skin but it just makes your makeup looks
lawless and seamlessly this no creases
or dads to anything ever if you do it
the right way so that's what you do um
to apply beauty butter just remember to
wash it because the water is what makes
it the beauty blender otherwise it's
just a hard the whole piece of sponge
and this is what makes it amazing and
reusable and this is why it's so great
and why everyone loves it so that's how
you use your beauty blender i hope this
taught you or helped you somehow if you
have a beauty blender or if you're
wondering you're thinking about getting
one you didn't know how to use it I hope
this did help I love using my Beauty
Blender and I never looked back I
stopped using my hands or a brush to
apply foundation i switched to a sponge
in my Beauty Blender one in specific so
i hope you enjoyed this video like I
