to use a bath bomb from lush now this is
just one that is called pink I know a
great name right it just has three
little flowers on it in its pink
obviously and you put it in your tub and
basically like kind of not really
explodes but kind of just likes
integrates into this big like colorful
bath smelly bubble bath thing you'll see
I'm going to put it in my tub after I
fill it up with water and then you place
this in there and it just it's amazing
so I'm going to show you what happens
because a lot of people have been asking
like what happens when you use bath bomb
because the first I was like asking the
cashier and I was like what happens and
they're just like oh just like exposing
your bathtub and I'm like what like do I
want this so I'm going to show you what
happens when you put it in so this is
what you need to do fill up your bathtub
plop this in it's as easy as pie
but I'm just going to show you what it
looks like and you know it'll kind of
determine whether or not and if you want
to buy one if you've been thinking about
like should I buy it I don't know what
it does and you'll see like what it does
to your vet so let's go
so right now I'm just putting water in
the bathtub and then once all fold
I'll show you what it looks like when I
put the Palmas also something I suggest
doing is cutting your bath bomb in half
because it looks to you like you get
more than once obviously because you're
cutting it in which you have and cut it
with any serrated knife to UM get me one
more than one use out of it because it
is kind of expensive so yes I cut mine
in half I'm using a floured dice today
okay so now that I have my tub filled up
about halfway I'm going to place the
pink bath bomb in now so I'll just zoom
in and I'll place the bath on and that's
what it does it makes it fizzy noise and
it kind of just like disintegrates like
look how cool that is
I think it's amazing um see how quickly
that is it's almost all gone so that's
what you do and that was only half of it
so like imagine with a hole in would do
I think that would be way too much and
this pulls up the whole bath then it
turns it pink and it gives it a great
smell I just I love this and as you can
see there's some like yellow crap right
there but that is one of the flowers so
it's not like some grounds for my
bathtub um it just kind of sinks to the
bottom and yeah like look at that that's
so cool there's like smoke coming from
it and on flowers fell off and it's just
it creates bubbles oh my god as you can
see it's amazing it's you should smell
it you can smell it but obviously you
can't
yeah it doesn't look like there's some
like crud floating around but that is
all blush stuff so I just really love
how this is turning my family come on
the most done it's just the last busy
concert
we're like hurricane thing took turning
six smoke take a chemistry lab so I'm as
done as you can see it's turning and
turning and turning and then you don't
even need bail Beth I put some of that
in here prior to this but this really
does the job the best part is watching
it explode
so yes I heard a lot of people don't
like that foams because it does leave
residue like that like the white or yeah
white the pink yellow and green things
as flowers and little specks from the
pink bomb on the floor of your bathtub a
lot of people don't like that and saying
it off because it doesn't you know wash
away the easiest but I like it and I
think it's great so this was 495 and I
would definitely get this from your
local lush story I hope this helps you
on how to use your bath bomb if you have
one or if you were determining whether
or not you want
by one this is kind of like a review and
shows you how to use it so yes this is
my bath and I'll stay later thanks for
