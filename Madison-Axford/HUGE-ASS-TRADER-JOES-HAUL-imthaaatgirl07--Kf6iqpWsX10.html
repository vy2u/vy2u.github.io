different spot for me yeah but to do a
part of my house but yeah I'm in this
room it's so cute right little table
okay today we're doing as you can see a
Trader Joe's haul I'm very excited do
this because I haven't been here since I
think throwing a year ago I just have to
go I don't know I like this summer but I
did a training hall about a year and a
half ago I actually remember to break
last year so it was very fun and I was
like I haven't been back there in
forever I haven't been back since I went
this summer and I can get logs a little
bit about it
but I got two bags but which if you're
not sure you know since much everything
into one bag so if I said I got two Big
Show's I got quite a bit up on the bay
before the reveal let's conserve the
Trader Joe's haul first good guys are
the microwave first time I didn't say my
kids kind of junky because I don't know
a huge cook hurt I'm not there's new
cooks a lot unfortunately so this is
maybe snack foods that I tried to get a
little healthier than just shot me at
park Walmart and some like that like
this would be choice' pretty junk foods
and so anyway turns I got veggie chips
which are tater chip Spacely so at least
I'm just eating like ladies which I
never sent any place but I know a lot of
people do especially people who go to my
house so I have these instead they're
salted you know you're just like chips
except they have a spinach carrot and
ever notice a cauliflower or tomato
flavor but yeah I think these will be
really good
anyways right I think we good I do love
magic
like little what they call veggie straws
there's something I think I've had
before the mentorship should be just one
of the same so the next thing I got our
organic corn chip dippers and these look
exactly like Fritos and I am not by any
means an organic person a personal
choice that you don't help me know I
like I like you look ones just be what I
like you happy that's just my outlook on
life don't take that and run if you
don't want you but um yeah that's my
skin my so I'm not a huge organic person
but I was like I'm here under Fritos
anyway so I might as well get these
they're really good with salsa guacamole
stuff like that so computer soup the
Fritos I did not buy it so we're gonna
cry welcome to their cheap and as out
next I got as you know my favorite
things ever I have it all I bought these
eight hundred times if I'm over this
summer I haven't a favorites video
they're make enterpise from Trader Joe's
and they're just like little green peas
mother beige so they're crunchy like
little the chips your little straws
they're really really good I absolutely
adore these and you know all the try to
very salty which isn't super good for
you but I love so yes baby like you can
see these green little straws
love peas then my gosh is for my mom
because I don't like toffee but she
loves it so it's English talking milk
chocolate and has a little almonds and
nuts on the top and it's just like a
milk chocolate little bar so she will
like these I don't like this this just
wasn't my flavor or style of candy that
I like to eat but she will update so I
got those perfect and that's all isn't
that bad
we have six okay so much heavier money
again I was out of tortilla chips so I
got some tortilla chips this bag I love
is it's like full it is a cool bag it's
not a half ass like I'm gonna take your
bag of lays and just use but sometimes
you get more air than chips in a bag and
this one is very full so again there's
like yellow corn chips I'm excited try
because now it doesn't only fix myself I
look I've been loving tossing I'm long
water so since I have no nose recently I
pick up some chips too next I got this
is from my mom and dad again because I
don't like this but it's a grand-slam
snack gluten free event we're not people
who are gluten free to use whatever but
there's caramel-coated popcorn and
peanuts almonds cashews and pecans and
it's kind of like Cracker Jack or what
you get at a baseball game but organic
gluten free giorgos kind so it looks
like potty talk and stuff like that so I
got that for them so I know they will
like that then I got these for my mom
and your dad as well chocolate covered
ripe fruit I'm not a huge I paint nuts
and I'm not a huge person I will eat
fruit but like driver strawberries is
that all dried up eat
but this chocolate-covered drive-through
- cherries apricots cherries blueberries
and chocolate they look so they looks
cute in the clinical for your spring so
I was like
they're pretty cheap that they chose for
soul foods I just treasure us any day
over Whole Foods Christmas like $90 for
guacamole where our chatter dose it's a
lot more reasonable not spots for Tojo's
they don't know who I am but they're a
lot more reasonable and just more fun to
shop there come the people on as
judgmental and like organic so yeah I
don't know I want to find that kangan
show me chocolate fruit but and we have
my mom my mom will you pick us up but
it's tomato basil marinara sauce again
we're out and I said I was going to
George oh just like to pick up a few
things so that is what I did this is
just spaghetti sauce we're going to get
easy private college but either I am or
they're having spaghetti and so we need
sauces we're at my house we got them
again sheep alternative to a normal
store but it's not because it's organic
then we got some first shoutout
I love bruschetta and then I got 10% on
these are brioche brioche toasts they're
like little melon house like I'm a
brioche now I'm gonna go for the ratchet
turn the maltose they're like little
hard pieces of many toasts that even
under shut up I love chunky or shut up
forever another thing songs in it and
mozzarella our Parmesan cheese on top
but I love tomato chunks are my face
like really itchy today I didn't put
face foundation on these my face is just
an itchy recently I think it's of a
topical cream I'm using a random I've
been with friends
I'll tell you my face has an itchy so I
needed a gay break from these foundation
if though it's rather monotonous what if
she can write and I will cook you for
person at least I do myself I don't know
if it looks different to you but I love
to read in the mirror I see myself but
it's my thesis did she
I keep cameras of a so I'm sorry
that's kind of gross doing it at home
anyway yes this brochure looks stupid
show me but it is the tomato paste that
if you love and bruschetta has been like
a newfound love for because I never used
to eat it when I was younger I would be
like right now I'm like yeah this tomato
everybody give me it so I got those I
think they're really cute excited try up
next a guy's salsa we I love her I don't
know if you have this in your course
probably but I love margarita though
salsa this great I don't like to see do
salsa and that's all we have in our
house right now so I was like I'm
getting some I eat it's just so like
artificial it tastes me why is it but it
tastes me nothing so this is just a
salsa authentica yeah by trailer with
Fran says it's not so hot you know just
have you come with all my corn chips you
know for me dog chicken recipe jerky
sticks jerky treats for dogs
my dog is there anything you know what
she eats but surely any freak but food
she's picky so there's just no treats I
think that I know that are cute they
were on sale stuff got some treats
but I don't have a double yourself no
it's my camera duck then for my mama I
got fleur de sel caramels
it's caramel nut caramel sorry
as I say official song so probably needs
me alone release for banking I'm at a
news conference Peter I love like
caramel on ice cream or caramel flavored
ice coffee drinks but I want to sit down
and eat caramel I do like it I prefer
caramel over chocolate but I won't just
sit down and eat caramel but Jesse's are
huge and you can use polymers and
beginning of them we use word meeting on
my own and then I got these I'm so
Seneca I love freeze-dried strawberries
strawberries and sweetened and on
soldier from tray goes grapefruit um I
haven't any mr. bellows I know she's
Bose no he's pretty much as emotes I'm
not sure but I never smoked cereal which
I do love with dried strawberries in it
and I just like up I love eating the
strawberry is there in that cereal soap
I saw this and freaked out because they
just have them packaged by themselves I
was like you need those so yeah there it
is right it sound like fresh fruit and
then you can try them so they're crunchy
and very acidic and I love that I love
my little punch it'll give you taste bud
and so I love in these in Syria yogurt
and whatever I was going to eat yeah
whatever but oh no it's one more thing
the last thing I got I have been eating
all day so that's why we were gone but
there again you saw these in a home
before or in the summer maybe all sour
gummies t + JS t and bacon switcher joes
but they're in the shapes of T's and J's
and the sour gummies in the flavor of
lemon grapefruit lemon tangerine I love
I love all these to death you're so good
there's a power play two seconds and
then extremely sweet but not like
headaches a good great sweetness and
while these are so amazing sorry I try
girls and doing open
and I can eat a whole bag of em in one
sitting there yeah my favorites are
probably lemon and tangerine I'm not
huge the liner is combined and the
grapefruit is just really really like
read favorite grapefruit so I do like
all the flavors not used to have those
other two but I'll eat them so yes
