Friday haul
I think Black Friday holes have really
been a thing since 2012 but like let's
try to bring them back great I usually
don't buy this much for some reason I
did this Black Friday which I'm glad I
did because now I can you guys a hall
and it is a try on hole which is even
more exciting but that proved their D
let's just hop right into the Black
Friday 2016 Tryon okay so first I'm just
gonna go over the weird thing I went to
Cole's like with my family and we go out
that night and then we go home and like
sleep like normal people the next day at
like 2:00 or whatever we'll go out again
to like small stores so we're not ones
that really waiting in line is trying to
get televisions we've done that before
and just not like this year or the past
years we've done that so I hope everyone
stays safe if you did do that penny wait
we went to Cole's my family and I like
if he thinks each but all I got it was
abuse and Butthead like graphic t-shirt
it's a size medium and men's - it is a
little big okay
would you get a snapchat that you're
like waiting before now it's getting
okay anyway so yes this is um the sure
Matt God if you haven't seen people go
ahead
ratchet show but I love it it's sort of
like I'm obsessed with it because my mom
and dad were obsessed with it when they
were younger I mean when it was all in
like MTV it was their jam and so I
started watching I watch the movie the
movie this whole bad but it's so good
like it's so stupid come here to the
show that it's like good and yes so I
got this so I'm not like a fake fan and
what beavis and butthead is and I love
it so this is just like a nice like gray
blue shirt and I was like why not it was
like six dollars and I was like okay
next I ordered from Beyonce's clothing
line item park or her workout clothes I
got a sweatshirt from there which I'm
very excited about I was never gonna
splurge but ever since lemonade came out
I've been obsessed with her music so I
got just the gray ID park one hello
I'm really excited for this I think it's
adorable I slowly bought this because it
is Beyonce's and because it says every
part which is a little but realistic I
know but I'm like why not like I don't
have any sweatshirts actually I'd like
four and so I was like why not just get
this and so I did
Black Friday will go on to romwe next
rumblies an online source first thing is
what I'm wearing it's a black crop I
don't never ordering this so I don't
know it was like free or like with an
order with messed up or what I enjoy or
it's like a little off shoulder or I
couldn't wear it on shoulder just like a
nice little crop and I really really
enjoyed it but I don't member ordering
it or buying it so like probably would
and then I got this choker right here
but I didn't have choker and I know that
it's totally like all the rage right now
but I like needed one because I only
have like one it's like a dog holding
one so it's got two new black velvet one
moving on I got this sweatshirt which I
guess it's like it's a good crop
sweatshirt if you can see it has little
cuts on the sleeves I thought was very
very hip very trendy and I really
enjoyed it
everything is super cheap on there I
don't think I spent more than 220
dollars on any of this stuff and I got
this Bay shirt which I love it's a
little bit mess because I wore yesterday
on Thanksgiving to me probably saw a few
so I need my picture it's following
Instagram please tell me Instagram mad
snacks nerd the one and only it says
make my bio box so you can find me
oh I push so much of my life on there
and if I do take breaks from YouTube
because I'm full-time college student
you know what's happening and what I'm
doing and like what I'm wearing and so
definitely follow me on there it would
mean the world to me and I just I use it
to remove than anything Twitter as well
that's accurate and I just think I'm
always saying things and posting things
you can see what I'm doing at my life I
wear this shirt this tan which I love
this new color crop long-sleeve and then
the back is totally backless and it has
like long like eight-foot tie that I
wrap from my something like four times
and tied it it looked really cute but I
really like that shirt I didn't have a
wrap tie shirt like that and so I picked
it out then I got this which this also
kind of reminds me of something from Ivy
Park but not but it is a like workout
mesh hoodie so there's a hood but it
also is like this clear
you threw like sleeves I love that I
love that material and it's crop super
cute and comfy and I just love crop
styler it makes it look so much more
fitted and so much more girly I think
then just wearing like a big bulky
swatch all the time which I love but not
not all the time sometimes gonna show up
your button so then I got this shirt
because my friend Lili so let me borrow
one of her like white off-the-shoulder
shirts and then as soon as I gave it
back to I was like I didn't get one I
got this it's like a crop and then off
the shoulder like big sleeves and it's a
very flowy versus more fitted but this
one is very flowy and so food baby just
can cover it up I thought it was
adorable then if you know me I am the
queen of these like bar shirts I like to
call them cuz I would not wear this to
class you wear - what up I so it's just
I love crisscross like crisscross is my
jam I everything I have is criss cross
and I used to wear I have like every
color in crisscross I know my friends
are wearing it it's just world use
together and I thought this color was
the most beautiful color ever especially
with my dark hair blue is just beautiful
it is a onesie leotard thing so it you
know stay in your pants skirt whatever I
love it I think it's really cute I'm
excited to wear that I got the cutest
thing ever which you also saw him I
think see my pictures on my Instagram is
this black skirt it's like a jean skirt
with two pockets in this beautiful tie
that cinches in you can tie it a little
tighter fit as if it runs big on you but
I got the small size I have a really
weird thumb
I'm not body but like kind of body like
up here I'm a bigger size than I am and
my waist and my pants I Panther it was
the smallest size because my legs are
really tiny and my waist high and nobody
were like shut up you're ragging but
like no it's a struggle just the same as
someone who is bigger so I can't find
anything that ever fits me and so I
finally come this and I like fits for
the most part not like yes I say this
gray like leggings which I'm a little
confused about like that's cotton but
really really stretchy so this is like
what you wear after Thanksgiving and so
like I like them but not and then it's
like there's a weird like flappy fabric
and then like kind of mushy see-through
stuff I don't really know what's
happening with these I assume they look
better on but I'm not really living for
them they're like soft and whatever and
like they're heavy-duty thick but they
just feel
big and so I'm not I love my ladies run
a little smaller so that they do fit
like tight and like synced up to your
skin and not like baggy there's nothing
worse than a baggy pair of leggings and
the last thing I got from romwe is this
like I don't know what color this it's
like Greg cream I love it and it kind of
looks like a bustier top almost like
right there like the outline but as long
as please I love this I love the high
neck and the turtleneck almost and just
I don't know I think is adorable a long
sleeves I love long sleeve things
because I have like so much accent on
the back while Herman it just covers
that and so I think this is adorable I
love the color and yeah that's what I
got from romwe and so moving on from H&amp;amp;M
I got this I thought myself and I like
don't have in my closet so I feel like
I'm not like going out tops and stuff
like that and I don't have a lot a lot
of like professional clothing or they go
for it so that's what I got today I'm
mainly cruising up this like light pink
sweater
I don't own a sweater I don't have one
sweater like this you're like glove
basic and sweater no I don't have a
bloody sweater so like got this there's
$10 and like unbeatable rose color size
like a like simple 18 today
and then another simple thing I got it's
just this a $10 black turtleneck I have
a great one that I wear a lot
surprisingly and so I was like because
you're like girl we don't see you in
turtlenecks but like I do wear it a lot
and so then I just got this black one as
well and that one's more like it doesn't
have like this big of a turtleneck part
but I love turtlenecks I mean really
cozy so this one definitely is like more
fabric around the neck um and so it's
just have a black shirt love it
long sleeves I love long sleeves like
because I don't wear coats and I'm never
cold but like I don't like my arm and
like you can see where am I ever not
like blood circulation always cuts off
cycle uncie's is always a plus and then
yeah so I gotten this was $5 was a
special day and like New Year's Eve
Billy oh girl okay it's a onesie it
looks long as hell but like it fits
um yeah I was $4.99 so I seem to look
cute I got a high neck but I love this
disco ball like start looking sky sure
and it's like
you always like saying that I use to
where's a good kid with the fabric so
it's like squishy love it okay so I got
black dress pants you can never have too
many dress pants and I know people
complain about like I don't know what am
i dress pants I don't know like
professional clothing it's so expensive
it's like no it's not okay you can go
anywhere and find a blazer or dressings
or like flats so don't lean that it's
expensive because you can fight the mr.
20 out of 20 dollars from electriss--
pants elects me I don't know forever
until I like die in them so yeah they're
skinny I love skinny like dress pants
because flare I have many of hair but
right but I look kind of like at it in
them so like I prefer skinny ones and
these are just like perfect dress pants
okay this last thing it's $10 and it's
this blue dress okay okay okay okay this
way oh this lip it has a slit oh my god
did we see that did I freak out so much
did you miss it
look at this oh you know that leg slit
has to be present to sway and it is so I
bought it ten dollars I love a
Cinderella blue color it was just like
it was after I spent a million and $1
Express so I was like I don't need to
buy any more spend another thousand
dollars at H&amp;amp;M but it's fine
I love that stuff so much and I'm so
excited to wear it
I love my seven stores so much better
than online because online it's like is
it gonna fit I don't know if it if it a
chance so yeah oh one thing I forgot was
I got like sexy hair whatever it's
called hairspray for only $8 and also
cuz usually like 18 so that's my
bathroom no and I'm not gonna get it but
score okay but it is expert first this
okay I mean it was 40% off but I got
this tank top that's adorable look Oh
huh yes okay I love this stuff I love
that kind of like like criss cross
threading whatever and I love gold
accoutrements and
detailing Oh beautiful love it then I
got this sum of all of colored things
and this is like a beautiful like black
like almost lingerie looking at least
I'm detailing on top front and I love it
those two gates jobs it's like silky
activities pajamas but it's not and
again like couldn't dress this up with a
blazer or wear it down and wear to a bar
I love things you can wear both ways
next the same things could be bar or
professional but it's a little showy I
love it Jacqueline Hill had this so I
have to get it I love this color it's
like an emerald almost but not like I'd
rather describe this color she's perfect
it has like a built in color and then
this huge V but not like deep enough to
show boobs which I appreciate because
it's not like showy so you could wear
this like professionally but I love the
color it's adorable
I they had exercise one small and I'm
usually next just want everything and I
have a tiny head okay I like my head is
abnormally small but I couldn't fit my
head through that just no choker so I
was like I guess I'll just go small and
have it be a little longer because like
wasn't working and I got this sweater
thing which is different and weird for
me I hate high-low things so you know me
I hate high-low but this is a high level
so it's like I love this knitting I
don't have any like sweater stuff like
this like I said like I really don't
have sweaters I'm not a cardigan sweater
person I hate cardigans first
I think curtains oh my I'm sorry aren't
the arm in holes are very deep so like
you can't really wear like a bra or
something because like it shows so I'd
recommend wearing a tank if you don't
want to like show sigh but it is like I
said a high and low it has a cut on the
side and it's just like a sleeveless
like sweater shirt and I really like it
it's very different it's not like a
cliche typical sweater
it's like comes like a dress last thing
I got it was the most expensive but my
favorite thing that I got this whole
Black Friday in the land in size medium
Oh a little bag you can tell it's a
little big of me but I try and make it
work as best as I can
because I couldn't not get it it's a
sleeveless white blazer huh these
buttons that almost look like bomb on
but not don't kill me but like in my
head oh sweet bomb on so I got it okay
look oh oh girl of the lapel the color
the white cream color these gold buttons
button sold me really
like it was even my size and I still pay
that much for it so like you know I love
it so that was my like Friday haul if
you're not amazing I want to subscribe
to my channel it would really help me
out and it means the world to me I know
some people I have problems when I do
these Tran holes they're like oh my god
it's stickier but not much or whatever
but like I'm just minding the clothes
living my life and being confident so if
you don't like try and hauls just like

better and move on you know you don't
