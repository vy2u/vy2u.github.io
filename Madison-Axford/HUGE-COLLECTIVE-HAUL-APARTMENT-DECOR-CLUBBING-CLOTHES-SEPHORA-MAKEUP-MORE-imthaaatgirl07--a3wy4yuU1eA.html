haul over the past two or three months I
remember to do my last one January
February but anyway I am doing a
collective haul over clothes
home decor makeup everything and
anything in between that I have just
bought over the past two months so I'm
very excited to do this for you and I
love doing this style where it's not
just I've actually make up things into a
hall and so I do it or I'm great I'm at
a time so my channel isn't over done
with halls at the same time these are
ready long so grab a snack before we get
into this and then yes oh wait okay gets
awkward okay let's say start it so I'm
gonna start with the store action on it
on the name of I'm gonna leave a break
here except forgot about it I purchase
so long ago and then they didn't send it
to me for like 20 years later very
disappointed and then I was due having
with the clothes once I got them so I'm
gonna haul it anyway so first I got to
this dress which is a static mess they
had it modeled on Kylie Jenner and
they're like picture for this dress and
I did buy a permanent body to look at
the color and the form-fitting Ness
of a dress I got it it's a steady mess
the colors so Bert orange and I just
don't like up fits it's so tight I came
in breathe so yes I will not be wearing
this ever only getting rid of that
I can't I prep it on the first time for
our fancy event I was gonna wear to and
my hair was like and I wasn't what the
 is this so yeah I can't wear that
anyway then I got this and button-up
oxford like blouse that was supposed
have a huge boat here and the way it
looked on the picture was like the bow
what is just like sewn on so we've never
moved its position but this no it's a
tie and it'll never look the same as it
did on the picture so I'm like wasting
money on this crap and then I'm to buy
stuff in this website anymore I'm sorry
but I just don't like it the clothes I
like the silkiness of this top and the
traffic no but I don't like that huh
and the last thing I got started with
this which I do kind of like but it's
very short and see-through it's a pink
sweater dress basically like a zipper in
the front to make it out of however high
or low you want it to it's just very
see-through I would wear that nipple
covers and you can see them and see like
the underwear I was wearing me if I was
wearing any and so like that so that
story's just to fail I'm not having my
maybe much bigger and better things from
stores style we first I got this top
which is like this metallic e gray
silver whatever a beautiful top as a
tank top slinky just hangs down and it's
beautiful
then I got this dress which you've seen
in one of my recent videos it's Oh thick
but I like about style V dresses is they
hit below the knee which is like very
rare for me in my closet everything I
have is quite short and form-fitting so
that is my personal style but this is
very thick almost like a coat material
and it does hang almost at my ankles I
had to tie the top because it is a
little bitty pretty small but that's
fine
it worked with my hair down it is a nice
unit plunge so it's my jam I like the
new color it's very pretty very neat
then I like this I don't know why I
bought this to be honest it's a
bejeweled at the bustier but I can't
imagine myself ever wearing this and
being taken seriously I don't know I
think it's tough so long ago but I know
maybe a video and that's it like I
thought he was gonna meet you this I
don't know what I thought it's gonna be
when I got this I just like what I'm not
gonna come anytime soon so I don't know
when this will come into use but it's
okay you know we have this the staple
closet piece then moving on I went to a
wedding you saw my Instagram and if you
follow me Mad Max or go for me thank you
right now it is this beautiful like red
and black which I think you should have
these close together my mom it's me
other but not me but I feel like this do
you ever save like this you go I thing
with a very high neck short strap top I
like this again different for me because
it hits me way below the knee and comes
up to literally in my Adam's apple if I
had one button on man so everything is
covered and it's not that's different
for me usually everything much stolen
but I do like the change in my closet
and the different styles that I'm adding
to my closet then I got this beautiful
button on opposite shirt which has
lipsticks all over it so it's like you
try to be professional at the same time
can Jack my style I'm gonna show you who
I am which is a makeup lover I thought
this was beautiful beautiful the clothes
on here are a bit pricey but worth it I
think because they are all very
high-quality I can't see any of this
stuff like ripping or britney repairing
or shrinking for that matter and I just
they're going to love their clothes so
yes I got this lipstick literally but no
shirt and I mean look that I've worn it
like three times already seen it on
Instagram again it's not this problem
moving on okay no facts because like I'm
not gonna sit and talk about
these things for like an hour and happen
it's a shirt move on I got this Marley
Lilly monogrammed hat
my skin is very fair unfortunately like
I know I don't have hands and like all
the other people's hand people in the
world so I have to put technology on so
I like that in the summer whatever
seeing kids are not happening so yes I
don't want to wear I had to protect my
face from Sun Sun Sun SPOT created
hyperpigmentation in Auburn scalp so I
got this big-ass hat is the size of
freaking Saturn and I just went like
this like I'm going to a tiny Derby it's
a bit of a button right now so it looks
stupid but you know what I mean like
it's very cute I got you white red one
it has my initials Madison Taylor x-ray
that's me um I bought anything you need
to be a little smaller than this but you
know it's fine we'll rock that Kentucky
Derby dream of mine moving on from
Marshalls and t.j.maxx at a river which
is from which I got a few of her into
core items because a a movie in -
finally my own freaking apartment next
year so thankful and happy better when I
have a roommate anymore
um but yes I got a lot of stuff because
I want to start training the aesthetic
and ambience that I want and I wish
there's all this by myself like all this
is personally me my parents oh my me
anything like I know the value of dollar
and I know when to spend my money and
actually some of the things that I
wanted to eat and not just random crap
so first thing I got is this beautiful
pillow can we take a little bit oh my
god I love it
this is kind of a theme I'm going for
throughout my house my house what my
apartment and then I
this beechwood whatever way yet to
choose will be in this with me so
whoever is my best friend via this
summer will get their face to put in
here with me
no kidding but you know I haven't picked
a picture yeah it's for my stick so it's
not too big but it's just like bejeweled
all around this was something ten
dollars and this was about twenty eight
but I love this it's a tiny pillow I can
throw my better couch and these might be
jeweled as beautiful like things that
are it's kind of what I want to go for
for my upper metal and make it look very
expensive and beautiful but not break
the bank so those are the first two
things I got from much season back there
a set or tumblr cups and they have these
little dots all over my father's
beautiful you can't see but there's just
like little dot bubbles all around these
plastic just cups rings so these are
ending $10 it's not the outdoor
collection if you're wondering and I
adored them I thought they were cute and
perfect for my pregnancy and then the
last thing that I got from our 50 G max
was this open the door mirror I'm not
going to put it on a board though I'm
just gonna put it on the floor and then
get up against a wall it's just
beautiful beautiful silver like frame it
wasn't 4000 it was 30 35 which is such a
steel such a meal for a mirror I mean
it's a huge mirror but I'm very thankful
that I got this it looks expensive it
wasn't and I'm living for it from an
online store called society6 which tells
like tapestries and on the wall clocks
and the art in pillows and film aces and
just beautiful beautiful creative things
from always online artists I got a small
size tapestry which I'm not a huge fan
of like textures that are like the
tribal trend or stuff like that I think
that time is coming on i'm not into back
but i got this beautiful freaking this
and all that beautiful in my living room
and my apartment hung on the wall
oh that's upside down girl freaking get
your together and lipstick swatch
tapestry I can't look at this look good
there's 90 little kissy lipstick
swatches
lips whatever it's beautiful are all my
colors as if it was
actually lipstick swatch on your lips I
love this thing the main obviously the
main color is white so it'll go with my
apartment theme because it's white
grating so where I can't it's just
perfect for me like lips lips lips to
lips love it so I got that it's about
$35 and I think was worth it because I'm
being on my apartment wall forever you
know until I get sick of it moving on
from the happiness boutique I got the
infamous your I've been wearing on my
Instagram I don't see this I hadn't a
picture it's hard to see though because
it's tiny but it's a gold y-drop but
it's you like in the cleavage it goes
between your boobs I love this I wanted
a wide drop necklace and this I think is
beautiful it has like this little point
'add dagger down there and it just
gathers here and took one the white and
then hits you got from your boobs I love
this actually for this with this shirt
which doesn't really go considering the
different like so we're cool looking but
that's okay then this one this is where
every time you type that it has this is
a statement that was quite exhausting
when I was is this statement necklace
look look oh forget huge this is there's
like one two three four five six 20
statement up the system one I love it
and the prices all these things are not
sentimental happiness boutique I adore
them I'm gonna get so much more stuff
because I can't wait to check out what
else they have but I picked this about
and I love it
look how big this it's like you just
need once a minute left inter collection
and this is it beautiful diamonds
diamonds everywhere I love it cuz I
wanted those battles moving on to makeup
my gosh yes those glow kit and gleam I
didn't well the other one because when I
can't or when I highlight I went light
shades
I don't want Browns on my highlight and
that's what I need to get other one to
be so I might still get it but I am
living for this gleam palette my
favorite is crushed pearl holy crap the
priests highlight in the most vibrant in
your face how that I've ever seen I love
that highlights there's something about
this one if you can see it but there's
something about freakin crushed pearls
that I live for the other ones are hard
Katie mimosa and starburst are you
starburst on my cheeks to regain color
when I'm good
Berlin but the other ones are hurricanes
Matt but most it is like a shimmery
bronzer I love this palette it was
around $40 but considering they're about
the same size a tiny bit smaller than
the Becker ones which are like 50 with
tax
this isn't that expensive it's only $40
I'm so glad I got this it was when I
went on this one online thing about two
ran things I would've never won the
store for myself and I was like what not
so I got that super super oh my god like
one thing you want to buy yourself this
year's expensive get back and then I got
this Beca back later I didn't love it so
I think it gives your seems such a glow
whether or not you put foundation on top
of it it definitely have one flow I'm so
disappointed I feel like I'm almost out
of it and I feel like so expensive for a
primer like 30 to 40 dollars but I can't
use that much of it when I want to
but Hogwood buy this again it breaks the
bank a little bit but I love it so I had
never tried a product besides like of
highlights highlighters so when I tried
this primer I've heard so many good
things about it and I just like bought
it because of what I found and I do love
it so I do like it it's expensive I wish
I'd worn it bla bla you know but I love
it glad I got that next I got a new
Beauty Blender it's the original one but
it's in black and pink I need to be
blender you always change your beauty
blenders after a little maybe four
months like if you're doing very good
community which I am I did - thrush you
know like it needs to be changed you
can't buy one Beauty Blender and then
just keep your whole life it's only
twenty dollars
get a freakin new one so I need a black
one which I would be different and I'm
looking for then I got - is it bosha of
Basquiat I don't know but it's these
like mini trial travel size of their
face like things so first I got Moshe
makeup breakup cool cleansing oil which
is a oil that just breaks down your
makeup instead of using water or a
makeup wipe
I love this it's incredible I'm gonna
get the premier size for sure
definitely check these out because I
love it this is the bow should you
toxifying black cleanser so it is black
it comes up
cool it is a warming sensation when you
do touch it whether it's with your hands
hair brush or whatever you clean your
face with I don't really like this is
much because of the texture it feels
like syrup or very thick molasses it's
very hard to move on your skin unless
you're going into play the spin brush
which I do but I wouldn't just normally
just wash my face I haven't noticed any
great changes using this but I do love
the makeup break boil so I will buy the
Signet I don't know if I'll buy this
again I just bought it because of the
color is cool I don't know go ahead
again next I got vibrance in Sierra
which I've never tried like the sexy
hair brand she polluted her and I was
like what I'm not but I just realized
this is for colored hair and I don't
have color here so I'm like but it's
fine to try it anyway I got the shampoo
and conditioner color conserve
conditioner and shampoo so it has rose
and olive oil in it free of sand songs
with gluten impairment salt whatever
yeah so I just wanted to try this brand
I haven't tried it yet
calm down below if you tried it and you
like these I just picked it up because
I've never seen the Sun soup if I'd
never seen shampoo and conditioner by
this brand I have only seen their like
infamous hairspray and stuff texturizing
spray so I'm excited to try these but
yeah I'll let you know what did I like
them next I have the selling that's an
airbrush legs but I think I got the
shade way too dark because this is the
shade medium low and I'm hey listen
forgive me they go so I don't know if
this will be like super dark on me um
but I'm figuring you have to do this
outside yes because I don't know how you
even like spray this and not get it all
the wall in your house but you know it's
fine
yeah so it's like a spray-on tan I feel
like I would make a mess with this but I
wanted
I picked it up but like I don't even
remember and I've been all over my
freaking house in my wolves and now on
my body or a big squatching bat so well
see maybe just my legs will go we'll try
small areas first areas that are covered
by clothes next I got um just one brush
from a oak oh it's a flat kabuki I don't
have a flat kabuki that has a large like
stick brush like it's just like a small
one so I got like cookie with a large
brush tip and so I'm going to use this
when I use when I go back just a
foundation because company I'm using
liquid foundation again it is very firm
and I love it but yeah I never check out
a Yoko then I got to brush that's from
my favorite art company my tried and
true I know I love me because I've had
million sets from them before Royalton a
Nicole I love Romanenko brushes I use
them an excellent tutorial guide even
because I have the most ever done
because I actually willingly choose the
wrong Lincoln brushes over any other
brushes that I own so these are two sets
from their new motor collection in the
white professional makeup brush set so
as I in this one it's powder foundation
angle shader smokey eye brow and lip
brush and this is powder crease smudger
brow I shader and duo fiber brush so
they're kind of similar sets but they're
both small so they're travel sets and I
would say to use this I picked up the
color white they have like blue red pink
lava I just adored their brushes
check out my like nickel is the best
thing you'll ever do for makeup brushes
they're a little bit expensive but fully
worth it
I've never had a problem with my V
Nevers cherry or fall apart bristles
never fall out they're incredible
next I got the Brazilian buck long cream
this is the infamous foam cream I love
it it's from Sol de Janeiro the brand
first of all it smells like just I don't
even know like vanilla coconut pineapple
Kate the most amazing thing ever I use
quite a bit of it as you can see and I
just put this all over my body I love it
it just makes you should so smooth so
shiny so just looking almost is
incredible and it's so soft and I just
love this as after shower lotion that
might reconcile these Suttons before I
do believe but I love it but I've never
blow Sean and this
makes me wanna pollution on now then I
thought if care package from hotshot
tetra is sold in Sephora and isn't me a
care package isn't so nice about I'm
going to quickly show you when they sent
me it's a Japanese brand so first I got
to touch a blotting oil sheets this is
what I really wanted a Peschel moon is
dewy skin miss about oh my god it smells
so amazing it's like up makeup finishing
spray
I got polish classic race and design
powder once you're rich silk cream for
your face and then we got radiant deep
brightening serum and here one-step
cleansing oil I'm so fatalities I will
definitely do a review on these later
and when I got I like the price I just
that sexist so ie not gonna tell you by
the way I'm here because I don't
personally know I'm gonna try that but
thank you so much cha-cha for sending me
this I love the brand I had the oil
blotting sheets for literally months and
I love the finishing this as well I
actually had that before in full-size
and so he sent me traveling for my
travels and oh yeah
um mister from home recommended it so I
bought it and I do like it it's not so
wet and in your face for relief such a
glossy Sheen on your face but it's not
like dripping like sauna I've had before
drip off your face because they're so
wet when in here face but that is just
very light it it finishes it in skills
to make them a place moving on I got but
tree hat shade sugar scrubs from multi

Walmart I got it in an original shade
and tropical mango these are great body
exfoliator
oh my goodness I just love you so much I
was looking for
cuz I excellent patches and dry skin and
acne and whatever and I was looking for
something to exfoliate my dried rough
skin off I hadn't really had next
found that wasn't like ten million

like right in front of my face hit me
face and I punched them both
five six dollars so freakin cheap and
it's best to soon and I'm going to go
back and eat some more

at the same time such as using these
every time I freaking take a shower next
from Ikea I got my comforter for next
year my apartment

to my bed over a queen it was my
decision and I was like I don't need a
freaking huge ass bed when can be big

graphite color with a cream base the
comforter from it yeah super cheap

hips of the bus stronger what I always
