collective haul it's just a bunch of a
random that I've got over the past
two months honestly no Remer recent no
random order it's just everything from
makeup to fashion to random things to
decor etc so I'm very excited to do this
because I was really gonna do hoped I
was like let me show you what I have
bought because I have spent a little bit
of money over the past few months and um
why not show you all so yes it is the
most random haul you will ever see on
this channel I don't do howls very often
if at all on the snow what China hauls
crystals are fun but other than that I
don't you just like collective hauls or
hauls in general but like I said I'm
doing when today and without further ado
let me stop rambling and get into the
whole first thing are these earrings the
most obnoxious biggest earrings but I
love them they're from the ultimate
jewelry collection no way the ultimate
collection no yes right here thank you
for the ultimate collection online it's
a jewelry shop based in New York City
and these were asking like 350 maybe and
I you got two pairs like you can't just
buy one but at the same time we're
getting to fifty-fifty if one breaks or
you lose one or whatever you'll have the
backup pair I love these so much they're
just so cute they're gold-plated three
and a half inch ye one two three five GD
earrings I love these I know probably a
lot of people won't like them but maybe
a lot will and I don't know they were
just like something I was really
interested in and I almost got the 4
inch I'm glad I didn't because those
would have been like that so yes I got
the smaller ones the three boys this one
these are the smaller ones the three and
a half inch ones I'm very excited I got
these again ultimate collection calm and
yeah I didn't know about them before I
bought these but it shipped very fast
and they're very good customer service
stuff not sponsored but I love them the
next thing I got is from canvas pop they
actually sent a picture of myself to me
and it's super cute they specialize in
all-in-one sized canvases I love it
because sometimes if you blow it up on a
canvas and get very blurry and pixelated
this did not which I was worried about
but it didn't mmm it comes with like a
little wire to hang and guys I died guys
guys
I died I think this is a 20 by 20 inch I
have a coupon code for you in town but I
definitely check it out oh my god
their campuses are just incredible like
I don't know what I just I what I opened
it
oh it didn't have high expectations
because this is from Instagram so I
thought it would be blurry honestly like
I'm gonna say the truth I don't think
it'll be great and literally not saying
this just because they said it to me but
I love it it's me it's me out of canvas
so now I'm gonna have a picture of me in
my room cuz I need to be more conceited
right it's been hanging in like front
entryway to my home for the past like
month and everyone's like okay next I
got random a NYX butter gloss I had a
NYX butter gloss I have one more it's an
orange one I don't know the colors but I
got it unlike clearance at Target these
are like I think five six bucks
so not extensive but I got that one for
three anyway this one was mentioned by
Trisha Paytas my favorite youtuber ever
and this isn't creme brulee but the
battery loss isn't a liquid lip stain
it's something like that it's literally
just like a really really creamy gloss I
guess that's why it is called a butter
gloss it's not like a clear lip gloss
it's like a thick cream and I love it it
goes perfectly with angel like I said
from Mac that's the kind of like baby
pink that this color is it matches that
perfectly and I really like this I'm
glad I picked up from the hope so next I
got Sigma's a brush cleaning match for I
brushes and face brushes so the way that
you use this which oh my gosh I'm so
excited for this because I wash my
brushes obviously I think there's
nowhere for them to dry it's like
there's nowhere like sanitary for me to
clean them so what is great about this
is there's suction cups on the bottom
you it's just placing your sink so that
the water depth make sure you can you're
saying first Enochs the Russians I'm
just floating around but fill it up just
a little little bit and then this is the
bottom sink and then you take a brush
and you use it on all these different
textured surfaces to clean and it really
gets in there and I haven't used it yet
but I've seen many tutorials on this
that's why I got it and I'm really
excited to use it but yes you just put
the brush on kind of roll it around
it'll get any makeup or any dirt or
whatever that's accumulated on it off of
it and you can use whatever soap or
brush cleaner and there you go I'm
really glad I got this because like I
said there's all these different
textures you can use so yeah don't let
this a tip don't let your brushes get
like don't my watering it past the
bristles because otherwise then it gets
up in the glue and the brush part and
then it can make them fall apart and a
lot of my ELF ones broke from me doing
that anyway
at least I tried this little Sigma
cleaning matte so I got that mom on the
topic of this let me show you I am a
huge Kat Von D make a fan I think her
makeup line is in PEC is incredible and
you can tell she's working extremely
hard on and I've been a fan since her
like tattoo concealer came out and I
have that but um this I got the Cabernet
shade and light palette as well as the
shading light brush this was a splurge
for me because I normally don't buy
products but this you based you together
yes are over a hundred dollars but it's
definitely worth it every person I meet
you had it and I was like why don't I
have that like what so this is like I
said the calf initiate in like palate to
most used would be this lightest one for
under-eye powder and then this middle
bronzer this is a little G dark creep
but I can get away with it if I tap off
a lot of the excess this is just a
little gray toned so I'll usually use it
for fainter bronzers like on my double
chin and my temple hairline up here this
is that really one drew meet and that's
really yellow for me I was really
disappointed cuz I wanted something so
badly it's like a really big widely used
one on YouTube but it was a very yellow
for my under eyes and don't work as well
as this one is for me but nonetheless I
can use it on different people from
doing their makeup and I love this I'm
really glad I picked it up and it just
felt incomplete finish you get the brush
and I use this every single day since I
got it like this is amazing for
under-eye powder and baking and every
kind of application of powder and this
is great for contour and it really got
an England brush for contouring I always
just use like one like this or like a
knockoff Narsee eat up kind of brush and
this is great because it is an angular
like NARS eita so it just kind of goes
like right in your contour I just it
felt incomplete they may the best
friends need to be gether next from the
online store and kit I got three things
first I got this an M Marquis light I
wanted one of these for so social sort
of long because I think they're adorable
my mom has one with our last name Axford
and i think it's like black and it has
these little lights it's downstairs in
my kitchen but I don't have an M so when
I moved to my apartment next year I will
be able to like really decorate it how I
want hang up the canvas of myself no you
know what I mean though just so this is
the first thing that I really got for it
which is like I said the white Marquis
MI and it's battery-operated
and I just think it is absolutely
adorable like lo I don't know about
Aries in it but you can imagine they
just light up like a normal light bulb
and I just think it's cute it's perfect
little size and I look great I'm like a
countertop or something like that in the
kitchen I love it I'm really excited for
that
also from ANCA I got this shower curtain
um hello it's beautiful I've never had a
fabric shower curtain has always been
like a plastic one but do you always
remember to put a plastic lining on
whatever chakra you have just on the
opposite sides so water doesn't get make
it all gross but this is a like I don't
even know what you call this like a
khaki kind of color Savage shower
curtain with Gold sparkly dots polka
dots all over it I really really like
this it comes from so cute and it has a
metallic little hooks to put it on your
shower hook thing I really like this
kind of a little kind of a rustic
old-timey look I think so yes I got this
for my bathroom shower and then the last
thing I got from ink it is this
absolutely adorable mug oh my god guys
you're gonna die it says make today your
bitch yes I love this it's a light pink
with this saying on it it's black and
the inside says drink up bitch it's very
very foul but we love it and then it has
a gold handle I'm not going to drink
coffee on this because I think it's too
pretty to be drinking out of it um it's
just my opinion but I will put makeup
brushes in a pen something I will make
it useful I adore this it's Hugh would
you look at those bring in my head but
yeah I love that and anka is so nice

read
I like her a lot and I love the show and
repellent so I was like why not and so I
got it and maybe it'll help me in some
way and then I can help you guys from
nasty dress is that what is called nasty
dress I think that's what's called I got
two Blazers a lime-green one that has
yet to be shipped to my house and then
this blue one which I've a black blazer
like this and it has like a little
detailing on the sides right here this
Hardware slover zippers and I love this
royal blue color I think it is very
professional just as a black one is and
I do have to wear blaze to black for
certain meetings that I have in my
school and I had a black one and these
people probably like why the hell are
you just keep wearing this black blazer
like go ahead to get some more so I did
ordered this one I got a white one
coming the male and my it's like a candy
apple a penny it's called lime green one
is still coming the mail that contacted
the company because I was gonna sent my
one nasty dress come on but yeah so I
got this blue one because I really
needed to step up my wardrobe game next
this is from Bath no that doesn't me on
I got poo pourri
it's gross but we got to talk about it
we all do it so when you poop it's like
it's gross so what you do with this is
you spray three to five pumps in the
toilet before you poop and then it like
you can't flaunt it all like you cannot
I got the flavor a rosy cheeks rose mo
steps with roses roses my favorite color
roses my favorite smell and I love
everything roses so of course I would
get the rose poo pourri scent and on it
something I'm not just saying this to be
funny or whatever but you cannot smell
it like it'd be spraying after this you
will not explain your poop and like it
lasts for a little bit afterwards it's
great deli shakes out I think Walmart
sells it now but I know Beth Beth me on
an online sells that you will be seen
that poopourri at the redhead girl
definitely get this I is $10 and I was
procrastinating buying it for so long
because it is a little pricey for like
poop spray but I'm gonna go I have it
now I mean it's just cute you have in
the bathroom I really like it
next I got okay I got this from eBay
it's one of the fuzzy phone cases okay
this is what really in really trendy
right now everyone has them I really
don't like it um honestly it was six
five six bucks I bought it everyone it
seemed to really like it at first like
around me I go my god are we gonna pet
and it is fun it's the softest thing
ever and I love this gray black mixed
color but this is literally where the
camera hole is it's covered by fur so
I'm sure my trying to picture I couldn't
out I feel like through this and hit
this while I was like trying to get
something out of me
like I would have to like turn it around
and hit it as opposed itself you know
I'm saying I could never take a picture
like that what a normal way because the
fur covers the phone and it's always
clinging to the screen especially when
it gets hot humid and sticky this part
always cleans the screen so do not get
one of these honestly unless you want to
be a hassle I wish I didn't buy this but
like I was obsessed with it for the five
days that I used it and I'm just like
bye okay no next me and my friend Mohini
got the same matching Starbucks cup is
this pink sparkly one for Valentine's
Day it's looking ugly on camera kind of
but it's beautiful in person it's a
normal red top green straw um I don't
know I don't know this is not that it
matters but like I usually like to know

need we both have we both we bought it
like two weeks ago we both haven't use
it but it's just really cute and I don't
drink Starbucks coffee I'm not a huge
fan at all um like there come on
macchiatos like either it's always too
sweet or not enough caramel and it's
just like sighs campus for water at my
home then I got this crown eyeshadow
palette in pure exposed this is the
thing about this it is the exact same
thing as a Naked palette oh my god look
at this girl ha this is the same thing
as Urban Decay first you get the
double-sided brush right you get like
the flat top one right there and then
this big blending and then you get 12
shadows exactly the same is over decay

I don't work for us ever so this slinky
new for me but my not yelling at once
right looks like there is a lot of
cushion it's kind of it doesn't feel
like normal Victoria's Secret cushion or
anything it's kind of like a trampoline
almost it feels bouncy and you make sure
both your boobs fit in here and then you
like do this and there's little hooks
under here pull them apart and you pull
as far as you want once you have both
your boobs secure it in there and then
it pushes your boobs together on both
sides there's two of these clasps and
then you pin it in whichever one you
want to give that like most cleavage
that you desire so I mean these are
really cool definitely check them out if
you are you know a grown-up or a grown
woman and looking for something to
relieve I don't know stun everyone so I
got to publish this because why not and
