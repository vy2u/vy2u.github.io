hall I got a lot of stuff at TJ maxx and
marshalls that I want to share with you
I was gonna do a haul and i was i'm
planning on doing hall when i went there
gotta love stuff so I was like why not
show you what I got and hopefully they
have some of this stuff at Marshall
senior max if you like it and you can
pick it up as well you might notice I'm
not in any magnet or Omega I'm not in
full face today because i feel like i've
always used such a heavy makeup look on
every video and I just wanted to I don't
know wanna do a video to show you that
you don't need to wear all the makeup to
be happy or feel pretty and I'm
confident in my own skin I want you guys
to be too now that me not wearing makeup
is gonna make you more confident but
just believe in yourself and hopefully
if you see me doing it I putting myself
out here to the public you can to it you
don't have to make up I wear it as an
art form because I love to do it that
because i feel like i need it um but I
just love try out new looks and doing
heavy makeup doing natural makeup doing
all the kinds of makeup so today i just
thought i would do it natural and where
none for you I and literally honestly
have none um and just do the video
because why not let's do laid-back video
today so that further ado let's have
right in to my decor hall so the first
thing actually isn't to court all really
but it is a water or tea or whatever it
lemonade whatever pitcher and then on
the inside if you can see here is a
little um fruit infused thing you put
lemon strawberries whatever you want I
should put lemons I'm in my water so
i'll put lemons in here and then you
have it so me in the water and then you
should pour whenever you want stuff in
your refrigerator and it's kind of
expensive for marshalls to be honest but
i'm glad that i got it i thought it's
really cute like look it's like clear
you just thought up with water and it's
you know it has the lemons putting it
you have nice water with lemon flavor in
it so I'm excited for this is random but
I got a toothbrush holder it's just
beige and I was like two dollars I need
it i needed a toothbrush holder because
my old sheepish holder doesn't hold many
a toothbrush because apparently the
bottoms to like big and it's rubbery so
it won't push down into the toothbrush
holder hold so i had a new tuba shoulder
with like wide spaces on the top for the
toothbrush to fit in so I got this it's
not fun but I needed it
and this is the first of four I wanted
some of these for so long these little
um vase will container things with rocks
and then it's a little like it's not a
cactus but it's like the couch is like
they always have these with the cactus
but cactus in of this plan I don't know
what it's called my mom knows with this
cactus and whatever this is I always
have those like the new decor trend and
they had these and marshalls and I
picked up four so this is the first one
this is design I think there's two of
them that are like this in two of them
that aren't different but this is what
looks like it's super cute I think it'll
look adorable slick right there so we'll
put that the next thing I got is I've
always wanted this as well as it's like
a pair of antlers I know you might not
like this i'm not saying promote you
know shooting or anything by any means
this is obviously fake I've never have a
real antler don't kill animals but I
like the look of this metallicy thing
it's very in right now I just gonna look
cute you know somewhere on my wall so
it's cute it's fake don't forget then I
got this little notebook and it says
dreams on the front and I know I thought
it was really really cute um this one
looks like on the inside like this gray
chevron can see and it has like a
journey in web pages and a bookmark to
keep your page and i think i'm just
going to write little notes those things
i think of or want to write in this book
and we'll see where it takes me but it's
really cute light-blue dreams I just
thought it was adorable his two bucks I
had to pick it up my gosh is white
picture frame I just needed a picture
frame ops got one more just to add some
pictures in my room because they don't
have any pictures of me and my friends
and my room actually no I looked too but
I wanted more so i picked up this white
picture frame and then I got in this
shower bathroom like rug so there's 14
by your shower and then one under your
sink jet is very so soft it's like so
soft foods little like curly design and
I just really love it it's nice I need a
new bathroom rug so here we go it's
white doesn't my room everybody bathroom
is so soft I love it and the last you
think I got our when I already mentioned
I got here's the second plant and then
the third and fourth one are a little
bit different of a design it look like
this so yeah I've two pitch ball up
that's all I had that for so grab them
all then I got this
picture frame which I love these kinds
like a double connector so you quit like
to usually the same person I don't know
I do I was but like what if I'm gonna do
me and one of my friends I'll do the
same friend and the other one just so
it's like you I don't know you could do
different but I like doing the same
friend so I got that connecting frame
because i love connected brain and the
last thing i got is a huge huge yankee
candle it's in the scent midnight sky
okay huge this is bigger in my face it
smells so amazing and i just love it
three wick so yes it's on sale at TJ
maxx since it's usually so expensive at
yankee candle for this big of a candle
